FT  07 DEC 94 / Unhappy Irish await a new government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's acting prime minister, in Budapest yesterday
for the European security conference, was hoping for a dignified exit on
perhaps his last appearance as premier on the international stage. His
expectations were to be cruelly dashed.
New revelations about his role in the unfolding judicial scandal that
destroyed his government last month forced him to cut short his trip and
rush back for yesterday's vital session of the Dail, the Irish parliament.
With Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader, yesterday calling off his negotiations
with Fianna Fail, it is widely believed that a general election is the only
way out of the impasse.
Mr Bertie Ahern, who succeeded as leader of Fianna Fail after Mr Reynolds
was forced to resign as prime minister, publicly accepted that a fresh
alliance with Labour was no longer an option.
The latest breakdown follows allegations that Mr Reynolds misled parliament
over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan from attorney-general to the post
of president of Irish High Court. It emerged on Monday that a day after
defending Mr Whelehan Mr Reynolds had tried to persuade him to resign.
As the Dail prepared for yesterday's critical session, the mood was summed
up by one Labour MP: 'Its lies, lies and damned lies.'
The public mood is one of almost total shock.
Ireland has already spent a month agonising over the role of the Catholic
Church, its most hallowed institution, after the first allegations about
bungled extradition of a paedophile priest, later convicted in Northern
Ireland on child sex abuse charges.
This has been followed by a political crisis which a nervous public fear may
undermine efforts to achieve an elusive peace in Northern Ireland.
There is little public enthusiasm for a general election whose campaign
could take the country right into Christmas week.
Only two days ago the three-week-old political crisis seemed close to a
resolution. A new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour seemed a foregone
conclusion. The programme, inherited from the outgoing government, looked to
be agreed. Both parties appeared committed to a high-growth strategy and to
reducing the level of indebtedness. Fianna Fail and Labour seemed prepared
to co-operate to co-ordinate policy on Northern Ireland.
But now all this is to the hazard. The most immediate concern is that the
crisis may hurt or slow down the Northern Ireland peace process. Dublin and
London have yet to finalise the long-awaited framework document which is
expected to form the basis for all-party talks on a new constitution for the
province. It is also just a few days away from the first public meeting
between UK officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Efforts to avoid a Christmas poll continued yesterday. Mr Spring announced
he was restarting talks with Fine Gael, the main opposition party. With
Labour holding 32 seats and Fine Gael 47, there is an arithmetical
possibility of a coalition with one of the smaller parties. Mr John Bruton,
the Fine Gael leader, said yesterday that 'first of all we must get full
facts out on the floor of the Dail'.
With stronger leadership from Fine Gael, it is clear that the party could
win broad support within parliament to lead a coalition with Labour.
However, relations between Mr Spring and Fine Gael are not good, and a new
accommodation may prove difficult in practice. The smartest political
punters in Dublin appear to be laying their bets on a Christmas election.

Mr Michael Portillo, Britain's employment secretary, yesterday vetoed a
diluted European Union draft directive that would have provided protection
for part-time workers.
His decision, which was made at the EU's social affairs council, annoyed his
ministerial colleagues from the other 11 EU member states who had believed
that the UK had been willing to agree to a compromise settlement over the
part-time workers' measure. The proposal will now be re-written by the
Commission and it will be much tougher than the watered-down version
rejected by Britain yesterday.
The final directive will be presented in the early part of next year to
European employers and trade union organisations to see whether they can
reach a consensual agreement on its details. If this fails, then the EU
governments - without the UK - are expected to agree on a directive on
part-time workers which will then come into force. Mr Padraig Flynn, the
EU's social affairs commissioner, said he was 'disappointed' at the British
government's decision to block the part-time workers' directive. 'I thought
what we were proposing was a bare bones minimum measure but even then the UK
maintained a negative approach' he said.
The social affairs council meeting was also unable to reach agreement on a
draft directive covering posted workers. Britain was strongly opposed to the
directive in principal, but there was also serious criticism from a number
of other countries, nobably Portugal, Greece and Italy. The measure is
designed to ensure companies carrying out contracts in member states other
than their own have to pay their employees at the rates of the host country.
Doubts were raised about the scope of the directive, what issues it should
cover and whether it applied to workers employed for less than one week.
Mr Flynn said that he hoped that there would be an agreement on a posted
worker directive on December 21 when the ministers are due to meet again. 'I
believe there is a willingness to compromise on all sides over this
measure,' said Mr Flynn. 'It is about extending the free market in services
and not part of any Social Chapter.'
Mr Portillo was also alone to reject the German government's proposal to
press for greater economic and social convergence through the creation of
minimum labour standards.

Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, yesterday predicted that this
week's EU summit in Essen would be a 'milestone' in efforts to bring central
and eastern Europe into the European Union.
In a pre-emptive strike against critics, Sir Leon said Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania could expect new trade
concessions and a guaranteed minimum Ecu5.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) over the next
five years to pay for preparation for eastern enlargement.
In addition, the European Commission would next year produce a blueprint for
EU accession for the six countries. A white paper would set out steps to
adapt laws, state aid, norms and standards to adjust to the single European
market.
'We want to embed the principle of membership and create irreversible
momentum behind it. That is what Essen is about,' said Sir Leon.
In the run-up to the two-day summit which opens on Friday, critics seized on
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's hesitation about inviting the central and eastern
European leaders as symptomatic of a half-hearted approach to enlargement.
Doubts grew after it emerged the German presidency of the EU did not include
in its Essen discussion paper a commitment to reform structural funds and
the common agricultural policy.
The London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research claimed yesterday that
the proposals for Essen were deeply flawed. 'They are piecemeal and much
more limited in areas such as market access, anti-dumping, rules of origin,
agricultural policies and medium-term finance'.
Sir Leon conceded that the EU had avoided a commitment to reform of the CAP
and structural funds which, on cost grounds, was vital if enlargement were
to take place. But he derided the CEPR's proposal for a new secretariat
comprising EU and eastern European officials to monitor implementation of
the accession strategy. People would not be dancing in the streets of Prague
in anticipation of a new layer of bureaucracy in Brussels, he said.
Sir Leon said it would be 'artificial' to set a date for membership of the
central European states, or for opening accession negotiations. He advocated
waiting for the end of the 1996 intergovernmental conference whose primary
task was to adapt the EU's decision-making machinery to cope with an
expanded Union of up to 25 members. After institutional reform, some eastern
European countries might wish to move faster than others toward membership.
Sir Leon will hand over responsibility for relations with central and
eastern Europe to Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner for external
political affairs in the new European Commission which takes office in
January. However, he will retain responsibility for external economic
relations and yesterday's performance underlines his commitment to eastern
enlargement.

France wants the European Union to harmonise penalties for breaking EU laws,
allowing them to be enforced evenly and properly, Mr Alain Lamassoure,
French EU affairs minister, said yesterday.
France, which takes over presidency of the Union next month, is to ask the
European Commission to make an inventory of all infractions of existing EU
laws and to attach to all future draft EU legislation clauses specifying the
sanctions for breaking it.
Mr Lamassoure made clear that the initiative would tackle more than EU
budget fraud and, for the first time, would harmonise sanctions currently
left for member states to fix when they transpose EU regulations and
directives into their national legislation.
France's move may pose a dilemma for British Conservative Eurosceptics who
recently argued that the UK should pay no extra into a Brussels budget that
is so defrauded, but who might bridle at the EU reducing national
prerogatives on legislative sanctions.
'Member states may say setting sanctions is our national prerogative,' said
Mr Lamassoure. 'This is fine, when all member states apply some sanction,
but they don't' As examples of the unevenness of sanctions, he cited the
EU's 1991 directive against money-laundering, for whose infraction some
states had attached virtually no penalty but Luxembourg had prescribed a
20-year jail sentence, and EU rules on giving hormones to livestock, which
carried penalties of fines in some countries but prison in others.
A former chairman of the European parliament's budget control committee, Mr
Lamassoure said it was his experience of investigations into the same fraud
covering several EU states that 'some countries are very strict, while
others show great gentleness, even complicity' towards fraudsters. Companies
operating in stricter states were placed at a competitive disadvantage.
Mr Lamassoure said the French foreign and justice ministries had drafted a
memorandum which they would shortly send to Brussels. 'Our preoccupation is
about the fight against fraud and also about the respect for EU laws in all
fields - agricultural and regional grants, public market openness,
environmental norms and so on.'
He stressed that the French initiative covered only infractions of EU law,
not national criminal law. It therefore meant no softening of French
reservations about Europol, the German-backed proposal for a Europe-wide
police network that is to be discussed at the Essen summit. 'For the
present, there is no European penal law, and therefore no possibility of a
European equivalent of America's Federal Bureau of Investigation,' the
minister said.

The Dutch economy has grown by 2.2 per cent this year, far exceeding the 0.4
per cent rise in gross domestic product achieved in 1993, the central
statistical office said yesterday. Reviewing the year, it noted that the
sharp increase ended five years of steady decline in GDP growth from a peak
of 4.7 per cent in 1989. This year's economic rebound was firmly led by
exports, up 5 per cent in volume terms over 1993 when exports rose by just 2
per cent. By contrast, domestic economic growth was relatively weak, with
consumer spending rising 1.5 per cent. This marked the first time in three
years that the rise in consumer spending did not outstrip the wider economy.
Although investment grew at a modest 2 per cent, this represented a reversal
of the previous year's 2 per cent decline.
West German industrial orders fell 0.2 per cent in October from September,
but were up 10.4 per cent year-on-year.
Slovakia posted a Sk160m (Pounds 3.26bn) foreign trade surplus in October,
taking its January-October surplus to Sk1.38bn.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Iberia pilots force crisis showdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis at Iberia, the Spanish state airline, deepened yesterday after Mr
Javier Salas, the company's chairman, failed to convince the powerful
pilots' union to support a rescue plan for the financially crippled flag
carrier.
The breakdown of what was viewed as a final negotiating round with the
pilots is now likely to force the government to intervene directly in the
dispute. Madrid will want to avert a resumption of strike action over the
peak Christmas period following last week's stoppages.
Mr Salas said the failure to obtain an agreement with the pilots, after the
viability plan had obtained preliminary acceptance by ground staff unions,
meant he would now press ahead with a controversial restructuring programme
that involves cutting some 5,000 jobs, 20 per cent of Iberia's labour force,
and the sale of subsidiaries in order to stave off the company's threatened
bankruptcy.
Last week the embattled Mr Salas shelved the drastic streamlining project
after wildcat action by ground staff closed down domestic airports.
He subsequently gained initial backing from the company's main unions to a
scaled-down cost-cutting plan that placed the burden of wage reductions on
Iberia's 1,100 highly-paid pilots. The pilots yesterday rejected allegations
by Mr Salas that they had refused to accept nominal pays cuts of 15 per
cent. They said they were willing to reduce salaries by as much as 40 per
cent in real terms after wage freezes had been factored in - but only if Mr
Salas and other senior Iberia executives were replaced.
There could now be a showdown between the government and the Instituto
Nacional de Industria, INI, the loss-making public sector conglomerate run
by Mr Salas and of which Iberia is part.
The pilots, and also the company's middle management, blame INI executives,
who occupy top positions in Iberia, for a series of bad decisions, ranging
from costly investments in Latin America to a badly-judged fleet renewal
programme, that lie at the root of the airline's problems.
Iberia has debts of Pta424bn (Pounds 1.95bn), half of them short-term.
The airline has written off accumulated losses of Pta144bn, reducing its
capital and reserves to a mere Pta69bn, and is on course to lose Pta44bn
this year.

Arianespace, the European aerospace group, said yesterday it had suspended
its satellite launching programme and set up an inquiry into the crash of
Flight 70 last Thursday shortly after its launch from the island of Kourou
off French Guyana in the Atlantic. First results of the inquiry into the
accident - the seventh since 1979 but the second of its kind this year - are
to be presented on December 19. But Arianespace said it would not comment on
the findings until the official report was complete. '(The) mandate is to
establish the causes of the failure of Flight 70 and to recommend all the
necessary measures to be taken to correct the anomalies found,' the company
said. It is committed to launching 30 rockets before the end of 1996.
Insurers have warned that the failure of the launch will lead to a
reappraisal of rates for launches where insurance cover has not yet been
agreed.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Ireland poised for election as talks on coalition collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, Ireland Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland was last night heading for an early general election after talks on
the formation of a new coalition broke down.
The impasse came amid fresh allegations about outgoing prime minister Albert
Reynolds' controversial handling of a judicial appointment.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Labour party leader, abandoned negotiations with
Fianna Fail, the largest party, hours before yesterday's scheduled session
of the Dail, which would have approved the formation of a new government.
Last night Labour was trying to forge a left-right coalition with the main
opposition party, Fine Gael, and one of the smaller parties in the hope of
avoiding an election.
However, MPs held out little hope for such a pact. If a coalition does not
emerge in the next few days, Mr Reynolds will be forced to dissolve
parliament and call an election.
Mr Spring appealed to all parties to solve the crisis quickly because of its
likely effect on the Northern Ireland peace process. 'A prolonged period of
instability that could result from an election would do potential damage to
the progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland,' he told
parliament.
The collapse of talks between Labour and Fianna Fail comes at a critical
moment in the peace process, three days before the UK government starts
exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Speaking in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
seemed keen to play down the crisis. However, he conceded that the delays
would create a 'hiatus' in the negotiations to devise a framework document
which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks on a
constitutional settlement for Ulster. The judicial row that led to the
collapse of the Irish government centres on Mr Harry Whelehan, the former
attorney-general.
Mr Whelehan allegedly failed to process UK extradition warrants for a
paedophile Roman Catholic priest who was later convicted of child abuse
offences in Northern Ireland.
Mr Reynolds reiterated in parliament that he had not tried to mislead
parliament over the affair. But the Irish Times newspaper reported on Monday
that the prime minister had deliberately deceived parliament by not
disclosing his attempt to persuade Mr Whelehan to resign as attorney-general
a day before publicly defending him in parliament.
On Monday, Mr Spring demanded that Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, the new
attorney-general, provide a written explanation of the sequence of events.
Mr Reynolds hurried back from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe summit in Budapest to answer parliamentary questions.
'We are not happy with the answers we got . . . We've broken off
negotiations with Fianna Fail at this stage,' Mr Spring said as he left the
Dail yesterday.
'It's very serious,' said Mr Bertie Ahern, the new leader of Fianna Fail.
'We were hoping we'd form a government. That's not going to be the case.'
Mr Ahern seemed visibly shaken by the new set of allegations. He said the
party was resigned to a period in opposition or a general election.
'We're living through one of the saddest episodes in our parliamentary
history,' said Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, a former
coalition partner.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Serious setback for Major as Clarke drops fuel tax rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent, and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Budget strategy was in disarray last night after a
rebellion by more than a dozen backbench Conservatives forced the
abandonment of the planned second stage of value added tax on domestic
heating fuel.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced the humiliating climbdown after
Labour won a majority of eight for a motion paving the way for a fresh
debate on VAT during the passage of the finance bill, which implements the
Budget.
In an attempt to forestall an adverse reaction from the financial markets,
Mr Clarke said he would announce tomorrow how the government plans to plug a
Pounds 1bn hole in the Budget arithmetic opened up by the vote.
'On Thursday I will announce a package of spending and taxation measures
designed to keep borrowing on course and to maintain confidence in the
strong recovery of this country,' he said.
Financial markets had been nervous ahead of last night's vote and in the
aftermath of the government's defeat sterling edged lower against the
dollar. In early Asian trading today the UK currency was at Dollars 1.5585
after finishing in New York at Dollars 1.56225 and in London at Dollars
1.5631. The British Chamber of Commerce urged market caution, saying the
vote need not derail recovery.
The defeat is a serious blow for Mr John Major, who had hoped the vote would
mark the beginning of a period of political calm. Some MPs said it cast
doubt over the government's ability to last a full parliamentary term.
Labour demanded Mr Clarke's immediate resignation. Shouting over cheering
opposition MPs, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the Commons had
'spoken for the country against a government that is both discredited and no
longer in control'.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the chancellor's decision to abandon
the second stage increase, which would have raised the rate from 8 per cent
to 17.5 per cent, was the 'absolute minimum' he could have done.
'Even that will not be enough to persuade the people of Britain that this is
anything but a divided, discredited and dying government,' he said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Major had 'lost the
confidence of the House, the support of his party and the trust of the
country. There is only one way for them to go and that is out'.
The opposition victory followed a desperate late night Commons offer by Mr
Clarke of an extra Pounds 120m in compensation for pensioners. However, the
gesture persuaded only a couple of rebel Tories to fall back into line.
After a rowdy debate, marked by frequent interruptions from the chancellor's
own side, seven Conservatives voted with Labour and eight abstained. The 10
unionist MPs from Ulster, who normally back the government, voted with the
opposition.
In a sign of deepening backbench bitterness, eight of the nine Tory MPs who
lost or resigned the party whip after last week's revolt on UK contributions
to the EU rebelled again.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, one of the suspended MPs, said he had no regrets. 'It
was not a pleasant thing to do but it was the right thing to do. This
measure was going against the Conservative party's policies.'
Mr Richard Shepherd, another rebel on both issues, said the VAT rise was 'a
regressive tax, which means that poorer people pay a higher proportion of
their income than richer people. That is against Tory philosophy'.
Mr John Carlisle, a right-winger who voted against Labour, said the
government's position was 'extremely' serious. 'In shooting terms it is a
winged bird, waiting to be picked up or put out of its misery. We are in a
crisis,' he said.
Other senior Tories put a brave face on the defeat. Mr Kenneth Baker, a
former party chairman who attacked the cabinet's handling of recent events
at the weekend, said the government's position was 'difficult' but not
irrecoverable.
However, Mr Baker said the result emphasised the need to bring the Euro
rebels back inside the parliamentary party. 'They must be reconciled to the
party as soon as possible,' he said.
The revolt followed a day of frantic efforts by senior ministers and
government whips to rally support for the VAT changes, as contradictory
rumours about the extent of the rebellion swept the corridors of
Westminster.
Amid rising fears in Downing Street that Labour would succeed in forcing the
withdrawal of the increase, Mr Major flew home early from the European
security conference in Budapest to direct the government's fightback.
The prime minister saw Mr Clarke immediately on his return to London as Tory
whips warned that the outcome of the vote was 'on a knife edge'. Mr Clarke
and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, spent most of the afternoon
locked in meetings with rebellious backbenchers.
In a highly unusual move, the chancellor even telephoned Mr Geoffrey
Dickens, a seriously ill Conservative backbencher, to gauge his support. In
the end, Mr Dickens was paired with an opposition MP.
As the day wore on, even government loyalists grumbled about the handling of
the VAT controversy. One MP, normally a strong supporter of Mr Major, said
the issue had been handled with 'all the guile of a newt'.
Few were willing to go as far as Sir George Gardiner, the rightwing MP for
Reigate, who claimed in an article in The Times that the cabinet had brought
the Conservative party 'to the brink of disaster'.
Mr Major's supporters had hoped that victory in last night's vote would
clear the way for a less febrile period after recent rebellions on Europe
and Post Office privatisation, and speculation about a leadership challenge.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Euro-security summit fails to find accord over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A European security summit of more than 50 nations disagreed over the
conflict in Bosnia yesterday in an ominous sign that international consensus
on the war is crumbling.
Bosnia's Moslem-led government objected to a passionate ceasefire appeal by
German chancellor Helmut Kohl on the ground that the wording did not specify
that the Serbs were the aggressors. Earlier, Russia had blocked a series of
resolutions it viewed as unfair to the Serbs.
Delegates at the summit in Budapest said it was the most spectacular
diplomatic failure at an international gathering since the end of the cold
war.
The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is supposed to
be building a new security grouping of all countries from Vancouver to
Vladivostok, was unable to reach agreement over the fighting in Bihac, the
northern enclave of Bosnia virtually surrounded by the Serbs.
Mr Kohl, who was encouraged to make his ceasefire call by Russian president
Boris Yeltsin, pleaded unsuccessfully with Bosnian officials to lift their
objections, in a dramatic closing session of the summit.
'I do not want to go home and to answer the questions over what we did about
Bihac,' the German leader said. '(Shall I say) that we talked and got bogged
down in formalities?'
Mr Kohl said he understood the Bosnian government's view that the wording of
the ceasefire was not ideal, but he insisted: 'Only 300 kilometres from
here, people are dying of hunger . . . and it will be catastrophic if we
don't seal an armistice and provide some help.'
In the end, the summit's Hungarian presidency issued an informal appeal for
a ceasefire which was said to reflect the views of most, but not all,
participants at the summit.
Bosnian officials said they could not accept the ceasefire call because it
made no distinction between the internationally recognised government of the
republic and the Serb forces that occupy about 70 per cent of its territory.
The Bosnian delegation complained bitterly that Moscow had vetoed a separate
series of statements running to thousands of words that would have called
for an end to Serb encroachments on Bihac and condemned the behaviour of
Serbia, which has been suspended from the CSCE.
Six pages of carefully drafted pronouncements were discarded after Russian
officials called them unbalanced and unfair to the Serbs. The resolutions
would have condemned the Serbs of Bosnia and Croatia for encroaching on a
nominally UN-protected area in the Bihac enclave, and called on the
'aggressors' to accept a ceasefire.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Labour scents blood of a wounded government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a lean 15 years. But last night Labour MPs smelt the blood of a
damaged government. For some, it was almost too much to bear.
In extraordinary scenes as the voting figures were announced, MPs of all
parties crowded into the House from the lobbies at either end, many sitting
on the floor or even on the laps of colleagues.
Parliamentary tradition dictates that the voting figures are always handed
to a teller on the winning side. Thanks to that longstanding custom, Labour
MPs knew they had won even before the result was announced.
Tories looked on glumly as the cheering swelled from more than 300
opposition throats. Mr Dennis Canavan, an exuberant Scottish leftwinger, was
so excited he had to be physically restrained by Labour whips as he embraced
one of the tellers.
As the noise grew, Mr Major sat gloomily on the government front bench,
occasionally sharing a joke with Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, sitting alongside him.
The prime minister left the Commons shortly after the result was announced,
saying nothing. Later, he emerged looking grim from a midnight meeting with
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury
chief secretary. Asked how he felt, the prime minister snapped: 'Don't waste
my time.'
Mr Clarke, as combative as ever, returned to the despatch box immediately
after voting on a series of technical resolutions had finished, in order to
spell out his determination to protect the integrity of the Budget
arithmetic.
He told MPs: 'Nothing said in the course of the debate tonight has changed
our commitment to take all necessary measures to put the public finances on
a sound footing, nor indeed has the outcome of the vote.
'It is only right that we listen to the views expressed here tonight and I
have therefore decided not to proceed with the second stage of VAT on fuel.'
Clearly determined to brazen out the government's defeat, Mr Clarke claimed
that the principal beneficiaries would be people living in large houses with
extensive central heating systems.
Dismissively lambasting the opposition's failure to provide a costed
alternative to the VAT increase, he sneered: 'I see nothing resembling an
alternative government on the benches opposite.'
His rumbustious performance prompted a dramatic intervention from Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow chancellor, who will take much of the credit for the
parliamentary manoeuvring that defeated the government.
The cheering broke out again, at twice the volume, as Mr Brown told the
packed House that the humiliating defeat suffered by the chancellor and the
prime minister would force them to listen to the British people.
Shouting to make himself heard above the clamour, Mr Brown told the
government: 'This is not just a defeat for the Budget. This signals a
turning point in the politics of this country.
'The Conservative party may remain in office, but they are tired, they are
discredited, and they are out of touch.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: BMW signs motorcycle joint
ventures in India with Hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW of Germany and India's Hero group have agreed joint ventures to make and
market motorcycles in India, agencies report. Hero is the world's largest
bicycle manufacturer.
The aim is for Hero to assemble BMW's single-cylinder motorcycle F650 in
India for sale there, the German group said. BMW's F650 model is the
third-highest selling motorcycle in Germany, with 4,000 units sold this
year.
BMW said the company expected to sign a contract with Hero in 1995, with
production beginning soon after. Hero would build about 600 F650 motorcycles
a year, BMW said.
'We are convinced that by working together we shall be able to open a new
and promising market in India for larger-engined motorcycles,' said Mr W.
Hasselkus, president of BMW's motorcycle division, after signing a
memo-randum of understanding with Majestic Auto of the Hero group.
Majestic said there would be two new joint ventures. BMW would hold a
majority in a venture to source car components and market finished
motorcycles, while Majestic would hold a majority in a new motorcycle maker.
The two companies said they would carry out a feasibility study on the
possibilities of their making car products.
India's sales of motor cycles has doubled to 2m from 1m in the 1980s.
Mr Brij Mohan Lall, Hero chairman, said the details of the new joint
ventures would be discussed later. 'Both of us are committed to financial
participation but the minute details are yet to be worked out.'
Hero Motors would immediately start production of BMW's 650cc engine
motorcycles in India, adding Rs300m (Dollars 9.5m) in sales in the first
year, Majestic said.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Clipped wings for Mercury: The pressures behind retrenchment
plans at the UK telecoms operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior official at Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, was heard
muttering recently: 'What do we do if Mercury dies?' Yesterday's
announcement of retrenchment at the UK telecommunications company reveals
the question to be far from academic.
Less than a month ago, Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, was
suddenly reassigned to another post in the Cable and Wireless group, of
which Mercury is a part.
The new management, led by Mr Duncan Lewis who was previously responsible
for the north American operations of C &amp; W, insists the company has now laid
the foundations for future growth.
But some analysts believe that the company's best days are behind it as a
serious competitor to British Telecommunications, the UK's telecoms giant
which has just celebrated its tenth anniversary in the private sector.
Yesterday Mercury announced job cuts totalling 2,500, withdrawal from a
number of services including payphones, directory enquiries, mass market
entertainment and customer premises equipment. It also listed the business
areas - including telecom services for the oil and transport industries - on
which it intended to concentrate and said its residential services would be
provided through partnerships with cable companies.
The changes will not affect Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company that
is a separate venture.
There have been repeated warnings that Mercury was under pressure. Analysts
have been sounding alarms for more than a year, and statistics have long
been available highlighting Mercury's difficulties.
The most telling have related to the company's profitability and the erosion
of its competitive edge over BT, upon which most of Mercury's business
depends.
Mercury's figures for the half year to September 30 revealed the extent of
the company's plight and appear to have been the immediate spur for
yesterday's bloodletting.
They showed a fall in operating profit - down 3 per cent on the same period
for 1993, with only a modest growth in turnover and barely half the level of
growth in traffic witnessed in 1992 and 1993.
Much of the problem lies in Mercury's declining competitiveness. In the
business market, the gap between Mercury's charges and BT's has been
narrowing fast (see chart). Savings of up to 20 per cent were common on
long-distance prices in the late 1980s. But for large businesses, the
savings now on offer can be trifling, allowing for the costs of switching
and volume discounts available from BT.
It is a similar picture in the residential market, which has been Mercury's
main target for the past two years. A detailed BT study, published in
October, claimed that after volume discounts and bonus schemes, BT worked
out cheaper than Mercury not just for low-value residential users, but for
many home users with large bills - Mercury's target market. The figures,
verified by consultant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, were persuasive, and Mercury
failed to produce a convincing rebuttal.
As Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, the brokers,
puts it: 'Mercury has seriously under-estimated BT, which over the past five
years has ruthlessly cut costs and become a strong competitor on price as
much as quality.'
Oftel has been an accomplice in BT's transformation, since its tough price
cap on the former monopoly operator has been a significant spur to its
productivity improvement.
The regulatory vice was further tightened by the government's decision in
1991 to allow new entrants into the telecoms market to compete with BT and
Mercury. The ending of the BT/Mercury duopoly, which had been in place since
BT's privatisation, has exposed Mercury to intense competitive pressure.
In the business market, a host of new operators has focused on large
companies, severely denting Mercury's business. Worldcom, one of the largest
of the new operators, regards Mercury - not BT - as its principal
competitor, and quotes its prices as a percentage saving on Mercury's 'best
business price'.
A recent survey of 100 large business users by broker James Capel concluded
that Mercury was being 'squeezed from all sides' and is set for only modest
growth in the next few years.
Ironically, given the company's early success as the lean David fighting
against a bloated BT Goliath, Mercury now finds itself up against
competitors with far slimmer structures and lower cost bases than its own.
Energis, the subsidiary of National Grid that recently launched a national
fibre-optic network using the Grid's pylons, has about 400 employees,
compared with Mercury's 11,400.
In the residential market, cable TV companies have made significant inroads
into BT's market in urban areas. They use Mercury for much of their
long-distance traffic, but they have used the proliferation of long-distance
carriers to force down the charges.
Yesterday's surgery marks a change of strategy, the end of Mercury's attempt
to present itself a mini-BT offering a full range of services.
The closure of the payphones division is the most visible evidence. The
company is also pulling out of the mass consumer market; it will continue to
provide services to residential customers but largely through third parties
such as cable television operators. Mr Lewis says: 'We cannot address the
mass consumer market; the young upstarts of the cable television business
are the kind of people we will partner.'
More telling, perhaps, is Mercury's decision to withdraw from supplying
equipment such as exchanges, to business customers. Its supply activities
were built on the Pounds 320m acquisition of Telephone Rentals in 1988,
hailed by the company at the time as an act of 'industrial logic' to extend
Mercury's reach.
Mr Lewis sees two models for Mercury to follow. One, outside the
telecommunications sector, is Compaq, the US personal computer company that
has become a world leader by providing quality systems at low prices.
The other is MCI, the US telecommunications company whose rapid growth in
the late 1980s was based on confronting AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms
operator, in its core markets. MCI - which, ironically, last year forged a
Dollars 5.3bn alliance with BT - represents the best practice in
telecommunications for Mr Lewis.
MCI was one of the models used by Mercury in deciding to shed 20 per cent of
the workforce.
'We are committed to benchmarking our operations against best-in-class
carriers' practices and financial profiles,' says Mr Lewis.
In facing the current challenge, Mr Lewis boasts of his US experience.
Analysts argue, however, that MCI is a company that has done most things
right, while Mercury has missed its opportunities. Even if costs are brought
under control, growth has to be stimulated.
Furthermore, Mercury is only one of the businesses of Cable &amp; Wireless - and
one of the less successful. Although C&amp;W remains loyal to its offspring in
public, in private some of those in charge of its more successful businesses
are critical.
Last year Asia accounted for nearly half of C&amp;W's Pounds 4.7bn turnover, and
Hong Kong - C&amp;W owns a 57.5per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom - has long
been the jewel in its crown. Hongkong Telecom accounted for 64 per cent of
its operating profit last year. By contrast, in the competitive UK market,
C&amp;W's turnover was three-quarters that in Hong Kong, yet its operating
profit was less than a third as great.
Until now, C&amp;W has resisted bids for its UK subsidiary. Earlier this year it
even turned down a partnership deal with AT&amp;T that would have brought
Mercury into the US group's 'Worldsource' international alliance geared to
the telecoms needs of multinationals.
The decision to close the door on AT&amp;T aroused anguished soul-searching
within Mercury, with some believing it might be the UK group's last, best
chance to secure itself against BT.
Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said yesterday: 'The scale of this
restructuring reflects our determination that all businesses within the C&amp;W
federation must be fully competitive in their respective marketplaces.'
But even for a company named after the god of commerce, determination is a
long way from outcome.

China has expressed hope that a recent tariff pact with six central Asian
neighbours will reverse a sharp slump in traffic on the Eurasian Railway, a
fledgling rival to Russia's Trans-Siberian route, Reuter reports from
Beijing. 'We would like to open up this railroad,' Mr Ying Yue from the
Chinese Railways Ministry said. 'It would benefit our foreign trade and
economic development as well as that of the other countries. The more
railways we can open the better.'
China completed the high-potential intercontinental rail link when it opened
Alataw Pass into Kazakhstan in 1990, creating a second land link between the
Pacific and Atlantic. Promoters hope a second 'Eurasian Land Bridge'
mimicking the Silk Road will provide a cheaper, more direct and more
efficient alternative to the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Trans-Siberian
carries the bulk of transcontinental traffic, but is curtailed by harsh
Arctic weather in winter and limited capacity all year-round. Its remote
northern route is also of little use for central Asia's economic
development.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israelis to launch satellite as TV demand
grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Spacecom, an Israeli company, has announced plans to launch a Dollars 250m
communications satellite called Amos 1 before the end of next year.
Amos 1 will immediately compete against the outdated Saudi-backed Arabsat
which is due to be replaced in 1996.
Mr Shlomo Tirosh, Spacecom chief executive officer, said Amos 1 would be
able to relay video, voice and data services over an area from Iran to Libya
but would concentrate on Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gulf.
The new satellite will beam directly to customers equipped with 60cm dishes
and will carry analogue or compressed digital signals.
It will operate in the KU band which uses transponders more powerful than
the previous generation of transmitters.
Spacecom will lease segments in Amos's seven transponders to Arab and
Israeli customers as well as international clients such as HBO, the pay-TV
subsidiary of Time Warner, CNN, the Atlanta-based world TV network and Canal
Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, who will directly market their
programmes in the Middle East.
In the Gulf region, three rival Saudis have led the quest for the Middle
East's satellite viewers (there are an estimated 1m to 2.5m dishes in the
Middle East): Sheikh Walid Al Ibrahim, Sheikh Saleh Kamel, the billionaire
owner of Islamic banking group Dallah Al-Baraka; and Emir Khalid Ibn
Abdallah Ibn Abdel Rahman, who is head of the Mawarid Group, one of the
kingdom's largest conglomerates.
'The Middle East is an emerging market for television,' said Mr Tirosh.
'There is a lot of demand from citizens for TV channels from all over the
world and we believe the market will open up considerably in the coming two
years.'
Spacecom is a joint venture between Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), one of
Israel's largest companies, and three other Israeli companies - Gilat
Communications Engineering, C Mer, a telecommunications company and GSSC, a
satellite venture. The lightweight-class satellite will be launched by a
French-made Ariane rocket and will stay in orbit for between 10 and 11
years. It was manufactured by IAI with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and
Alcatel of France.
Amos 1 will also seek telecommunications business and provide data, voice
and oral telephone on the VSAT (verysmall aperture terminal) market,
increasingly used for business communications in the US and Europe.
Mr Tirosh said the company was seeking partners in the Middle East to
operate VSAT networks and to develop a regional network. Gilat already
operates VSAT networks in Israel.
Mr Noam Fink, Spacecom operating officer, said Gilat would eventually
transfer its services to Amos 1 including data broadcasting.
Among the services currently provided by the company are distribution of
Reuters and other financial information and satellite services for paging
companies.
Mr Fink said from January 1 next year the company would operate a
sophisticated interactive distance learning network to allow interactive
lessons with remote classrooms.
A contact to provide these services has already been signed with Israel's
open University and the ministry of education.

France's opposition Socialist party yesterday refused to be co-opted into
accepting anti-corruption reforms by prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, in
advance of a forthcoming parliamentary debate on the issue. Socialist
leaders boycotted a meeting of MPs which Mr Balladur called yesterday
evening to discuss anti-corruption reforms, after which the prime minister
was due to make a statement on national television. The opposition wants to
remain free to insist during a parliamentary debate on Friday that the
conservative government should reverse its easing of anti-corruption
measures passed by its Socialist predecessor. Last Friday a special
commission appointed by Mr Balladur recommended a total ban on corporate
contributions to political parties, as well as a ban on politicians holding
senior company posts and a series of measures to ensure fairness and
transparency in the award of public contracts.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Berlusconi hit by local polls: Centre-left alliances
flourish as Forza Italia falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Results of week-end local elections have increased the fragility of Italy's
right-wing government and turned the spotlight on the possibility of a
centre-left coalition.
Centre-left opposition alliances won the mayoral races in the run-off for
four out of six regional capitals, two of the regional councils and a
majority of the small local administrations being contested.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement showed signs of
having lost momentum and in the south the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance
surprised every commentator by the poor performance in its heartland. The
most spectacular result was the defeat of the right by a centre-left
coalition in the southern port of Brindisi and the province of Foggia.
Members of the government dismissed the outcome as insignificant voter
discontent. But Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League,
said the outcome demonstrated his movement could no longer live with its
partners in the right-wing coalition.
Although the elections involved fewer than 2m voters, all the political
parties prepared for them as a big end-of-year test for the popularity of
the Berlusconi government and the strength of the ruling alliance. The vote
covered a cross-section of the country - from the rich industrialised north
(Brescia, Treviso and Sondrio) to the centre (Pescara and Massa) and the
South (Brindisi and Foggia).
The most interesting result was at Brescia, where Mr Vito Gnutti, the
industry minister and League candidate, fell to Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the
leader of the Christian Democrats who presided over their transformation
into the Popular party (PPI). He gathered 56 per cent of the vote, backed by
the PPI and a broad alliance of the centre-left.
This alliance included the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS) and the Greens; but the high vote for Mr Martinazzoli indicated he had
obtained the reluctant backing of Reconstructed Communism, formed from the
rump of the old Italian Communist party.
Brescia now mirrors the fast changing political landscape. This wealthy
industrial centre was a traditional Christian Democrat stronghold, until it
was taken over by the League in the March general elections. Then in the
June European parliamentary elections, Forza Italia won 30 per cent of the
vote and cut the League from 25 per cent to 17 per cent.
The League vote held up in the first round of local elections two weeks ago;
but Forza Italia fell back to 12 per cent, while the MSI was almost level
with its government partner. With Forza Italia only giving half-hearted
support to Mr Gnutti and the MSI boycotting him - both in protest over the
League's 'disloyalty' in government - his defeat was likely. But the margin
was bigger than expected.
Mr Martinazzoli represented the left wing of the Christian Democrats and he
has now become both the symbol of, and the laboratory experiment for, the
PPI's new strategy of allying with the more powerful PDS.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Ukraine signs up to treaty on nuclear non-proliferation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine said last night it had won extensive guarantees from the US, Russia
and Britain in return for renouncing any aspiration to be a nuclear power.
The published text of an agreement between the four countries suggested the
pledges won by Kiev were little different from the standard promises made by
nuclear countries to non-nuclear states under the terms of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally joined yesterday.
Western diplomats declined to comment on whether any private or informal
undertakings had been given in addition to the published text. The accession
of Ukraine to the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for
the Start-1 treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former
Soviet nuclear warheads, to enter into force.
The break-up of the Soviet Union left Ukraine with the world's third largest
nuclear arsenal on its soil, and only last month did the Ukrainian
parliament formally renounce the aspiration to wrest control of these
weapons from Russia. Ukraine's adherence to the NPT was sealed during a
European security conference in Budapest by Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma and the leaders of the US, Russia and Britain, which were the
original architects of the treaty.
President Kuchma thanked his three co-signatories for their understanding of
the 'unique situation' of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and their
'readiness to give security' to his country.
Under the published text of yesterday's deal, the US, Russia and Britain
pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, to refrain from using or threatening
force against Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if
Ukraine is threatened with nuclear aggression.
In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of Russian
commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from
infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion. Russian foreign
policy experts have called openly for the use of their country's superior
financial muscle to take over as much as possible of the Ukrainian economy.
At the signing ceremony, President Bill Clinton hailed the 'arrival of a new
and safer era' in world affairs. 'Ukraine has taken a bold move away from
the nuclear precipice,' he said. 'The country's leaders have done a great
service to their own people and the world.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Derivative users 'lack refined controls of risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a minority of companies and institutions using financial derivatives to
hedge risks has adopted the most sophisticated risk management techniques
recommended by banks and derivatives traders, a survey has found.
The survey by the Group of Thirty, a Washington-based group of bankers that
has been influential in the debate on derivatives, found that derivatives
users such as industrial companies still lag behind banks in risk controls.
Only 8 per cent of the 149 'end users' surveyed reported using 'value at
risk' methods of portfolio valuation, and 42 per cent subjected their
derivatives portfolios to 'stress tests' to measure their value in volatile
markets.
The survey found that derivatives dealers such as banks and investment banks
had tightened standards since the G30 issued recommendations 18 months ago.
Senior managers of derivatives dealers were better informed about
derivatives risks.
The survey follows legal action by companies against Bankers Trust, the US
bank, over sales of leveraged interest rate swaps, and is likely to add to
debate over whether institutions that buy derivatives are aware of their
financial risks.
Despite a G30 recommendation that all users should set up an independent
risk management function, only 39 per cent of companies managed market risks
of derivatives independently, while 50 per cent managed credit risks
independently.
Mr Charles Taylor, executive director of the G30, said that some derivatives
users might not need such sophisticated risk management methods because they
had relatively small and simple portfolios.
However, Mr Taylor said the G30 had 'some ongoing concern' about the
relatively low use of 'value at risk' methods, the lack of stress testing
and 'some big gaps' in financial information disclosed by dealers.
Mr Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, executive vice president of Deutsche
Bank, said at a briefing in London that his bank intended to improve
disclosure standards by setting out its overall market risk position in its
1994 annual report.
The survey found improvements in dealers' practices. The proportion using
stress testing rose from 19 per cent before the G30 recommendations in July
1993 to 54 per cent, with another 39 per cent planning to do so within a
year.
There was greater monitoring of derivatives' activities by senior managers
of banks. The proportion of dealers whose senior management reviewed
controls had risen by 25 percentage points since July 1993 to 99 per cent.
The 'value at risk' method of calculating how much of a dealer's capital is
at risk from future market movements was used by 43 per cent of dealers,
with a further 37 per cent saying they would adopt it within a year.
Ms Gay Evans, chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, said that she was 'very happy' that the survey confirmed
anecdotal evidence that dealers were tightening risk management controls.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (14): Education system
criticised - Reform is needed for a more competitive Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Masashi Kojima, president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest
telecommunications operator, has grave concerns about Japan's
competitiveness in the future global multimedia race.
The underlying problem, he believes, is Japan's education system, which
encourages students to memorise rather than indulge in creative thought, and
is geared to creating disciplined, quality labourers.
Such concerns have been voiced over the past decade as Japanese industry has
caught up with the world and has been forced to compete to stay ahead in the
technology race. The increasing importance of patents has also made
creativity more valuable. A Japanese Nobel prize scientist and resident
researcher at a US university claimed in 1987 that he would not have won the
prize if he were still in Japan.
Education not only affects industry's competitiveness, but also the
country's political system and its role in the international arena. Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the back-room strategist of the present political realignment,
believes that education is the underlying problem for Japan's system of
government.
In his book Blueprint for Building a New Japan he writes that democracy has
never really taken root in Japan partly because of an education system
designed to stamp out independent thought. He believes the system is too
rigid at school level and and too dull at the university stage.
However, the business world needs to realise that it bears some of the
responsibility for the educational system's 'creativity problem'. In the
1960s, representatives of leading business federations suggested measures
for a partial reform of the national education system to suit their
interests.
The Federation of Employers' Organisations (Nikkeiren), and other business
organisations came up with proposals which were incorporated in an outline
prepared by the government's central education committee. The proposals were
reflected in the government's curriculum. Based on the measures, students
have been divided into five grades to determine which schools on the higher
levels they would advance to, creating pressures for pupils to cram at an
early age.
Another criticism has been that the Japanese system focuses too much on
equality, which threatens to stifle the creativity of talented students.
The Ministry of Education and the country's leading universities have
started to correct this problem and are implementing a programme which
allows high-school students excelling in maths and physics to attend courses
taught by university instructors.
The programme is intended to allow talented pupils to escape the constraints
of the uniform education system and the pressures of the fierce competition
for university entrance exams.
Mr Martin Phillips, head of education services at the British Council in
Tokyo, believes pressures from society as a whole will bring about changes
in the education system. 'The attitudes of the young today are very
different from their parents,' he says.
But conformity is still a virtue and open debate is rare in Japan. A rigid
hierarchy still governs almost every aspect of Japanese life, including
academia, bureaucracy, and politics. In a business world which is no
different and still strongly adheres to such values, individual and creative
thinking may take time to root.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (15): Different sides of same
story - Finance and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Takanobu Matsuda decided his company needed slimming down if it was
to compete in the harsher economic climate of the 1990s, he knew he would
require a little financial assistance from his banks.
The cost of severance payments for some of Matsuda Denshi Kyogo's employees
could not be met from the small electronic manufacturer's own coffers, so Mr
Matsuda asked his local banks for a loan. But he got nowhere.
None of the bankers in the Nagano area of northern Japan was prepared to
take the risk of advancing him the money he needed. He eventually found the
money by digging deep and trimming his restructuring plans, but he blames
the banks for his troubles.
Meanwhile in Tokyo, managers at a branch of one of the largest commercial
banks tell a rather different story. For months they have been enjoined by
their management to look for sound lending opportunities. But demand for
their funds, they say, has never been weaker.
The outlook has become so grim that they have taken to cutting their lending
rates to larger corporate customers in an increasingly desperate effort to
lure them back into the money market, despite the steady rise in their cost
of funds this year.
In a curious way both Mr Matsuda and the luckless Tokyo bankers tell
different sides of the same story of Japanese corporate financing in the
mid-1990s; the country has entered a kind of financial stasis. For the first
time in living memory, bank lending has actually dropped for four months in
a row.
Supply of and demand for lending has fallen. But the problem is a mismatch.
Banks want to lend to large, safe corporate customers. But they won't bite.
Smaller companies are eager to borrow, but banks are wary of lending to
them.
For years, Japan's banks were the life-blood of the country's economy. Under
the strict tutelage of the authorities, banks acted as a conduit to channel
the huge savings of Japanese households into industrial lending. They paid
rock-bottom interest rates to their depositors and they lent it on at
similarly low rates to industry.
The equation was simple and it worked. As Japan's economy emerged from the
debris of the second world war, the money was plentiful and cheap, and
corporations used it wisely, building an industrial base that would, in
time, dwarf most of its rivals.
But that happy tale of almost uninterrupted growth ended in the chaotic
bubble economy of the late 1980s. Financial liberalisation and rapid
economic growth created a speculative boom that started in Tokyo and spread
throughout the country like wildfire. The explosion of asset prices embraced
everything - land, stocks, even golf-club membership fees.
Industry, too, flourished as the higher prices raised wealth and demand and
enabled companies to expand. But in 1990 the bubble burst and Japan's
economy suffered.
For the banks the collapse of the bubble meant a mountain of bad debts as
lending secured on over-inflated asset prices quickly became worthless.
Between 1992 and September 1994, disclosed bad loans at the largest Japanese
banks quadrupled, and on average now represent nearly 3 per cent of total
loans. The true total is almost certainly much higher, since banks are not
obliged to disclose all their non-performing loans.
They have spent the past few years beginning the task of unpicking the
problem. As a result they are highly cautious about lending to the type of
smaller growth companies that fuelled the boom of the 1980s but collapsed so
spectacularly in the 1990s.
For industry it meant a pile of over-accumulated capital investment. For
four years, they have been caught in a downward spiral of falling demand
leaving them with excess capacity and lower profitability. New orders for
machinery declined by nearly 30 per cent between 1990 and the first half of
this year and have been flat since. Few large companies are willing or able
yet to borrow to finance an expansion.
In the past year, the slow economic thaw has created the demand-and-supply
mismatch. As banks work through their bad debt problems they have started to
allocate more lending to larger companies, on the grounds that security is
stronger at such corporations and a repeat of the bubble years is unlikely.
According to Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo,
demand from large companies is so low that 'banks are having to discount
their product in order to keep demand alive - by contracting loans at below
the prime lending rate.' But smaller companies are still considered too
great a risk for many bankers.
The underlying problem, according to many analysts, is that banks' lending
policies are hidebound by an attachment to land prices. More than a quarter
of all bank lending is collateralised by land and property. Many companies
are refinancing their borrowing on the basis of the new, much lower, land
prices that prevail today. The lower property prices mean banks have cut
their credit lines, making it more difficult for companies to expand.
Land prices are continuing to fall, dropping by 5 per cent in the principal
cities in the past year. That makes banks' lending policies still
restrictive for smaller borrowers. Some lenders have started to shift
towards a more innovative (in Japanese terms) policy of tying lending to
expected future cash-flow, but the fall-out from the bubble economy is so
great that most are still reluctant to break the familiar link with land
collateral.
Smaller companies have been borrowing in far greater volume from the public
institutions and that has offset some of the tight conditions in the private
sector market.
But just as there is little sign of an upturn in land prices that will help
the smaller companies to increase borrowing, there is scant evidence that
the larger corporations are eager to start borrowing again.
Corporate profitability is still at wafer-thin margins, and much of industry
remains plagued by overcapacity. And when businesses do return to the
financial markets they look likely to follow the growing trend towards
corporate bond issuance. In Japan's over-regulated financial markets that
may mean more business going overseas since corporate bond issuance in Japan
is still encumbered by a restrictive regulatory framework.
If the mismatch is to be redressed, banks must either change their lending
policies, land prices must rise sharply, or there must be an early return to
strong growth. Since none of those three possibilities seems likely in the
next year or so, the constrained market for capital seems set to continue.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (13): A particularly heated
argument - Trade conflict between Tokyo and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the latest round of trade negotiations between Japan and the US, one of
the main arguments the US has mustered against Japan has been that
internationally competitive US companies would have greater success in Japan
if its markets were truly open.
The majority of sectors which US trade officials have cited as problem trade
areas with Japan are those in which US companies have demonstrated
competitiveness in other world markets but have, by and large, failed to
make significant inroads in Japan.
The predicament of US telecommunications equipment makers trying to sell in
Japan is a case in point. 'US telecom manufacturers are among the most
competitive in the world,' the US government states in a paper on the
framework negotiations. Yet the Japanese market, particularly in the area of
government procurement, has been largely closed to foreign, including US,
telecoms companies.
The closed nature of Japan's telecoms market can be seen from the fact that
while other Group of Seven countries import about 25 per cent of their
telecommunications needs, Japan imported just 5 per cent in 1992, the US
argues.
'This imbalance stems from the obstacles foreign firms encounter in
attempting to participate in the Japanese public sector procurement market,'
the US government says. Not only have foreign companies lacked access to
information which is provided to Japanese companies, they have been
disadvantaged by practices such as sole sourcing and discriminatory tender
specifications.
The same goes for the medical equipment market. US manufacturers account for
40 per cent of the public and private market in the European Union, but less
than half that in the Japanese market, Mr Mickey Kantor US Trade
Representative Ambassador has stated.
The argument that US industry, despite its international competitiveness, is
prevented from penetrating Japan's markets, becomes a particularly heated
one when applied to the vehicle industry.
US frustration about its inability to make a wider mark in Japan's vehicle
market has intensified over the past few years not only because two-thirds
of the near-Dollars 60bn annual US trade deficit with Japan stems from
vehicles and vehicle parts, but increasingly because of a renewed confidence
in the US industry's competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese vehicle makers.
'The US has re-emerged as the world's largest producer of automobiles,'
noted Ms Joan Spero, US under-secretary of state for economic and
agricultural affairs, in a speech earlier this year.
The quality of US cars is also seen to have improved markedly. US companies
'are getting the quality message too. (They) have been making a serious
effort to improve the quality of the goods and services they produce, and it
shows,' Ms Spero said. Surveys in the US indicate that a growing number of
Americans now believe American cars are even better than Japanese cars.
On top of their increased competitiveness, US vehicle companies have stepped
up efforts to penetrate the Japanese market.
Yet the closed nature of the Japanese vehicle market has worked to frustrate
such efforts. Foreign vehicle manufacturers lack access to information on
the car market, come up against regulations and business practices which
hinder sales of foreign-made car parts to the after-market in Japan, and the
close relationships which tie dealers to Japanese car makers.
The situation is blamed for the small share, about 3 per cent, that foreign,
including US, vehicle makers had for long been relegated to in the Japanese
market against the 20 to 30 per cent share which Japanese companies have
recently enjoyed in the US.
Although the foreign share of Japan's vehicle market has risen substantially
closer to about 10 per cent this year, this has owed more to a favourable
exchange rate and intensified marketing by foreign companies rather than
improvements in market access.
Improved US competitiveness in cars and other industries means that 'the old
rhetoric in Japan - the rhetoric that says that the trade deficit is
America's fault because of our low product quality or because our companies
don't try hard enough to export - that rhetoric simply does not ring true
any more,' Ms Spero asserts. This argument has been used to support US
claims that Japanese markets do not function like 'normal' markets do in
free trade economies and was behind a 'results-oriented' approach adopted by
the administration of President Clinton.
However, as the year-long experience of the bilateral framework negotiations
made clear, the US approach failed to win widespread public support not only
in Japan but in Europe, Asia and even in the US.
While many people, including Japanese businessmen, would no doubt agree that
competitive US companies probably face greater obstacles in Japan than they
would in most other industrialised countries, the results-oriented approach
advocated by the Clinton trade team raised suspicions that it would benefit
mainly specific companies in chosen industries which the US government had
deemed competitive. After bilateral agreements were reached in November in
most of the priority sectors, that suspicion remains.
This month, Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for External Relations,
voiced concern that the bilateral agreements would benefit US companies at
the expense of European ones.
In a recent report, Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, economist at Morgan Stanely, the
US investment bank, argues that the benefits from the framework agreements
'may accrue to individual firms in the targeted sectors but are unlikely to
have a major impact on the big picture of Japan's trade-current account
surplus.' In fact, based on rough, hypothetical estimates, the bilateral
agreements are likely to cut the US trade deficit with Japan by just Dollars
404m - or less than 1 per cent - she notes.
Many economists and public officials agree that a far more effective
approach to reducing Japan's surplus would be to stimulate domestic demand
through deregulation measures that would create a level playing field for
foreign companies in Japan.
After a year of battling against widespread public criticism of its
results-oriented approach, and having reached agreements on some of the most
contentious issues in the framework talks, the US government now appears to
be channeling its energies in that direction.
It has submitted to the Japanese government a detailed list of deregulation
and administrative reform measures which it states 'can. . . provide greater
market access for foreign goods, services and investment and. . . generally
promote the domestic demand-led growth of the Japanese economy.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (12): Tiger economies win market
share - Japan in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's east-Asian neighbours have benefited from, and contributed to, the
declining competitiveness of traditional sectors of Japanese manufacturing.
The most successful tiger economies, Taiwan and South Korea, have used their
low labour costs and cheap currencies to win market share from Japan, in
selected sectors such as steel and shipbuilding, where price is a more
important determinant of market success than technology. Later developing
economies such as Malaysia and Thailand are rapidly catching up for the same
reason.
The tigers owe part of their economic success to Japanese industry's
strategy of shifting production capacity for lower value-added goods to
cheaper locations overseas, given fresh impetus recently by the yen's surge
in value.
East Asia has been the main beneficiary of this fresh industrial investment,
concentrated in the most capital- and labour-intensive sectors such as cars
and consumer electronics. In these sectors, Japan's Asian neighbours are
assembly bases rather than strong competitors, but their economies have
nevertheless benefited.
Japanese direct investment in the region rose more than three-fold from
Dollars 2.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 7.3bn in 1993, where it represents roughly
one-fifth of Japanese investment worldwide. That proportion will nearly
double, as a share of Japan's overall foreign investment, to 37.5 per cent
this year, according to a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry. At this rate, by the end of the decade east Asia will overtake the
US as the largest recipient of Japanese industrial spending.
Within east Asia, the focus of Japan's corporate investment planners has
recently switched from Hong Kong and Thailand to China. Japanese investment
in China grew by nearly 58 per cent in the first half of last year, faster
than anywhere else in the world.
Corporate Japan's Asian spending spree has stimulated a sharp rise in trade
with its neighbours, as Japanese manufacturers export components and
machines to their east Asian assembly plants. Helped by Japanese salaries,
local economies' demand for foreign, often Japanese-made goods, has
expanded.
Accordingly, Asia overtook the US as Japan's largest export destination in
1991 and last year Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its
surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a
third more to the US than to Asia; now the balance is reversed.
Japan's trade surplus with the rest of Asia will continue to rise, believes
Mr Susumu Taketomi, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
But Asian exports to Japan will grow fast enough to defuse serious political
problems of the kind that bedevil Japan over its surplus with the US, he
argues. 'This surplus is healthy for Asian countries. They will probably
succeed in upgrading their industrial structure so that they will show a
surplus at the end of the century,' he says.
Most Japanese manufacturers began in east Asia with basic assembly plants,
fed with components made in Japan. As local economies grow and the yen
continues to rise, the Japanese are now looking to expand their use of
locally made components. An added incentive to do this is the need to avoid
heavy import duties on part-assembled products.
Japan's industrial advance into east Asia has been led by sectors in which
assembly forms a high share of costs, such as consumer electronics - as a
result of which Japan last year became a net importer of colour televisions
for the first time - and home appliances.
Examples include electronics giants Matsushita and Sharp in Malaysia, which
have become so deeply embedded in the local economy that their combined
local sales account for 6 per cent of the country's gross domestic product,
according to the Japan External Trade Organisation.
So far, Japanese companies have reaped rich rewards from their Asian
onslaught, all the more welcome when their domestic market is stuck in a
painfully slow recovery from the longest recession in post-war years.
According to the IBJ, the operating profits of Asian offshoots, as a
percentage of turnover, averaged 4.8 per cent in 1991, well above the 0.9
per cent average for overseas subsidiaries.
However, the shift of Japanese manufacturing capacity into east Asia is
limited by two things. It will only happen in sectors where Japan is least
competitive, because companies wish to keep control of key technology. It is
unlikely to be at the direct expense of jobs at home, because of the
continuing taboo against making redundancies in Japan.
Japanese companies still see an advantage in domestically producing those
high technology products in which they lead world markets. Semiconductors
are the obvious example, where manufacturing equipment for the newest and
most powerful memories continues to be made in Japan, helping to ensure that
east Asian chip-makers remain dependent on Japanese technology.
The IBJ's Mr Taketomi believes the growth rate of Japan's Asian investments
will slow down in the years ahead, constrained by companies' unwillingness
to break the taboo against making redundancies at home. There will be
instead, he predicts, a reorganisation of Japanese investments within the
region, away from relatively high cost areas such as Hong Kong into cheap
ones such as southern China.
The Japanese government has played a cautious role in supporting Japanese
industry's economic advance into Asia by gently pushing the cause of free
trade in the region.
Until recently, Japan's Asian diplomacy strategy was one-dimensional: aid
for trade. The Tokyo government disburses 60 per cent of its annual overseas
aid budget - the world's largest - to the region, partly a hang-over from
post-war reparations.
The new dimension is the shift in the government's attitude to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec) over the past year, from
mildly negative to mildly positive. Indonesia's support for US-inspired
efforts to use Apec to reduce barriers to trade and investment has helped
Tokyo overcome some of its inhibitions over playing a part in Apec.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (10): Progress will be painfully
slow - Deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paying a bill through a Japanese bank amply illustrates why Japan's path to
deregulation will be painfully slow.
A white-gloved attendant bows respectfully as you enter, murmuring 'Welcome
dear customer.' You are led to a ticket machine, which issues a numbered
slip, indicating your place in the queue.
Another attendant hands the ticket from the machine to the the dear customer
and ushers you to a comfortable chair, next to a rack well-stocked with
scandal magazines and mail order catalogues. There you browse until your
number is called.
The teller will then ask you to fill out a form, with duplicates, giving
details of the money transfer. Cash only is accepted.
Yet at the end of all this, the funds are transferred electronically; at
least that is before the dear customer is bowed out of the door again.
It is a costly system, paid for by customers - on the whole without
complaint - in the form of bank charges two or three times European levels.
Yet this kind of service, whether it be at department stores, filling
stations or banks, has been until now a valuable staple of Japan's social
structure.
The highly regulated service sector, generously sheltered from foreign
competition, has traditionally absorbed surplus jobs, shed by
internationally competitive manufacturing businesses. Banks are not legally
obliged to perform these expensive rituals in their retail halls, but they
are so protected from competition that they are under little pressure to
break with comfortable old ways.
The service sector's ability to mop up jobs is one reason why Japan has been
able to stay near or above US levels of competitiveness in manufacturing -
depending on the sector - and yet lag 50 per cent behind it in some kinds of
services, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute.
However, that comfortable arrangement is up for renegotiation. It only
worked so long as manufacturers could continue to race ahead in the world's
export markets, and perform their traditional job of being the main motor of
Japan's economic growth.
But US and European pressure to curb the trade surplus, combined with the
squeeze on export profit margins imposed by the high yen, has obliged the
Japanese government to turn to a new strategy, deregulation, as a way to
increase the economy's capacity to grow.
If services could be made as efficient as manufacturing, the argument goes,
Japan might rediscover the growth rates achieved in the heady 1980s.
Three Japanese administrations over the past year have recognised this and
have accordingly begun to make progress in pushing away some of the more
than 10,000 official rules and regulations that control an estimated 40 per
cent of industrial activity.
For the first time in Japanese post-war politics, government, opposition and
the main business lobbies officially favour deregulation  - even if they
sometimes appear to pay no more than lip-service to the idea.
As in previous deregulation drives, a decade ago, progress has run into
resistance. Companies are reluctant to fire the men in white gloves, since
redundancies remain socially unacceptable. Firing staff is seen as a sign of
corporate weakness, at least until a large company gives the lead.
According to a recent study by the Keidanren, the business federation,
deregulation on a scale to bring Japanese costs in line with US ones would
initially put 2.84m people out of work, but would by the end of the decade
stimulate growth enough to produce a net gain of 740,000 jobs.
On top of this, government departments are averse to giving up some of the
powers they have used to control Japan's economy until now with such
success. In Japan, vested interests make no sacrifices without being
mollified first.
And yet there has been progress. It started with the popular attack on the
bureaucracy launched just over a year ago by former prime minister Morihiro
Hosokawa, Japan's first non-Liberal Democratic Party leader for 38 years.
The present prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, aims to continue, with a
five-year deregulation programme starting in April 1995.
The main sectors to see the beginning of a change in the restrictive old
ways are retailing, food, financial services and cars.
Retailing: The Large Scale Retail Law, which governs planning consent and
opening hours, has been relaxed twice in the past two years, most recently
in May. This has removed local shopkeepers' power to veto a new supermarket
and allowed stores to stay open later.
As a result the number of supermarket openings has quadrupled since May to
about 80 a month. At the same time, imports of foreign consumer goods are
growing rapidly, helped by the cheapness they derive from the rising yen.
Food: The decision to allow, for the first time, limited rice imports, has
weakened the power of the farm lobby, formerly fundamental to keeping the
LDP in power. This is bad news for interest groups in other sectors. The
rice import ban is to be gradually phased out from next year and replaced
with tariffs.
There is a pay-off, of course, in the form of a Y6,010bn aid package.
Financial services: Finance ministry officials are planning to step up the
pace, motivated by the gradual loss of the capital markets' competitiveness
to other markets in Asia and Europe.
So far, Japan's march to financial deregulation has been slow. It continued
this year, with the end of government controls on ordinary savings and bank
deposits, completing the freeing of interest rates begun in 1985.
This has encouraged banks to seek new ways to attract savers' patronage.
One credit group even offered savers a lottery prize, to the consternation
of the finance ministry and the banking industry federation.
It may be a sign of things to come.
At the same time, the government in October permitted the large commercial
banks to issue corporate bonds, for the first time. This privilege was
granted to long-term credit banks last year and is the latest stage in a
cautious dismantling of the barriers between banking and securities.
Cars: There has been a slight loosening in car dealers' formerly rigid
allegiance to single Japanese manufacturers, for business rather than
deregulation reasons.
This, plus the yen's strength, lies behind a 93 per cent rise in car imports
in the year to October, where they account for nearly 9 per cent of the
Japanese market.
However, the government has not yet touched the barrier to trade most often
cited by frustrated exporters, the 'shaken' system. This is a costly test,
obligatory after a car is three years old, which foreigners complain gives
high volume producers an unfair advantage.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, president of the otherwise pro-deregulation Keidanren
and chairman of Toyota, believes the system should stay as it is.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (11): The old order is breaking
down - Emiko Terazono takes a look at the Keidanren
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades, the Federation of Employers Associations (Keidanren), Japan's
leading business lobby, has acted as the control centre for businesses in
realising the government's industrial policy, as the guardian of business
interests, and as fund-raiser for the conservative Liberal Democratic Party.
However, the old order, where business, bureaucrats and politicians worked
closely together to ensure Japan's economic success by directing funds to
specific industries and keeping foreign competition out, is breaking down.
Political realignment which started last year, heightened criticism of the
bureaucracy for its resistance to deregulation. Battered business confidence
due to the prolonged recession has altered the relationship of the three
parties known as the 'iron triangle'.
The influence of the Keidanren has also been undermined by the realisation
among businesses that neither governmental nor political control can provide
answers for the structural problems which Japan's industries face.
Amid such changes, the organisation is trying to promote itself as an
instigator for deregulation. Earlier this year, Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the
chairman, asked then Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to cut the number of
bureaucratic regulations by half in the next five years.
The Keidanren believes that deregulation is essential to revive Japanese
industry, presently stifled by bureaucratic and political intrusion. It sees
deregulation also helping to remove the price differentials between consumer
products in Japanese and overseas markets, and activating consumer
confidence.
The Keidanren recently blew a whistle on the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry for allegedly violating the law on administrative procedure,
laid down last October. Complicated and unwritten bureaucratic
decision-making has long been regarded as a regulatory barrier for new
businesses. Companies, including foreign enterprises, have voiced complaints
over the procedures.
The new law aims to make bureaucratic decision-making more transparent and
to curb the influence of lobby groups on bureaucratic decisions by laying
down rules for the processing of applications for government permits or
licences.
The irony is, however, that while the Keidanren is an eager watchdog for the
government's deregulatory process, many of the industries which the
organisation oversees are beneficiaries of administrative guidance and other
government regulations. This includes the motor industry, whose interests Mr
Toyoda, also chairman of Toyota Motor, is keen to protect.
The car industry and the government are under pressure from the US to ease
the vehicle inspection system which has long been blamed for making it
costly for consumers to own the same car for more than five years, and
encouraging regular replacement of vehicles.
The Keidanren is aware of the pain of deregulation. In a recent report, it
predicts that full-scale deregulation would wipe Y10,000bn off gross
domestic product and put 2.84m people out of work in the following few
years.
And while it envisages the eventual benefits of deregulation as a net
increase of 740,000 jobs and a Y177,000bn rise in the national wealth, it
claims that the prerequisite for a successful transition is an improved
infrastructure, telecommunications and social services.
How far the organisation can shrug off the vested interests it embodies and
convince corporations to alter traditional practices in order to promote
fully-fledged deregulation remains to be seen.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (9): Success has whittled away
Miti's powers - Emiko Terazono examines industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poll taken last year by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese leading
business daily, revealed that Japan's leading bureaucrats thought the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) was third on the list of
insignificant ministries and government agencies, following the Hokkaido
Development Agency and the Food Agency.
Miti was once one of the most powerful institutions in Kasumigaseki, Japan's
Whitehall, orchestrating the country's industrial policy in close
co-operation with the business sector. However, now that Japan's has
achieved economic success and the role of industrial policy in economic
development has diminished, the ministry has been marginalised among even
clannish bureaucrats.
Many economists agree that Miti's interventionist policy - based on
identifying key growth industries, supporting them with enormous investment
programmes and protecting them from foreign competition - has been largely
successful. Industries such as petrochemicals, cars and electronics
flourished under the wing of Miti in the 1960s and 1970s.
But economic success has whittled away Miti's powers. The rising strength of
corporations has reduced the influence of the government's industrial
policy, while the ministry's role of selecting and promoting industries has
been limited by foreign pressure on Japanese exports.
'The ministry is a little like a poverty agency that has actually succeeded
in eliminating poverty,' says Mr Chalmers Johnson, professor of University
of California, Berkeley, and author of Miti and the Japanese Miracle.
Increased criticism from businesses over informal administrative guidelines
have also reduced the ministry's power. In the past, ministries such as Miti
could withhold licences and legal permissions from businesses that did not
follow the guidelines. However, rules governing administrative approval
procedures, introduced to make the process more transparent, have made it
difficult for bureaucrats to wield influence.
The ministry is also losing out in a power struggle with the Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications (MPT) which began in the early 1980s for control
over new potential growth sectors - namely the telecommunications and
multimedia industries.
Mr James Vestal, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo and author of
Planning for Change, a book which analyses the role of Miti, says that while
its success in the 1950s provides lessons for developing countries, the
argument that the west has something to learn from Japan's industrial
policies now, is questionable.
He claims that there is little scope for industrial policy in solving the
middle term issues which the country's economy faces. The biggest problem,
unbalanced growth, comes as a result of corporate interests being placed
over those of the consumer.
The lack of emphasis on consumption has led to a surplus of domestic savings
over domestic investment which is at the root of the country's chronic
current account surplus.
The underlying cause has been the willingness of Japanese workers to put the
interests of the company before their own. Industrial or macro-economic
policy cannot deal with this issue. Only a radical change in the way
Japanese see themselves in relation to their employers will resolve it.
Nor can industrial policy solve the demographic changes which will soon hit
Japanese economic growth. Pollution, another big problem, is also an issue
which needs tackling outside industrial policy.
The lack of industrial models also makes it hard for the country to identify
potential growth industries. Since Japan cannot follow other examples of
industrial development, it is on equal standing with other industrialised
countries in investing and promoting the development of new technologies.
In its search for a new role, the ministry has started to undo its past
policy failures. In the early 1980s it moved to save jobs in the
petrochemical industry by organising a cartel of Japan's producers. This has
left the industry fragmented with inefficient operations and costly
products.
Aerospace, another industry that Miti has promoted since the 1960s, is also
being reviewed.
The ministry is now promoting restructuring in the petrochemicals industry,
encouraging mergers and cutting costs. Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi
Petrochemical merged last October and Asahi Kasei is also undergoing
rationalisation.
Miti has decided to side with the consumer, shifting from its role as
promoter of industry. Miti has backed the country's product-liability law
which will protect consumers against defective products. The bill passed
parliament last June after nearly 20 years of debate.
The pro-consumer direction has also allowed Miti to regain its grip on
certain industries. It is using its remaining powers of intervention to
place market forces into the country's energy sector - including the gas and
electricity utilities and the oil industry. In spite of heavy opposition
from the industries, Miti is promoting the freeing of energy prices and the
deregulation of distribution routes.

Heavy industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<TEXT>
On an island in Tokyo Bay stands a living embodiment of the decline of
Japan's primary industries.
Built in the 1970s, when demand for Japanese steel was multiplying, the
massive Ohgishima Steel Mill was designed to produce 9m tonnes of crude
steel a year, almost one-tenth of the country's total output. But a few
years ago one of its two blast furnaces was extinguished and the mill, built
by NKK, one of the country's five largest steel makers, is now running at
less than 50 per cent capacity.
The mill is a concrete reminder of the overcapacity that dogs Japanese heavy
industry. Despite years of falling demand for their product, Japanese
companies have avoided taking the painful decisions that would keep them
competitive in a region where new challenges from the emerging Asian
economies grow more threatening every year.
In the past few years the high yen has forced them to look again at their
chronic problems - over-capacity, high costs and inefficient production
techniques
Japan's heavy industrial behemoths have had longer to adjust to the
straitened conditions of the recession that is just ending, but that
advantage has hardly helped them. For the giant industries of steel and
shipbuilding, the difficulties began in the 1970s with the first oil shock,
and despite a recovery in the late 1970s and 1980s, crude steel production
has never returned to its peak of just under 120m tonnes in 1973.
The recession of the early 1990s has exacerbated the decline. Weak global
demand gave way in the last year to a genuine slump at home. In 1993, crude
steel production was 99.6m tonnes, the second year in succession that Japan
has produced less than 100m tonnes. In the first six months of 1994
production remained flat.
Exports have risen in the past year as a result of strengthening demand in
Asia and the US, but the strong yen has eaten away manufacturers' profits.
Domestic demand this year has remained weak. The coming year may see some
improvement as as demand for higher-margin products such as cars, picks up,
but the shift of much of the country's manufacturing capacity offshore means
longer-term prospects are bleak.
The unaddressed problem is that the industry still needs wholesale
restructuring. Total excess capacity is estimated at more than 20m tonnes.
The number of hours worked in steel production per worker per year fell
below the 2,000 mark in 1993 for the first time ever, but there have been
only limited reductions in staff numbers. Employment fell from 309,000 in
1989 to 289,000 last year - barely matching the fall in production.
Mr Stephen Wolfe, industry analyst at UBS in Tokyo, says: 'the steel
industry is capable of producing 110m tonnes of crude steel a year, and yet
by the year 2000 domestic demand will be for no more than 90m tonnes of
active production.'
The prospects for exporting the excess are slim. Although demand for steel
in Asia remains strong as the regional economy continues to expand, Japan's
ability to supply that demand is threatened by much cheaper steel elsewhere.
Japanese prices are as much as 50 per cent higher than other countries'
steel, especially Korea, and there seems to be little prospect of a
narrowing of that differential.
Japanese shipbuilding, like the steel industry, reached its peak in the
early 1970s and has struggled to adapt since. Following the slump in new
building demand after the first oil shock, Japanese shipyards suffered their
worst-ever decline. But, unlike their steel counterparts, shipbuilders made
some progress in restructuring. Excess capacity was cut and the industry was
able to weather the worst of the weak demand for ships in the 1980s, which
saw ship prices fall sharply.
But just as the prospects for demand have begun to revive, and despite its
efforts, it is an unhappy irony that the industry faces probably a greater
immediate threat to its survival than any other Japanese sector.
In the next 10-15 years the combined effect of the ageing nature of the
world tanker fleet and more stringent safety requirements which will boost
the production of double-hulled ships, is likely to raise demand for ships.
But late last year, the South Korean government gave the long-awaited
go-ahead for a huge expansion of South Korean shipyard capacity and in the
process signalled a bare-knuckled fight with the Japanese, one in which
Korea has a critical advantage.
Japan and her principal rival both have roughly one-third of the global
shipbuilding market. In the next three years, Korean capacity is set to
expand by more than 50 per cent. The effect will be to drive prices down
further - a price-cutting war that Japan seems set to lose.
Costs in Japan are way above those in South Korea - wages are on average
more than double Korean wages, raw material costs are 10 per cent higher,
and the strong yen has helped that country's shipbuilders gain a price
advantage. The Japanese builders have indicated their willingness to cut
costs further, but the scope for further reductions is limited.
According to Mr Timothy Marrable, shipping analyst at Barings Securities in
Tokyo, 'The massive expansion of Korean shipbuilding capacity is now a hard
reality and spells disaster for Japan's shipbuilders.'
But perhaps no industry is identified more closely with the traumas of the
past few years than construction. Not only were the leading construction
companies the immediate beneficiaries of the commercial property boom in the
late 1980s, but through a series of well-publicised scandals involving
bribes-for-contracts, they came to symbolise the web of problems at the core
of Japan's economy.
The enormous over-investment that was the most striking feature of the boom
years seems likely to depress the industry for many years yet. Total orders
fell by more than 60 per cent between 1991 and the middle of this year.
The one bright spot has been public sector orders, where fiscal stimulus
packages in the last 18 months have helped bolster demand. But the
difficulties seem set to continue. Companies are in many cases burdened with
land bought at the peak of the boom, and with uncollectable debts from
insolvent clients. Losses are at record highs.
Restructuring is more of a reality in the construction sector than
elsewhere. The leading contractors have all virtually eliminated their
overseas activities and have cut staff levels at home. But in a
labour-intensive industry, there is little scope for genuine
rationalisation.
The weakening of Japan's manufacturing sector - caused by excess capacity in
the late 1980s, the subsequent recession and the surging yen - have eroded
the country's industrial base. Much of the modern manufacturing that has
powered Japanese growth in the past two decades has gone offshore where
labour is cheaper and the currency weaker.
For Japan's primary industrial giants, many of whom have postponed their
long-overdue restructuring, this unfortunate coincidence of adverse events
means that the reckoning may soon be at hand.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (8): Secretive bank lifts veil - Ian
Rodger profiles Pictet, undisputed leader of its tribe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss banks are notoriously secretive, the country's 18 private banks
especially so.
These firms, with exotic names such as Mourgue d'Algue or Landolt Lonfat,
are in fact private partnerships and operate under a special Swiss law which
enables them to keep information about virtually every facet of their
business to themselves.
No balance sheets or income statements ever emerge from these banks, and the
partners - whose liability for their firm's problems is unlimited - rarely
talk in anything but the most general terms about their business.
They are, of course, supervised by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission.
That, plus a long tradition of competence, has tended to satisfy their core
customer base, the world's so-called high net worth individuals.
Undisputed leader of this tribe is Pictet &amp; Cie of Geneva, with a staff of
900 and offices in Zurich, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Montreal, Nassau and
Luxembourg.
Pictet has about Dollars 30bn in funds under management, ranking it the
largest fund manager in Switzerland after the three big universal banks. It
also claims to act as global custodian for Dollars 45bn, which includes most
of the funds under management.
Until recently, Pictet, which was founded in 1805, has been among the most
secretive of the private banks, but now that its business is becoming
increasingly international, it has begun to lift the veil on its activities
and strategies.
The firm, with assets of over SFr2bn, is owned, directed and managed by its
seven partners (an eighth is due to be appointed). Not all have connections
to the Pictet family. Deliberately, the age range is wide, from early 30s to
early 60s. 'If you have seven of the same age, they will be rivals,' says Mr
Jacques de Saussure, one of them.
Shares in the partnership are sold at par to new partners and bought back at
par when they retire. Young partners are awarded extra dollops of the firm's
profits to help them build up their share stakes.
The partners meet every working morning to review problems large and small.
Mr de Saussure says important decisions are made by friendly consensus. 'It
is very lonely to be a chief executive in a company; when we have a tough
problem, we are all in it together.'
Pictet's main policies, similar to those in other Swiss private banks, are
to eschew diversification, debt, trading for the firm's account and
acquisitions. Sometimes, this makes it look over-cautious, but this year
when many other banks have taken a beating on own trading, Pictet is
purring.
Highly qualified young people are sought - fluency in three languages is a
prerequisite - and trained to be team players. 'We do not want any stars or
gurus,' says Mr Charles Pictet, another partner. The firm likes to control
every aspect of the process of investing client funds, from research to
custody.
With these cautious policies, change cannot happen quickly. Until the early
1960s, Pictet was active only in private banking and mainly for European
clients seeking to avoid taxes in their home countries. It then set out to
broaden its base, developing from scratch an institutional fund management
business and searching wider for private clients.
It has taken a generation to achieve these goals. From its London base,
Pictet is now recognised by US institutions for its expertise in emerging
markets and on small capital stocks in Europe. The London office manages
some Dollars 3.5bn in funds. The firm also has a big institutional business
in Switzerland and feels well placed to offer its services in neighbouring
European countries if and when their pension schemes become capitalised.
Mr Pictet says the bank's private clients come from more than 60 countries
today, compared with only eight 30 years ago. Services are offered in 12
languages.
More recently, the firm has polished up its Swiss equity brokerage and
global custody departments to be internationally competitive. One impact of
this broadening of activities has been to reduce substantially the firm's
dependence on private banking for tax-evading Europeans. As many analysts
foresee growing pressures on Switzerland from its neighbours to give up tax
evaders, the move appears sensible.
Mr de Saussure says only that the partners are pleased with the broadening
because it has opened up much greater opportunities for growth. 'The pie is
growing, the portion of the pie that is going into asset management is
growing even faster. We can take a bigger market share and we have a strong
income with which to finance our growth,' he says.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (10): Pressure to consolidate - The
future of regional and cantonal banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's regional and cantonal banks continue to bear the brunt of the
pressure for consolidation in the country's banking industry. Both sectors
are now taking on new shapes to try to secure places in an increasingly
compet- itive, liberalised environment.
The regional and cantonal banks (the latter are owned and guaranteed by
cantonal govern- ments) have long played a role in the country's economic
life that goes beyond their size.
At the end of 1993, the cantonal banks accoun- ted for just over a fifth of
all banks' total assets, the regional banks 6.8 per cent. But together, they
provided more mortgage loans than the big universal banks that accounted for
half of the industry's total assets.
They are also key lenders to small and medium-sized businesses, bringing a
local sensitivity to the needs of entrepreneurs that the larger national
institutions sometimes lack.
However, excessive lending by many of these institutions in the easygoing
1980s led to a refinancing squeeze in the early 1990s when the Swiss
National Bank pushed up short- term interest rates to over 9 per cent.
The collapse of a small regional bank, the Spar-und Leihkasse Thun, in
October 1991 roused the Swiss to realise that this squeeze had reached
crisis proportions. The number of reg- ional banks tumbled from 185 at the
time of the Thun collapse to 138 in February of this year.
In the wake of the Thun affair, the banking fraternity, concerned about the
international image of the Swiss financial centre, put in place a rescue net
to prevent further fiascoes. All the subsequent departures have been either
due to agreed mergers or takeovers by other regional banks or by one of the
big universal banks.
However, this trend did not augur well for the future of the regional bank
movement. Last February, the sector's leaders tried to stop the rot by
proposing a new central organisation. It would aim at improving the
competitiveness of member banks by pooling their efforts in both financial
and infrastructure services.
Even more important, a central surveillance body would root out the problem
cases, providing the public with an assurance of the soundness of the member
banks.
The plan was widely welcomed, but even as members were being canvassed, more
were being gobbled up. By the time RBA Holding, the main central body, was
formed in September, only 98 banks with combined assets of SFr45bn were
willing and able to participate.
A few weeks later, RBA-Finanz, the surveillance body, was set up and has
been examining problem cases. By the end of the year, the old Union of
Regional Banks will be dissolved. Of those not joining the new RBA group, a
few believe they can carry on alone, but others are likely to disappear in
the near future.
The next steps are the creation of central financial and infrastructure
service organ- isations, which will enable the organisation to be up and
running at the beginning of next year.
Among cantonal banks, the same trends can be seen. The Berner Kantonalbank
has been the sector's biggest disaster case, having made large loans to
fugitive bankrupt financier Werner K. Rey in the 1980s. The cantonal
government had to inject new capital last year to prevent the bank from
collapsing.
This year, the Solothurner Kantonalbank has been in difficulty, and for the
first time, a private sector bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, has made a bid to
rescue it. The cantonal government and parliament have approved the sale,
recognising that it would cost SFr1.2bn to restructure it. In the usual
Swiss way, the people of Solothurn were to vote on the SBC bid on December
4.
Other cantonal governments, notably that of Zurich, are beginning to wonder
if there is still any need for them to back a bank, raising the possibility
of more privatisations in the near future.
Early this year, the two Geneva cantonal institutions, Banque hypothecaire
du canton de Geneve and Caisse d'epargne de la Republique et canton de
Geneve, merged, creating an institution with total assets of SFr14.7bn as at
the end of 1993.
In the canton of Vaud, Banque Cantonale Vaudoise and Credit Foncier Vaudois
agreed in October to merge next year, creating Switzer- land's fifth largest
bank with total assets of some SFr30bn and strengthening the position of
Lausanne as a regional financial centre.
Like the regional banks, the cantonal banks are trying to cut costs and
improve services through pooling of resources. Up to now, there have been
various ad hoc groupings for various purposes, but analysts expect two
constellations gradually to clarify.
One, for German-speaking Switzerland, will be built around the huge Zurcher
Kantonalbank, which had total assets of SFr52.5bn at the end of 1993, and
the other around the Banque Canton- ale Vaudoise.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (9): The real time breakthrough -
Progress in electronics on the stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next June, the Swiss stock market goes electronic.
Nothing particularly exciting about that, one might say. Stock exchanges
around the world have been doing that since the late 1960s when programmers
at the Toronto Stock Exchange discovered a way of making a computer behave
like an auctioneer.
The Swiss, it would seem, are slow as usual in adopting useful innovations.
That is true, but it is not the whole story. The Swiss have also achieved a
significant technical and practical advance to the design and operation of
electronic exchanges.
The Swiss exchange will be the first that carries out trading, settlement
and clearing in real time. This is no mean feat, as those in London involved
with the Taurus project, abandoned two years ago because of the technical
difficulties of integrating trading and settlement, would attest.
Its importance, apart from cost savings and reduction of the possibility for
errors, is that it removes the risk that a party to a transaction can suffer
significant losses because of delays in settlement. It also eliminates the
risk that one of the parties will default during the settlement period.
The Swiss hope that this feature alone will encourage traders to bring back
some of the volume in Swiss securities that has been carried over to other
exchanges, especially London's SEAQ International.
The other big benefit for traders that should come from the electronic
exchange is liquidity. At the moment, domestic trading is spread among three
exchanges in Zurich, Geneva and Basle. With improved liquidity, spreads
should narrow, providing better prices.
Mr Bernhard Sauer, project director, says there is already a double-digit
queue of foreign banks, led by Deutsche Bank of Germany, wanting to join the
new exchange. The directors decided last year not to accept any new members
until after the system was up and running.
Goldman Sachs of the US, the last bank to get through the door before this
freeze came into effect, is eagerly looking forward to the opening. 'We
think there will be a myriad of opportunities with the electronic exchange,'
says Mr Walter Haydock, general manager of Goldman Sachs Bank in Zurich.
'The Swiss market is fourth largest in Europe.'
There is much speculation about how the electronic exchange will affect
trading behaviour. The most important change will undoubtedly be a reduction
in the influence of certain brokers, particularly those of the three big
universal banks and Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank, on price movements.
The big three, Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank
Corporation, together account for more than half of all trading on the Swiss
exchanges today, with BZ Bank accounting for about a fifth.
In times of active markets, traders from other banks inevitably watch and
take their lead from the actions of these big players around the rings. This
gives the big banks extra power in the market.
By contrast, when they work on the electronic exchange, traders will not
necessarily know who is offering or buying shares. The decision to disclose
one's identity in a transaction is optional, and the expectation is that
most traders will not. 'A few may put their names up for macho reasons,' Mr
Sauer says.
Paradoxically, however, the electronic market will be more transparent than
the open outcry rings because dealers will be able to see all the orders
concerning a given security at any moment. On very large orders, a trader
will not have to reveal the full volume involved, but he will have to insert
a symbol indicating he aims to sell more than he has showing.
Mr Ebner, who opposed the conversion to an electronic system, fears that
without the atmosphere of a true market, volume on the new exchange will
decline and spreads will widen.
It also remains to be seen how much trading will take place off the
exchange. Members have agreed that only very large transactions can be
executed privately. Also, the big banks will no longer be allowed to
practise in-house clearing or delay reporting off exchange deals.
Mr Sauer says he would have preferred to see bankers obliged to put all
transactions through the exchange. 'But my theory is that if this exchange
turns out to be as efficient as we think it will be, then the clients will
want to come anyway.'
But will it all really happen? Are there still possibilities for hiccups
before next June? The designers, a team put together by the Swiss stock
exchanges themselves, are very confident that they can bring the system in
on time and within its SFr80m budget.
For one thing, the electronic settlement and clearing systems are already in
place. The only new element in the system is the exchange itself. For
another, the system has been up and running for several months already, and
comprehensive training programmes are under way.
Still, they are taking no chances. Last month, they agreed to delay the
introduction by 10 weeks to allow member firms more time to develop their
own software. And the introduction will be staggered, with foreign equities
being the first to go live on June 2, followed over the next few weeks by
Swiss shares and bonds.
Soffex futures and options are already traded electronically, and they will
be integrated into the new system in 1996, enabling users to do combined
trading between underlying securities and derivatives.
The larger economic consequences of the start-up of the new exchange are
difficult to assess. All three existing physical exchanges in Zurich, Basle
and Geneva will close.
Basle is likely to be hurt the most. Its most active members will simply
move to Zurich which is only an hour away. Geneva will lose the big bank
traders based in the city, as the big three will concentrate their forces in
Zurich. But leading Geneva banks, such as Pictet &amp; Cie, will pull back their
Zurich staffs to Geneva.
'It is good for Geneva,' says Mr Jacques de Saussure, a Pictet partner.
'Under the present system, Geneva was fighting a losing battle against
Zurich. Now we will have a more level playing field.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (6): Too weak to stand alone -
The aerospace industry faces formidable odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost unique among Japan's industries, aerospace has never been an
international contender. In a land of industrial leviathans, aerospace has
been a pygmy - the entire industry is just 8 per cent of the size of the US
aerospace industry and a third that of the UK.
Now, as the world's aircraft market creaks under the strains of
over-capacity, Japanese government and industry are making one more attempt
to get into the race with their European and American rivals.
In the summer, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry confirmed
that it had approved plans for the development of a new small civilian
airliner. The project, code-named YSX, will start in 1996 and is planned to
be in service by 2000.
Japan's aerospace industry has long been dependent on the nation's
relatively small defence forces for its staple business. Last year, more
than three-quarters of the aircraft manufacturers' Y850bn sales were
defence-related.
The small civilian sector consists principally of component manufacture for
US Boeing aircraft. But the end of the cold war threatens to cut military
demand and the industry is pinning its hopes on the new civilian airliner
project. If it succeeds it could open the way for the development of an
independent Japanese aerospace industry, but the odds are stacked against
it.
Japan is anxious to avoid repeating its previous experiences with civilian
aircraft. In 1962, the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation. a consortium
of the leading aircraft manufacturers, launched the YS-11, a 60-seat
twin-engined turboprop. After selling just 182 aircraft, the project
collapsed in 1972 in the face of a mountain of debts and recriminations.
A similar fate befell a short-take-off-and-landing craft called Asuka.
Both failed because customers were wary of risking buying expensive aircraft
from Japanese manufacturers with no track record.
The failures persuaded the government of the futility of building an
independent Japanese aircraft industry, and from then on it concentrated on
developing international links. That philosophy bore fruit as Japanese
manufacturers developed a role as a component base for Boeing aircraft.
Contracts to build 15 per cent of the Boeing 767, and 21 per cent of the new
777 that comes into service next year have helped build the nucleus of an
industry, albeit one confirmed to medium-level technology such as the
construction of wing-tips.
That dependence on international alliances is also behind the YSX.
Initially, the government had planned to develop a small 70-seat aircraft,
including possible involvement with European companies. But the YSX project
which succeeded it now seems certain to be built, again with US co-operation
from Boeing.
The collaboration will extend from manufacturing to marketing. While the
Japanese government will be responsible for marketing the aircraft
domestically, Boeing will sell it overseas.
The YSX, which will go into development in 1996 will have 90-100 seats -
making it slightly smaller than the Boeing 737 - and is expected to meet the
growing demand for regional aircraft, particularly in Asia.
Miti expects world demand of between 1,500 and 3,000 units in the first two
decades of the 21st century.
Unusually in a country where government subsidy for the aerospace industry
has been minimal, at least half of the research and development budget of
Y2bn will be met by the government.
Although the industry sees the project as a harbinger of a real aerospace
industry in Japan, critics are sceptical. 'It will remain the same as past
Japanese aerospace projects,' says one analyst. 'It will be essentially a
sub-contracting job.'
The principal aim of the YSX is to wean Japan's manufacturers off their
dependence on the defence business. Despite the country's growing acceptance
of an international role, the prospects for the domestic defence industry
are no better than anywhere else in the world. In fact most observers think
they are probably worse.
Japan has relied heavily on US technology for its airforce. Forbidden from
building aircraft for seven years after the second world war, the Japanese
manufacturers only started to put together an industry in 1952. Since then,
it has lacked the technological know-how to catch up with US and European
manufacturers. The vast majority of Japan's warplanes are US-built.
Aerospace as a whole is one of the few industries in which Japan runs a
substantial trade deficit - of nearly Y500bn a year.
The bulk of the small domestic industry is committed to producing US
equipment under licence for the Defence Agency. Only a handful of aircraft
have been built independently, such as the C-1 transport, the T-2 trainer
and the F-1 support fighter.
But in 1988 the Defence Agency announced plans to develop a new project, the
FSX, with support from the US, based on the F-16 fighter. The new aircraft
is scheduled to begin flights next summer, but orders are not expected to be
high, and limited production is planned.
It is unlikely even to be the successor for the F-15 aircraft, the principal
strike jet of the Japanese Air Force, since the Defence Agency itself is
thought likely to stick with a more reliable US fighter. And since Japan is
forbidden constitutionally from exporting military equipment, the prospects
for the fighter do not look appealing.
Japan will continue to look to space to develop the aerospace industry, but
there, too, competitive pressures mean the country's industry faces an
up-hill struggle. In February, the country's first home-produced rocket, the
H-2, was launched. The rocket, capable of carrying a two-tonne satellite,
was two years behind schedule and is even further behind its principal
competitors, the European Arianespace, and General Dynamics of the US in
cost and efficacy. At Y19bn a launch, it is more than 50 per cent more
expensive than the other two companies, and demand has so far been
uninspiring.
Japan's aerospace industry needs to look further afield than the small
domestic defence market that has been at its core for so long. The YSX is
the centrepiece of this new strategy. But the nature of the project - a
junior partnership in a US-led alliance, suggests that the Japanese
aerospace industry is still not strong enough to stand alone. In the
increasingly competitive market for aircraft, that will leave the country at
a chronic disadvantage.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (7): Inefficient structure -
Service industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors boarding a domestic flight at Haneda Airport in Tokyo will realise
that high technology in Japan does not necessarily mean rationalisation of
operations. At a ticket-cutting machine at the boarding gate, passengers
hand their ticket to an airline employee who inserts it into the machine,
then the stub is handed back to the passenger by another employee.
Such inefficiencies in Japan's service sector have been tolerated for
decades in the name of 'extra service'. Banks, for example, have several
employees standing at the door to greet customers, while 'elevator girls'
operate the elevators at leading department stores.
The economic implications have also been large because the sector has served
as a buffer for unemployment, providing extra jobs when the economic
conditions required it. Large manufacturing companies have tended to set up
subsidiaries in service sector industries where unwanted employees can be
shifted to.
However, the inefficient structure is now under fire because of deregulation
and increased competition. Although heavy government regulation and the
tolerance among consumers have helped maintain the low productivity of the
domestic service sector, pressure from foreign governments has lowered
barriers for new entrants while a new awareness of value is spreading among
Japanese consumers.
According to Bain, the consultancy group, the productivity gap between
service sector industries, including airlines, telecommunications, retail
banking, general merchandise, and restaurants in the US and Japan is as
large as 40 per cent. This gap, it said, had been 'subsidised' by Japanese
consumers, who were paying premium prices.
The changes are most apparent in the retail sector, where discounting has
become a new trend. Japanese consumers, many of whom have travelled
overseas, have started to question expensive domestic retail prices. The
downturn in the economy has also prompted consumers to tighten their belts
in search for value.
Deregulation of the large-scale retailing law, which controlled new store
openings in order to protect small retailers, has spurred the increase of
large supermarket chains' bulk purchasing power. The large-scale supermarket
chains are bypassing the multilayered wholesale network, which has kept
retail prices high, and are procuring merchandise directly from the
manufacturers or producers.
A stronger anti-trust law, put in place following demands by the US
government, has overturned the manufacturers' grip on retail prices. Large
manufacturers had controlled the retail prices and prevented discounting of
its products by threatening to stop supplies. However, electronics companies
including Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial, and leading breweries,
have been warned by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), Japan's anti-trust
watchdog, to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of
losing supply contracts.
McKinsey, the business consultants, believes that foreign retailers will now
be able to bring in their innovative organisation, management and marketing
skills which the traditional Japanese players lack.
With the rise in the yen prompting manufacturing industries to move
overseas, combined with a rapidly-ageing population, and further domestic
demand for added value, business leaders and many government officials see
the service sector as a key to further growth in the Japanese economy.
For this, says the Keidanren, the business lobby, deregulation of government
restrictions is essential. Deregulation will help the creation of new
businesses and improve productivity in the service sectors, including sport,
travel, telecommunications, multimedia and environmental businesses.
For example, the organisation estimates that deregulation of the
telecommunications business will help the market, whose size is presently
1.4 per cent of gross domestic product, to grow to 2.7 per cent - the
equivalent of that in the US - by the year 2000. This means the sector will
grow by some Y6,000bn and an extra 260,000 jobs will be created.
However, such changes may not come easily for some sectors of the service
industry. Some branches of the government and some politicians are keen to
protect certain interests and are the stumbling blocks to increasing the
competitiveness within sectors which have traditionally been heavily
regulated.
The airline industry met heavy opposition from Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport
minister, when it tried to lower costs by hiring air hostesses on a contract
basis. Although Mr Kamei finally approved the move, he had strongly opposed
it on grounds of safety, claiming that the contract employees would not be
able to co-operate with other air hostesses in an emergency.
Innovation has also been restricted within the retail banking sector due to
heavy regulation by the Ministry of Finance and self censorship among the
banks. A new deposit account introduced by Jonan Shinkin, a large credit
association, which comes with a chance of winning a Y50,000 lottery,
recently caused an uproar within the industry and an investigation by the
regulators.
So far, with backing from the FTC and popular support from the public, Jonan
has remained unscathed. However, the frenzied reaction which Jonan provoked
within the financial sector and the ministry of finance, may have prompted
other institutions trying to introduce competitive products to think twice.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (5): Economy pauses for breath / A
look at the reasons for the slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a strong recovery in the first half of this year the Swiss economy is
taking a breather. Most economic forecasters see this as merely a pause
before more rapid growth next year - but some fear it signifies a more
durable lack of stamina.
The ascent of the Swiss franc this year, especially against the dollar, has
knocked company profits, provoked squeals of pain from industry and
reinforced concerns about Switzerland's long-term 'de-industrialisation'.
Meanwhile, much of the government's 'economic revitalisation' programme,
launched after voters rejected Swiss membership of the 17-nation European
Economic Area in December 1992, is still on the drawing board. Ministers are
also struggling with mixed success to mend tattered federal finances.
On the face of it, the economy looks in reasonable shape after emerging from
three years of recession, the longest since the war. National output touched
bottom in mid-1993 and grew 2.3 per cent over the following 12 months.
Investment in private housing and business equipment has bounded ahead,
though industrial and commercial building remains depressed.
Exports have been buoyant, boosted by renewed growth in Europe and
especially in Germany which alone accounts for a third of Swiss goods sent
abroad. Switzerland's habitual balance of payments surplus set a new record
last year of SFr27bn or 7.8 per cent of gross domestic product.
Inflation is expected to average under 1 per cent this year, an eight-year
low. Registered unemployment, which reached a post-war high in January at
over 188,000 - 5.2 per cent of the workforce - has since fallen steadily to
below 160,000.
The economic slowdown this autumn has been blamed on the postponement of
investment into next year to take advantage of the new value added tax to be
introduced in January. Under VAT, businesses will be able to recoup tax on
investment goods which they cannot do under the present sales tax.
The majority of forecasters are predicting export- and investment-led
economic growth of 2.25-2.5 per cent next year, up from about 1.5 per cent
in 1994.
Some, however, such as Mr Hans Kaufmann of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich,
believe the pause shows that industry is already being priced out of export
and domestic markets by the resurgent Swiss franc. Bank Baer has accordingly
slashed its growth forecast for next year from 2.5 per cent to just 1.7 per
cent.
Other clouds on the 1995 horizon are the uptick in inflation from the
changeover to VAT, which could add 1.5-1.75 per cent to the consumer price
index. Inflation is generally expected to average about 2.5 per cent next
year, keeping real household incomes and spending subdued. Higher
unemployment insurance contributions and a possible rise in mortgage
interest rates will also have a dampening effect.
Meanwhile, government spending is being restrained by the need to cut the
budget deficit, now running at about 4.5 per cent of GDP for central and
local government together. The federal deficit this year is put at just
under SFr7bn, after a record SFr7.8bn in 1993.
Heroic attempts to cut spending and raise extra revenues will still leave a
projected gap next year of SFr6.5bn and smaller but still substantial
deficits in future years.
Although these deficits are not high by European standards, they are still
worrying for a government which is used to balancing the books and which
must submit key tax decisions to the electorate.
For industry, however, the overriding concern is the strong Swiss franc.
Largely reflecting its traditional haven role at times of political and
economic uncertainty, it rose nearly 16 per cent against the dollar in the
first 10 months of 1994, coming close to record highs touched two years ago.
The impact on profit margins has been dire, prompting 80 small and
medium-sized companies in October to appeal for an easier monetary policy to
cap the currency. But the Swiss National Bank, one of Europe's most fiercely
independent central banks, says it has no intention of relaxing its tight
monetary stance intended to keep inflation low.
'I don't think a relaxation of the monetary reins would be in the interests
of the export industry in the medium term,' Mr Markus Lusser, SNB president,
said in October, arguing that it would risk rekindling inflation which would
itself harm competitiveness.
Indeed, many economists, including those of the OECD in Paris, believe the
strong franc has paradoxically helped to boost the competitiveness of Swiss
industry by forcing companies to cut costs and restructure production.
Since 1991 rapid productivity growth has led to a fall in unit labour costs,
making Switzerland more cost-competitive against key trading partners. And
on most counts Switzerland still ranks among the world's most competitive
economies, according to the latest report by the International Institute for
Management Development and the World Economic Forum.
The downside has been a 6 per cent drop in employment between 1992 and 1994.
Unemployment, almost unknown for most of the post-war period, is set to
become a permanent feature of the Swiss economic landscape though it remains
well below that of neighbouring countries.
At the same time, Swiss firms have been creating jobs abroad, not only in
mass-production facilities but also, more worryingly, in high-tech
activities.
Mr Thomas Gasser, president of the Swiss Machinery Manufacturers'
Association, points out that half the research and development spending of
Swiss industry is now directed overseas, and that the production jobs that
go with it are very unlikely to migrate back to Switzerland.
Switzerland's December 1992 vote on the EEA has also removed much of its
attraction for foreigners who might otherwise have found it an easy stepping
stone into the European single market. Foreign direct investment in
Switzerland, which was running at between SFr3bn and SFr6bn before 1992,
fell to just SFr0.1bn in 1993.
Meanwhile, to industry's dismay, the government's 'economic revitalisation'
programme remains incom- plete, with delays affecting all three planks of
the programme.
Switzerland's slow-moving legislative procedures mean the Gatt world trade
pact will not be ratified until the middle of next year, months after other
nations have done so. Bilateral negotiations with the EU on such issues as
transport, research and public procurement finally begin this month but are
likely to be protracted.
Important measures to stiffen competition and improve efficiency in the
domestic market, notably by tackling Switzerland's numerous cartels, have
yet to be considered by parliament.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (6): Draught through a cosy world -
Insurance / A deregulated market faces competition from abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times are changing in the once-staid and tightly-controlled Swiss insurance
market in the wake of increasing deregulation and intensified competition in
Europe.
Switzerland's biggest insurers have recently taken aggressive steps to
solidify their presence at home and in world markets. Meanwhile, foreign
companies have begun to muscle in on the SFr30bn-a-year domestic insurance
scene - not easy in a market which, after years of cosy informal
cartellisation between Swiss companies, is one of the most concentrated in
Europe.
In parallel with the elimination last July of barriers to insurance business
within the European Union, tariffs in most life and non-life sectors in
Switzerland have now been freed. Fixed tariffs for compulsory third party
motor insurance will be scrapped from January 1996.
Though the Swiss market remains profitable - the Swiss are the world's
biggest spenders on insurance, laying out a staggering Dollars 3,000 a year
each on premiums - it no longer provides the secure financial padding of
old. Swiss insurers, like their European counterparts, are looking both to
cut costs and to focus more selectively on profitable market opportunities
rather than premium volume growth for its own sake.
That, in turn, means producing new and better products and selling them
effectively. Those best suited to prosper in the new environment, analysts
believe, will be the big diversified insurance companies with efficient
distribution networks and low costs, along with specialist niche players.
For medium-sized companies with undifferentiated products, the prospects
look dim.
This was the reasoning behind the surprise announcement last September by
Swiss Re, the world's second-ranking reinsurer, to sell off its direct
insurance operations to Allianz, the German insurance giant, and Winterthur,
the biggest insurer in the Swiss market.
The deal, worth more than SFr5.3bn, will 'almost halve' the 48 per cent of
Swiss Re's total premium income from primary insurance operations. The
company is now free to concentrate on its more volatile but highly
profitable core reinsurance business.
Zurich Insurance and Winterthur, Switzerland's largest primary insurers, are
seen as well-placed to take advantage of deregulation at home and abroad.
Zurich already does three-quarters of its business overseas (a quarter in
the US) and Winterthur over half, mostly in Europe.
That has not stopped them slugging it out in Switzerland's newly-liberalised
SFr4bn-a-year motor insurance market. That business is about to be
transformed, after years in which standard policies - often for five- or
10-year terms - were sold to customers by a network of local agents.
Last spring Winterthur, the market leader, unveiled a new 'modular' car
insurance policy, the 'Strada', allowing customers to choose their cover a
la carte. This was quickly trumped by Zurich Insurance which in July
launched Zuritel, Switzerland's first cut-priced motor insurance telephone
sales operation.
Zurich sees Zuritel as a forerunner for direct selling operations elsewhere
in Europe and in other branches of insurance. Some 20-50 per cent of
insurance contracts in Europe may be sold in future by telephone or
interactive television, the company believes.
Zurich is already having considerable success with direct sales by its
newly-acquired British subsidiary, Zurich Municipal, which specialises in
local authority insurance. Winterthur was an even earlier pioneer in direct
telephone sales through Churchill, now Britain's second largest motor
insurer.
Smaller Swiss companies have also shown themselves game for a fight. La
Baloise, Switzerland's fourth largest insurer, announced a deal this summer
with the Swiss Touring Club to offer cheap motor insurance to its 1.3m
members - half of Switzerland's motorists.
Elsewhere, a significant move was Zurich's acquisition in September of a
bank, Zurich-based Rud, Blass, which specialises in securities trading,
broker business and investment consulting. The company plans to use the bank
to expand its asset management services, now that liberalisation of life
insurance regulations allows insurers to offer investment trust-linked life
insurance policies.
Winterthur, meanwhile, has been buttressing its European operations. In
January it succeeded at its third attempt to secure a significant slice of
the huge and fast-growing German market. A complex deal with Commerzbank
gave it control of DBV (Deutsche Beamten-Versicherungskasse), making
Winterthur Germany's 10th biggest primary insurer.
Then in September Winterthur strengthened its position in southern Europe,
agreeing to buy for SFr355m Swiss Re's direct insurance operations in Italy
and Spain plus its stake (via its Elvia subsidiary) in the Spanish group La
Equitativa.
Though Swiss insurance companies employ nearly twice as many people abroad
as at home - 87,935 against 48,319 in Switzerland at the end of last year -
the domestic market has been a Swiss preserve. Foreign companies had a
meagre 2 per cent of premium business in 1992. Next year that proportion
could be over 10 per cent.
The biggest foreign invader has been Germany's Allianz, Europe's largest
insurer. At the start of the year, Allianz owned two small Swiss insurance
companies with a combined premium income in 1993 of just SFr270m. But in
June Allianz bought a stake of over 30 per cent in the Berner insurance
group, a medium-sized company with 1993 premium income of just over SFr1bn
and a 5 per cent share of the Swiss non-life market.
And in September it snapped up an even juicier morsel - Swiss Re's Elvia,
Switzerland's fifth biggest direct insurer with 9 per cent of the domestic
market and premium income of SFr2.6bn last year. Allianz is also buying from
Swiss Re the Vereinte Group (ranked fifth in Germany with nearly SFr5.9bn in
annual premium income) and an Italian company, Lloyd Adriatico. Elvia and
Lloyd Adriatico will be acquired through Allianz's Italian subsidiary,
Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS).
Earlier, Assicurazioni Generali of Italy gained a controlling stake in
Fortuna, a small Swiss company mainly active in life insurance, and Alte
Leipziger of Germany took a 10 per cent stake in Helvetia as part of a
co-operation deal.
On the domestic front, too, Switzerland's medium-sized companies are
increasingly turning to partnerships to help them compete effectively.
Helvetia and Patria have strengthened their co-operation over the past year,
as have Swiss Life and La Mobiliere, both mutual companies and respective
Swiss market leaders in life and non-life insurance.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (7): Fund managers stay healthy - In
private banking, the country is undisputed world leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there were any doubts about the importance of private banking to the
Swiss financial centre, they have been dispelled this year.
At a time when profits from securities trading have been depressed by
unexpected market turns, when new issue activity has been minimal, when
margins on lending remain under heavy pressure, it is once again the
commissions and fees from fund management - mainly for wealthy private
clients - that are keeping many Swiss banks healthy.
Take Swiss Bank Corporation, for example. Its pretax profits slid 45 per
cent in the first half of this year, but commission income was up 11 per
cent to SFr1.34bn. At Union Bank of Switzerland, it was the same story, with
pretax profit off 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn but commission income up 10.8
per cent to SFr2.14bn.
Although the big three universal banks rank among the world's largest
portfolio managers, private banking represents only roughly a third of their
activities. For many other Swiss banks, and virtually all of the foreign
bank outlets except the Japanese in the country, it is vital.
For example, at Vontobel, the Zurich family-controlled bank, 55 per cent of
consolidated operating income came from commissions last year, and most of
the rest of earnings from lending and trading were generated from the
private banking business.
Switzerland remains the undisputed world leader in the international private
banking sector. Mr Bruno Gehrig, professor at the Swiss Institute for
Banking and Finance at St Gallen, has recently revised upward his estimate
of the total volume of funds held under management in the country to about
SFr3,000bn.
Bankers generally agree this represents about 40 per cent of all funds held
by investors outside their home countries.
In the past few years, leading banks from many countries have looked
increasingly covetously on the international private banking business, and
many have either moved into it or invigorated existing units.
Mr Raymond Baer, a director of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, says this is not
a surprising trend. 'It is true that this is an attractive business in the
long term. If you have a stable base, you can get a stable, more or less
riskless income. And we are all looking for that because the quality of
earnings from other banking activities is declining,' Mr Baer explains.
Another advantage of this business, and one which is probably to the fore in
a year when financial markets have been depressed, is that most clients are
unlikely to make a fuss even if they feel that their funds have not been
well managed. This is because they do not want to draw the attention of
their home tax authority to the existence of their Swiss accounts.
At first glance, the influx of non-Swiss banks to international private
banking might appear to be a threat to Switzerland's domination. In fact,
however, such is the reputation of the country in this sector that most of
the newcomers feel the need to have an outlet there.
Mr Walter Haydock, general manager of Goldman Sachs Bank in Geneva, which
opened recently, says a base in Switzerland is essential for anyone
seriously committed to international private banking.
'We like the infrastructure, the tradition and the high quality investing
talent,' he says. 'Clients do not come here just for bank secrecy.'
A more interesting question is whether an increase in competition from
foreign rivals is a threat to the Swiss private banks.
The Swiss themselves seem fairly relaxed, claiming that there have been
periods in the past when foreign banks became interested in private banking,
but soon retreated.
Banks that are not prepared to wait at least seven years for success should
not even start, Mr Baer advises. 'How many who enter this business are
really willing to do that?' he asks.
Other Swiss private bankers argue that the increased foreign presence in
Switzerland is an entirely positive phenomenon, apart from the pressure it
puts on personnel costs.
'The day they are no longer interested in Switzerland I would be worried,'
says Mr Thierry Lombard, a managing partner of Lombard, Odier in Geneva.
Foreign banks bring new ideas and prevent the Swiss from becoming insular,
he says.
Mr Jacques de Saussure, a managing partner of Pictet in Geneva, adds that
the foreign banks introduce new clients to the Swiss market. 'Gradually,
these people may become clients of ours, too.'
For all its present attractions as a private banking centre, Switzerland's
future in this sector is not altogether secure.
The banking community has been totally supportive of efforts to put into
place a series of measures in recent years to discourage and prosecute money
laundering and funds with criminal connections.
However, the country's bank secrecy law, which is a main attraction for
foreign investors, has inevitably been weakened in the process. The Swiss
will still not co-operate with investigations by foreign authorities into
cases of tax evasion. This is because tax evasion is a civil offence in
Switzerland, but not a criminal offence. However, they will now co-operate
in cases of tax fraud.
Also, a few months ago, Mrs Carla del Ponte, the Swiss federal prosecutor,
passed on a request to the country's banks on behalf of the Italian
authorities for information on the accounts of a number of Italian nationals
suspected of involvement in drug money laundering.
Swiss bankers balked at this request, saying it was too general and made at
too early a stage in the investigations. Normally, legal assistance is
provided only in cases where individuals have been duly charged with a
criminal offence.
'If this is allowed, then anyone can ask for anything,' one Swiss banker
said following the request. The Swiss Bankers' Association has appealed to
the federal cabinet to block it.
In the longer term, the Swiss may also have to face pressure from the
European Union to desist from harbouring its tax evaders. As the average age
of EU citizens advances, tax revenues of member countries are going to be
squeezed anyway, so they will become more resentful of an aloof neighbour
that seems to profit from the stresses that they suffer.

Cost reductions by Japan's largest manufacturing companies during the
rigours of recession have come partly at the expense of their armies of
sub-contractors.
Industrial heavyweights such as Toyota and Matsushita have been demanding
sharp price cuts and encouraging suppliers to seek new customers as they
scale back their own production and strive to reduce break-even points. They
have kept up the pressure, even into the mild recovery.
Nearly two-thirds of Japan's biggest industrial customers have increased
in-house production of components in an attempt to reduce costs over the
past year, while a third have reduced their number of suppliers, according
to the latest white paper on small businesses from the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
Some sub-contractors have been left high and dry by the shift of industrial
production overseas, to 6.6 per cent of manufacturing output last year, more
than double the level in the mid-1980s, according to the Japan Research
Institute.
In many cases, the pressure on small suppliers' sales and margins has been
intolerable. For the first time in post-war years, the number of business
collapses exceeded start-ups just after the onset of the economic downturn
in 1991. Bankruptcies, of which small manufacturing sub-contractors formed
the majority, continued to rise until last July, when Japan's slow economic
recovery began to ease the pressure.
The survivors have prevailed by screwing down their own costs, as shown by
the contrasting experience of three sub-contractors around Osaka, the
heartland of Japan's electronics industry. They hold very different ranks in
Japan's feudal-style industrial structure, but they share one thing; the
realisation that near-total dependence on a single large client is not the
guarantee of survival it used to be for most of Japan's post-1950s economic
expansion.
The largest and most successful of them, Showa Plastics, a 2,200-employee
producer of plastic casings, with a head office in central Osaka, has been
entrepreneurial enough to follow its customers to cheaper locations
overseas. It has closed more than half its domestic production over the past
five years and relocated next to its Japanese buyers' new overseas plants in
Asia, the US and Europe.
Showa is a member of the family of more than 6,000 local companies serving
Osaka-based Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics group. The
electronics giant has shifted about 60 per cent of what used to be its local
component purchasing offshore, mainly into neighbouring Asian countries,
since the early 1980s.
All of Showa's main customers have followed the same pattern. 'Toshiba,
Hitachi and Sony are more willing to buy from me in Singapore than in Tokyo.
They won't even see me in Tokyo,' says Showa Plastics' president, Mr Kenzo
Nakagawa.
In the past five years, Showa has closed four of its eight Japanese plants
and reduced its domestic workforce from 550 to 150. This is unusually
aggressive restructuring by the standards of Showa's Japanese competitors,
who pride themselves on not cutting jobs.
Showa's rapid foreign expansion has helped it to broaden its client base, so
that the top three customers now account for 40 per cent of sales, from 75
per cent in the mid-1980s. But the most important benefit of moving
production out of Japan is to protect Showa from the yen's inexorable rise.
Showa's prices have fallen by 30 per cent over the past four years. But unit
costs have also fallen, helped by the decline in foreign currencies against
the yen, far enough for Showa to increase its profits throughout the
downturn.
Takizawa Precision Gear, a 14-staff producer of machine tool gears, has
taken a more traditional approach to the squeeze imposed by its clients by
staying put and stepping up the search for internal self-improvement.
'Customers are less loyal than in old times,' mourns Mr Kiyoshi Takizawa,
president of the Takizawa Precision Gear.
Mr Takizawa devotes 40 per cent of annual sales to his top three customers.
That is a big enough exposure to make it impossible to resist their demands
for price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for the past
four years, he says.
Sales have shrunk from Y300m to Y200m over the same period, perilously close
to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point. Instead of sacking his tiny workforce,
Mr Takizawa has increased spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip
with Swiss machine tools and carried out an engineering cost analysis.
He justifies sticking to the old invest-or-die approach on the grounds that
Takizawa has few foreign competitors, allowing him to market more on quality
than on price. But Mr Takizawa admits that 'there is nothing we can do' if
the Japanese market continues to shrink.
Nearby, Meisei Metal Industries, a 140-staff maker of metal dies for the car
industry, has joined forces with other sub-contractors, to seek economies of
scale. Meisei's top three customers account for 85 per cent of sales and the
group has had to accept price cuts as high as 30 per cent this year, as a
result of which it has fallen into loss for the first time since the
economic downturn began.
It formed a joint company two years ago with three other sub-contractors to
service a joint customer, a car group. The sub-contracting group, called
Must, after the initial letters of its company members, saves costs by
pooling design, marketing and finance. This also saves costs for the
customer, by reducing the number of suppliers it has to handle. Several of
Meisei's competitors have adopted the same strategy and Meisei itself may
launch Must-type groups for other important customers.
Mergers between car industry sub-contractors will inevitably increase,
believes Mr Yozo Ueda, Meisei's vice-president. He estimates that up to 30
per cent of his competitors will go out of business 'sooner or later.'
If he is right, Japan's manufacturing sub-contractors will come into the
economic upturn late, as their big customers continue to squeeze prices, to
ensure their own recovery. It supports the widespread assumption that the
general economic recovery will be painfully slow.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (4): Yen's rise curbs consumer
appetites - The motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in its history, Keidanren, Japan's most influential
business organisation, welcomed a member of the motor industry as chairman
earlier this year.
The appointment of Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, to the head of
Keidanren was widely seen at the time as a signal of recognition that
Japan's vehicle industry was at last worthy of representing the Japanese
business establishment.
Ironically, that recognition has come just as the Japanese vehicle industry
has faced one of the most trying periods in its history.
It is not just that a four-year economic slump has brought about a 17 per
cent fall in new vehicle sales in Japan from 7.8m units in 1990 to 6.5m
units last year. More fundamentally, the Japanese market is not expected to
provide its vehicle makers with the kind of growth they had become used to
since the late 1980s.
While demand has recovered in the past several months and is likely to
continue to improve, the domestic market, which grew 5 per cent in 1987 and
by an average 9 per cent in the following three years, is only expected to
show growth of 1 to 2 per cent for the foreseeable future, notes Mr Yutaka
Kume, chairman of Nissan.
Japan's falling population growth, inadequate infrastructure and the growing
cost-consciousness of consumers make it unlikely that the home market will
expand significantly in future, he says.
Overseas, the yen's sharp rise against leading currencies, and the improved
competitiveness of US vehicle makers, has curbed consumer appetite for
Japanese cars in both the US and Europe.
In the US, Japanese vehicle manufacturers have seen their share of the
market slump as Japanese cars have become more expensive due to the
appreciation of the yen and as US consumers have embraced the improved
quality of cars made by domestic manufacturers.
At the same time, the yen's appreciation has slashed the value of their
profits made overseas. Honda, which reported a rise in first-half pre-tax
profits for the first time in four years, said that the yen's rise had
shaved Y39bn off operating profits.
The high value of the yen has also helped the manufacturers' foreign
competitors make inroads in the domestic market by cutting their prices to
bring them within reach of a wider customer base. The share of imported cars
in Japan's vehicle market has grown each month for the past year and rose to
more than 10 per cent for the first time in August, although the figures
include Japanese reverse imports.
Japanese vehicle manufacturers have responded to these multiple pressures by
cutting costs across the board. Companies have increased the commonality of
parts between different models and, in many cases, reduced the range of
models they turn out. Mazda and Nissan, for example, two of the worst
performers in recent years which both reported losses in the first half of
1994, are supplying each other with pick-ups and vans.
Personnel costs are being cut by trimming or even freezing recruitment while
sub-contractors are being squeezed on parts prices.
Such belt-tightening has started to show in the vehicle makers' financial
performances. Honda more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first half,
helped in part by savings of Y36.5bn through cost-cutting. But these
measures are insufficient to counter fully the falling profitability of
their overseas operations and the loss in their international
cost-competitiveness.
Japan has become one of the most expensive manufacturing bases in the world.
Meanwhile, with the domestic market unlikely to provide substantial growth
in the years ahead, Japanese vehicle makers are becoming more dependent on
overseas markets for growth. The majority of Japanese vehicle manufacturers
sell more cars overseas than they do at home. The ratio of overseas sales is
as high as 70 per cent for Honda and 66 per cent for Mazda.
Calls by foreign governments to increase local production and local
procurement of vehicle parts, is also putting pressure on Japanese vehicle
makers to reduce their dependence on exports from Japan.
Against this background, Japanese companies believe they have little choice
but to accelerate the shift of production outside of Japan both to counter
the effects of the high yen and to be closer to overseas markets which are
becoming increasingly important for their survival.
Toyota, for example, plans to raise production in North America by 50 per
cent by 1996. It announced recently that it will stop exporting its mainline
Corolla sedans to North America and rely on its Canadian plant to
manufacture the cars instead.
Moving production outside of Japan is a difficult step for any Japanese
company: it exposes them to public criticism that they are taking jobs away
from domestic workers and contributing to the hollowing out of the nation's
industrial base. For the vehicle manufacturers, the decision to shift
production overseas is made even more difficult at this time, because most
of them made substantial capital investments in the late 1980s.
The increased shift of production overseas will mean a further drop in
domestic production which has already fallen 18 per cent to 11.2m units
since peaking at 13.5m units in 1990. Domestic production is now almost down
to the same level as it was 10 years ago, Mr Kume points out.
This year, helped by an income tax cut and a moderate recovery in the
Japanese economy, vehicle sales have started to pick up. The likelihood is
that demand will continue to firm next year as well. But the recovery at
home is not expected to fundamentally change the need for restructuring in
the domestic industry.
'The problem that the Japanese auto industry has is coming to terms with the
fact that they won't be needing so much capacity here,' says Mr Andrew
Blair-Smith, industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
Executives of Japan's leading vehicle companies recognise the problem but
are hoping that they will be able to deal with overcapacity without massive
lay-offs by spreading the pain over several years.
Meanwhile, the march into markets overseas will continue as Japanese
companies seek opportunities for growth which they no longer expect to find
at home.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (2): A bad year for the big three -
The problems facing the country's top banking groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Switzerland's three big banking groups, CS Holding, Swiss Bank
Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland, 1994 will go down as a year they
would rather forget.
This not just or even mainly because of the epic row that the UBS board and
manage- ment have been fighting with the bank's largest and most critical
shareholder, BK Vision. Rather, it is because of the startling fall in their
earnings performance from the record levels achieved last year, and the
subsequent questions raised about the quality of their management and
earnings.
On the common basis of profits before taxes and provisions, the UBS result
in the first half was down 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn, Swiss Bank
Corporation down 45.1 per cent to SFr1.19bn and CS Holding, the group built
around Credit Suisse, off 30 per cent to SFr1.97bn.
The main cause of these profit slides has been big declines in income from
trading, the money the banks make from dealing in foreign currencies and
trading in bonds, shares and other securities for their own account.
UBS was hit hardest, with a 68 per cent plunge in trading income to SFr493m,
and SBC was not far behind with a 63 per cent fall to SFr537m. CS profit on
trading was down 43 per cent to SFr1.27bn.
The banks' leaders have been quick to point out that many of their
international rivals, including JP Morgan of the US and SG Warburg of
Britain, fared far worse in the difficult conditions that have prevailed in
global securities markets this year.
Nevertheless, analysts have concluded that the overall quality of the banks'
earnings is not what it used to be when trading formed a smaller part of
their overall profits. And that has been a main reason for a downward
rerating of their shares.
Bank Julius Baer, for example, sees the current prices of CS Holding as only
10.3 times projected 1995 earnings, about half a point lower than its rating
a year ago. SBC has been similarly downgraded to 8.2 times. Baer's rating of
UBS has held firm at 12.1 times, but that was distorted by the effect of the
recent proxy battle.
The banks themselves insist that the sharp decline in their trading results
this year is within tolerable limits. It looks particularly bad, they argue,
because last year was an exceptionally profitable year in this volatile
area.
They also say that they have little choice but to be involved in
sophisticated derivative markets if they are to continue to be active in
international corporate banking.
The potential for that business is also coming under question. In the past
few years, Swiss banks had a relatively easy time because many big American
and Japanese banks had retreated from the field. Now they are returning, and
competition will become tougher.
The other disappointment this year has been in the domestic commercial
banking market. There were hopes after the takeover by Credit Suisse of
Swiss Volksbank last year that competitive pressures would ease and margins
on retail and commercial lending could rise to profitable levels.
However, this does not appear to have happened. The continuing rapid
consolidation in the regional bank sector has, if anything, intensified the
struggle for market share among the big banks.
CS was again the main player in this process, with its SFr905.6m rescue
package and agreed takeover bid for Neue Aargauer Bank (NAB), Switzerland's
largest regional bank, in September.
To make matters worse, both SBC and CS acknowledged that in the third
quarter their hitherto resilient commission businesses, based mainly on
their large portfolio management activities, had also weakened.
This altogether unsatisfactory performance created a useful background for
the extraordinary challenge by Mr Martin Ebner over the overall corporate
governance of UBS.
Whatever the ultimate result of the confrontation between Mr Ebner and the
UBS board, it is already clear that it will have a big impact on the future
of all three big banks.
When UBS announced that it would eliminate its registered shares and create
a single class of bearer shares with no restrictions, it said this would be
a move that would be followed by other Swiss banks and companies.
Both CS and SBC have two classes of shares and even more severe restrictions
on voting them than UBS. At CS, no one can vote more than 2 per cent of the
shares. At SBC, only Swiss citizens and legal entities with residence in
Switzerland and Swiss control can vote up to a maximum of 5 per cent of the
total share capital.
Paradoxically, while UBS removed its restrictions to see off a challenge to
its governance from dissident shareholders, CS and SBC will probably want to
achieve the same end by retaining such curbs.
CS has served its shareholders no better than UBS in the past decade and SBC
has done much worse (see chart). But because of the voting restrictions, it
would be very difficult for anyone to rally enough shares to put real
pressure on the directors of these banks.
Nevertheless, it will also become increasingly hard for the banks' directors
to justify retaining the restrictions. As UBS pointed out, there will soon
be other ways of ensuring that ownership does not fall into undesirable
hands.
From January 1, banking law provisions, which restrict the use of the word
'Swiss' in bank names, will be altered. Until now, a bank has had to prove
that at least half its capital is held by Swiss interests. Henceforth, only
voting interests of more than 10 per cent will be taken into account.
Moreover, the law will for the first time oblige shareholders to notify the
Swiss Banking Commission if and when they acquire stakes of more than 10 per
cent, 20 per cent, 33 per cent and 50 per cent.
The commission will have the right to suspend the voting rights of large
shareholders if it considers their influence would hurt the proper conduct
of the bank's management.
A liberalisation earlier this year of the law restricting foreign ownership
of Swiss property (and further steps pending) also makes it less important
for the banks to be able to prove majority Swiss ownership.
CS refuses to comment on the possible removal of voting restrictions, and
SBC says no changes are foreseen. However, it is clear they have seen the
signals. Mr Peter Wuffli, chief financial officer at SBC, said in a speech
three days after the UBS vote that the bank was trying to transform itself,
putting more emphasis on value for shareholders and less on the size of its
balance sheet.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (3): Biotechnology's new champion /
Profile of Bank am Bellevue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was probably inevitable that Mr Martin Ebner's highly successful BZ
banking group, in the headlines recently over its epic tussle with the board
of Union Bank of Switzerland, would attract imitators.
So far, the most conspicuous one is the Bellevue group, built around a small
brokerage house, Bank am Bellevue, established a year and a half ago in
Zurich.
Like BZ, Bank am Bellevue's offices are in open plan on the top floor of a
building that houses a downmarket department store. Like BZ, it operates
with only a skeleton staff and concentrates on rigorous financial analysis
of top quoted companies for a small number of large institutional clients.
These similarities are not accidental. BB, as it has become known, was
formed by Mr Ernst Muller-Mohl and Mr Martin Bisang, former directors of BZ,
and Mr Jorg Graf, Mr Ebner's successor as head of research at Bank J.
Vontobel.
Their view was that there were still great opportunities for revaluation of
many leading Swiss equities, partly as a result of the companies becoming
more transparent about their affairs, partly because of an increase by Swiss
institutions in their allocation of funds to equities and partly due to
industrial restructuring.
The Bellevue brokerage business, with a staff of 18, was an immediate
success, achieving a net income of SFr6m in its first five months of
existence to the end of 1993.
Also like BZ, the Bellevue group has diversified into investment fund
management and sees there its greatest potential. Indeed, it achieved
international notice earlier this year when its BB Biotech fund disclosed
that its stake, in Biogen, a leading US biotechnology company, had exceeded
5 per cent.
BB Biotech was set up by Bellevue last autumn in response to its Swiss
clients' demands for a vehicle that would give them exposure to the most
exciting part of the pharmaceutical industry without having to take the more
humdrum part as well.
The fund's strategy - again similar to that practised by BZ funds - has been
to focus on only a small number of pure biotechnology stocks. And Bellevue
has used the limited company as a structure rather than an open or closed
end trust.
Mr Bisang, who now heads Bellevue Asset Management, the group's asset
management arm, says the advantages of the limited company are that the
shares can be listed and traded like those of any other company and there
has to be a clearly identifiable responsible board. The main disadvantage,
tax liability for income and capital gains, can be minimised, he says.
The initial public offering of shares in BB Biotech attracted SFr325m and
the fund raised a further SFr150m in February through a free warrants rights
issue, making it one of the world's biggest funds devoted to biotechnology
stocks.
At the end of August, nearly two-thirds of its money was invested in only
two US stocks, Biogen and Genentech, with the remainder in Amgen and a small
new stake in Affymax, a California-based leader in combinatorial chemistry.
In common with the whole biotechnology sector, the shares have weakened in
recent months, but have remained well above both the average of US
pharmaceutical shares and the CBOE biotech index, in spite of the strength
of the Swiss franc against the dollar.
Mr Bisang says BB Biotech will in future allocate up to 20 per cent of its
funds to second tier companies, mainly through participating in private
placements.
Last summer, Bellevue Asset Management set up a second fund, BB Industrie
Holding, showing its interest in Swiss industrial restructurings. Its first
stakes were in companies specialising in textile machinery and office
building controls systems, both sectors where the potential for
consolidation among Swiss players is considerable.
The Bellevue group does not object to comparisons with the BZ group, but
likes to think of itself as a step or two ahead of its mentor towards
investor friendliness and transparency.
The identities of the investors in the group - all are directors or
employees - are disclosed and both the boards and the management of the
brokerage house and the asset management arm are kept separate.
All the group companies have a single class share structure whereas BZ
entities have dual class structures, giving the core shareholders greater
voting power with less investment than other shareholders.
Bellevue also has rather more distinguished external experts on its boards
than does BZ. Mr David Baltimore, a Nobel prize winning biotechnology
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sits on the BB
Biotech board. Dr Ernst Thomke, one of the developers of the Swatch watch,
sits on the BB Industrie board.
Mr Bisang, who heads Bellevue Asset Management, says the group has many more
ideas for funds, but is waiting until market conditions are more propitious.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (4): Fees cut as trade rises -
Futures and options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soffex, the electronic exchange for options and futures on Swiss securities,
has had a good year in spite of the poor performance of the underlying share
market, writes Ian Rodger.
And that seems to be mainly because it offers investors the opportunity to
move quickly on both the put and call sides.
By the end of October, the number of option contracts traded on stocks by
its 54 members was 15.3m, 14 per cent more than in the whole of last year.
Option contracts traded on the Swiss Market Index (SMI) totalled 5.6m by the
end of October, and Mr Otto Nageli, chief executive of Soffex, is
forecasting 6.7m for the full year, a 20 per cent advance over last year.
Volume in the first 10 months on the futures contract on Swiss government
bonds (CONF) was 880,000 contracts, more than three times the 271,000 traded
in the whole of last year. 'That is an astonishing figure by Swiss
standards, taking account of the limited experience with these instruments,'
Mr Nageli says.
As a result of the increased volumes, Soffex recently announced fee
reductions for next year, including a consolidation of fee zones from six to
three. Fees on futures have also been cut, notably the physical delivery fee
on the CONF future from SFr5 to SFr2.
Soffex introduced a long- term (18 months) option last May. It is on the SMI
index, and so far accounts for only a small part of total SMI option trading
 -for example, 6 per cent in September. Mr Nageli says the open interest
volume - 35,000 at the end of October - is a better indicator of its
popularity as it is more of an investment vehicle than one for trading.
By contrast, the option on CONF futures, launched in January, has not been a
success, with only some 50,000 contracts traded since its introduction. 'It
is difficult to get people to buy an option on a derivative,' he admits.
The exchange may introduce long-term options on individual stocks, but will
not launch any products until the integration with the new Swiss electronic
stock exchange is completed next year.
Soffex attracted some criticism a year ago for halting its plan to permit
cross-border trading, apparently because its directors wanted to postpone
expansion until after the planned integration with the Swiss stock
exchanges.
However, last May, it created a Frankfurt access point through the Deutsche
Terminborse (DTB) and accepted three Frankfurt-based banks as members.
Similar arrangements with brokers in other countries depend on the attitude
of regulators to the sharing of jurisdiction.
The trend in Switzerland's two other derivative product markets this year
has sharply diverged. Participants in the over-the-counter market say that
it has continued to grow, but at a more moderate rate than in 1993. As with
Soffex, investors can buy products to take advantage of falling prices. 'We
are very satisfied with the overall volume,' a Swiss Bank Corporation
derivatives trader in Zurich says.
By contrast, the listed option market has had a terrible year. The value of
listed options traded on Swiss stock exchanges plunged from a frenzied
SFr4.6bn as the market reached its peak in January to only SFr756.9m in
October.
OZ Holding, the subsidiary of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group,
accumulated a loss of SFr12.6m in the first nine months compared with a
SFr21.5m profit in the same period of 1993. Mr Ebner noted in his report to
shareholders in October that the market was characterised by low trading
volumes and low prices.
Analysts say that the listed market is mainly for call warrants, which
anticipate price rises in underlying shares.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (3): Laying the groundwork -
Multimedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ever since US vice-president Al Gore began his highly public campaign for a
national information superhighway, the Japanese authorities, private
business and media have been obsessed by the idea that the country may be
left behind in the race to connect the population with an advanced
communications network.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has come out with a
master plan for Japan's information age that reflects the authorities'
concern with catching up with the US in laying the groundwork for multimedia
services.
In its plan, the MPT calls for the building of Japan's information
superhighway infrastructure by the year 2010, five years earlier than
planned by NTT, the former public utility which is probably the only
telecommunications company today with the ability to build a nationwide
network.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has
competed with the MPT for the leadership role in nurturing Japan's
multimedia industry, has also published a report calling for increased
government efforts to pave the way for an advanced information society.
In its report, Miti notes that Japan has been a laggard in the development
and use of information networks. The spread of local area networks and
multi-channel broadcasting, two important steps along the information
highway, is much further advanced in the US than in Japan, Miti points out.
Yet beneath the ostensible panic, views are divided over whether Japan
really needs to catch up with the US in laying the groundwork for advanced
communications services.
There is general acknowledgement that when it comes to the spread of many of
the key elements in the information superhighway, the US has a considerable
lead over Japan.
For example, computer networks which will link businesses, academic
institutions, public facilities such as hospitals and libraries, and homes
to each other to provide services ranging from health care and banking to
home shopping and interactive video games, are already in much wider use in
the US than in Japan.
According to IDC, a high technology consultancy, penetration of PCs in the
US is 42 per cent against just 10 per cent in Japan and 56 per cent of PC
users in the US are connected by local area networks compared with just 13
per cent in Japan.
Cable TV, which is expected to be another key channel for multimedia
services, is also far more widely used in the US than in Japan. Jardine
Fleming, the securities company, estimates in a recent study that cable TV
reaches 70 per cent of US homes compared with just 2.9 per cent in Japan.
The US is also the recognised leader in developing services which take
advantage of the enhanced powers of communication provided by sophisticated
networks. Video-on-demand and home shopping services are about to be
commercialised and several companies are experimenting with a variety of
interactive services.
'Japan lags far behind the US when it comes to the utilisation of networks,'
admits Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT. At the same time, however, some
Japanese business executives have taken comfort from the fact that this
apparent delay in Japan's move towards the multimedia age may not really be
a serious cause for concern.
'I don't agree that the US is ahead of Japan,' asserts Mr Nobuyuki Idei,
managing director of Sony. 'They may end up being the last of the pack
because they have very old cables and there is the possibility that this
will be an obstacle to advanced multimedia,' he points out.
Many Japanese industrialists point to the failed multimedia alliances in the
US and the delays in multimedia experiments as evidence that the promise of
vastly enhanced communications and media services has run far ahead of the
reality. 'Not very many people in the US are talking as loudly any more
about multimedia as they use to a while ago,' says one Japanese electronics
executive.
Furthermore, Japanese companies are leaders in many of the technologies that
will be central to the development of information superhighways.
For example, companies such as Sony and Toshiba are leading manufacturers of
CD-ROMs, which are likely to become a key recording device for information
captured through computer networks.
JVC is a leader in digital compression technology while Pioneer has
expertise in interactive cable systems.
With their existing strengths and the lead they maintain in many key
technologies, the optimists believe Japanese companies have plenty of time
before the infrastructure is ready and the regulatory environment is sorted
out to make up lost ground in preparing for the advanced information age.
'Worrying about multimedia is like worrying about which university to send
your son to when he is just born,' Sony's Mr Idei asserts.
'The first five years will be just a small part of the big (multimedia)
picture,' adds Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita.
Meanwhile, Japanese companies will be able to focus their energies on
developing those technologies which they believe have the greatest market
potential in the information age.
To complement areas where they have recognised weaknesses, particularly
software, they can form links with the many innovative software companies
that exist in the US.
That is precisely what companies from Matsushita, the consumer electronics
giant, to Toshiba and NTT, have done.
Matsushita, Sony, Toshiba and NTT are among a growing list of Japanese
investors in General Magic, a US start-up company which is developing an
operating system and communication software for personal digital assistants.
NTT has linked up with Microsoft, the US software giant, and Silicon
Graphics as well. The availability of interesting contents is one of the
keys to success in multimedia, notes NTT's Mr Kojima. 'We hope to build bold
alliances with the US in the field of network utilisation and contents,' he
says.
The alliances reflect a recognition that the building of a wide-ranging
information infrastructure that is capable of changing the whole structure
of society is a massive undertaking involving many industries, advanced
technologies that are still to be developed, and huge sums of money.
As such, the march to multimedia is likely to be less a contest in which
either the US or Japan will emerge victorious than a three-legged race in
which each side needs the other to reach their common goal.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (2): Strong export markets have
been crucial / A look at developments in the electronics industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
After three years of battling against the debilitating effects of a sharply
rising yen and anaemic economic activity at home, Japan's electronics
companies are finally beginning to see a turn in their fortunes.
In their latest results, many Japanese electronics companies, from consumer
electronics makers to computer and semiconductor manufacturers, have been
able to report a lift in first-term profits this year and have indicated
expectations of a better year-end than they have seen for the past few
years.
Toshiba, the integrated electronics company, for example, saw operating
income quadruple in the first half while Sharp, the consumer electronics
company, managed to double its operating profits in the six months to
September, 1994.
There is no doubt that strong export markets, particularly in the US and
other parts of Asia, have been crucial in helping electronics companies to
reverse the tide of falling profits.
The results season did provide evidence, too, that many Japanese electronics
companies still command a leading edge in key technologies which has enabled
them to take advantage of buoyant demand overseas and thereby improve their
profits and future outlook.
The Japanese dominance of the memory chip market, for example, contributed
significantly to the better results electronics companies have reported so
far this year.
The growing sophistication of electronics equipment, from more powerful PCs
and games machines to increasingly intelligent camcorders and communications
tools, has boosted demand for memories and provided a bonanza for the
leading Japanese manufacturers of dynamic random access memory chips.
Likewise, the Japanese lead in liquid crystal display panels - in wide
demand for lightweight, portable electronic tools - has contributed
significantly to the recovery of many companies.
Toshiba, for example, says that first-half sales were up 16 per cent in its
information and devices division, which makes up 60 per cent of overall
sales, while total exports were up 18 per cent, largely on the strength of
semiconductor and LCD demand.
Meanwhile, Japanese companies have been implementing crucial restructuring
efforts, including the shifting of manufacturing overseas and increased
procurement of components from abroad, to lower their cost base.
Companies have been moving labour-intensive manufacturing to countries with
lower labour costs, most notably China, and buying a larger number of
components made in south-east Asia where prices are often 20 to 30 per cent
below those at home.
With the yen showing no signs of returning much of its recent 24 per cent
gain against the US dollar, and as the domestic market promises no more than
a mild recovery, such cost-cutting has been a vital element of Japanese
companies' programmes to regain international competitiveness.
The result has generally been a significant improvement in operating profits
even while sales have hardly firmed or have even fallen. Matsushita, the
world's largest consumer electronics group, reduced costs by Y28bn in the
first half, and improved pre-tax profits by 26 per cent although sales were
only moderately higher.
Restructuring efforts have been essential not only in raising profits at
Japanese electronics companies but also in maintaining their position
against growing competition both in overseas markets and in their home
market.
The appreciation of the yen has meant that Japanese electronics makers are
at a disadvantage against foreign competitors, not only in world markets,
but in the domestic market as well.
Consumer electronics makers, for example, have faced stiff competition at
home from cheaper Asian imports. NEC, Japan's leading PC-maker has been
forced to follow the lead of foreign computer makers in Japan by reducing
prices substantially.
So far, the strengths Japanese companies had built up in many sectors of the
electronics industry, coupled with restructuring efforts over the past few
years, have enabled most companies to stand up to the growing pressures they
face.
Some of them are even likely to emerge from the domestic recession and the
high yen environment better equipped to compete on the international stage.
However, the improvement in their business results masks the reality
Japanese electronics companies face of increasing international competition
in markets they have long dominated such as consumer electronics and memory
chips, or where they have been able to enjoy a protected home market, such
as in the domestic PC market.
In semiconductors, for example, while the recent boom in memory chip demand
has been a strong factor behind the profits rise at Japanese electronics
companies, they are expected to face increasing competition from Korean
manufacturers which have raised their competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese
manufacturers in recent years.
Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, industry analyst at UBS Securities, notes that 'a sharp
increase in Korean production is threatening the Japanese semiconductor
industry.' Mr Sugiyama believes that as a result Japanese makers could see
profitability decline as early as next year.
Even in the PC market, while foreign competition has yet to break the
domestic makers' grip on Japanese PC users in a significant way, cracks are
beginning to appear, with one Japanese PC maker after another launching
machines that are IBM-compatible, rather than based on their own proprietary
systems.
In wireless communications, which is one of the most promising growth
markets, world-leading foreign companies such as Motorola and Nokia, are
providing strong competition in the domestic market to Japanese equipment
makers, which hardly have significant operations outside the home market.
The likelihood is that, barring an unexpected plunge in the yen's value, and
as Japan gradually opens its doors to more foreign products, Japanese
electronics companies will continue to face strong foreign competition in
many of their traditionally important markets.
Their best hope then lies in their ability to continue identifying and
developing technologies which will form the basis for new markets in the
years ahead. So far, the signs are that many Japanese companies are well on
the way to doing so.
Sharp's belief in the continuing importance of information communication
tools has led it to invest in the world's largest LCD plant and to focus R&amp;D
efforts on opto-electronics, which enables the processing of information in
huge volumes.
Other Japanese companies such as Sony, see the information age spurring
demand for advanced recording media. They have led in the development of
discs which can record substantially larger amounts of information than
currently possible.
Their efforts are promising signs that as new markets based on new
technologies unfold, Japanese electronics companies will continue to play a
significant role in their development.
As they do so, it is probably inevitable that many of the key product
sectors they once dominated will be passed on to others.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (1): Open, competitive, lively - and
Swiss / A look at how the country's financial centre is adapting to greater
foreign competition and a future outside the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
The Swiss financial community is having a difficult but productive year.
Profits are hard to come by, especially when compared with 1993, but a
surprising amount of progress is being made towards consolidating and
improving the financial centre's openness and competitiveness.
Two years after the Swiss people rejected in a referendum the path towards
integration with the European Union, there is no moaning in the financial
community about any negative effects of isolation.
On the contrary, the talk is all of a continuing strong inflow of investment
funds from neighbouring EU countries and of how the new national electronic
stock exchange will bring back share trading volume from London's Seaq
International.
Meanwhile, the unprecedented proxy battle last month between Mr Martin
Ebner, the maverick Zurich broker-fund manager, and the board of Union Bank
of Switzerland has raised expectations that Swiss shareholders will take
more interest in the governance of their companies than they have in the
past.
It all points to a more lively future for Finanzplatz Schweiz than many
bankers would have hoped for a few years ago. If only business would
improve, Swiss bankers might even admit to being moderately content.
After the boom last year in virtually every banking sector, it was to be
expected that things would be tougher this year. The end of the declining
trend in interest rates and a 16 per cent slide in stock market prices since
the peak at the end of January have been particularly painful for the many
banks that specialise in fund management. Sharp falls in income from own
trading have become the norm.
The accelerating pace of consolidation among smaller regional banks has
intensified the struggle for market share in domestic commercial business,
at the expense of margins. All three big universal banks, Credit Suisse,
Swiss Bank Corporation and UBS, reported lower net interest income in the
first nine months of the year.
Following the December 1992 referendum vote against joining the European
Economic Area, the Swiss government launched a programme unilaterally to
harmonise laws with EU practice, wherever possible. In the financial area,
the fruits of that effort are about to appear, much more quickly than many
Swiss expected.
A new banking law comes into force on January 1 that legalises assistance
between Swiss and foreign banks on administrative matters and permits
foreign-owned banks to provide information on large risks to their parents.
It also simplifies the process by which domestic banks prove they are
Swiss-owned and thereby entitled to use the word Swiss in their names.
Henceforth, large shareholders of banks must disclose their holdings, and
the Federal Banking Commission has the right to disenfranchise those it
considers undesirable. It was this reform that emboldened UBS in September
to propose removing all ownership restrictions on its registered shares.
An investment trust law also comes into force at the beginning of the year,
supplanting an antique law that does not permit the formation of many
popular types of funds. As a result, much fund business left Switzerland,
mainly for Luxembourg.
Until a few months ago, Swiss bankers cautiously predicted that the main
impact of the new law would be to encourage fund managers to set up their
new investment funds in Switzerland. Now they think there could be some
repatriation of funds from Luxembourg as well.
Next June, the Swiss stock exchanges will go electronic, uniting in one
market the volume that was hitherto dissipated over three regional
exchanges. Most members are confident that there will be an increase in
liquidity and a lowering of transaction costs, which will encourage traders
to bring volume back from London.
Barring unforeseen problems in parliament, a new national stock exchange law
will come into force at about the same time, bringing with it important
protections for investors and companies.
The inclusion of a takeover code will remove the justification for severe
restrictions on voting that still exist over many Swiss shares. The
directors of Nestle, where no shareholder may exercise more than 3 per cent
of the votes, have already signalled that they would propose removing the
curbs once the code is in place.
Meanwhile, the government has implemented three new measures to facilitate
its fight against money launderers. Bankers now have the right to denounce
suspicious clients. Previously, such a move conflicted with bank secrecy
requirements.
For its part, the government now has the right to confiscate funds found to
be held in Swiss banks by criminals.
And membership of a criminal organisation has become a criminal offence.
That means that Swiss courts can co-operate with foreign prosecutors in
cases involving the Mafia and other criminal organisations, without further
specific charges being involved.
All these measures appear to be having positive effects. After a period in
which foreign banks were tending to close or downgrade their Swiss bases,
new ones are now being opened.
The most significant recent expansion is probably that by Goldman Sachs, the
leading US investment bank. Its Zurich operation, a small brokerage-based
private banking branch in 1991, has moved into fund management,
institutional sales and derivatives issuing, and has become a member of the
Zurich Stock Exchange. The staff now numbers more than 100.
Some German savings banks are planning to open Swiss offices because their
clients fear that Luxembourg, now their favourite haven, will be forced to
harmonise its tax policies with those of other EU members.
Unfortunately, these arrivals are unlikely to be enough to offset the
massive personnel reductions that are expected on the Swiss financial scene
in the next few years.
Mr Bruno Gehrig, a professor at the Swiss Institute for Banking and Finance
in St Gallen and a member of the Federal Banking Commission, said in a
speech last week in Zurich that the retail banking sector, which now employs
about 90,000, would have to fall by as much as 20 per cent if it was to
return to health.
That process could happen quite quickly by Swiss standards in the wake of
the landmark proxy battle last month between the UBS board and Mr Martin
Ebner over the governance of the bank.
The UBS board won the battle, which was ostensibly over its proposal to
convert all registered shares into bearer shares, at a dramatic
extraordinary shareholders' meeting.
But Mr Ebner received wide support for his case that the bank should improve
its returns to shareholders by focusing more on its successful activities
and scaling down its unprofitable domestic retail business.
It is still too early to foresee all the consequences of the UBS-Ebner
confrontation, not least because of potential legal appeals. But improving
shareholder value is clearly a theme whose time has come to Switzerland.
Even Mr Gehrig used it to support his call for rationalising the troubled
retail sector. 'The average domestic banking operation does not make enough
money to yield what shareholders require,' he said.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (1): A mood of muted optimism
prevails - Japanese industry is cautiously celebrating a gentle economic
recovery, which has brought the first profits upturn for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now is the time of year when Japan's top industrial companies hold their
annual bonenkai parties, at which executives gather to chat about business
over beer and a tray of sushi.
The tone of these august gatherings is a little lighter this year than last,
when industry was wallowing in the trough of its deepest recession since the
second world war. Now Japanese industry is cautiously celebrating a gentle
economic recovery, which has brought the first profits upturn for five
years.
Those in the fastest recovering sectors such as semiconductors are throwing
parties with a flamboyance not seen since the heady late 1980s. But overall,
the mood of this bonenkai season is one of only muted optimism.
Until the recession hit, in 1990, Japanese industry was imbued with 'great
arrogance,' believes Mr Hideo Ishihara, chairman of Goldman Sachs (Japan).
Today, 'that arrogance has crumbled,' he told a recent seminar in Tokyo. The
chutzpah of the 1980s is being replaced by a period of 'soul-searching. . .
a loss of confidence' among Japanese managers, says Mr Ishihara.
The managers are starting to get to grips with a number of fundamental
changes. Abroad, uncomfortable reminders of fallibility have cropped up over
the past year, such as the way in which Germany's BMW seized Rover, the
British car maker, from under the nose of Honda, its long-time partner; and
the problems Sony and Matsushita have experienced with their investments in
the US film business.
At home, companies face adjustment to the shift over the next decade or so
from a fast-expanding, export-driven economy - on which all their strategies
up till now have been based - to a slow-growing, consumer-driven economy.
Services will take on increasing importance, thanks to the fact that Japan
has the world's fastest-ageing population profile. An increasing amount of
basic manufacturing will be undertaken in cheaper locations offshore because
of the yen's strength and the growing competitiveness of Japan's Asian
neighbours.
Many companies believe this so-called 'hollowing out' is a mark of declining
competitiveness. Yet it is an inevitable, maybe even healthy trend. It
reflects a new division of labour in Asia between high technology industries
and basic industrial manufacturing, argue seasoned observers such as Mr
Yasushi Mieno, outgoing governor of the Bank of Japan.
Already, Japanese companies are becoming accustomed to the main consequence
of all these changes; that they will not in the 1990s repeat the growth
rates of the 1980s. The recovery which has just started is a sign of things
to come - weaker and shallower than previous upturns. At best, industry can
expect 3 per cent annual rates of increase in gross domestic product this
decade, well below the 5 per cent growth rates of the late 1980s, agree
economists in Tokyo.
Industry faces, in consequence, a harder task to increase profitability than
it did before the recession hit. The top 600 quoted companies managed a mere
4.36 per cent rise in current profits - before tax and extraordinary items -
in the first six months of this year, estimates the Wako Research Institute
of Economics. For the full year to next March, they are expecting a 7 per
cent profits rise, which looks on the surface like a good turnround from the
16.4 per cent profits decline in the previous year, according to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
Yet even at that level, operating profits margins are in poor shape; well
below the average for the previous two decades and even below levels seen
after the 1973 oil price shock. And the scope for manufacturers to improve
margins by raising prices is limited by continuing surplus capacity in
fundamental sectors such as steel, cars and consumer electronics.
Some, like the big integrated electronics companies and precision instrument
makers, have nevertheless managed to make startling increases in profits in
the first half of this year, thanks to their skill in squeezing costs - an
indication that they are responding to the structural changes ahead.
One consequence of this painfully slow recovery is to continue to lay bare
the weaknesses in Japan's industrial structure exposed by the recession.
This might prove to be a blessing, if it ensures that industry remains under
pressure to restructure.
Japanese industry has, for good reasons to do with avoiding high
unemployment, been slow to address its problems. With a few exceptions,
Japan's top companies have so far managed to struggle through the recession
without reducing their three main excesses, capacity, stocks and workers, on
anything like the scale of their US or European competitors. Investment in
new plant and equipment is set to fall by nearly 6 per cent this year,
estimates Nomura Research Institute; making a record four years of decline.
Yet even after this, average capacity utilisation is barely abovethelevels
20 years ago in the immediate aftermath of the Opec oil price rises.
The rate of growth in wage costs has meanwhile been trimmed. This is partly
due to reductions in overtime and bonuses, which account for a third of
average remuneration, so giving Japanese industry more scope than most of
its competitors to cut labour costs without firing people. Unit labour costs
are forecast to rise, as a result, by just 2.1 per cent this year.
Jobs have been cut as well, mainly through early retirement and cuts or
freezes on graduate recruitment. Graduates who fail to get jobs do not show
up in unemployment figures, but reductions in older members of the workforce
have been enough to nudge Japan's jobless rate from 2.5 per cent to 3 per
cent over the past year. That is still a long way below US and European
levels, a mark of the success with which Japan's chronically overmanned
service industries mop up surplus jobs.
It is also a sign of how Japan's much-envied tradition of lifetime
employment, a luxury confined to the top 300 or 400 companies, has survived
the recession. A growing number of companies would like to scrap the system.
Some, such as Sony and Toyota, have started to experiment by setting up new
streams of staff on short-term contracts. But most companies accept that the
present generation of life-timers will have to retire before the system
itself can retire - and by then, ageing Japan is likely to be facing a
labour shortage.
The sharpest cost reductions have come from the shift of capacity overseas.
Offshore production has roughly doubled to 6.4 per cent of Japanese
industry's total output over the past decade, but is still tiny by
comparison with the 27.5 per cent of production which US companies now have
overseas. There will be more to come.
Another traditional feature of Japanese industry to be put up for
reassessment is the network of ties, through cross-shareholdings and
exchanges of managers, between manufacturers, bankers, suppliers and
customers.
The pressure to reduce costs has forced industrial companies to terminate
old alliances that have outlived their usefulness. This is especially true
in the keiretsu diversified corporate families such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui,
or Sumitomo, which dominate heavy manufacturing, trading and banking. It is
also taking place among groups such as Matsushita or Toyota, which exist
outside the traditional keiretsu groups but nevertheless have similar links
with subcontractors and distributors.
Sales of mutual cross-shareholdings rose sharply last year, to a record
Y2,148bn, and continue to rise this year. Capital locked up in equity stakes
in partners which have become less useful over the years is being freed for
better use, and loyal but over-expensive contractors are being asked to take
their business elsewhere.
Gradually, Japan's industrial structure is readjusting itself to cope with a
rise in international competition, and to make the best of a maturing
economy. Arrogance may have crumbled, yet Japanese industry's ability to
adapt should not be underestimated.

FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares shrug off political and
economic worries - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprisingly strong showing by Wall Street late on Friday and another
firm performance by US markets at the outset yesterday saw London's equity
market consolidate an early good rise, in spite of the twin threat of early
moves to higher interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 16.2 higher at 3,033.5. The strength
in the leading stocks did not, however, extend to the rest of the stock
market, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended marginally easier at 3,458.3,
down 1.6.
There were other deep-seated worries for London, with the market
increasingly concerned at the prospect of the government being defeated in
the House of Commons later today when the house votes on the increase in VAT
on domestic fuel. Adding to the underlying concerns was tomorrow's meeting
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie
George, Governor of the Bank of England, to discuss monetary policy, and the
Pounds 2.8bn gilts auction.
One very disturbing detail of the trading session, dealers said, was the
exceptionally low level of activity in the market ahead of the Commons vote
and the meeting of the chancellor and the governor.
Turnover in London was a dismal 456.3m shares, the lowest for more than two
weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for a disappointingly high 60 per
cent of that figure. Even more worrying for traders was the fact that such a
low turnover figure was boosted by a couple of programme trades, albeit of
limited size.
There was no denying, however, that European stock markets had responded
willingly to Wall Street's sharp rise last Friday. Questioned as to why the
markets had raced ahead in the face of the constant flow of economic data
pointing to the probability of interest rate rises here and in the US, one
leading marketmaker in London said the markets had already factored in the
next round of interest rate rises.
'The political scene has weighed very heavily on the London market today,'
he said. 'Although it is very unlikely, if the government were to lose
tonight we would be in very big trouble indeed. Without that I feel we would
have been much stronger today.'
Other dealers said there was a feeling around the trading desks that, given
a yes vote on the VAT issue, the FT-SE 100 could easily progress to 3,180
before meeting any strong resistance.
There was also plenty of talk suggesting the long-awaited year-end rally may
be taking shape. But again, the feeling was that Wall Street needed to
demonstrate its resilience in the face of the interest rate concerns.
Buyers moved in for equities at the outset, with the FT-SE 100 opening
around 11 points higher, before slipping into negative territory within an
hour as the interest rate factor triggered pockets of profit-taking.
Once those bouts of selling were done, however, prices quickly regained the
upward path, with overseas buyers also making their presence felt. Shortly
after midday the FT-SE 100 Index was more than 15 points ahead and it
progressed to reach a high for the session of 3,037.4, up some 20 points,
before coming off that level an hour before the close.
Around the sectors, the regional electricity stocks attracted some sizeable
profit-taking, with analysts pointing out the sector's recent outperformance
against the market in anticipation of interim dividend increases of 20 per
cent-plus. Seeboard began the 'dividend race' last week.
SG Warburg was the pick of the financial sectors of the market, reflecting a
growing conviction that the bank will find rich pickings in moves by a
number of UK building societies to merge and convert to banking status.

FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several regional electricity stocks (recs) fell back sharply after Kleinwort
Benson downgraded the sector.
The securities house changed its recommendation from a buy to a hold on the
sector as a whole, although its analysts declined to comment on reasons for
the move.
Electricity shares had moved sharply ahead in recent sessions after last
week's Budget made no mention of plans to impose a windfall tax on proceeds
from the sale of the National Grid, owned by the 12 generators.
Sentiment in the sector yesterday was hit further by renewed nervousness
about the outcome of today's VAT on domestic fuel debate in parliament and
fears of a rise in interest rates in the near term.
The day's slide included East Midlands, which surrendered 12 at 751p,
Manweb, 10 lower at 794p, Midlands, 3 easier at 780p, and London, which
receded 9 to 693p.
However, Kleinwort Benson continues to favour some stocks in the sector,
such as National Power. It urged investors to buy the stock, saying:
'Significant cost control continues to drive profits growth, while an
international portfolio of projects is gradually being assembled.' National
Power shares finished 5 ahead at 502p.
The long awaited restructuring package at its Mercury unit left Cable and
Wireless 4 3/4 better at 378p ex-dividend, with most analysts reading
positive management into the group's announcement of a 22 per cent workforce
reduction.
Immediate adjustments to C&amp;W's earnings were minimal, although the consensus
view was that the group was taking a firm bite of the bullet and that as a
result the shares' confidence factor had moved up several useful points.
C&amp;W trading volume was modest at 2.6m shares, with most of the telecoms
action reserved for Vodafone, which put on a penny at 199 1/2 p in 8.7m
turnover.
Diversified industrial issue Tomkins barely flickered in response to what
analysts saw as a sweeping boardroom reshuffle, firming a penny to 216p in
nominal 2.2m turnover.
The mooted response reflected investors' difficulties in gauging management
changes, although most commentators felt that a certain amount of unease had
begun to creep into stock market thinking.
By contrast, BTR was again actively traded, improving 1 1/2 to 277p in 8.4m
turnover. There was also heavy dealing in BTR stock options, with nearly
4,000 lots dealt.
Bank shares stayed in confident mood, rising across the board as speculation
on the timing of the next round of base rate rises appeared to focus on
January.
Barclays moved forward 5 to 604p, while Lloyds, up 2 at 555p in 5.7m volume,
was the most actively dealt share in the banking stocks.
Sector watchers have begun to peer forward to the next results round (TSB's
preliminary figures are due early in the new year) and - more significantly
 -to calculate the point at which interest rate rises actually begin to work
against banking margins.
Investment bank BZW feels that bad debts could start to pile up for the
industry once base rates work their way back up to 7 per cent, using recent
US experience as a guide.
Among motor distributors, Inchcape advanced 11 to 442p following a buy
recommendation from Smith New Court and a Pounds 30m disposal of two vehicle
hire operations. Lex Service was a contrasting feature, sliding 14 to 307p
in 3.2m turnover, with a 1.2m line of shares changing hands at 307p.
The 27.8 per cent increase in half-year profits from brewing group Scottish
&amp; Newcastle cheered the market, leaving the shares 6 ahead at 503p.
Demand for Grand Metropolitan, which reported figures last week, continued
yesterday and the stock gained a further 8 at 389p in trade of 5.7m, with
the market said to be only now appreciating the cash generation qualities of
the group.
Freight specialist NFC dipped 3 to 162p ahead of today's prelims - and the
possible announcement of a new chief executive - but it was the turnover in
the shares that caught the eye, rising to 10m with a 3.5m block passing
through the market at 162p.
Elsewhere in the transport sector, British Airways firmed 2 to 369p, helped
by better than expected traffic figures for November which showed a 7.3 per
cent gain. Bus operator Stagecoach, floated last year at 112p, was steady at
215p in advance of today's interims.
Food manufacturing group Hazlewood receded 6 to 110p in nervous trading
ahead of today's first-half figures. One analyst said simply: 'I think it
will be a bad set of results, and what is more I think the statement from
the company will be cautious.'
Buoyant ice cream sales, courtesy of unseasonally mild European weather,
were said to have been behind an advance in Unilever of 17 to 1124p.
Engineering shares were mixed, with GKN a notable casualty, slipping 8 to
613p in modest 1.8m turnover. Siebe added 8 at 553p ahead of today's
interims and amid hopes for an increase of at least 10 per cent in the
half-time dividend.
T&amp;N showed signs of approaching a bottom after the recent rights issue-led
fall-out, clawing back 6 at 165p.
The prospects of strong sales of the recently released new Beatles record
were reported to have been behind positive sentiment in Thorn EMI shares,
which improved 14 to 1009p.

FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailing shares came under pressure as the market remained nervous about
trading prospects in the Christmas period. Also, UBS was said to have turned
negative on the sector.
This is traditionally the most lucrative time for most retailers, but nerves
have set in recently about whether sales will match original forecasts. For
clothes retailers, the warm weather of late has left many of the winter
lines unsold.
Worries over the prospect of higher interest rates were another factor that
cast a shadow over the sector. Burton Group dipped 1 3/4 to 66 1/4 p,
Kingfisher gave up 6 at 448p, Marks and Spencer softened 2 to 392p and Great
Universal Stores, which reports interim figures on Thursday, declined 11 to
535p.
However, trading was not all one way in the sector and bargain hunters
helped Boots firm 1 1/2 to 489p. Hopes that the long awaited Office of Fair
Trading investigation into warranties will not be as severe as originally
expected helped Dixons harden a penny to 181p.

FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, making good a large part of the
big sell-off experienced at the end of last week, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,041, up
36. The final two sessions of last week saw the December contract fall by 88
points.
The premium to the cash market was around eight points - roughly where it
had traded all day - or some five points above fair value.
Business was thin, with 12,683 contracts dealt, down from 15,919 on Friday.
Moreover, around a quarter of these constituted spread trading as investors
rolled over into the March contract. The December contract expires on
December 16.
The contract reached a 3,045 best of the day around 3pm - 30 minutes after
the opening on Wall Street - and dealers said that at that point there was a
flurry of useful two-way business.
In late, screen-based trading the contract moved down to 3,039 in little
additional turnover.
Traded option volume was significantly lower than on Friday, although heavy
trading built up around a number of individual options. There were 30,168
total contracts, down from 44,235. BTR was the most active stock option at
3,960 lots, followed by GrandMet at 2,481. BAT and Boots were also actively
dealt.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond prices leave
equities mixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
The US stock market closed mixed yesterday on the heels of a declining bond
market, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.70 at 3,741.92, while the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was up 0.02 at 453.32, the American SE composite down 0.21 at
432.25 and the Nasdaq composite 0.69 firmer at 745.71. The day's NYSE volume
was light at 258.5m shares.
After Friday's surge, when the Dow jumped more than 40 points in the
afternoon, the market opened with investors in a surprisingly upbeat mood,
with the Dow gaining some 10 points by 1pm. Last week's late gains were
spurred by a sharp increase in bond prices, and yesterday saw bonds fall all
day, pulling stock prices down by the end of the day. Most economists
attributed the declining bond prices not to renewed bearish sentiment, but
to profit-taking after Friday's strong rally.
With senitment on Wall Street divided about whether equities are likely to
rally in the short term, the market traded within a relatively narrow band,
never rising more than 18 points above Friday's close or falling in excess
of 19 points below it. Analysts attributed the day's lows to program trading
that took place late in the afternoon after share prices began to slide.
A range of Dow issues achieved gains as buyers favoured cyclicals. Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52, Aluminum Company of
America Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 82 5/8 , International Paper Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 71 5/8 and Caterpillar Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 7/8 .
Car issues were firmer in anticipation of another strong set of sales
figures. General Motors appreciated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 39 and Chrysler
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 7/8 .
ICN Pharmaceuticals fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 after stating that,
following advice from the US Food and Drug Administration, it was amending
its application for approval of its treatment for chronic hepatitis C.
On the Nasdaq, Figgie International climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 7 on
news that it had hired an investment bank to advise on 'strategic
alternatives' that could involve the sale of businesses or a
recapitalisation.
Canada
A zig-zagging Toronto market ended mixed, thanks to another solid day of
advances in heavily weighted bank stocks. Weakness in oil and gold shares
was the main drag on the market.
The TSE 300 index managed a minor gain of 3.57 points at 4,096.56, but
declines led rises by 404 to 354 after volume of 54.5m shares. Nine of the
14 sub-indices were up, led by the paper, financial, conglomerate and
communication sectors. Golds fell 1.25 per cent.
Financial services added 0.79 per cent, with Royal Bank of Canada putting on
CDollars 1/2 at CDollars 29 1/2. The bank is expected to release earnings
today. Besides strong earnings, the banking stocks are gaining strength from
growing belief that long-term rates are peaking.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo ended 2.3 per cent higher after investors reassessed a
central bank ruling requiring reserve requirements for repurchase of export
notes, which sent stock prices lower at the start of trading. The Bovespa
index rose 1,068 to 46,313.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg golds weaken

An advancing dollar, topping Y100 for the first time since October 13,
helped to jack up the Nikkei 225 by 307.36 to close at the day's high of
19,305.66, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
After two consecutive days of losses, the benchmark index sailed out of the
doldrums at the opening, leaving a day's low of 19,067.01 to finish the
morning session at 19,207.44. Most of that gain occurred in the first 15
minutes of trading. There was little market movement through most of the day
until a final, arbitrage-led rally at the close.
Traders attributed the renewed strength of the market to futures-linked
arbitrage buying, as dealers who had taken the short side in Chicago index
futures markets on Friday bought shares in Tokyo to cut losses. The upturn
was also supported by recent strength in US financial markets and the
release of better than anticipated US employment figures on Friday.
The market turned up in estimated volume of 211m shares. The
capital-weighted Nikkei 300 index rose 3.30 to 282.52 and the Topix index of
all first-section stocks by 16.01 to 1,531.86. Winners topped losers by 837
to 187, with 169 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
1.57 to 1,272.07.
Among computer game makers, Sega Industries extended its recovery to a
seventh consecutive day, rising Y80 to Y5,210. Nintendo gained Y100 at
Y5,800.
Sony, which entered the video game business last Friday with its advanced
PlayStation, added Y100 at Y5,520, while Matsushita Electric Industrial
advanced Y40 to Y1,580. Other consumer electronics stocks also rose, JVC by
Y30 to Y1360, Sanyo Electric by Y6 to Y582 and Sharp by Y30 to Y1710.
Most integrated electricals did well. Mitsubishi Electric moved ahead Y10 to
Y710 and Hitachi Y7 to Y985, while Toshiba climbed Y21 to Y731 in the day's
third highest volume of 3.2m shares. NEC closed at Y1,190 for a Y30 advance,
but Fujitsu stayed at Y1,020.
Carmakers joined the upsurge. Mitsubishi Motors rose Y11 to Y983, Nissan by
Y13 to Y834 and Isuzu closed at Y492, up Y6. Following recent losses,
privatised stocks were mostly higher. Japan Tobacco appreciated Y5,000 to
Y960,000 and NTT Y7,000 to Y837,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 160.11 at 21,275.3 in volume of 33.4m
shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's strong performance on Friday provided inspiration for some
regional markets. Bangkok was closed for a public holiday.
TAIPEI jumped 4.2 per cent as investors celebrated a victory by the ruling
Nationalist party in key elections for governor on Saturday.
The weighted index ended 270.40 stronger at 6,750.22, off an opening high of
6,824.20. Turnover surged to a hectic TDollars 103.8bn from Friday's
TDollars 54.76bn.
Plastics shares led the rally on good fudamentals and recent product price
increases, with China Petrochemical and Taiwan Polypropylene both advancing
by a daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 39 and TDollars 76.50 respectively.
Electronics also raced ahead on strong earnings growth, with United
Microelectronics and Acer each limit up to TDollars 131.50 and TDollars
102.50. The financial sector, which opened 6.5 per cent ahead, gave up some
of the rise to finish 4.1 per cent up.
SYDNEY closed near its high for the day, the All Ordinaries index adding
17.4 or 0.9 per cent at 1,897.5, as a number of blue chip issues found
support on the back of a better futures market.
SEOUL ended higher after an early technical rebound in blue chips, while
buying interest remained strong in selective smaller-capitalisation shares
with good corporate earnings prospects. The composite index was ahead 11.00
at 1,065.03.
Securities houses were also in demand, on unfounded rumours that the
government would allow brokerage houses with abundant cash reserve ratios to
raise capital freely.
HONG KONG saw an early 1.0 per cent rally but was unable to make further
headway in subsequent trade. The Hang Seng index, which dropped 5 per cent
last week and was 34 per cent down from its January peak, moved up 80.96 to
8,302.53.
Turnover dwindled to a preliminary HKDollars 2.7bn, compared with HKDollars
4.2bn on Friday.
Brokers noted that rising US interest rates were making fixed interest
investments increasingly attractive, contributing to redemptions of local
stock investments.
China-incorporated shares led the market higher, with Tsingtao Brewery up 25
cents to HKDollars 5.10 on buying after technical weakness.
HSBC Holdings rose 75 cents to HKDollars 84.50, Hutchison Whampoa moved
ahead 60 cents to HKDollars 30.10 and Consolidated Electric Power advanced
60 cents to HKDollars 15.50.
SINGAPORE was unable to hold on to early gains and the Straits Times
Industrial index finished 3.45 easier at 2,185.57, with sentiment bruised by
faltering Malaysian shares traded over the counter.
KUALA LUMPUR continued to fall, ending 1.4 per cent lower, as a fresh round
of forced selling by clients unable to meet margin calls sent prices
tumbling. The composite index shed 13.86 to 963.88.
WELLINGTON sank to its low for the year in early afternoon trade amid gloom
over the outlook for higher interest rates, before prices picked up towards
the close. The NZSE-40 fell to 1,932.69 and then rallied to close 3.20 down
on the day at 1,939.36.
MANILA saw profit-taking after a firm opening before renewed, late buying by
domestic and retail customers. The composite index finished 25.96 higher at
2,622.71.
Petron led the gains, advancing 75 cents or 3.9 per cent to 20 pesos.
BOMBAY encountered early retail selling before late demand for blue chips by
domestic mutual funds reversed the slide.
The BSE-30 index picked up from a low of 4,034.49 to finish 6.74 ahead at
4,084.23.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage rally before
bonds show weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses rallied at the outset as they caught up with the renewed strength of
the dollar against the D-Mark, and of Wall Street ahead of the weekend; but
some of them, particularly France, were unable to withstand weakness in
bonds later in the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT held up quite well considering the afternoon weakness in bunds,
and in bund futures. After a 32.61 or 1.6 per cent jump in the Dax index to
2,071.12 on the session, the Ibis indicated Dax closed 24.88 or 1.2 per cent
higher at 2,067.26 after hours.
There was some popular support for banks ahead of their 10-month results,
but the sector did not hold on to all of its gains in the afternoon; in
fact, the high flyer in financials was the insurer, Allianz, up DM56 to
DM2,496 at the end of the day. To Mr Adrian Phillips, who heads the German
analysis team at Kleinwort Benson, this suggested that traders, rather than
investors, were taking the initiative.
Carmakers did well, although there seemed a tendency to offer German
industrials in sizeable lots: BMW put on DM10.90 at DM760.50, and Daimler
DM13.90 at DM752.50; Volkswagen improved over the day, ending DM6 higher at
DM422.50, after last week's 8 per cent drop which followed the release of
disappointing 1995 profits targets in the group's latest five-year plan.
Turnover rose from around DM4bn to DM5bn. Other stocks stayed out of favour.
Henkel, the chemicals group which owns the Persil brand name in Europe
outside the UK and France, lost another DM5.30 to close at a new 1994 low of
DM532.70, after a meeting nearly two weeks ago which has since led some
analysts to revise their projections.
PARIS broke briefly through the 2,000 barrier in the CAC-40 index before
losing momentum in the last hour of trading as profits were taken. The index
ended the day 9.06 lower at 1,973.65, after a high of 2,003.19. Turnover was
FFr3.6bn.
Last week the French market made a strong forward move, largely on technical
activity, closing at its highest level for nearly three months. James Capel,
in a technical analysis of the CAC-40, suggested that the current rally,
which began around the start of November, was likely to meet resistance at
2,040. The broker's analysts Ms Deborah Boys and Mr Robin Griffiths remarked
that the rally had been more broadly based than in other European bourses.
Corporate stories were sparse. Carrefour lost ground as profits were booked
following recent strength, and the shares dipped FFr51 to FFr2,234.
Elsewhere, some brokers suggested that funds were being switched from Total
to Elf Aquitaine, as the former retreated FFr3.60 to FFr331.90 and the
latter rose FFr5.70 to FFr387.40.
AMSTERDAM tracked strength elsewhere, and the AEX index moved forward 3.34
to 413.35.
Two issues stood out: Ahold, on good third-quarter results; and Pakhoed, as
news of a French acquisition was well received.
The former, an international supermarket and retail group, saw a 25 per cent
gain in earnings, helped by an improvement in trading conditions in the US,
Portugal and the Netherlands. The company said that the results would have
been even better had it not been for dollar weakness. The shares settled at
the session's high of Fl 53.50, a gain of 70 cents.
Pakhoed, the oil and storage company, rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 46.70 as it
announced that it was to take an immediate 66 per cent stake in Lambert
Riviere, the French chemicals distributor, and to launch a public offer for
the remaining stock early in the new year.
ZURICH looked to firm futures to support the cash market, and the SMI index
rose 33.5 or 1.3 per cent to 2,611.0.
Hopes that bond markets would remain firm helped insurers, which are heavily
invested in fixed rate bonds. Zurich rose SFr19 to SFr1,262, Swiss Re picked
up SFr6 to SFr773 and Winterthur was SFr7 higher at SFr637.
Bearer shares in Berner, a medium sized insurer, rose SFr70 or 5.3 per cent
to SFr1,390 amid renewed talk that Germany's Allianz, which already owns 30
per cent, might raise its stake.
Roche certificates advanced SFr115 to SFr5,850: dealers noted that BZW had
advised clients to take profits in Swedish Astra, and switch into Roche.
MILAN was unmoved by political developments and the Comit index eased 1.65
to 629.80 in very low volume of about L300bn, with the banking sector again
providing one of the few areas of activity.
Credito Romagnolo rose L267 or 1.6 per cent to L17,429 in response to the
improved offer of L20,000 a share from Credito Italiano for up to 65 per
cent of the shares. Italiano firmed L7 to L1,633. Some analysts were
doubtful about local newspaper speculation suggesting that Rolo might face a
counter-bid from Cariplo.
Olivetti fell L36 or 1.9 per cent to L1,886 and Cir, its fellow De Benedetti
group company, receded L35 to L1,786. Both are shareholders in Rolo, and the
declines suggested disappointment that Italiano's bid had not matched early
forecasts in the L21,000 to L23,000 range.
Ras moved ahead L376 or 2.5 per cent to L15,546 amid buying linked to its
rights issue which is currently in progress.
BRUSSELS was more concerned with constituents of the Bel-20 than with the
index itself, which gained a tame 4.61 at 1,413.63. The biggest rise of the
day was in the steelmaker Cockerill Sambre, which ended BFr6 or 3.0 per cent
higher at BFr203, not far short of its BFr215 peak for the year. On Friday,
Cockerill will replace Gevaert in the Bel-20. Gevaert fell BFr48 or 3.2 per
cent to BFr1,424 as investors dropped the holding company from their
portfolios.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Sterling nervous on worries about VAT vote
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pound traded steadily yesterday ahead of this evening's closely
contested parliamentary vote on the increase in value added tax on fuel,
writes Philip Gawith.
Analysts warned, however, that it was vulnerable to a heavy sell-off if the
government were defeated. Interest rate markets were nervous, with short
sterling contracts losing ground across the board. The March contract fell
13 basis points to close in London at 92.66, down from 92.79.
Sterling lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark in afternoon trade and
finished at DM2.4542, from Friday's DM2.461. Against the dollar it was
barely changed at Dollars 1.5591, from Dollars 1.5598.
Activity was generally quiet, with one analyst saying that it had 'the feel
of the first pre-Christmas trading day'.
In Europe the main movement came from the Spanish peseta, which weakened to
close at Pta83.86 against the D-Mark, from Pta83.42.
Analysts said UK markets continued to be dominated by political factors.
Today the focus is on whether the government will prevail in a vote on value
added tax. This follows anxieties last week about whether a vote on European
Union finance would pass, and a possible leadership challenge to the UK
prime minister.
Mr Peter Luxton, analyst at MMS, commented: 'Sterling is being affected by
the two 'Ps' - politics and policy.' He said markets were worrying about a
further loss of face for the government, as well as the possibility that a
setback on VAT might leave a Pounds 1.5bn revenue hole in the 1995-96
budget.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the key
determinant for sterling until the year's end would be tomorrow's monthly
monetary meeting, rather than politics.
On a trade weighted basis the dollar has now appreciated 4.5 per cent from a
recent low of 60.6 on October 25, and 5.5 per cent against the D-Mark.
One factor buoying the currency is that US short-term rates have finally
risen above those in Germany, giving investors an incentive to hold US
assets. The interest rate argument could yet move further in the dollar's
favour if German rates are cut.
Yesterday Mr Gerd Haeusler, a Bundesbank board member, told a meeting in
Frankfurt that he personally believed another rate reduction was possible,
if inflation pressures eased further and money supply stayed under control.
Explaining the Bundesbank's policy, of persisting with a fixed rate repo in
its weekly money market operations, Mr Haeusler said a variable rate tender
could be difficult in times of volatility or uncertainty; 'this is
particularly true near to a real or supposed turnaround in interest rates'.
Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said: 'The
Bundesbank has not made up its mind about what to do yet.' He said it would
stick to a fixed repo until it was evident that a variable repo would not
necessarily take short rates higher.
A further factor affecting the dollar were rumours that Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US treasury secretary, would resign. Mr Bentsen later said the rumours
were 'premature', but traders said his departure would have little impact on
the dollar.
Sentiment towards the dollar clearly continues to improve. Salomon Brothers
has forecast the US currency rising to Y108 in the coming months, while some
bold spirits see it moving as far as DM2.20 by end-1995.
A meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels decided that they need
take no action to alter the fluctuation bands in the exchange rate
mechanism. 'The European Monetary Institute considers it is desirable to
continue with the present arrangements. There will be no judgment on that,'
said Mr Lamberto Dini, Italian treasury minister, after the meeting.
Later, Mr Dini said the Italian government had not yet needed to decide
whether it should rejoin the ERM.
One currency that will be joining the ERM is the Austrian schilling, when
Austria becomes an EU member on January 1. Traders said this would have
little effect on the schilling as it is virtually fixed to the D-Mark.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 205m late
assistance, and Pounds 750m assistance at established rates, after
forecasting a daily shortage of Pounds 1.1bn.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):  UK
tenancy reform lacks incentives for landowners - Without fiscal changes
opportunities for new entrants to agriculture may remain few and far between
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opportunities for young people in any industry are universally regarded as
'a good thing'. New blood brings new ideas that also stimulate those already
involved. Farming is no exception, and one of the means by which this may be
encouraged is through the availability of farms to rent. By relieving the
new entrant of the requirement to purchase land it offers a relatively low
cost way of getting a start.
I started that way myself, renting my first farm, on which I still live,
when I was 20. It was fairly commonplace for a young man to be able to rent
a farm in the late 1950s. But subsequent legislation and developments
designed to avoid its provisions have brought about radical changes in the
UK; and today few new farm tenancies are arranged.
So the announcement in the Queen's speech that a Tenancy Reform Bill to
address the problem and encourage landowners to let more land would be
presented during this session of parliament was, on the face of it, very
good news. Indeed, the government and the Royal Institute of Chartered
Surveyors forecast that the reform, when enacted, would lead to 1m acres
more farmland becoming available for rent. Sadly, I fear their estimates are
wildly optimistic and that, short of fiscal reform, only a few new tenancies
will be created.
Before 1947 most UK farmland was owned by one group - landowners - and
farmed by another - tenants, through a variety of legal agreements. These
were usually written in favour of landowners and it was not unusual for
tenants to be evicted, without compensation for improvements, at the whim of
the owner.
In 1947, as part of a wide-ranging Agricultural Act, Mr Tom Williams, the
Labour agriculture minister, introduced life-time security of tenure for
tenant farmers. The prospect of losing control of their land for many years
together with the ability to sell it, if necessary, at the enhanced price
available with vacant possession, reduced the number of tenancies being
offered. But the supply did not dry up altogether, as I found in 1958.
In 1976, however, another Labour government brought in security of tenure
for three farming generations, provided certain succession criteria were
met. It was a measure that had been introduced in Scotland some years
earlier.
It raised the possibility that, if they entered into new tenancy agreements,
landowners might lose control of their farms for up to 100 years. The
immediate effect was a refusal by landowners to be so hamstrung and to an
extention of the established policy of taking any farms which came vacant
'in hand' - that is farming the land themselves.
Not all landowners were successful at farming, however, and a variety of
arrangements developed whereby owners could derive income from their land
without having to do the job themselves, but also without creating
undesireable tenancies.
In some cases land agents were retained to control managers employed by
owners. Various forms of share-farming were introduced, with the owner
entering into limited partnership arrangements with local farmers or their
sons. Contract farming deals were devised that included full management of
the farm by the contractor and guaranteed landowners a rental equivalent
income as well as a share of the profit after costs. Some cashed in on the
Gladstone v Bower case, which by judicial ruling allowed a licenced tenancy
to run for up to five years without creating a full tenancy.
Furthermore, the owners who entered into contract arrangements, usually for
three years, which has now emerged as the most widespread and popular way
round the present law, also qualify to be taxed under Schedule D rather than
having to pay higher rates when receiving rents, which count as unearned
income; they are the farmers so can reclaim much of their VAT; and as
owner-occupiers their heirs qualify for inheritance tax relief not available
to the owners of let land.
In his budget last week the chancellor did nothing to change those
owner-occupational benefits. It seems to me, therefore, that little has
changed, or will change, when the Tenancy Reform Bill becomes law next year.
The new arrangements for which the Bill provides, which have been thrashed
out over several years by the National Farmers' Unions, the Country
Landowners Association, the Tenant Farmers' Association and the National
Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs contain many sensible and practical
ideas.
There is recognition, for instance, of the desires of both parties for
flexibility. So, no minimum term for tenancies has been set and there will
be more freedom on the uses to which the land is put. For the protection of
tenants there will be mandatory compensation for improvements; provision for
independent arbitration to settle disputes; effective procedures for notice
to quit and a check on rent increases. All are workable, but without the
extra incentive to the landowner that taxation reform would have provided I
doubt the package will prove attractive to many.
I should declare an interest, as a non-executive director of one of the farm
management companies involved in a great deal of the type of contract
farming I have described. But I can see few reasons, other than altruism,
why landowners should decide to give up those significant tax benefits plus
a profit share, for which they qualify under a contract farming arrangement,
in order to let their land under one of the proposed farm business
tenancies.

There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Coloury
liquoring Assams met keen competition and prices advanced 4 to 8 pence.
Plainer North Indians remained about steady. Bright East Africans were
irregular and closed 2 to 4 pence easier but mediums were well supported at
fully firm rates. Better liquoring Ceylons held firm but poorer sorts were
often eaiser. Medium Zimbabwe, Ceylon and Kenya teas sold well at last
levels but plainer descriptions were lower where sold. Quotations: best
available 160p/kg, good 135p/kg, good medium 125p/kg, medium 110p/kg, low
medium 78p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 161p/kg for a Kenya

FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the International Natural Rubber Organisation have agreed to a
year's extension of the existing world rubber pact.
A meeting here of Inro, which groups six rubber exporting nations and 21
consumer countries, decided that the extension was necessary for the 'final
negotiation of the new agreement'. Whether to grant an extension to the
existing rubber pact, which stabilises prices through a buffer stock system,
or negotiate a new agreement has been argued between producers and consumers
for several months.
However, producers concerns have been tempered by a recent upsurge in
natural rubber prices. Tight supply and growing demand, particularly China,
have pushed prices to the highest level for six years.
At its meeting Inro said it was concerned that high prices had created a
very volatile market and that heavy speculation by some traders had resulted
in contract defaults. It said positive action was needed to restore order,
confidence and credibility in the market.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt sees Uruguay Round
settlement lifting cheese exports by 50 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Cheese exports could increase by up to 50 per cent as a result of market
opening moves under the Uruguay Round trade pact, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade says in a report out today.
Gatt's latest annual survey of the world dairy market says the phased
reduction of tariffs and establishment of minimum access levels for dairy
products will provide new export opportunities in what has been hitherto one
of the most protected of all industries.
Under the Uruguay Round deal, which is due to come into effect on January 1,
countries must offer import access equivalent to at least 3 per cent of
total consumption, rising to 6 per cent after six years.
For cheese this translates into additional imports of 110,000 tonnes (up
from 213,286 tonnes to 323,819 tonnes), the EU market alone accounting for
an extra 86,000 tonnes. For milk powder and butter the extra access is more
modest at 13 per cent (53,000 tonnes) and 21 per cent (22,000 tonnes)
respectively.
The trade pact also requires almost all import restrictions to be converted
into tariffs and reduced by 36 per cent by the end of the decade. Even after
these cuts dairy tariffs will sometimes be very high  - over 100 per cent
for Canada, Norway, Finland and Poland, among others.
However, Gatt points out that for exporters the tariffs, which normally
cannot be raised again, are a more transparent and predictable form of trade
protection than the plethora of import quotas and variable levies they are
replacing.
Competitive exporters will also benefit from the planned export subsidy
cuts. Gatt notes that the actual decrease will be higher than the required
21 per cent over six years because exports, especially of cheese, have risen
since the 1986-90 reference period.
Reviewing the current market situation, Gatt says world milk production
continued to decline this year, with lower output in Europe - especially in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - outweighing record production
in Australia and New Zealand.
World production and consumption of butter are also on a long-term
downtrend. But cheese production is rising and an even faster increase in
demand for cheese is expected to sustain high prices and buoyant exports.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Virgin Islands closure to
reduce alumina surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation (Vialco) will shut its refinery in the
West Indies for at least a year taking between 600,000 and 610,000 tonnes
off the market.
Analysts said the alumina (aluminium oxide) market would still remain
significantly in surplus in 1995. 'But the closure might change sentiment a
little and allow some producers to pass on in higher prices some of the cost
increases they face,' said Mr Tim Armstrong, at the CRU International
consultancy organisation.
Glencore, the Switzerland-based international trading organisation that
indirectly owns Vialco, blamed market conditions for the temporary closure,
which takes affect by the end of this year. While not disclosing Vialco's
production costs, Glencore admitted the plant was not breaking even at
present alumina prices. The plant would be kept 'in operational readiness'.
Mr Armstrong estimated that there would be a 600,000-tonnes alumina surplus
next year, despite the Vialco closure.
The alumina market is suffering because about 1m tonnes of western world
aluminium capacity has been shut down in the past year following the
international trade agreement between some of the major producing countries.
A further 300,000 tonnes has been cut in Russia.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mild weather undermines oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices weakened further yesterday as unseasonably warm weather persisted
in many parts of Europe and the US.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for January fell to Dollars 15.90 in
late London trading, more than a dollar down from Thursday's close.
Recent temperatures in Europe have been 2' to 5' C above normal. Mild
weather is also affecting the north-east and mid-west regions of the US,
where demand for heating oil is 19 to 28 per cent below normal for this time
of year.
World crude oil prices were also dragged down yesterday by sharp falls in
the price of petrol in the US.
Petrol prices were affected by reports that some areas that were to
introduce reformulated gasoline on January 1 were about to pull out of the
programme. US cities with severe smog problems are required to introduce the
fuel, but other areas have volunteered to join the programme.
US refineries had been strong buyers of crude oil in recent weeks to ensure
that adequate stocks of reformulated fuel were available.
Fears of withdrawals from the programme left markets 'believing that
reformulated gasoline will be in over-supply rather than under-supply',
according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at the London office
of US brokers Smith Barney.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver's retreat continues -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER yesterday continued to lead the retreat of precious metals prices,
closing 27.5 cents down in London at Dollars 4.65 a troy ounce. GOLD ended
at Dollars 376.70, down Dollars 2.50, slightly up from an earlier 3 1/2
 month low. 'Silver did most of the hard work on the way up and it will
probably do the same on the way down,' one analyst said.
Wide swings in London Metal Exchange NICKEL prices resulted in a nervous
day's trading throughout the base metals complex and all contracts ended
sharply down.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices fall from Friday's
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell from Friday's highs yesterday as the yield curve
continued to flatten.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at
95 3/32 , yielding 7.925 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was  1/4 lower at 99 13/32 , yielding 7.560 per cent.
Most analysts attributed yesterday's declines to a slight correction from
Friday's highs rather than to a reversal of the more bullish tone the market
has adopted of late. On Friday, the long bond price was up more than a point
and the yield fell back below 8 per cent.
Many economists believe the market has at last accepted the Federal
Reserve's promises to take a tough stance against inflation. One sign of
this is the steadily flattening yield curve, which is an indication that the
market expects an economic slowdown.
The difference between the yield on the two-year bond and the 30-year bond
held near 36 basis points yesterday morning, down from 120 points in October
and 210 points this time last year.
News that sales of single-family home sales increased slightly also helped
push prices lower mid-morning. The Commerce Department reported sales of
such houses increased by 1.3 per cent in October, whereas economists had
expected a slight decrease. A report on car sales showed the November figure
only slightly above economists' expectations.
While long-dated government bonds in many European markets drifted sideways
in calm trading, the shorter-dated sectors of their yield curves - notably
in the UK and Germany - remained under pressure amid continued talk of
monetary tightening.
In the UK, the short end of the yield curve was depressed by jitters ahead
of today's parliamentary vote on raising VAT on domestic fuel.
'Some people are worried that if the government loses the VAT vote, the lack
of fiscal tightening will have to be compensated by monetary tightening,'
said Mr Adrian James of NatWest Markets.
The proximity of tomorrow's monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank
of England, exacerbated fears of an imminent base rate rise, although many
dealers do not expect another move until early next year.
At the longer end, prices softened ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2bn
of 8.5 per cent gilts due 2005. Dealers reported little investor demand for
the issue. 'The market will probably have to cheapen up a bit more to
generate any client interest,' said one.
The March long gilt futures contract eased by  13/32 to 101 and the March
short-sterling future fell 0.16 to 92.63.
German bonds closed lower in a session dominated by roll-over activity in
the Bund future ahead of the December contract's expiry.
The short end was depressed by renewed talk that the interest rate easing
cycle has ended, and by forecasts from Salomon Brothers that Germany will
start tightening in the first half of 1995.
Most dealers are not expecting any monetary policy changes at Thursday's
Bundesbank council meeting, especially after council member Mr Gerd Haeusler
yesterday said that the central bank would stick to fixed-rate securities
repurchase agreements in the near term.
The March Bund future on Liffe ended around 91.20, down 0.27 on the day. The
March three-month euromark future fell by 0.10 to 94.56.
French bonds continued their recent out-performance of the German market,
with their 10-year yield spread over Bunds narrowing to 49 basis points from
52 on Friday. However, some observers said that trend could be reversed
soon.
'We believe that, given the political risk premium associated with French
assets, this spread-tightening has been overdone and we look for this to
widen over the next few weeks to around 75 basis points,' said analysts at
Yamaichi International.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Spain launches DM2.5bn fixed-rate
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Spain yesterday launched a DM2.5bn offering of five-year
eurobonds, the largest fixed-rate D-Mark issue this year.
The bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points over German bunds of the same
maturity and met demand from central banks and investment funds across
Europe and in the Far East, said joint lead manager Commerzbank.
Commerzbank said pricing compared favourably with other recent five-year
D-Mark issues trading in the market, such as those by the World Bank and
Belgium. These are currently trading at around six and five basis points
respectively above US Treasuries. Commerzbank reported some switching by
investors out of the latter issues into the new Spanish offering.
However, dealers said the bonds were expensive compared with domestic German
bonds, which are currently trading at around 35 basis points over bunds.
'With that pricing, it is difficult to see a strong (German) bid for the
paper,' said one dealer. However, Commerzbank said that it had kept the main
part of the offering to place itself and a third of that 'is already in firm
hands'.
Spain last came to the D-Mark sector in February 1993 with a DM4bn 10-year
offering.
In the dollar sector, Nordic Investment Bank launched a Dollars 250m
offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 12 1/2 basis points over US
Treasuries.
Lead manager Nomura said the bonds met the strongest demand from central
banks and institutional investors in Asia and Europe. Market sources said
the proceeds were swapped.
In the Canadian dollar sector, GECC launched a CDollars 100m offering
targeted at retail investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries.
Wood Gundy, the lead manager, said it had seen significant interest in the
short-end of the Canadian dollar sector recently and pricing spreads on
existing bonds of a similar credit had narrowed sharply.
The issue was priced to yield 12 basis points over Canadian government
bonds. Wood Gundy said significant demand came from investors switching out
of longer-dated bonds.
Midland Bank launched a Dollars 400m offering of 10-year yankee bonds, in a
deal lead-managed by J. P. Morgan.
All eyes in the market today and tomorrow will be on the expected launch by
South Africa of its long-awaited Dollars 500m global offering of five-year
bonds, with a December payment date and expected pricing of 170 to 200 basis
points over US Treasuries.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Syndicated Loans: Sweden jumbo Dollars 5bn deal gets good
response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response to the jumbo loan for Sweden, which is now in general
syndication via Citibank and J. P. Morgan, is said to be 'very encouraging'.
Underwriting for the Dollars 5bn loan was finalised last week and
syndication is likely to be finalised before Christmas, with signing in
early January.
A Pounds 520m loan to build a 750MW power station on Humberside has been
oversubscribed almost 100 per cent.
This is the first large financing for a UK power project for 2 1/2 years,
since power stations at Barking in London, Medway in Kent, Keadby in
Yorkshire, and Derwent in the Midlands were announced.
Some 40 banks offered a total of more than Pounds 1bn for the Humber Power
loan, arranged by NatWest Markets and UBS. They are mainly European, with
strong support from Japan, with underwriting by ABN Amro, CIBC, NatWest
Markets and UBS.
Syndication closed last week for the loan, which runs for 17 1/2 years, and
is priced at 125 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor)
during construction. After construction, pricing changes to 115 basis points
over Libor, rising to 135 basis points over. Citibank and Toronto-Dominion
Bank are arranging and underwriting a Pounds 400m revolving facility for
BSkyB, the satellite television group which is to float this week. Trading
in the shares is due to start on Thursday, the day the loan is to be
launched into general syndication. The loan price varies between 37 1/2
basis points over Libor and 87 1/2 over, depending on the company's
financial performance. Proceeds from the share issue and the loan will be
used to repay shareholder loans. This will leave BSkyB with Pounds 900m of
bank debt, and equity with a market capitalisation exceeding Pounds 4bn.
Syndication closed last week on a Dollars 900m loan for Instituto de Credito
Oficial, a Spanish public law institution which carries out credit
transactions for the Spanish government, and is rated Aa2. The four-year
loan, arranged by Argentaria, Deutsche Bank and NatWest Markets, has a
facility fee of 6 1/2 basis points and a margin of 6 basis points. Banks
offered Dollars 1.5bn and allocation has not yet taken place.
Carrefour, the French supermarket group, has asked J. P. Morgan with
co-arranger UBS to syndicate a FFr3bn (Dollars 600m), five-year
multi-currency loan through a group of banks, most of which already have a
relationship with the company. The drawn cost will be between 20 and 25
basis points over Libor.
Midland and NatWest Markets have launched into syndication a Pounds 300m
multicurrency loan with a swing-line facility for Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
Anglo-French paper group, with a price of 20 basis points over Libor.
NatWest Markets is arranging a seven-year, Pounds 140m loan for SHV Macro,
the Dutch wholesale and retail foods group. The loan is priced at 22 1/2
basis points over Libor for first five years then 25 over Libor for the last
two.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tokyo exchange acts to stem the
foreign exodus - Reforms aim at emerging economy companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is set to make the first serious response by
Japanese authorities to the haemorrhage of international financial business
from Tokyo.
Later this month the TSE will announce sweeping changes to its notoriously
prohibitive rules that prevent many foreign companies from listing. The aim
is to revitalise the virtually moribund foreign companies' section of the
exchange.
But the reforms will also mark a shift in strategy by the exchange in its
development of Tokyo's role as a capital market. It will target companies
from the emerging economies, rather those from Europe and the US which have
been deserting the exchange.
The exchange's foreign section has been the most startling casualty of the
dearth of equity trading on the stock market in the past few years.
In the 1980s, as listings on international exchanges became fashionable for
companies wanting to be seen as 'global', big companies flocked to Tokyo to
gain direct access to the world's fastest growing pool of capital.
The total number of foreign companies listed on the TSE mushroomed from a
handful in the early 1980s to 127 by 1990.
That influx was reflected in the busy trade that the shares attracted - on
average more than 800,000 changed hands daily in 1989 at the peak of Japan's
financial boom. However, since then a Tokyo stock exchange listing has lost
its lustre.
In the past year names like Eastman Kodak, Scott Paper and British Gas have
left the exchange and by next summer the total of listed foreign companies
is expected to be below 90.
Most fugitives have cited the lack of activity in their shares. Trading
volume has fallen from an average of about 2m shares a day in 1989, to fewer
than 180,000 so far this year. Most days many listed companies report no
trades at all.
With no immediate prospects of a recovery in the Japanese equity market, the
costs of maintaining a listing - up to Y10m (Dollars 100,000) per year - no
longer match the supposed benefits.
But instead of trying to win back the departing big-name foreigners, the
TSE's efforts will be concentrated on attracting new companies to replace
them.
Although the exchange will not admit it publicly, it is clear that it
believes the future for its international section lies in constructing a
financial workshop producing capital for companies from emerging economies,
and not in providing a boutique for the largest names in global business.
There is growing scepticism in financial circles about the advantages for a
large international corporation in having its shares listed on a foreign
stock exchange.
'Why should they?' says a senior executive at a foreign bank in Tokyo.
'There is absolutely no need for a large European or American company to be
listed anywhere other than in London or New York. If a Japanese investor
wants to buy British Gas shares, he can do so directly by trading in
London.'
In an increasingly global market, facilitated by off-hours trading, the
much-vaunted advantages of a listing in Tokyo are marginal.
However, for new companies in Asia the advantages of a foreign listing are
much more obvious. Double-digit growth rates in Asia are spawning thousands
of businesses seeking access to capital.
Their own national stock markets, although a good starting point, lack the
international profile of one of the large exchanges.
What has most alarmed Japanese authorities in the last year is that many of
these Asian businesses - including large newly-privatised Chinese entities
and south-east Asian manufacturers - have chosen Hong Kong or New York.
The main reason is that most of them are excluded by Tokyo's listing
requirements - which include a ruling that requires companies to have assets
of at least Y200bn, and profits no lower than Y20bn for three years.
The rule changes to be approved this month will remove most of those
barriers. The TSE's aim is to become Asia's main stock market.
'These reforms can pave the way for at least 200 east Asian companies to
join the exchange in the next few years,' said Mr Mitsuhide Yamaguchi,
president of the TSE, last month.
There are doubts whether the strategy will work. International brokers in
Tokyo point out that company decisions about where to list are made mainly
on the type of investor it wants to attract - and they may not necessarily
favour Japan.
But the TSE's moves are widely welcomed.
'Any measures that improve access to Japan's financial markets in this more
difficult trading environment are to be loudly applauded,' says Mr Peter
Fenichel, president of BZW Securities in Tokyo.
The proof of the new openness will be in the number of Asian companies that
now turn to Tokyo. But that is not entirely within the TSE's control.
The bulk of the regulations that have stifled business come from the
ministry of finance - a tax on equity-trading is perhaps the most
prohibitive.
Unless the ministry decides to make further efforts to liberalise the
market, the success of the TSE's reforms will be limited.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody liquidates
Japanese operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tokyo's becalmed financial markets suffered a further setback yesterday when
Kidder Peabody, the US securities company, announced that it was liquidating
its Japanese operations with the loss of up to 100 jobs.
The company said that it was closing its Tokyo and Osaka branches and
selling its memberships of the two cities' stock exchanges. The withdrawal
follows Kidder's takeover earlier this year by fellow US broker PaineWebber.
PaineWebber is not a member of the Japanese exchanges, and General Electric,
Kidder's parent company, had hoped to effect a smooth transfer by selling
its memberships to PaineWebber, but it appears that the new owners of Kidder
turned down the offer.
'In the end Kidder Peabody and PaineWebber simply had different strategies,'
said Mr Takao Sakuma, Kidder general manager in Tokyo.
Kidder now hopes to sell its memberships to a third party.
Of the company's approximately 140 employees in Japan, about 40 are expected
to be transferred to PaineWebber and the company will attempt to persuade
the buyer of its memberships to hire as many as possible, Mr Sakuma said.
'But in the worst case, about 100 people will have to seek employment,' he
added.
Redundancies on this scale have been rare in Japan, even in the recent
recession.
Staff had known since the takeover by PaineWebber two months ago that their
future was uncertain, but there was still dismay when they were told
yesterday.
'Obviously most people were expecting something like this, but it's a big
disappointment to them,' said one employee.
Mr Sakuma said that the company's Japanese operations had been profitable in
the six months to the end of September.
However, reports of its imminent demise, which began circulating shortly
after the takeover, brought business to a near standstill. As a result, the
company would probably record a loss for the year for the first time since
it opened a Japanese branch in 1983, he said.
The staff transferring to PaineWebber are mainly on the bond-trading side.
PaineWebber is understood to be keen to build up its fixed interest business
in Tokyo, but not to be interested in equity trading.
Stock trading volumes have been depressed for several years on the TSE and
most domestic stockbrokers are operating at below break-even levels. Foreign
institutions have fared little better.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said non-members would be invited to apply directly
to Kidder for the purchase of the exchange membership by no later than
December 19.
Financial sources indicated yesterday that two companies, the UK brokers
Smith New Court and the French company Paribas Capital Markets, had shown
interest in TSE membership. But Kidder is understood to be keen to sell the
TSE membership as a package with membership of the Osaka Stock Exchange.
The liquidation is the first of a TSE member company since 1968, and it is
the third case of a foreign broker giving up its membership in the past two
years.
The UK's County NatWest and the US company Prudential Securities, the two
previous cases, cited poor trading conditions as the reason for their
departure.

30% rise in first half

CSR, the Australian building products, sugar and aluminium group, yesterday
announced a 30 per cent increase in after-tax profits to ADollars 225.2m
(USDollars 173.2m) for the six months to end-September, and forecast that
full-year figures would show a 'substantial improvement over the previous
year'.
CSR combined news of its first-half figures with the announcement of two
deals in the Asia-Pacific region.
The first was the purchase for ADollars 71m of a 70 per cent stake in a
timber business in China's Hunan province, and the second an ADollars 8m
investment in a plasterboard company in Beijing.
CSR said its aim was to invest ADollars 600m in the region by the end of
1996.
Because much of the investment would be through joint ventures, the
underlying asset exposure would be about ADollars 1bn, said Mr Geoffrey
Kells, managing director.
The company also said that it would 'vigorously defend' a legal claim by
Mackay Refined Sugar, alleging that CSR attempted to force its rival out of
the refined sugar market by predatory pricing.
The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, announced
last month that it would look into the matter.
CSR has maintained that all its sales were made at above the costs of
supplying the sugar concerned.
CSR achieved the profits increase on a 12 per cent rise in sales to ADollars
3.17bn.
Earnings per share rose by 25 per cent to 24.7 cents, and the interim
dividend was increased by 17 per cent to 14 cents.
The company said that all divisions reported an improvementin profits, with
timber and aluminium posting the strongest gains, of 47 per cent and 36 per
cent respectively.
There has been some concern that the slowdown in Australia's housing market
would hurt the company's financial performance in the next financial year.
However, CSR stressed that it expected further profits growth in the 1995/96
year.
CSR's shares strengthened, rising 12 cents to ADollars 4.52.

<TEXT>
Barito Pacific, the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood producer, said
its net profit in the nine months to September 30 fell 35 per cent from a
year earlier following a slump in world plywood prices. The Indonesian
company's earnings were also hit by a delay in the renewal of its timber
concession licences.
Net income fell to Rp142.3bn (Dollars 45m) from Rp220.1bn. Sales dropped to
Rp696.6bn from Rp778 bn.
Income from operations dipped to Rp95.2bn from Rp276.4bn mainly because of a
two-month delay in the renewal of licences for its concessions, forcing the
timber giant to buy timber from other logging companies.
Higher log transportation costs were also to blame for increased operating
expenses, which climbed to Rp98bn from Rp72.7bn.
In June this year, Indonesia's ministry of forestry took over 49 per cent of
the shares in two concessions supplying Barito Pacific as punishment for
what it said was irresponsible forest management.
The move was followed by pledges from the forestry minister, Mr Djamaldun
Suryohadikusomo, to crack down on logging offenders.

<TEXT>
Optus Vision, the consortium which was formed to build a broadband cable
network across Australia and includes Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing &amp;
Broadcasting group and Optus, the telecommunications carrier, said yesterday
that it remained intact.
It added that it was holding talks with the Australian government over the
latter's stance on cable infrastructure regulation.
The future of the consortium was thrown into doubt when Mr Michael Lee, the
federal minister for communications, said he would not allow monopolies in
cable infrastructure and would not act to stop geographical duplication of
the networks planned by Optus Vision and Telstra.
P&amp;B has already withdrawn from a potential ADollars 318m (USDollars
245m)investment in Optus as a result.
However, Mr Bob Mansfield, head of Optus, said he hoped the government's
stance would be clarified by Christmas.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, admitted that the US-based company
had been lined up to supply programmes to the Optus Vision pay-TV project,
and now looked to be without an infrastructure supplier. He added, however,
that the chapter was not closed.

military use, according to a local radio report. The company earned profits
of Yn79m (Dollars 9.3m) this year.
In the period from January to October this year, Changhe produced Yn580m in

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Samsung's designs worry its
rivals - Korea's other carmakers fear overcapacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung yesterday formally applied for government approval to begin
passenger car production by 1998 in a move that could prove risky for South
Korea's second largest industrial group and the nation's car industry.
Korea's four carmakers have called on the government to reject Samsung's
plan, al-though that appears unlikely.
The chief concern is that Samsung's entry will lead to overcapacity when the
Korean car industry is planning to almost triple car production from 2.5m to
6m vehicles annually by the end of the decade, which would make Korea the
world's fourth biggest car manufacturer.
Each of Korea's big three car companies - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - wants to
produce 2m vehicles, while Ssangyong has a modest goal of 150,000 cars.
Samsung would add another 500,000 cars by 2002 and hopes to reach 1.5m.
'That is too many cars, given the slowdown in domestic sales, although
exports are rising due to the weak Korean currency. The optimum figure for
production is probably around 3.5m,' said Mr Chung Tae-seung, director of
overseas sales for Kia Motors.
The industry benefits from a highly-protected domestic market, although
trade barriers are likely to be reduced in the next few years under pressure
from the US and the EU.
Carmakers have expressed worries that Samsung will recruit engineers from
rivals, causing a bidding war that would lead to higher wages. Moreover,
Korea's car components base is under strain by the growth in production.
Samsung's technical alliance with Nissan of Japan may also set back efforts
to promote automotive technological independence and increase imports of
parts that would deepen Korea's Dollars 12bn trade deficit with Japan,
according to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Although the government shared many of these doubts and tried to persuade
Samsung to drop its plan, it finally approved the Dollars 5bn project after
Samsung agreed to take measures to avoid disrupting the automotive industry.
Samsung will hire engineers from the US and other foreign countries, while
promising to invest in the growth of the domestic car components industry.
It pledged to export 55 per cent of its output of 500,000 vehicles by 2002
to reduce the threat of harming domestic sales of the other carmakers. But
rivals remain sceptical about Samsung's measures. 'Samsung has a history of
breaking its promises. It promised, for example, not to enter the car
industry several years ago when it gained government approval for truck
production,' said a Hyundai Motor official.
Samsung has long sought to enter the car industry to reduce its dependence
on electronics by developing its heavy machinery business. It believes car
production will deliver synergy benefits for its electronics operations
since cars are increasingly relying on electronic components.
Its automotive ambitions reflect the personal interest of Mr Lee Kun-hee,
the Samsung chairman, who is an enthus-iastic collector of racing cars.
Samsung has argued that its car project would benefit Korea since it would
acquire advanced automotive technology from Nissan, which would help the
country's export competitiveness.
It said the programme would create jobs for Pusan, the home town and
political base of President Kim Young-sam. Pusan has suffered job losses due
to the decline of its textile and footwear industry.
Analysts question whether Samsung should be devoting considerable financial
resources to car production. This will divert money from its electronics
business when it needs to spend vast sums on the development and production
of advanced semiconductor chips and other costly programmes to strengthen
its position as one of the world's leading electronics companies.
However, Samsung said it would be able to help finance the car company
through the sale of subsidiaries in the textile, food and retail industries.
There are doubts whether Samsung can achieve success by emphasising car
exports.
'No car company has survived by concentrating on exports, at least
initially,' said Mr Kim Chul-su, the trade and industry minister, in a
recent interview before he decided to endorse Samsung's bid.
Samsung may succeed if it forces one or two competitors out of the car
industry. Samsung made an apparent attempt last year to take over Kia,
although it was blocked by the government.
Some analysts speculate that Ford and Mazda, two of Kia's largest
shareholders with a combined 18 per cent stake, may be willing to sell the
company to Samsung to help improve the finances of troubled Mazda, in which
Ford has a shareholding.
The survival of the loss-making Daewoo and Ssangyong car companies may be
threatened by Samsung.

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's top 25 private sector companies are expected to report net profits
rising by an average of 60 per cent in 1994-95, with infrastructure and
construction concerns leading the way, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Analysts also forecast net sales to rise by an average 32 per cent for the
current year, according to a poll of 16 securities houses conducted by
Reuter.
'India's liberalisation programme seems to be bearing fruit,' said Mr Asit
Mehta of Nucleus Securities. 'The tiger is coming out of the cage.'
The rise in sales is being triggered by the government's market-oriented
reform programme, which has removed many barriers and obstacles to growth
and raised manufacturing capacity.
Economists expect India's industrial production in 1994-95 to more than
double to 7 to 8 per cent and the economy to grow by around 5.5 per cent.
Analysts say a rise in disposable income will lead to higher demand for
consumer durables and cars.
Falling interest rates and increased borrowing through domestic and
Euro-issues has helped companies cut their financing costs.
Over 50 companies have raised Dollars 4.8bn since the first Indian company
tapped the overseas markets in mid-1992.
Associated Cement Companies, India's largest cement producer, topped the
poll with a projected 177 per cent rise in its net profit to Rs1.68bn
(Dollars 53.5m) for the year ending March 1995.
Analysts say that a boom in the infrastructure sector and construction
activity has led to rapid growth in demand for cement.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Born-again Magma branches out -
The US copper producer has bright prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few years ago Magma Copper, the second-largest US producer, was
unloved and unwanted - spun-off to fend for itself by an uncaring parent,
Newmont Mining. 'Our future was uncertain,' recalls Mr Burgess Winter,
president. 'There were those who doubted whether we could survive.'
Magma, however, has joined that happy band known as the Lazarus
corporations, brought back from the dead by a new management team. And to
confirm it is no zombie, it made two landmark moves in the space of a few
days.
First, it won the auction for Tintaya, Peru's second-largest copper
producer, with a bid worth USDollars 250m. The deal, completed at the end of
November, takes Magma outside the US for the first time.
It also announced it had final permission for its Dollars 300m Robinson
project, and immediately started construction of what is expected to be a
world-class, copper-gold mine near Ely, Nevada.
'These two events are of significant strategic importance for Magma,' says
Mr Winter. His management team set itself a strategic target of having by
the end of 1996 some 10bn lbs of recoverable copper in Magma's reserves, and
to be producing 750m lbs of copper from its own mines at a net operating
cost of less than 50 cents a lb.
With Tintaya and Robinson in the bag, 'these targets are definitely
achievable,' he says. 'They also give us a strong start towards our goal for
the year 2000: production of 1bn lbs a year.'
Magma has come a long way since 1987 when it was spun off by Newmont. At
that time, it was the highest-cost copper producer in the US, loaded with
debt, and it had only limited ore reserves.
Some of its troubles stemmed from an amazingly generous labour contract
involving an ill-conceived bonus scheme that linked payments to copper's
market price. The scheme generated bonuses of up to Dollars 5.50 an hour,
and ate up nearly all Magma's profits - some Dollars 55m  - between 1987 and
1988m. It had to borrow high-interest money to cope.
Mr Winter was recruited and, with a new management team, he launched a
survival strategy that required a complete change of culture. It demanded a
new approach to labour relations, increased productivity, cost cuts and a
re-focusing on the core business of producing copper profitably.
Those core operations were its three mines in Arizona: San Manuel, Pinto
Valley and Superior, plus the San Manuel smelter. San Manuel underwent a
Dollars 250m modernisation, completed in 1989, and a subsequent Dollars 100m
expansion. It is now said to be the lowest-cost and most environmentally
sound smelter in North America.
Costs at the Arizona operations have been substantially reduced: net
operating cash costs are down from 78 cents a lb to 58 cents, and are
forecast to fall to 50 cents by the end of 1996. Productivity at the mines
is up 86 per cent since 1988, and copper production has been lifted from
274m lbs to 600m.
This has been partly achieved through improved employee relations that
culminated in 1991 with an historic 15-year labour contract. The agreement
allows costs to be strictly controlled, and eliminates the possibility of
strikes or lock-outs for seven years.
It also provided the key to the development of a new ore body, called
Kalamazoo, at the San Manuel underground mine, where reserves were due to
run out in 1997. Kalamazoo will cost Dollars 140m and will extend the mine
life at least until 2009. It is expected to start up in late 1996, producing
200m lbs of copper a year.
Development of the Robinson ore body in Nevada was supposed to dovetail with
the second expansion of the San Manuel smelter, which took its annual
capacity to 720m lbs. However, permission problems delayed Robinson. This
has not harmed Magma, which has been able to sell all the extra smelting
capacity.
Magma is the only US producer to do any significant volume of custom
smelting on a regular basis. Mr Winter says it is a good business and one
the group intends to nurture.
On October 11, Magma received the final permit and started construction
immediately. Production from Robinson is scheduled to begin in the first
quarter of 1996 at an annual rate of 135m lbs, with projected net cash
operating costs of less than 50 cents a lb. The present mine life is 16
years, but Mr Winter insists 'there is excellent exploration potential that
could extend the current mine life'.
Although Magma is not short of cash, and gearing is a modest 36 per cent
compared with nearly 60 per cent in 1988, it initiated a copper price
protection scheme for 1995, when spending peaks. This guarantees a minimum
realised price of 84 cents a lb for most of its projected output.
The programme consists mostly of put options, which allow the company to get
some benefits if the price is above 84 cents. Mr Doug Purdom, chief
financial officer, says the cost was 'modest,' and 'the price protection
scheme makes sure we can get Robinson into operation whatever happens to the
copper price'.
Magma first showed its interest in moving outside the US when it bid for 51
per cent of the El Abra copper mine in Chile, in partnership with Broken
Hill Proprietary of Australia. However, their bid of Dollars 240m was well
below the Dollars 330m eventually paid by US rival Cyprus Amax.
Magma bid Dollars 218m for Tintaya at an auction in Peru, where the
government is privatising many of its mining assets. This was only Dollars
4m more than the next closest bidder, Metall Mining of Canada, and, to Mr
Winter's delight, only Dollars 27m more than RTZ of the UK, which has a
reputation for driving hard bargains.
The total cost of acquiring Tintaya will be Dollars 250m, as Magma must also
provide Dollars 55m of Peruvian debt at face value (but the discounted cost
of this debt is Dollars 30m to Dollars 35m.)
Tintaya, located at an altitude of 4,100 metres in the mountains near Yauri
in southern Peru, has been in operation since 1985 and will generate
cashflow for Magma from the outset. At present, it produces 111m lbs of
copper a year at a net cash operating cost of 60 cents a lb. By increasing
the output to 135m lbs, and introducing new equipment to replace Russian
trucks, productivity should improve and Magma expects to cut costs to 55
cents.
Magma has guaranteed it will spend Dollars 85m to improve Tintaya, and it
should have no difficulty fulfilling this promise, particularly if a scheme
to produce copper by the so-called solvent-extraction, electro-winning
process, proves viable.
Tintaya has reported losses every year since it started up, but Mr Purdom
blames this on the debt that the government has burdened it with. In 1993,
and so far in 1994, the mine has generated a big flow of cash. Nevertheless,
Magma hopes to raise about Dollars 100m of debt in Peru some time next year
to reduce its equity risk. 'Also, we need a bit more cash than we can
generate from cashflow for things we want to do,' he says.
Mr Winter says Magma will work hard on improving productivity at the mine,
and that will mean sacking some of the present 780 employees. However, he
insists efficiency is low mainly because of the calibre of the mining
equipment.
Meanwhile, says Mr Winter, Magma is still looking for longer-term projects
in Mexico and Chile, as well as Peru.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: California Energy to acquire
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
California Energy is to acquire its fellow Californian power supplier, Magma
Power, in an increased bid worth Dollars 950m.
The agreed deal ends a two-month battle in which Magma rejected California
Energy's approaches, and creates what is claimed to be the world's biggest
independent producer of geothermal energy.
It also represents an abrupt volte-face for California Energy, which on
Friday terminated its earlier offer worth Dollars 924m in the face of
alleged opposition from Magma shareholders. Dow Chemical, which owns 20 per
cent of Magma, said it was 'delighted' with the higher offer.
The combined group will have sales of more than Dollars 400m, with Magma
contributing just over half. Both companies specialise in geothermal energy,
whereby electricity is generated by heat from the earth's interior.
Both are active as owners and operators of power plants throughout the US
and in the Philippines and Indonesia. South-east Asia is seen as the main
growth market for geothermal energy.
California Energy said the combined output of the group would be 545MW of
power, with a further 530MW under construction. Magma has started building a
plant in the Philippines with 231MW capacity.
The bid values Magma's shares at Dollars 39, made up of Dollars 28.50 in
cash and the rest in California Energy shares. This compares with an
original bid in September of Dollars 35, subsequently raised to Dollars
38.50. Magma had contested both bids, adopting a poison pill shareholder
scheme and seeking a court injunction against California Energy acquiring
shares under a tender offer.
Mr Paul Pankratz, chairman of Magma, said: 'We believe this transaction
reflects Magma's inherent strengths and outstanding prospects.'
Magma's shares yesterday closed up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 37 3/8, while
California Energy's fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 5/8.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: New-issue downturn hits Wall St
underwriting fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fees Wall Street investment banks earn underwriting stock and junk bond
offerings have fallen to all-time lows this year because of the sharp
downturn in business activity, according to a report by Securities Data, the
New Jersey-based financial information group.
Although fees have fallen in all categories, the record lows for initial
public offerings (IPOs) of stock and junk bonds are especially worrying
because underwriting these types of issues is traditionally among the
highest-paying business on Wall Street. Consequently, investment banks are
hit twice: the volume of underwriting business is falling, and the fees they
earn on that business are also falling.
Securities Data says that IPO fees - traditionally the highest because the
risk firms take on when selling the stock of newly-floated companies is
greater than in other areas of underwriting - have fallen 7 per cent in the
last year.
Today, firms are charging 6.7 per cent of the principal amount of each
issue, compared with 7.2 per cent a year ago. For example, if an underwriter
sells Dollars 100m of stock in an IPO, the firm will earn Dollars 6.7m for
its efforts rather than Dollars 7.2m.
Mr Jeff Rainess, an analyst at Securities Data, says: 'Rising short-term
rates are killing the new issuance market, and Wall Street firms are
scrambling to get business.'
In the junk bond market - which, like IPOs, has contracted this year because
of rising US interest rates - fees have fallen 19 per cent, also to a record
low. Junk bond issues are now charged at 2.1 per cent of principal, compared
with 2.6 per cent last year and a high of 4.5 per cent in early 1991.
The biggest decline in underwriting fees, however, has been in the
investment-grade debt category, where the volume of debt issued has plunged
30 per cent this year. Fees on debt issues have dropped 23 per cent, to 0.51
per cent of principal.

<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday joined other film studios
diversifying into video and computer games by launching an interactive
entertainment division.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, announced the creation of
the division, which will co-ordinate Disney's activities in the games and
educational software markets at its headquarters in Burbank, California.
Disney has in the past licensed the rights to develop video games from its
cartoon and film characters to other companies.
However, it recently devised the successful Aladdin and The Lion King games
in conjunction with Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of the Viacom
group. Last month it launched two CD-ROM products: the Aladdin Activity
Center and Disney's Animated StoryBook.
The group is now expanding its Disney Software subsidiary into an
interactive division to accelerate its move into games and educational
software.

Sherritt, the Canadian resource group, has signed a joint venture agreement
with Cuba to mine, refine and market nickel and cobalt from an operation in
Moa Bay, on the Caribbean island.
Sherritt will gain long-term feed for its Alberta nickel refinery, while
Cuba will benefit from modernisation of the mine and an increase in capacity
from 20,000 to 24,000 tonnes yearly, at a cost of USDollars 140m.
Sherritt has for some time refined Cuban nickel and cobalt in Alberta.
'The mine urgently needs refurbishing, and it is now operating at about
13,000 tonnes yearly,' said Mr Ian Delaney, Sherritt chairman. He said the
Moa Bay reserves were sufficient for 50 years.
Sherritt is also a fertiliser producer, is active in metallurgical research,
and operates an upstream oil and gas unit.

<TEXT>
Pakhoed, the Dutch oil and chemical storage group, is to buy 66 per cent of
Lambert Riviere, a French chemicals distributor. It plans to launch a public
offer for the remaining shares in early 1995.
The Dutch company said the Halliez family of France had agreed to sell its
66 per cent stake in the company at FFr470 per share.
Pakhoed's public offer in France, scheduled to take place after the family
sale is completed in January, will be made at the same price per share.
If all the shares are tendered, the acquisition will cost Pakhoed about
FFr408m (Dollars 75m).
Lambert Riviere, with annual turnover of more than FFr1.6bn, is active in
chemicals distribution in Italy, Spain and Portugal as well as in France.
The agreement marks Pakhoed's second attempt to acquire the company.
Earlier this year, it tried to take over Lambert Riviere through a joint
venture with Univar Corp of the US. After the attempt failed, Pakhoed sold
its 49 per cent stake in the joint venture, Univar Europe, back to Univar.
However, Pakhoed retains a 28 per cent stake in Univar itself.

<TEXT>
Artemis, the holding company which controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the
French retail group, yesterday announced it had sold Primeco, one of the
biggest groups in the US construction equipment rental market, to
Investcorp, the international investment bank.
The French group declined to disclose the amount of the transaction, but
said the assets of the Texas-based company were valued at about Dollars
300m.
Primeco is principally involved in the rental of construction and public
works machinery and in trading activities related to these markets.
Artemis, through which Mr Francois Pinault controls
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, acquired Primeco in the middle of last year. It
bought the company from Pinault-Printemps to reduce the debt burden of the
retail group. Mr Pinault said at that time that he would sell the US company
when conditions were favourable.
The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals by Investcorp, which was
established in the early 1980s by founding shareholders from Arab countries.
In October, the Bahrain-based investment bank completed the acquisition of
Ebel, a leading Swiss manufacturer of luxury watches and in August it bought
Star Market, a leading chain of supermarkets in Boston for Dollars 285m.
Other companies and assets controlled by Investcorp include Gucci, the
luxury goods company, Saks of Fifth Avenue and Tiffany's of the US.
Artemis declined to indicate how the proceeds from the sale of Primeco would
be used.

Teleglobe Inc, Canada's sole overseas telecommunications group, has hired Mr
Paolo Guidi from Sprint to take over as president and chief executive of
Teleglobe International, its primary operating unit, next February.
As president of Sprint International, Mr Guidi helped to forge many of the
US telecommunications group's international alliances.
He held senior executive positions with the US telecoms group GTE and the
Sprint-Alcatel joint venture.
Teleglobe, 24 per cent owned by BCE, serves foreign telecommunications
companies and owns part of the new transatlantic fibre-optic cable.
It will give up its monopoly position in 1997.
Teleglobe recently linked up with TRW of the US to build the USDollars 2bn
Odyssey Global Wireless Communications System, which is due to start up in
1998. This is one of six world low-orbit wireless systems planned to handle
international voice, fax and other services.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Portugal Telecom raises Es240bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-five per cent of state-owned Portugal Telecom is to be sold
simultaneously in Lisbon, London and New York next May in an equity issue
expected to raise about Es240bn (Dollars 1.49bn), the company said
yesterday.
An offer of American Depositary Receipts is to be made in New York. A second
tranche, expected to raise about Es80bn, will be sold in Portugal while a
third, divided into separate sections for UK and international investors, is
to be sold in London.
A consortium headed by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, will lead the
global issue.
The other members are Banco Essi, a Portuguese investment bank, Union Bank
of Switzerland and S. G. Warburg, the London-based investment bank.
Three separate valuations of Portugal Telecom are to be concluded shortly.
The company expects a final value of Es800bn to Es1,000bn. Legislation
setting out the terms of the sale is expected to be approved by the
government later this month.
Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi (CPRM), Portugal's intercontinental
telecommunications operator, which is 49 per cent privately owned, is to be
merged with Portugal Telecom before next year's equity issue, the company
said.
The state's holding in CPRM is to be transferred to Portugal Telecom and
CPRM's private shareholders are to be offered an, as yet, undisclosed price
for their shares.
They will be able to use this offer as credit to acquire Portugal Telecom
shares in May at the initial subscription price, without having to
participate in an auction.
This measure appears to rule out government approval for a proposed
management buy-out of part of CPRM's operations.
The international operations of CPRM, which has 40 overseas subsidiaries,
could be separated from Portugal Telecom in late 1995 or 1996 and partially
privatised.
Portugal Telecom was formed from a merger of three state-owned companies in
July, partly to gain sufficient size to acquire a place in one of the
international telecommunications alliances taking shape. But this will not
necessarily involve the acquisition of large holdings in Portugal Telecom.
It said the equity issue would aim for as wide a dispersal of capital as
possible.
Limits would be fixed on individual acquisitions and Portugal Telecom's
statutes would be 'armour plated' to prevent foreign companies gaining
control.

FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ahold lifted by strong sales in
third term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch-based international supermarket and retail group, said
third-quarter net profit rose by nearly 25 per cent to Fl 90.9m (Dollars
51.4m), reflecting buoyant growth in the Netherlands, the US and Portugal.
The figures took nine-month net profit to Fl 295.4m, an increase of 20.4 per
cent, prompting the company to repeat its earlier forecast that full-year
profits would rise considerably, compared with those of 1993.
The third-quarter rise would have been even more pronounced but for the
weaker dollar, which meant that Ahold's large sales and profits in the US
were translated into guilders at a rate of only Fl 1.75 to the dollar,
against Fl 1.87 a year earlier.
If the dollar had not fallen, Ahold's net profit would have shown an
additional increase of 3.6 percentage points.
In the US - where Ahold operates six supermarket chains that generate half
of total group turnover - operating results were up 26.4 per cent at Dollars
40.3m.
The strong rise was due partly to better results from two chains, Finast and
Edwards, whose formats have been changed to make their prices more
competitive.
In the Netherlands, where Ahold's Albert Heijn supermarket chain is the
market leader, operating results rose 8.9 per cent to Fl 75.9m.
The cost of the chain's new distribution system was again charged against
profits in the quarter, holding back the overall rate of increase.
Ahold's relatively new activities in Portugal lifted profits in the rest of
Europe 49.1 per cent to Fl 22.3m. Start-up costs continued to keep results
in the Czech Republic in the red, but Ahold said results were improved
compared with the same period of 1993.

TransAlta Energy, the Alberta-based power utility, has paid NZDollars 120m
(USDollars 75.9m) for a 49 per cent stake in Capital Power, the main
electric power distributor in Wellington, New Zealand.
The Wellington muncipality retains a 51 per cent interest in Capital Power.
The purchase follows last week's announcement that it was acquiring 20 per
cent of EnergyDirect, which serves an area around Wellington.
TransAlta paid NZDollars 50m for the EnergyDirect stake, which was bought
from Enerco New Zealand.
The Canadian company gained a foothold in New Zealand last year by forging a
partnership with Mercury Energy, formerly the Auckland Electric Power Board,
to design the first independent power station in the country. The 110MW
plant is due to be commissioned next July.
In addition to its Canadian operations, TransAlta has an operating interest
in a 1,400MW hydroelectric station in Argentina.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Conditional consent for Pounds 92m DMGT
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry minister Mr Tim Eggar yesterday gave conditional consent for the
Daily Mail and General Trust to acquire T Bailey Forman, publisher of the
Nottingham Evening Post, for Pounds 92m.
In October the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission unanimously opposed the
acquisition on the grounds that it would give DMGT, publisher of the Daily
Mail, too high a concentration of newspapers in the East Midlands. In order
to be able to go ahead with the acquisition DMGT has to agree to a number of
conditions:
to create a new editorial board which will be responsible for maintaining
editorial independence at the Nottingham Evening Post;
to sell the Long Eaton Advertiser and Stapleford and Sandiacre News and not
re-enter the weekly paid-for newspaper market in the East Midlands;
to refrain from launching a regional edition of the Daily Mail in the area.
In addition, there will be a general obligation to avoid acting in a way
that prevents, distorts or restricts competition in the newspaper market in
the area, including advertising.
DMGT A shares rose 3p to 988p on the news.
Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
asked the government to block the deal and said the only way to address
concerns about the acquisition was for DMGT to sell daily titles in the
region.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Abacus advances to Pounds 4.24m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abacus Group, the electrical components distributor, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.24m in its first full-year results since floating in
November 1993, and announced a push into Scandinavia.
The 43 per cent increase on last year's Pounds 2.98m was struck on turnover
of Pounds 37.5m, 21 per cent ahead from Pounds 30.9m. Allowing for the
pre-flotation interest burden, profits before tax for the year to September
30 rose 24 per cent. Interest payable fell from Pounds 454,000 to Pounds
7,000.
Mr Harry Westropp, chairman, said the group had achieved its immediate
growth objectives with the opening of a Singapore office, two offices in
Southampton and the addition of two franchises, ICT and Framatome
Connectors.
Dubilier, the passive components brand, and CTL Cables had both increased
sales by some 80 per cent.
Earnings per share came out at 9.7p (7.4p). The recommended final dividend
is 2.88p, giving a total for the year of 4p (1.12p), compared with a
notional 3.5p.
The group acquired a 75 per cent stake in Promax, a Danish company which
distributes Philips products in Denmark and Sweden, for Pounds 2.5m in
October. Mr Westropp said expansion was also under way in Finland and
Norway.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Magnet beats forecasts and Berisford cuts
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International, the former commodities and property group which
bought the Magnet kitchen and joinery business in March, yesterday announced
its first dividend for five years.
Operating profits from the first seven months at Magnet were Pounds 6.2m -
well ahead of City expectations. However, the group remained in the red for
the year to the end of September, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m on
total turnover of Pounds 157.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 5.5m on
turnover of Pounds 77.6m previously. The board is proposing a dividend of
0.5p a share. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, said the shareholders
deserved 'something for supporting us over the last few years'.
Mr Bowkett said the group was now profitable in its continuing business.
Furthermore, it was making good progress in its search for another
acquisition, this time in the US, where it has more than Dollars 600m
(Pounds 365m) of tax losses.
The group ended the year with Pounds 53.6m of net cash, up from Pounds 3.5m.
Since then it has sold Ketlon, the automotive components concern, realising
Pounds 21m and taking the net cash position to Pounds 70m.
Mr Bowkett said that he hoped to have completed a deal in the US by the
middle of next year.
Magnet's operating profits were struck on sales of Pounds 102m and followed
a previous loss of Pounds 900,000. Since March the group has cut staff by
469 and closed 31 high street outlets. So far it has spent Pounds 4.9m on
restructuring.
It has begun to address new markets, particularly national builders of new
houses. But it has also made big efforts to get back the jobbing builder, a
likely repeat purchaser, by using its mailing list of 40,000 tradesmen.
Total group operating profits were Pounds 3.3m. The loss from discontinued
operations, including the cocoa trading associate, totalled Pounds 8.4m.
Losses per share came out at 2.1p, compared with 4.5p.
COMMENT
Stripping out the Pounds 4m of gains from property and other disposals and
the Pounds 8.9m of provisions would leave Berisford with a 'normalised'
pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.7m - or better than the break-even figure
expected by the City. This reflects the impressive result at Magnet, where
margins have been quickly lifted to 6 per cent, or about half the level of
competitors. The shares are being held for Magnet's potential, the hitherto
successful management team, and the potential for a US acquisition. The
group has a head start in the US with the tax losses and Pounds 70m in the
bank. Whether investors should buy more shares depends less on the forecast
profits, estimated at Pounds 18m this year, than on how strongly they feel
that success can be repeated across the Atlantic.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint escapes receiver - Tim Burt
considers the repercussions of investing too heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover offer by Quebecor Printing, the Canadian printer, for
HunterPrint yesterday cleared another hurdle by extracting new terms from
union leaders at the group's plant in Corby, Northamptonshire.
Mr David Doulton, HunterPrint's managing director, said the GPMU print union
did not take much persuading. He told them that if they rejected the offer,
the company's 500 workers 'would be looking right down the receiver's
throat'.
Welcoming the deal, Mr Doulton claimed it would not only safeguard jobs but
re-establish HunterPrint as an important force in UK printing.
Ironically, by recommending the offer he may also have signed his own death
warrant. There is no guarantee that Quebecor will retain a management that
has struggled to contain borrowings during five successive years of losses.
A Pounds 13.6m rights issue and Pounds 18.3m capital reorganisation failed
to stem the tide, and investors who once saw the shares reach 565p have
witnessed a steady decline to yesterday's close of 1 3/4 p - a fall of 1 1/4
p on the day.
Nevertheless, investors holding 53.5 per cent of the ordinary shares have
accepted Quebecor's offer of 2p per share, while preference shareholders
will get 1.33p per share.
With no other offers on the horizon and its auditors expressing 'fundamental
uncertainty' over its future, HunterPrint expects the remaining shareholders
to accept given that receivership is the likely alternative.
But Mr Geoffrey Eades, finance director, said the group's performance could
improve with Quebecor's backing. It could not get much worse. The company
has been fighting a series of crises since it turned to lenders in 1989 to
finance the bulk of its new plant at Corby.
Mr Eades lays the blame squarely at the door of Mr Michael Hunter, the
founder, who pushed the company to the edge of bankruptcy by investing
heavily in probably the UK's most modern web offset plant. That saddled the
group with debts of Pounds 44.5m just as the recession hit the industry.
Some City analysts say the management, led from 1990 to 1992 by Sir Ian
MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and the National Coal Board,
made matters worse by sharply discounting prices to win more contract
printing deals.
'They undercut their rivals by up to 50 per cent and could not generate the
cash just to run the business,' according to one.
Yet that strategy has paid off with potentially lucrative contracts with
publishers such as Mirror Group Newspapers, the Guardian Media Group and
Associated Newspapers, which Quebecor will inherit just as they are
beginning to mature.
While agreeing to inject Pounds 7m to underpin the business, the Canadian
group has also persuaded HunterPrint's lenders to waive interest on its
current borrowing for two years.
Those borrowings have been steadily reduced to Pounds 17m, making the Corby
site an even more attractive proposition.
For the printing industry, this may be bad news. A rival that looked
terminally ill may be reborn in a leaner form, and HunterPrint could yet
realise its founder's vision of 'keeping one step ahead of the competition'.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Unipart takes strategic steps in
manufacturing expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unipart, the motor components and accessories group, will launch on Thursday
a further expansion of its exhaust and catalytic converter manufacturing
operations.
The move comes just six days after Unipart paid Pounds 21.6m for Ketlon, the
motor components subsidiary of former commodities and property group,
Berisford International.
The acquisition and expansion - at Unipart's Premier Exhausts subsidiary at
Coventry - were described by Mr John Neill, Unipart's group chief executive,
as ' further strategic steps in the development of our manufacturing
business.'
Ketlon is to become part of Unipart Industries, the manufacturing division
which has become the main focus of the group's expansion and which has
acquired substantial business with Toyota's and Honda's UK car manufacturing
operations.
Ketlon, which employs 400 at Paddock Wood in Kent, makes transmission parts
for several vehicle makers, including Ford, General Motors, Honda, Jaguar
and Rover.
It will substantially expand Unipart's machining process capability into a
broader spread of motor components business. Specifically, it will
complement Advanced Engineering Systems, a Tipton, Staffordshire-based
subsidiary which already makes machined castings.

<TEXT>
HunterPrint Group, the debt-burdened printing company, yesterday warned
shareholders that failure to back an agreed takeover by Quebecor Printing,
North America's second-biggest commercial printer, could force it to appoint
receivers.
Announcing a 24.4 per cent increase in full year losses, the Corby-based
company said it would be unable to guarantee the group's financial future if
the CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m) acquisition was derailed.
Pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.93m in the year to
September 25 on turnover down from Pounds 50.8m to Pounds 49.2m.
The group, which is Britain's leading independent printer of national
newspaper supplements, saw gearing increase from 134 per cent to 183 per
cent - equivalent to total debts of Pounds 17m.
That meant it was unable to declare a dividend or pay dividends due on its
cumulative redeemable preference shares.
'The level of on-demand (banking) facilities available to the current
management does not provide sufficient working capital for the group's
future trading requirements,' said Mr Jeoff Samson, HunterPrint chairman.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Housebuilding helps Allen jump to Pounds
2.74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allen, the Wigan-based construction group, more than doubled pre-tax profits
in the six months to October 2 as hire services and housebuilding turned in
sharply improved contributions.
Group profits climbed to Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 1.28m) on turnover 62 per cent
ahead at Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 30.5m). The results include figures for two
months from DJ Ryan, the cable laying and civil engineering company bought
for about Pounds 6.9m. While Kendrick Hire, the 41-strong chain of tool hire
depots bought in September for Pounds 3m, is included in the balance sheet,
it makes no contribution to the profit and loss account.
The shares were unchanged on the day at 163p.
Mr Donald Greenhalgh, Allen chairman and managing director, said Ryan had
not been as profitable as expected, but stressed that the shortfall was
material to Ryan, not to the group as a whole. The contracts for North West
Water and British Gas were profitable; the problems were only in the
contract for Nynex, the US telecommunications group. Allen was making a
claim against the Ryan warrantors.
The division made operating profits of Pounds 348,000 on turnover of Pounds
7.96m.
Profits from hire services, which with Kendrick comprise 78 depots, jumped
to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 472,000) on turnover of Pounds 8.04m (Pounds 5.07m).
Mr Ken Fox, group deputy managing director, said increased volumes, not
prices, lay behind the advance.
Completions on the housebuilding side grew 46 per cent to 206 and profits
were up at Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 822,000) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds
8.6m).
Property development and investment made Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 83,000) on
turnover of Pounds 314,000 (Pounds 395,000). Building contracting suffered
the only profits downturn, from Pounds 332,000 to Pounds 238,000 on turnover
ahead at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 16.4m).
Gearing rose to 58.5 per cent, against 42 per cent last time and a
self-imposed 60 per cent upper limit. Earnings per share were 6.48p (3.99p)
and the interim dividend is 2p (1.65p).

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods urges bid acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste company which last week fell to the hostile Pounds
391m bid from Browning Ferris Industries of the US, yesterday urged
shareholders who have not taken up the offer to do so.
The company said that if investors sold into the market instead, they would
lose their rights to the additional contingent payment upon the sale of
Attwoods' German business. The board had decided to accept BFI's offer of
116.75p, plus the proposed 3.25p dividend.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, stands to gain up to Pounds 1.2m
from the sale of his shares.
Preference shareholders will have to decide whether to wait for redemption
or accept BFI's offer of 92p per share. BFI has the right to redeem the
shares early at their par value of Pounds 1.
BFI won acceptances last week representing about 60 per cent of Attwoods'
equity. If Mr Foreman leaves the company, he is entitled to a substantial
compensation payment of more than Pounds 700,000.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New market growth boosts Oriflame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in new markets has helped Oriflame International, the
door-to-door cosmetics group, to lift interim profits by 17 per cent in
spite of a slight decline in sales.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end September rose from Pounds 5.39m
to Pounds 6.3m on turnover of Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 40.9m). Direct sales,
through more than 70,000 operatives, accounted for Pounds 24.5m (Pounds
24.7m) of total sales.
Shares in the group rose 12p to close at 269p.
Mr Robert af Jochnik, chairman, attributed the growth in profit to higher
sales in Finland, Chile, Mexico and Portugal. He sees further growth in
Spain and Portugal, and regards Latin America as the market most likely to
expand rapidly, with Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela targetted for next
year.
'The toughest markets in direct selling are in western Europe and the US,
where retailing is so developed,' he said. 'It is different in the emerging
markets, where people are looking for earning opportunities and retailing is
not developed.'
The group is also hoping to move into the Indian and Chinese markets. 'We
are confident of being in one or both of these markets in the next couple of
years,' said Mr af Jochnik.
The fall in total sales reflected the suspension of loss-making operations
in France and Germany; restructuring in the UK and US; a switch from
finished to bulk sales to the eastern Europe operation, which opens a new
factory in Poland next summer; and a drop in mail order sales to Sweden.
The pre-tax figure was struck after Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 432,000) in
interest and foreign exchange gains and losses. The group, which hedges
currencies on the futures markets, ended the period with gearing down from
27 per cent to 19 per cent.
Earnings per share were 9.7p (8.4p), and the interim dividend is raised from
4.3p to 4.6p.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish &amp; Newcastle 28% ahead - Strong
first-time contribution from Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain helped
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the beer and leisure group, report a 28 per cent rise
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 114m to Pounds 145m.
'We've had great success in integrating Chef &amp; Brewer,' said Mr Brian
Stewart, S&amp;N's chief executive. The group was unable to break out the
underlying profit growth of the existing leisure, pub and brewing
businesses.
Chef &amp; Brewer, acquired from Grand Metropolitan a year ago for Pounds 703m,
is thought to be earnings enhancing, several analysts said. Operating
profits from all pub retail activities rose to Pounds 73.3m (Pounds 29.2m)
on sales of Pounds 364m (Pounds 145m).
Mr Stewart said the chain offered plenty more scope for development with,
for example, the Homespreads food concept and the addition of accommodation
at some sites. The group was achieving a 25 per cent return on investment in
new projects in the chain, he added.
Chef &amp; Brewer took little of S&amp;N's beer during the half year, however,
because of its supply agreement with Courage which expires next March.
'Long-term, we would like to supply the bulk of it,' Mr Stewart said.
Profits from brewing and related activities fell to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds
50.4m) on sales of Pounds 445m (Pounds 443m). Half the fall was attributable
to low maltings prices which should recover next year, the group said.
S&amp;N's beer volumes were up 2.4 per cent in the half year to October 30, with
sales to the pub trade flat, but with improved margins, and sales to
off-licences and other retailers up 11 per cent.
The group benefited from the warm summer weather and a good performance from
brands such as Becks lager and Theakstons and McEwans Export beer.
Margins in the off-trade suffered a 'substantial decline', but some second
half-recovery is expected.
Leisure contributed profits of Pounds 49m (Pounds 47.1m) on sales of Pounds
202m (Pounds 192m). Center Parcs achieved a 10 per cent increase in profits
thanks in part to the opening of a third UK holiday village at Longleat.
Profits fell at Pontin's holiday centres because foreign competition led to
a 7 per cent downturn in visitors. Pontin's bookings were up about 5 per
cent in the second half, however.
Net debt was Pounds 740m at the end of the half year for gearing of 41 per
cent. This was a slight increase from the year-end level because of a small
cash outflow as expected.
The board declared a 7 per cent increase in the interim dividend from 5.78p
to 6.18p. Earnings per share increased to 20.4p (18.8p) - or 20.2p (18.5p)
fully diluted and excluding a Pounds 500,000 loss on property disposals
against a loss of Pounds 200,000 a year earlier.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: National Home Loans in the black at Pounds
11.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday confirmed
the continuing stability in the housing market as it reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 11.4m for the year ended September 30, against losses of
Pounds 36.6m last time. It was the group's first profitable year since 1990.
Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said the healthier property market
was allowing the group to return to focusing on its core business of
mortgage lending.
NHL had relaunched its residential mortgage business in June and had already
signed up 1,000 intermediaries to sell its products. Mr Perry added that the
group's aim was to quadruple this figure in an attempt to re-establish its
position in the mortgage market.
'There is still room in the market for a quality mortgage provider,' he
said.
However, NHL still faces a financial restructuring with negative
shareholders' funds standing at Pounds 24.8m against Pounds 36.1m last year,
in addition to Pounds 24m outstanding in preference share dividends.
Mr Perry said he expected to announce details of the restructuring, which
would involve a rights issue, early in the New Year.
'I think our shareholders expect us to come back for funds for this purpose
at some time,' he said.
Net interest income slipped from Pounds 48.1m to Pounds 45.6m. The group's
mortgage assets fell 17 per cent to Pounds 1.67bn (Pounds 2.04bn). However,
operating costs slid by the same percentage to Pounds 17m (Pounds 20.6m).
Provisions for bad debt fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 23.8m, while the
number of accounts more than three months in arrears dropped from 1,726 to
1,266.
Repossessions showed a sharp decline, falling from 2,548 to 837.
Earnings per share were 3.7p against losses of 43.1p last year. The final
dividend, which was last paid in 1991, was again passed.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape sells motor rental businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the international motors, services and marketing group, has sold
its remaining car and van rental businesses to a management buy-out for
Pounds 29.75m.
The sale of Kenning Car and Van Rental (KCVR) and United Rental Group had
been expected, and represents the final phase of streamlining following the
acquisitions of TKM and Hogg Group.
The buy-out was backed by venture capital group 3i, which has put together a
Pounds 100m financing package to cover the purchase price and an additional
off balance sheet debt of Pounds 70m related to the vehicle fleets.
Mr Chris Rowlands, director of 3i's Birmingham office, said the two
companies had made a total operating profit of about Pounds 4.5m last year.
3i has put together Pounds 17m of equity funding, while Barclays arranged
Pounds 15.5m of debt. The management will own about 40 per cent of the
company's shares.
KCVR was purchased by Inchcape as part of the Pounds 383m acquisition of TKM
in March 1992, while United was part of Hogg Group, which was bought in
June. Their combined fleets, including vehicles operated by franchisees,
amount to 25,000 vehicles and the two companies operate through more than
200 outlets.
Mr Kevin Betts, former finance director at Central TV, is to be chairman,
and David Hardman will be chief executive. 3i said there had been
competition for the deal from other vehicle rental companies and also
venture capital groups.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Growth in exports behind 50% improvement at
Denby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong rise in exports helped Denby Group, the pottery tableware maker
which floated in May, to meet forecasts with a 50 per cent jump in annual
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 4.13m.
Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, said the results were 'excellent. But
it is not the first time they have been this good'. Sales for the year to
September 30 rose 25 per cent from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 21.9m.
Exports surged by 82 per cent, offsetting what had been a disappointing
second half in the UK, said Mr Riley. The tax increases in April had had a
definite effect on the UK economy. However, 'we are delighted to see that
all the effort we put into the overseas business came through even more
strongly than we had hoped for', he added.
Exports now accounted for 24 per cent of sales, against 16 per cent last
year. Denby still had considerable potential abroad in an industry where
exports on average represented 63 per cent of sales.
Turnover more than doubled in the US, where Denby had about 1,000 outlets
through department stores and independent retailers. Denby is to double its
marketing expenditure in the US from about Dollars 300,000 to Dollars
600,000 this year.
The group's UK sales grew by 14 per cent, helped by higher prices and
increased impulse buying of products such as mugs and cookware.
Operating margins rose from 18.5 per cent to 20.8 per cent. Since 1991, when
the management buy-out from Coloroll was completed, Denby's margins had
benefited from price increases above the rate of inflation, which the group
had been able to make because of improved design and service, said Mr Riley.
Last year Denby increased prices by 4.5 per cent. Mr Riley warned, however,
that it would be increasingly difficult to push through higher price
increases.
A 1.4p dividend is proposed. If the group had been quoted for the full year,
it would have paid a notional 3.1p. Earnings rose from 6.5p to 9.2p.
The shares, which were 130p at flotation, fell 6p to 155p.

EuroDollar, the car rental company which was floated in July, said yesterday
that it would try to act as market leader and increase prices in January.
At the same time, it said better economic conditions in the UK were
responsible for a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.15m
(Pounds 7.01m) in the six months to September 30. Turnover rose 15 per cent
to Pounds 43m.
Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive, said volumes in November were up 30 per cent
over last year, but that there would continue to be downward pressure on
margins.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 11p (9.5p). The interim dividend
covering the period since the listing is 1.6p.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: CRT ahead sharply to Pounds 1.29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRT Group, the training and recruitment group which bought Systems Resources
in August, lifted pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 472,000 to Pounds
1.29m in the six months to October 31.
The shares eased 2p to 82p.
Operating profits advanced to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.64m) after a Pounds
220,000 contribution from the acquisition. Last year's figure, however,
included losses of Pounds 635,000 from the discontinued Doctus Consulting
Europe, now sold to management. Group turnover grew 30 per cent to Pounds
29.2m (Pounds 22.4m) including Pounds 5.2m from Systems Resources.
In recruitment, turnover rose 90 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 9.75m) and
operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 964,000 (Pounds 467,000).
Stripping out the effect of the acquisition, which made a two-month
contribution, the rises in turnover and operating profits were 37 and 59 per
cent respectively.
In training, turnover grew to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.46m) but operating
profits fell to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.85m). Explaining the fall, Mr Karl
Chapman, group chief executive, cited increased weighting to students
completing courses in the second half, development of the Link Training
Multimedia Learning Centre programme in schools, and investment in Link and
Pitman.
The group's second-half bias would be more pronounced this year, Mr Chapman
said, because of the acquisition, the general improvement in the recruitment
market and continuing weighting of that market to the second six months.
There was a Pounds 300,000 integration and restructuring charge, and Mr
Chapman said the total charge would not exceed Pounds 650,000 for the year.
Earnings rose to 1.42p (0.56p) per share and the interim dividend is raised
to 0.85p (0.75p).

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Airtours expands by 66% - Scandinavian
Leisure acquisition helps boost profits to Pounds 76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition of Scandinavian Leisure Group last April helped Airtours to
boost profits by 66 per cent and sales by almost the same amount. The total
dividend is being raised by 36 per cent.
Airtours, which is turning itself into a vertically integrated holiday
company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 75.8m on sales of Pounds 971.7m
for the year to end September. This compares with a previous Pounds 45.5m,
struck after a Pounds 9m charge for its abortive bid for Owners Abroad
Group, on sales of Pounds 615.5m.
'We think they are superb results,' Mr David Crosland, chairman said,
pointing out that the group had delivered uninterrupted growth in profits,
earnings and dividends since coming to the stock market in 1987.
The shares closed yesterday at 442p, down 2p.
After a successful summer season SLG, bought for Pounds 80m, contributed
Pounds 13.7m to pre-tax profits - well ahead of expectations. The
acquisition, which also brought in Pounds 151.4m of turnover, serves markets
using the same destinations as the UK operation.
The group is putting together the offices of the Scandinavian and English
tour operations in overseas resorts, reducing the overall number by about
half to 50. Mr Crosland said the group would benefit from the increased
buying power for transfers and excursions, for which it would have 3.5m
coach passengers.
While the tour operating business has a 21 per cent market share, its High
Street chain, Going Places, has a market share of 14 per cent. Mr Crosland
said he wanted to move the retail chain's market share closer to the tour
operating level.
On the downside, the group said that warm weather in the UK in August had
cut demand for some holidays, while the emergence of some northern European
countries from recession had put upward pressure on hotel bed prices.
However, winter bookings were almost 27 per cent ahead, and 1995 early
summer bookings were 13 per cent ahead. In addition the group has moved into
the fly-cruise market, with a 94 per cent take-up for next year already on
the first boat.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 44.37p (27.29p). The board is
proposing a final dividend of 10.9p (7.83p), taking the total for the year
to 12p (8.81p).
COMMENT
The figures were up to best expectations, although flattered by the
Scandinavian arm, which made the UK seem a shade disappointing. The group is
clever at marketing, and runs its tour operations and retail outlets
efficiently. It has grown at a terrific pace and has grasped the right
opportunities. Estimated profits this year of just below Pounds 90m put it
on a prospective multiple of 9. At first sight this looks grudging,
especially if you believe the move to vertical integration in the holiday
business will raise the cost of entry. However, investors will have at the
back of their minds the recurrent upheavals in the industry. At the same
time growth rate is likely to slow down.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Medeva to pay Dollars 54m for anaesthetic
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the acquisitive drugs group, yesterday stepped up its expansion
strategy by announcing plans to acquire Inhalon Pharmaceuticals, the US
anaesthetic manufacturer, for Dollars 54m (Pounds 34.6m).
Shares in the group rose 4p to 175p after it said the deal, funded from
existing cash reserves, would give it access to a market worth about Dollars
200m and would make a modest contribution to earnings next year.
The move follows three months of talks with the Pennsylvania-based company,
which only received approval for the US food and drug administration earlier
this year to manufacture enflurane and isoflurane ,two of the most
widely-used inhaled anaesthetics.
It takes the total invested by Medeva in the past four years beyond Pounds
300m, and Mr Bill Bogie, chief executive, said the company was well on
course to meet its target of doubling its market capitalisation to about
Pounds 1bn in the medium term.
Although Inhalon has yet to begin full-scale production and make any sales,
Mr Bogie rejected suggestions that Medeva may have overpaid for a company
which made losses of Dollars 2.3m in the year to June 30.
'The potential is enormous. There are only two other major players in the US
 -Abbot and BOC - so getting into the market is very important for us.'
Inhalon's products will be marketed and distributed by International
Medication Systems, the US hospital product manufacturer and distributor,
which Medeva acquired for Dollars 28.6m in 1992.
'By selling Inhalon's products through IMS's specialist hospital salesforce
we can achieve significant operating benefits,' Mr Bogie added.
Medeva also hopes to establish a niche presence in the anaesthetic market
and use Inhalon's technology in overseas markets.
The company is paying an initial Dollars 35m for Inhalon with further
tranches of Dollars 10m and Dollars 9m payable in 1995 and 1996 depending on
its production performance.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Verity beats the drum with Premier deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verity Group, manufacturer of Wharfedale and Mission hi-fi speakers,
yesterday beat a path towards securing one of Britain's most prestigious
drum makers when it made a Pounds 1.85m agreed offer for Premier Percussion.
The move caused surprise in the drumming world as Premier was only bought by
its management from the Japanese group Yamaha two years ago. Verity said
yesterday that Mr Tony Doughty, the Premier chief executive, would receive
about Pounds 1.4m from the deal and join the Verity board as a non-executive
director.
Premier, famous for its name in front of a host of musical stars, including
Keith Moon of The Who, the Coldstream Guards and the Joe Loss Band, was
founded in 1928 and was family-owned until 1984. As well as its drums, the
group also makes other percussion instruments.
Mr Rick Van Horn, managing editor of Modern Drummer magazine, said the group
had suffered along with other traditional drum makers from the impact of
Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s, culminating in its purchase by Yamaha
in 1984. 'It's still one of the big names in drumming, particularly in the
UK and Europe,' he said.
He added that the Premiers' main endorsers - drummers whose equipment and
expen-ses are sponsored by the company - were Rod Morganstein of the Dixie
Dregs, Charlie Morgan of the Elton John band, Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden
and Duane Perry of Jethro Tull.
The last audited accounts of the group show operating profits of Pounds
415,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.7m for the nine months to the end of
December, 1993.
Verity is raising Pounds 1.28m through a 1-for 12 rights issue of 17m shares
at 7.5p to pay for the purchase.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional checks NIE at Pounds 44.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A higher than average rise in unit sales as well as cost-cutting helped
Northern Ireland Electricity increase interim operating profits 16.5 per
cent from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 48.6m.
Pre-tax profit growth was 4.5 per cent, from Pounds 42.4m to Pounds 44.3m,
following a Pounds 5.9m exceptional charge for restructuring, mainly to pay
for voluntary redundancy.
The dividend rises 15 per cent to 3.9p (3.39p) in line with expectations,
out of earnings per share after exceptional costs of 21p (20.8p).
In the half-year to September 30, NIE's increased turnover of Pounds 209.6m
(Pounds 206.2m) was helped by a 6.2 per cent growth in industrial unit
sales.
The commercial sector increased 4.5 per cent, although domestic growth was
less impressive at 1.1 per cent. Taking all three sectors together the
weather-corrected increase was 4.6 per cent.
The company also benefited from a 13.4 per cent reduction in employee costs.
Some 149 jobs were cut in the half, leaving 2,607. It had set a target of
2,557 for March 1996 but expects to meet that in the current financial year.
Of the company's four main profit centres, supply showed the highest
increase, 78.9 per cent to Pounds 3.4m, but the retail business showed a
Pounds 500,000 loss, following a Pounds 200,000 profit in the comparable
period. Mr Patrick Heren, chief executive, blamed a fall in appliance sales
in a highly competitive market.
The company had net cash of Pounds 91.6m at the year end, up from Pounds
35.2m. Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said it was confident the regulator's
review of the interconnector with Scotland would show it provided an
economic method of purchasing electricity. 'We thought it was the best way
forward, even without the Pounds 61m grant from the European Union to help
build the interconnector,' he said.
COMMENT
Had all gone according to the government's plans, NIE would now be a company
with considerable gearing. However, a year after privatisation it is
treading the well-worn path of privatised utilities, cutting costs ahead of
schedule and spending less than expected. As a result the cash pile now
stands at Pounds 92m, and profits are healthy. Expenditure on the Scottish
interconnector will dent the cash but, assuming a full year dividend of 13p,
the shares are trading on prospective yield of 4.4 per cent. That is about
the same as the England and Wales regional electricity companies and seems
about right. NIE faces an earlier regulatory review than the recs, which
increases uncertainty, but uniquely it will benefit from the Northern
Ireland peace process.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The rising cost of running Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graeme Bowler, chief executive of grocery discounter Kwik Save since July
1993, was paid a total of Pounds 586,000 in his first year - 72 per cent
more than his predecessor Mr Graeme Seabrook received in his final nine
months with the company.
Kwik Save's annual report, published yesterday, showed that it had to pay Mr
Bowler a substantial premium to lure him away from his position as managing
director of Franklins discount stores in Australia. On an annualised basis,
Mr Bowler received about 30 per cent more than his predecessor.
'We paid a lot to get the right man,' the company said. 'Discounting is a
very competitive business, and this is a man we went half-way round the
world to get.'
Kwik Save added that Mr Bowler, 55, had to be persuaded to leave an
attractive position in Australia, and spend what may be the rest of his
working life in the UK.
The report shows that Mr Bowler earned a basic Pounds 260,000 in the year to
August 27, some 45 per cent higher than Mr Seabrook's Pounds 179,000 in his
final nine months.
His benefits in kind were 53 per cent greater, at Pounds 40,000, while his
bonus was more than twice as much, at Pounds 245,000 compared with Mr
Seabrook's Pounds 105,000.
His pension contributions were Pounds 41,000, against Mr Seabrook's Pounds
31,000.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Overseas side helps Faber Prest rise 32%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from its industrial services division, particularly
overseas, helped Faber Prest to announce a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits.
The rise in profits at the industrial and distribution services group, from
Pounds 5.03m to Pounds 6.63m for the year ended September 30, was achieved
on turnover up 15 per cent at Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 69.5m).
Underlying growth in turnover on continuing activities was 13 per cent to
Pounds 74.7m (Pounds 66.1m) giving operating profits of Pounds 5.78m (Pounds
5.35m), an increase of 8 per cent. There were exceptional profits of Pounds
595,000, compared with net losses of Pounds 42,000.
Expenditure on acquisitions was Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 500,000) and capital
expenditure doubled to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 3.5m). The group raised Pounds
8.5m in a 1-for-4 rights issue in July.
Mr Roger Feaviour, chief executive, said that this pace of expansion would
continue.
Operating profits from industrial services, principally slag recovery and
utilisation, increased 31 per cent to Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 3.31m).
The distribution division, which provides logistics services, increased
profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 1.75m) on sales of Pounds
24.6m (Pounds 21.3m).
Earnings per share rose 32 per cent to 43.7p (33.3p). The proposed final
dividend is 10p (9p) making a total of 15.5p (14p).

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SBC left with 45% of new Lloyd's trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation has been left with a substantial number of shares,
which are trading well below issue price, in a new Lloyd's investment
company following poor investor interest.
The bank had hoped to raise up to Pounds 50m for Matheson Lloyd's Investment
Trust, via the issue of 50m ordinary shares at 100p. SBC had agreed to
underwrite 25m of the shares.
The bank said yesterday that it had managed to place only about 8m, mainly
with continental European investors, leaving it holding about 70 per cent of
MLIT's shares.
Subsequently it has sold about 5m shares to Fidelity at about 80p each,
according to market estimates. After other disposals, SBC has been left
holding about 45 per cent.
The shares yesterday closed at 82p, though the bank argues that does not
take account of the value of warrants, entitling shareholders to subscribe
for one share at 100p, issued with every five shares.
The deal has left SBC with a paper loss but Mr Michael Kershaw, executive
director at the bank, said: 'The company should be judged by the quality of
its underwriting results and not by its short term share price performance.
We are extremely happy with the quality of the capacity we have obtained for
1995.'

acquisition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pillar Property Investments, the investment and development company which
joined the stock market in August, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
34,000, the purchase of a shopping centre and a new director, writes Simon
London.
The result for the six months to September 30 was struck after charging
Pounds 2.17m interest on loan stock which was repaid on flotation. Mr
Raymond Mould, chairman, said Pillar had moved strongly into profit since
then.
The company did not publish comparative half-year figures but in the nine
months to the end of March pre-tax profits were Pounds 744,000.
Pillar also announced the acquisition of the Fairhill Shopping Centre in
Ballymena, Northern Ireland for Pounds 11.5m, through its joint venture with
SITQ Immobilier, the Canadian investment fund. The joint venture has now
spent Pounds 62m on shopping centres out of a potential budget of Pounds
250m.
Mr Mould added that Pillar was in advanced negotiations for the acquisition
of a number of other investment properties.
Mr Nicholas Sheehan will join the board in January following the departure
of Mr Robert Maxted, property director, in October. Until March, Mr Sheehan
was chief executive of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the development company.

Associated British Foods, the milling, baking, and sugar group has bought
Allinson, the UK's leading producer of stoneground flour, from Booker for
Pounds 6.7m in cash together with Pounds 1.5m in repayment of inter-group
loans.
ABF is one of the biggest consumers of stoneground flour in the UK and has
been using the Allinson brandname under licence for the past 12 years.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman of ABF, said the purchase will consolidate the
group's position in the wholemeal bread market. 'We have been spending
considerable sums of money promoting and developing the brandname and we
wanted the security of owning it,' he said.
The disposal of Allinson comes as part of a restructuring at Bookers
initiated 12 months ago.

FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Coal Investments seeks Pounds 26.3m through
placing and open offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coal Investments yesterday announced a placing and open offer to raise
Pounds 26.3m.
It wants the money to increase capital expenditure, provide working capital
and increase its holding in Mining (Scotland), the government's preferred
bidder for British Coal's Scottish region.
Existing shareholders are being offered the chance to subscribe for about
half of the shares - up to 36.6m - being created through an open offer of
four new shares for every 13 held. The balance are being placed firm at
76.5p, against yesterday's closing share price of 81p, down 4p.
The issue represents more than 50 per cent of the 60m shares already in
existence.
Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, is increasing its stake in
Mining (Scotland) to between 22.8 and 29.6 per cent, paying Pounds 8.3m
initially. MS is paying Pounds 39.4m for British Coal's Scottish region plus
about Pounds 10m for surplus coal stocks. Of the Pounds 53m needed to fund
this, Pounds 25m will be raised through bank debt and Pounds 28m through
equity.
CI also announced the conclusion of contracts to supply the English
electricity generators with 4.8m tonnes of coal over six years.
It is also in contract talks with British Steel, which it said would enable
it to lift output to between 3m and 4m tonnes.
The company is to spend Pounds 6m at its Coventry pit to develop a longwall
face to fulfil the generator contracts.
Coal Investments said that geological problems at Cwmgwili earlier in the
year had prevented budgeted output being achieved; however, a move to a
better part of the seam meant budgeted production was now being achieved. A
new washery would improve margins, the company added.
COMMENT
The consolation for Coal Investments for RJB Mining taking over such a large
part of British Coal is that the electricity generators will want
alternative markets. This helps to explain why CI has been able to win 5m
tonne contracts with National Power and PowerGen, and there should be more
to come. Even so, the company has much to prove, particularly on the
production front. The problems at Cwmgwili and the late delivery of
machinery at other mines are dismissed as unimportant by Mr Edwards but, in
such a young company, they will be not be considered immaterial by all
investors. If Coal Investments can meet its targets it could recover from
expected losses this year to make profits of Pounds 18m next year. The
prospective price/earnings ratio, assuming a full tax charge, would be about
6.

</HEADLINE>

Associated Nursing Services, the USM-quoted nursing homes operator,
maintained interim pre-tax profits at Pounds 1.07m against Pounds 1.05m,
despite increased development costs.
Turnover dipped slightly to Pounds 8.46m (Pounds 9.02m) for the six months
to September 30. The nursing homes side raised operating profits by 18 per

FT  06 DEC 94 / Intermediaries find role under threat in Asia / A look at
the challenge posed to traditional bank lending by growing debt markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International banks have grown used to regarding Asia as one of the last
regions of the world where they can still lend money for a good return. The
process of securitisation which has seen their best customers in the US and
Europe drift away to the bond markets has been slow to take hold. Now,
however, even Asia is starting to catch up with the times.
Thailand's introduction last month of new arrangements for trading domestic
bonds and the recent launch by Wharf (Holdings) of a HKDollars 2.3bn (Pounds
190m) floating rate note issue in the Hong Kong market are signs of the way
debt markets are growing in importance around the region. The latter broke
new ground as the first issue by a commercial borrower eligible for discount
by the Hong Kong's Monetary Authority.
According to Mr Andre Lee of Peregrine Securities, the Hong Kong investment
bank, the value of paper outstanding in Asian debt markets outside Japan has
doubled to more than USDollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) in the last five years.
Mr Lee says it could easily double again in the next five years.
No one pretends that such rapid growth is an immediate threat to bank
lending business, but there is now a growing awareness among banks
themselves that their business is facing a serious long-term challenge.
'Hongkong Bank and its ilk will find the going a great deal tougher than
they have traditionally found it. Looking ahead five years, bank balance
sheets will look quite different. Straight debt will be a much smaller
component,' says Mr John Mulcahy of UBS Securities. Driving the development
of bond markets is the need in many countries to mobilise private sector
finance for infrastructure development. The requirement to use domestic
savings more efficiently is prompting governments to deregulate financial
markets and establish alternatives to traditional bank finance.
Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary-general of Thailand's Securities
and Exchange Commission, says local banks currently earn handsome margins of
about 4 per cent on average. Together with finance companies they provide
about 80 per cent of the funds needed by business. 'From an efficiency point
of view we don't wish any institution to have a dominating role.'
As competition grows, banks will see a fall in their interest margins, says
Mr Graham Catterwell of Crosby Research, 'probably not a dramatic fall, but
a progressive erosion over time'. But margins on lending to smaller
companies will remain high and, with affluence increasing, Thai banks will
be able to make up lost income by developing retail business.
Some leading banks remain relaxed about the impact of the changes. Mr Tom
Dunton, head of corporate banking at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, says
the scope for borrowers to securitise their debt is limited. 'There's only a
handful of investment grade companies that can do what Wharf did.'
But Hongkong and Shanghai Bank admits to the need for change. Mr Paul
Selway-Swift, executive director, says it is putting more resources into
investment banking precisely because it believes securitisation will take
lending business away from banks, a process known to bankers as
disintermediation.
'If we want to do the volume of business we think is desirable, we are going
to have to be somebody who disintermediates, rather than somebody is
disintermediated against,' he says.
Stock market analysts worry about balance sheet growth, but in the medium
term, says Mr Selway-Swift, borrowers' requirements will become so large -
he puts China's infrastructure needs at Dollars 300bn between now and the
end of the century - that even Hongkong Bank cannot satisfy them with its
own balance sheet.
'We are just going to have to take a lot of our clients to the capital
markets,' he says.
Mr Selway-Swift is relaxed about the impact of this change on his bank's
lending business. There are so many fast-growing companies in Asia that new
corporate borrowers will emerge for the banks as fast as the established
ones move over to the securities markets.
Not surprisingly, Peregrine, which took a strategic decision to strengthen
its bond department this year, takes a different view. 'We feel the Asian
debt market is going to absolutely explode in terms of volumes,' says Mr
Philip Tose, its chairman.
Asian companies are still often family controlled, but when they are
expanding rapidly, they need more new capital than their owners are willing
to provide. So they are pushed towards debt markets, rather than dilute
their ownership, he says.
None the less, there are some serious obstacles in the way of the
development of debt markets and their use to finance infrastructure. One is
the fact that a securitised structure is often inappropriate for a project
in, say, transport or power, which will take years to generate any cash.
Another, more general, difficulty lies in developing secondary market
trading.
Bankers regard Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia as particularly well-placed
to develop domestic debt markets because they have fully convertible
currencies. Yet all three countries lack liquid government issues which can
act as a pricing benchmark. Indeed, says, Mr Mohamad Munir, chairman of
Malaysia's Securities Commission, the stock of government bond paper in his
country is steadily depleting.
In Indonesia, worries about the authenticity of certificates have slowed
secondary market dealing. But Mr Bacelius Ruru, Jakarta's top securities
regulator, says this is being tackled by the introduction of book entry
trading. Indonesia wants to wean institutional investors away from
fixed-time deposits at banks, he says. Like Malaysia it is establishing a
domestic credit rating agency to help build confidence in its bond market.
Bankers say the scope for securitisation is large even in countries which do
not have fully convertible currencies, witness the flourishing commercial
paper market in Taiwan with outstanding issues equivalent to more than
Dollars 10bn. China's bond market is relatively small but it still offers
investors a return much higher than they can receive from bank deposits.
To some extent, the speed at which domestic debt markets grow will also
depend on the readiness of governments to open them to foreign investment
banks. Even if they are slow to do so, however, most bankers assume that
regional debt issuance in US international currencies will continue to grow
apace. 'Nothing will stop it,' says Mr Tose. 'The demand for funding is
going to be so great.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Swedish insurer writes down US holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, was forced yesterday to confront the full
extent of its disastrous foray into the US market, announcing that it
planned to write down the value of its investment in Home Holdings by at
least SKr2.8bn (Pounds 238m). It did not rule out a write-down of its entire
SKr3.5bn exposure to Home, its troubled US insurance affiliate which has
turned into the company's second big investment fiasco in two years.
The write-down will be made alongside plans to strengthen Home's balance
sheet which has been badly weakened by the need to cover its exposure to
environmental and professional liability claims dating back many years. Home
wants to raise at least Dollars 250m (Pounds 152m) in new equity or debt.
Analysts said Trygg's write-down suggested Home was planning a highly
dilutive share issue to new investors, which could reduce Trygg's capital
stake in the US group from 64.5 per cent to below 20 per cent.
They said it signalled a clear desire by Trygg to extract itself fully from
its involvement in the loss-making US group. Mr Bob Yates, insurance analyst
with Fox-Pitt Kelton in London, said the write-down showed the new investors
were forcing 'very generous terms'.
Trygg's investment in Home, first made in 1991, cost it SKr1.4bn in losses
in the first nine months. It now faces full-year Home-related losses of more
than SKr4bn. In 1992 Trygg also suffered SKr5.5bn in losses from its
investment in Sweden's Gota AB, the holding company for Gota Bank.
Trygg's shares, suspended on Friday following press speculation about Home's
recapitalisation, fell SKr2 to SKr76 when trading resumed yesterday.
Home has been downgraded by three US rating agencies since it announced a
nine-month deficit of Dollars 131m last month. It hopes to
get a higher rating after it has been recapitalised, facilitating efforts to
win new business.
Home, more than twice Trygg's size, had 1993 gross premiums of Dollars
2.42bn. Its difficulties this year have been compounded by high leverage,
rising US interest rates, intensifying competitive pressures and earthquake
and cold weather losses.

FT  06 DEC 94 / South Africa to launch Dollars 500m bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa is to return to the international capital markets this week
with the launch of its first international bond offering since the end of
apartheid.
The Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds is likely to pave the
way for a flood of new issues from other South African borrowers in both the
public and private sectors. It is being closely watched by major South
African companies and institutions as a measure of the acceptability of
South African bonds on the global market and of confidence in the economic
policies of the new government.
The state-owned electricity utility Eskom and telecommunications company
Telkom as well as several private companies are expected to approach the
international capital markets over the next few months.
Although South Africa has borrowed on the international markets before, this
is the first time it has been able to approach the US market directly.
The bond offering is expected to be launched either today or tomorrow.
Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, the banks lead-managing the deal,
were last night unable to comment on the pricing of the bonds, but the
market expects a price about 170 to 200 basis points (1.7 to 2 percentage
points) over US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. This compares with a
margin of about 175 basis points available on Greek bonds of a similar
maturity. Mexican debt is trading at about 200 basis points over US
Treasuries. Both countries have a similar credit rating to South Africa.
Earlier this year, South Africa was awarded an investment grade rating by
Moody's, the US credit rating agency. Japan's Nippon Investor Services also
gave the country an investment grade rating. However, Standard &amp; Poor's, the
other major US rating agency, awarded a sub-investment grade rating, albeit
with a positive outlook.
The launch follows the completion yesterday of a series of investment
presentations in Asia, Europe and the US by a South African delegation,
including Mr Chris Liebenberg, the finance minister; Mr Alec Erwin, his
deputy; Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank; and Mr Tito Mboweni,
labour minister.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The macro-economic fundamentals for gold look dreadful. The costs of holding
non-yielding assets such as bullion have risen as interest rates have
started to move up. Alternative investments such as bonds appear
increasingly attractive. Meanwhile, the potential rewards of holding gold
remain few and far between. Precious metals have traditionally been viewed
as a hedge against inflation. That rationale may no longer be valid: the
general breakdown of international exchange controls allows investors to
switch out of depreciating currencies; and the development of sophisticated
derivative instruments means there are more effective ways of offsetting
inflationary dangers.
Fundamentals apart, the current absence of any significant inflation in
Europe, Japan or the US provides little incentive to hold the precious
metal. Nor does the supply-demand balance give cause for comfort. With the
gold price falling to a 16 week low yesterday, Asian and Middle Eastern
investors - who generate 55 per cent of demand - have few reasons to buy
bullion. Many have already been burned by the depreciation of their
dollar-backed assets against their local currencies. On the supply side, any
decent price increase tempts mine-owners to raise production or central
banks to release gold reserves. For the gold price, the worst of all
possible worlds seems to have materialised.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish &amp; Newcastle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years, shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle have risen 22 per
cent against the brewery sector. The reasons are clear: it has made a series
of well-timed and well-executed strategic moves. It pulled out of hotels at
the right moment and diversified effectively into the continental European
leisure industry. It also had the nerve to buy the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain
at a price which competitors deemed high, but which now looks reasonable.
The figures yesterday were short on detail but the message was clear - the
integration of Chef &amp; Brewer is proceeding better than planned. Annual cost
savings should amount to an ample Pounds 14m by the end of the year.
That said, without the first time contribution from Chef &amp; Brewer, the group
would have struggled to produce much growth in either earnings or operating
profits. Even if problems in malting accounted for half the decline in beer
profits, the underlying business was subject to a familiar squeeze in
margins. The industry backdrop remains challenging. Competition in the beer
market is intense, volumes are falling as the drift to wines and spirits
continues. The absence of a 'feel-good' factor means that there is little
likelihood of a swift pick-up in retail profits as the economy recovers. The
shares now enjoy a market rating and the outperformance is unlikely to
continue.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Kidder Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber's decision yesterday to jettison the Japanese operations of
Kidder Peabody, its recently acquired subsidiary, was doubly significant.
Not least, it demonstrated PaineWebber's determination to dispel doubts
about the wisdom of its purchase. Since October, when the group bought its
majority shareholding, PaineWebber has moved fast to address Kidder's
problems. The bulk of the esoteric mortgage-backed bond portfolio has been
dismantled. The termination of the Tokyo equity operations is only the
latest in a series of far-reaching, cost-cutting measures.
Also significant was PaineWebber's conclusion that Kidder's Tokyo operations
were dispensable even though they were profitable. That underlines the
problems facing all Tokyo-based broking houses. The volatility and volumes
on the equity market have been so bad that most domestic brokers are
incapable of making money. Non-Japanese houses, less constrained by ministry
of finance regulations, are doing better. But the huge costs of doing
business in Japan mean they are not particularly profitable: over the past
24 months two other non-Japanese groups preceded PaineWebber in selling
their Tokyo Stock Exchange memberships because the benefits failed to match
the costs.
PaineWebber may find the queue for its Tokyo membership is short. It may
confer lower dealing costs, but trading volumes need to be high to
compensate for the additional infrastructure and capital required. The last
time a membership came up, the ministry of finance had to twist arms before
a buyer materialised. Since then conditions have deteriorated further.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Mercury's return to roots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Communications delivered a classic strategic U-turn yesterday. In
pulling out of payphones, directory inquiries and two other peripheral
businesses, the company returns to its roots, providing business customers
with long distance and international telephone services. This refocusing
goes hand in hand with welcome cost cuts, but it does not provide much
comfort for investors in Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent.
Times have changed since the days when Mercury and BT carved up the UK
telecommunications market between them. Since the duopoly came to an end in
1991, competition has intensified across the board, but especially so in the
business customer segment. Mercury's traditional policy of competing on
price rather on the range and quality of service has left it vulnerable to
attack from powerful new entrants such as Worldcom and Energis, not to
mention a revitalised BT. Over the past year, BT has successfully
implemented price cuts designed to hurt Mercury, demonstrating how well BT
has adapted to the new environment.
The cost-cutting announced yesterday gives Mercury a chance to restore its
competitiveness. The reduced cost base will help Mercury's profits momentum
in the short term. But the medium-term future remains uncertain and for
those investors who do not share the euphoria about the development of
Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's highly profitable Hong Kong subsidiary, the
uncertainty over Mercury's strategy provides further good reason for selling
the stock.
The shares are down by 19 per cent against the market over the past 12
months, but the prospective yield is still a modest 3.3 per cent. This could
rise sharply if investors sense that C&amp;W's growth stock rating is no longer
deserved.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Court drops diamond price-fixing case against GE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US price-fixing case brought against General Electric over its
industrial diamonds business collapsed yesterday as a judge ruled that the
company had no case to answer.
The abrupt end to the trial, which began five weeks ago, marks a severe blow
for the US Justice Department. It had accused GE, the US industrial
conglomerate, of conspiring with De Beers, the South African group, to fix
the price of diamonds in 1991 and 1992.
The case followed a two-year Justice Department anti-trust investigation
into GE and De Beers, which together control more than 80 per cent of the
world's industrial diamond output. Under the Clinton administration, the
department launched a stream of anti-trust inquiries, from computer software
to car rentals.
Yesterday, Judge George Smith, who was hearing the case in federal court in
the southern district of Ohio, accepted a GE motion to dismiss the Justice
Department's charges.
The motion was filed after the US authorities had completed their case
against GE, but before the company had begun its own detailed defence.
The judge's decision to reject the case turned on the role played by Mr
Philippe Liotier, the head of a diamond tool-making company owned by Societe
Generale de Belgique and a customer of both GE and De Beers.
The Justice Department had alleged that Mr Liotier passed on to GE
information about De Beer's plans to raise its diamond prices. Mr Liotier
was on the board of Sibeka, a company whose marketing was controlled by De
Beers.
Commenting on his decision to dismiss the case, Judge Smith said: 'Proving
that Liotier was acting on De Beer's behalf was a crucial link in the
government's case. It is a link the government failed to establish, despite
Herculean efforts, even under the relatively low hurdle of the sufficiency
of the evidence standard.'
The judge went on to say that the Justice Department had not managed to
prove that the link existed, 'even when the evidence is viewed in the light
most favourable to the government'.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Government warns defeat on VAT may force tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is drawing up plans to raise taxes or cut public spending if
it loses today's crucial vote on value added tax.
As the rebellion by Tory backbenchers showed signs of spreading at
Westminster yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned MPs they
would look 'extremely foolish' if they blocked the government's plans to
lift the rate of VAT on domestic fuel from 8 to 17.5 per cent.
With the result of tonight's vote too close to call, Conservative business
managers were raising the prospect of a possible increase in income tax or
the general rate of VAT if the government's VAT on fuel proposals were
overturned.
Meanwhile, Labour attempted to raise the temperature further, claiming that
the rebellion was gaining momentum.
As senior Tories insisted that they expected the government to win tonight's
vote, Mr David Sumberg, Conservative MP for Bury South, delivered an
unexpected blow by saying he would vote for Labour's motion because it would
give the country, the House and the government 'the chance to think again'.
Separately, Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Ulster Popular Unionist who often
supports the government, confirmed that he would vote with the opposition.
With the nine Ulster Unionists also set to vote with Labour unless ministers
come up with what one senior MP described as a 'very powerful argument', it
looked last night as if the opposition of eight Conservatives - or 15
abstentions - would be enough to defeat the government. Its majority is 14.
Last night there appeared to be at least 15 Tories, including several
Eurosceptics, who might either abstain or vote against the government. They
included: Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Sir Andrew Bowden
(Brighton Kemptown), Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth), Mr Nicholas
Fairbairn (Perth and Kinross), Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr), Mr Christopher Gill
(Ludlow), Mr Paul Marland (Gloucestershire West), Mr Tony Marlow
(Northampton North), Mr William Powell (Corby), Mr Richard Shepherd
(Aldridge-Brownhills), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton), Mr Nicholas Winterton
(Macclesfield) and Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North).
Tonight's vote is on a motion to reopen the issue of VAT on domestic fuel.
The government would have to be defeated once more to block the increase,
unless Mr Clarke changed plans before a second vote.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr Clarke said a government defeat would mean only
that the 'shape of the resulting Finance Bill would change'.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Mercury to cut 2,500 jobs after fall in profits: Loss-making
services axed in Pounds 120m measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Communications, British Telecommunications' largest competitor in
the UK, will cut 2,500 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce, over the
next 12 months and withdraw loss-making services in an attempt to return to
profits growth.
The services to go include payphones, directory inquiries and the company's
fledgling on-line services combining information and entertainment.
The measures, widely expected after disappointing interim results last
month, will cost the company Pounds 120m in the current financial year which
ends next March, a Pounds 40m charge for job losses and Pounds 80m for asset
write-downs linked with the job cuts.
The company's interim profits fell Pounds 3m to Pounds 96m on revenues up 12
per cent at Pounds 797m.
Mr Duncan Lewis, Mercury's newly-appointed chief executive, said yesterday
that he believed the losses - 2,000 permanent jobs, mostly in administrative
and support areas, and 500 contract and part-time positions out of a staff
of 11,400 - would be enough to bring costs under control.
There would be no need for further substantial restructuring, although
intensifying competition meant there would be continual pressure on costs.
Mercury, 80 per cent owned by the UK telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless and 20
per cent by Bell Canada, has been the principal competitor to BT since the
latter's privatisation in 1984.
Competition in UK telecoms has intensified since the government opened up
the market in 1991. Mr Lewis ascribed yesterday's moves to this, describing
Mercury's network as 'mature' but not suited for competing across the board
with a number of niche operators.
Mercury's strategy will be to concentrate on niche services including
international business, corporate and government business, small and medium
enterprises and home business. It will continue to support residential
customers but is likely to focus on cable television operators and other
industry partners.
Analysts remained sceptical that yesterday's retrenchment would end
Mercury's problems.
Mr Robert Morris, telecoms analyst with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,
said: 'This does not appear to address the key problem - that Mercury is
becoming more of a niche operator by moving back into the corporate sector,
yet that niche is under greater pressure than ever from new competitors and
price cuts by BT.'
Mr Laurence Heyworth, analyst at Robert Fleming, the broker, said: 'Mercury
may face an even tougher challenge in future, as BT continues to improve its
efficiency and marketing. If BT is given the greater pricing flexibility
that it is seeking to target the market, it will have still more severe
problems.'
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, will on Thursday publish a
consultative document proposing far-reaching changes to UK competition
rules.

It didn't take National Parking Corporation long to climb back into its

founders reverted to form and yesterday asked the FT's reporter to leave the

Even the stock market's greatest basket cases nowadays begrudgingly admit
the press. Unlike the car-parkers - who have long held the media to be
nosy-parkers.
The FT is still waiting to hear how many car parks NPC operates, a question

When 46-year-old boxer George Foreman last month regained the world
heavyweight championship, big bucks were sure to follow. Now he's being
offered an estimated Dollars 2m per advertising endorsement, or two thirds
of the total income he earned for ads last year.
Advertisers are hoping Foreman - a preacher as well as prize-fighter - will
remain a suitable member of the shrivelled ranks of squeaky-clean sporting
figures useful for such endorsements; possession of no unsightly stains is
now a sine qua non in the US endorsement market, whose fingers have been
badly burned by the likes of Michael Jackson.
So you can now buy a Foreman-autographed glove in a display case for Dollars
399.95, or a rather cheaper signed photo of Foreman seconds after his
November 5 victory over Michael Moorer.
How long before he is endorsing slimming products?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hearts of Tory business managers must have been in their mouths
yesterday morning on sighting a strongly worded press release from
Mid-Staffordshire MP Michael Fabricant condemning the government's VAT on
fuel proposals.
To date, Fabricant has made his name less for any rebelliousness than for
his extraordinary flaxen mane - once memorably described by a sketch writer
as resembling 'a Caribbean beach hut wrecked by a tornado'.
Yet here he was on the eve of today's vital procedural vote announcing his
opposition 'on three grounds' to 17.5 per cent VAT on fuel. If that was the
attitude of a stalwart, what were the hard-pressed whips supposed to do?
Breathe again. For, provided they read his second page, they discovered that
Fabricant will be behind the government tonight - because, his 'argument'
goes, Labour's amendment is merely procedural and would not have the effect
of keeping VAT on fuel at 8 per cent.
If only Tory backbenchers would devote a fraction of such ingenuity to
deciding how best to run the country.

Gender-exclusive it may be, as Observer has already pointed out, but the JO
Hambro Businessman of the Year Award has managed, unlike some such prizes,
to avoid looking foolish - largely by sticking to such indubitable pillars
of the business world as Sir Christopher Hogg (1993) and Sir David Scholey
(1990). To date, only 1984's titleholder, Gerald Ronson, who spent time in
jail in connection with the Guinness affair, constitutes a bit of a blip.
So this year's winner, Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, steps
effortlessly into the eminent line-up - except for the little matter, to
which he himself alluded yesterday, of his having only been back in the UK
for 14 months after a 40-year absence.
Appropriately enough, it fell to Lord Kingsdown, governor of the Bank of
England when the latter made Purves's residence in London a condition of the
Midland takeover, to make the award.
How he must have enjoyed commending Purves for his 'personal courage,
fortitude and modesty' - Purves, the proud Scot who, whatever he now thinks
about his London sojourn, famously dislikes being told to do anything by
anybody.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Observer: Bets on Bentsen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the election of a hostile Republican Congress last month had seemed to
confer job security on virtually the entire Clinton cabinet, the rumour that
treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is poised to pack his bags is the one that
will not go away. 'Y'all keep asking me that question and one of these days
you're gonna be right,' he barked back at hacks even before the mid-term
elections.
Yesterday he brushed off renewed speculation as 'premature', whilst
simultaneously managing to convey the impression that he was off in a matter
of months - if not weeks.
While the courtly, cunning 73-year-old Texan may initially have seemed the
odd man out in a youthful administration, Bentsen had actually grown close
to President Clinton, who, for instance, bowed to his advice to fight a
lonely battle for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Having served seven years in the House of Representatives and 22 years in
the Senate, he would also have been a useful link between an administration
lacking in 'greyheads' and a Republican Congress, where he has many friends.
But the septuagenarian is supposedly looking forward to getting back into
business - quite what, he hasn't said.
His father built a fortune on land sales to Mexicans while Bentsen junior
made his money from 16 years in the rather staider world of insurance. The
puzzle, though, is why, at his stage in life, should that be more alluring
than benignly neglecting the dollar?

<TEXT>
The insurance companies and pension funds that control the largest block of
shares in British Gas have been among the least vocal of those complaining
about the 75 per cent pay rise granted to the company's chief executive, Mr
Cedric Brown. Is it realistic for the government to look to these
instinctive non-interventionists to exercise a restraining influence over
directors' remuneration?
Realistic or not, it is certainly logical, since institutional shareholders
are the legal owners of a majority of the equity in British industry and
commerce. If runaway pay packages in the boardroom are a symptom of the
divorce between ownership and control in the corporate sector, then some
tightening of ownership discipline would be a legitimate way to address the
licence that prevails in the absence of any objective benchmark or proxy for
market value.
The problem arises because of fundamental conflicts of interest. The
non-executive directors who sit on remuneration committees are usually
executive directors of other companies and have little interest in keeping a
lid on pay. The remuneration consultants who advise them have a greater
interest in pleasing the directors than the ultimate beneficial owners. The
question is how to inject a greater degree of independence into this
over-cosy dialogue.
Greater transparency would certainly help the institutions to exercise more
effective oversight. An obvious starting point would be to ban the practice
of bundling up resolutions at annual general meetings, so that contentious
issues of corporate governance are packaged together with resolutions with
wider shareholder appeal on which shareholders are asked to exercise a
single vote.
Nor is there any reason why directors' pay should be exempted from
individual disclosure. So, too, with other parts of the remuneration
package. While the accountancy bodies appear to have doubts about the
practicability of valuing directors' share options, City practitioners mark
options to market value daily on the basis of widely accepted computerised
models which would be perfectly adequate for annual disclosure purposes. An
equally obvious loophole in the law is the failure to require disclosure of
the large actuarial costs to the company of increasing directors' pay in the
year before retirement.
The usual argument against putting remuneration packages to a shareholder
vote is that incoming senior executives could not be persuaded to take new
jobs if the terms of their contracts were subject to a shareholder veto. Yet
this rests on a misunderstanding of the institutions, which - unlike some
members of the cabinet - are not instinctively hostile to high pay. Still
less are they keen to damage the competitiveness of British industry. To the
extent that incoming executives need additional reassurance, this could be
provided by companies publicising a clear statement of remuneration policy,
with which any new appointment would comply.
The bigger difficulty lies in the institutions themselves, since they, too,
as legal rather than beneficial owners, are subject to conflicts of
interest. Insurance company directors have their own pay packages to think
of, while pension fund trustees are often creatures of the company. Even
with greater transparency, they have no great incentive to deny
international-style pay packages to executives who run companies with
predominantly domestic revenues. In the absence of greater accountability
for the institutions themselves, the incentive to play an active watchdog
role will be weak.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Personal View: Labour and education key to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SEBASTIAN EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the leaders of the Latin American and Caribbean nations meet President
Bill Clinton at the Summit of the Americas in Miami this Friday, they will
press for closer trade ties.
They will rightly argue that the future of their market-oriented reforms
will depend on the region's ability to continue generating rapid exports
growth. This, in turn, requires an assurance that protectionism in
industrial countries - and especially in the US - will be kept in check.
After implementing one of the most dramatic unilateral trade liberalisation
reforms of modern times, the Latin American countries want to be rewarded by
obtaining better access to large international markets.
Achieving a sustainable rapid rate of exports growth, however, will take
more than trade agreements. It will also require the governments of the
region to implement a series of 'second-generation' reforms aimed at
continuously increasing productivity gains. In particular, these new reforms
will have to deal with two fundamental problems: outdated labour market
legislation and dismal education systems.
Labour market legislation is thoroughly antiquated in most Latin American
countries (as with so many areas, the pioneer reformer, Chile, is the clear
exception), imposing astonishing restrictions to labour mobility. Taxes on
employment are high, reaching almost 50 per cent of wages in some countries.
Severance payments schemes reduce flexibility, discourage on-the-job
training, and discriminate against younger workers.
There is now abundant evidence from the rapidly growing economies of east
Asia that success in international markets requires flexible labour markets.
This allows companies to readjust their use of labour to maximise their
competitiveness.
But perhaps the most serious aspect of labour relations in Latin America is
that public sector unions still exercise a tremendous political influence in
many countries - especially in the health and education sectors. They use
this influence to obstruct any attempt to introduce accountability, reform
their operations and improve the delivery of public services. For example,
the Chilean education minister was recently ousted because his plan to
improve the dilapidated quality of secondary education was strongly opposed
by the vociferous teachers' union.
Reforming labour legislation - and 'reinventing' the trade union movement as
truly democratic, inclusive and non-confrontational - is one of the most
difficult challenges that the countries of Latin America will face in the
future.
Education reform is another fundamental priority. The limited coverage of
Latin American education systems, their lack of emphasis on science and
technology, and their generally low quality, stand in the way of improved
productivity.
A recent World Bank study found that the average quality of primary
education in Latin America is dismal. It quoted an international comparative
study on reading abilities of nine-year-olds which found that Venezuelan
students ranked last out of a sample of 27 countries.
Another study among 13-year-olds, carried out in 1992, looked at the quality
of science and mathematics education, and found that Brazilian students from
Sao Paulo and Fortaleza were outperformed by students from South Korea,
Taiwan, Israel, Jordan, China, and by every developed country in the sample.
Only Mozambican students recorded lower test scores than the Brazilian
students.
Finally, a 1992 study on mathematics and science education for 13-year-olds
in five Latin American countries - Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela - found that, with the exception of elite
schools, test performance was in most cases significantly below that of
Asian countries such as Thailand.
Improving the quality of education will require strengthening management,
reallocating education resources, an increase in funding and making teachers
accountable - especially to parents. In many cases, it will also mean
decentralising education, giving a greater role to the private sector.
Teachers should be trained using modern techniques, their skills
periodically renewed and their salaries set according to performance.
Only if Latin American countries improve the flexibility of their labour
markets and performance of their education systems will they systematically
be able to expand productivity, accelerate growth and move towards
prosperity.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A transport levy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke last week sweetened the pill of renewed cuts in public
infrastructure investment by promising that the government's Private Finance
Initiative would fill much of the gap. On paper, however, the UK
chancellor's grand Budget forecasts were a triumph of hope over two years'
disappointing experience.
Most are agreed that modern governments should seek new ways to involve the
private sector in transport and other large-scale infrastructure
investments. The UK government's answer, first launched in 1992, was the
PFI. This may yet win over the many doubters, but only a handful of projects
has managed to meet the combined objections of the Treasury and would-be
private investors.
The Corporation of London yesterday proposed a rather different, and
promising, approach to bridging the private-public divide: an
'Infrastructure Fund for London', financed by a levy on local businesses, to
be raised alongside business rates. The fund, if supported by a majority of
local companies, would be used to support efficiency-enhancing investments
throughout the area, thus, it is hoped, raising London's commercial value
and attractiveness to investors.
The Treasury - and the government - will have many quibbles with the
proposal. But a business levy would have the advantage of linking payment
for infrastructure improvements more directly to the ultimate beneficiaries,
namely local property owners. Many details have yet to be worked out, but
the government would be foolish to let its fondness for PFI blind it to the
benefits of a better way.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Leading Article: The danger of a cold peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If any such warning was still needed, President Boris Yeltsin's blunt words
at the CSCE summit in Budapest yesterday gave notice that the post-cold war
honeymoon is over. He angrily rejected the plans of the Nato alliance to
expand to the east, without including Russia itself, and warned that Europe
was in danger of sliding from the cold war into a 'cold peace'.
President Bill Clinton's rejoinder, that no country would be allowed a veto
on Nato enlargement, sounds all very well. But it is his administration's
determination to accelerate that process which has infuriated Moscow. It
suggests that the Nato allies in general, and the US in particular, have
greatly underestimated Russian sensitivity to being left out in the cold
once again.
Of course the western allies should not indefinitely appease the Russian
government which, in spite of its unpredictable vacillations in matters of
economic reform, has proved that it remains a tough and sophisticated player
of international diplomacy. Its tactic has been to remain persistently
ambiguous, extract concessions, and then still fail to deliver its part of
the bargain. That is what Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
did yet again in Brussels last week, when he refused to finalise plans for a
military co-operation programme with Nato.
Yet the west must at the same time understand and respond to the
extraordinary sensitivity of a humbled superpower, whose economy is in
tatters and whose proud military establishment is grumbling and potentially
mutinous. It was precisely to reconcile the conflicting demands of the
central and east Europeans for full Nato membership, while keeping the
Russians slightly more at arm's length, that the Partnership for Peace
programme was devised: a half-way house to enlargement, and a deliberate
fudge. It remains valid today, and full Nato membership for the central and
east Europeans should not be over-hasty. Indeed, the US urge to accelerate
the process seems counter-productive. Is it really sensible to extend a
security guarantee up to the former Soviet borders - indeed up to the
Russian frontier, if the Baltic states are included - which Washington
itself is unlikely to implement?
What the central and east Europeans really need today is economic security,
not military defence. Access to western markets, followed by full membership
of the European Union, is therefore a far more urgent priority than full
Nato membership. It is also a process which is much easier for the Russians
to accept. Indeed, Moscow has been positively enthusiastic about Finland's
prospective EU membership, precisely because it will bring the Union to its
very borders. It means that western Europe will become more aware of the
economic development needs of Russia itself, and more willing to contribute,
the Russians believe.
If the EU continues along its path of strengthening the European defence
pillar of Nato through the Western European Union, future east European
members of the EU will be getting enhanced military security through the
back door. It will lack the US security guarantee, but that seems
unrealistic anyway.
There is no doubt that the EU enlargement process to the east will itself
prove extremely difficult, not just for the east Europeans, but for the
current members too, who will have to pay for it. They have barely started
to calculate the cost, nor to define what reforms will be needed. But it is
the right road forward, and one which will not cause Europe simply to slide
into a 'cold peace'.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No link between pay and performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD B BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chairman of British Gas (Letters, December 1) bases his argument
for the increases in directors' salaries on two premises, performance and
comparability - both of which provide shaky foundations for his case.
The chairman writes: 'It is his performance that counts.' All the evidence
so far published in the UK and in the US demonstrates zero linkage between
directors' pay and the performance of their companies. Also widely
recognised is that lack of performance never leads to reduced pay. The
'significant annual cash compensation' which the chairman refers to will
ensure that pay at the top of British Gas is kept high regardless of the
future performance of the company. Private shareholders object strongly to
this.
The comparability argument will not carry any weight with the majority of
private shareholders, because the remuneration of the highly paid executives
of other UK companies, which British Gas now wishes to emulate, has been
fixed by a close-knit group of directors. Result? Top pay increases far
exceed increases in company profits, in overall output of the economy or in
the pay of other workers.
The chairman refers to the planned 'dramatic' Pounds 600m reduction in
costs. British Gas's operating costs excluding exceptional charges have
increased from Pounds 6.9bn in 1990 to Pounds 9bn in 1993, a 30 per cent
increase. The planned reduction is, therefore, some 6 per cent of present
operating costs. Dramatic?
British Gas should put this remuneration package to the vote at the next
AGM. This would at least, if carried, bestow some legitimacy on the
company's intended action. Private shareholders who do not support the
company's intended action may choose to give us their proxies.

<TEXT>
Sir, The reference to radio licences in your Letters column (November 26-27)
reminded me of the early days of wireless when my older brother, Bill
Francey, then a schoolboy, applied for and obtained an experimental licence
for reception and morse transmission for the sum of 10 shillings and
sixpence. It was signed by an up-and-coming politician called J Ramsay
MacDonald.
My brother in the course of his experiments erected a 100ft aerial between
our chimney and the flagpole of a nearby factory, an aerial which was
responsible for the sudden death of many unsuspecting seagulls before my
father made him dismantle it and re-erect it in our loft.
Whether it was equally effective would be known only to my brother's fellow
experimenter, a young chap who lived about 10 miles away, who had a great
interest in flying and wanted to improve his morse proficiency.
The young man's name was Jim Mollison.

FT  06 DEC 94 / A dangerous battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may not believe the passage I am about to cite unless you heard it with
your own ears, but here it is: 'The United Kingdom - the greatest cradle of
culture and academic and scientific and artistic and political achievement
in modern times - that's not some trifle to be lightly set at risk.' This
anachronistic fantasy was purveyed by Mr John Major, in a speech written for
delivery at last Friday's conference of Conservative women. An ancient
mirage of national glory was his product, the flag his packaging. 'It is,'
said the prime minister, referring to the country he runs with such
effortless brilliance, 'the highest cause this party knows - and we will
defend it with every fibre of our being.'
There you have it. England beats Graeco-Roman civilisation into a cocked
hat. The Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, the Egyptians, the
Italians, the Indians, the Persians - oh, why bother to list them, they are
all foreign, and they have nothing to teach the British. Music, painting,
philosophy, science, the very act of learning were all invented here. There
is a certain sadness in the vainglorious, grandiloquent rodomontade with
which some of our politicians express their nostalgia for a faded past.
Thank heavens there are fewer than six years to endure before 2000. Then it
should be clear to everyone, even Mr Major, that the 19th century is over.
Sorry about that moment of passion. I was looking through the prime
minister's address to the Tory ladies when the above-quoted nonsense leapt
out. The business of the day is cool analysis of Mr Major's attack on
Labour's proposals for constitutional reform, and the opposition's response.
The matter can be disposed of quite succinctly. Labour is right on the
merits of the case. The prime minister may be right on where the political
advantage lies. Mr Major believes that his warning that devolution of power
to a Scottish parliament would lead to the break-up of the UK was an
important element in his election victory of 1992; the opposition parties
have nevertheless persisted with their modest proposals for constitutional
change.
These include regional assemblies, the exclusion of hereditary peers from
the House of Lords, a referendum on electoral reform, a bill of rights, a
freedom of information act, and the curtailment of the crown prerogative,
the unwritten law that permits ministers to legislate in the name of the
monarch. Most of these have been propounded in this space, as elsewhere.
Whether or not you agree with any of them or indeed the package as a whole
depends on whether you regard the British executive as sufficiently checked
and balanced by other branches of government - and whether you think our
system is producing good governance.
The argument has been rehearsed many times, principally among the chattering
classes, but also through pressure groups such as Charter 88. This week the
audience may have been further enlarged because Mr Jack Straw appeared on a
TV programme in which he repeated his well-known view that the monarchy
ought to be retrenched, limited to its symbolic functions. That would
protect it from misuse as camouflage for the elective dictatorship. The
Conservatives grasped the opportunity. 'Labour attacks Queen' touches the
nationalist nerve Mr Major hoped to reach when he spoke last Friday. You can
see the Tory train of thought. Never mind the details of the proposals by
the opposition's spokesman on home affairs. They are merely common sense.
Forget the personal life of the Prince of Wales, or the difficulties into
which the minor members of the house of Windsor have stumbled. They are
merely show business.
Concentrate on the Queen herself, the institution, the flag, the nation. Mr
Peter Lilley has done so. 'Labour voters are usually in my experience very
conservative, very pro-monarchy, very pro-Britain,' the secretary for social
security observed at the weekend. There has been plenty of time to get this
kind of thinking into people's heads. It was in 1838 that Peel delineated as
Conservative principles 'the maintenance of the Peerage and the Monarchy -
the continuance of the just powers and attributes of King, Lords, and
Commons . . .' I, and perhaps you, may think that a century and a half later
some rational modifications would improve our polity, but our elevated
opinion may carry little weight when set against bar-room salutes to 'Queen
and Country'.
Yet Labour has no choice but to do battle on this dangerous ground. In
nearly every other area it is the 'me too' party. Privatisation? Labour will
leave untouched whatever it finds in the private sector. Tax increases? Not
us, guv. Schools? We'll do what the Conservatives do, but rename it. Health?
Ditto. Increase public spending? Perish the thought. Changing the nature of
the state is another matter. Labour will undertake what its leader, lovingly
quoted by Mr Major, has called 'the most extensive package of constitutional
reform ever proposed by a British government'. That, said the prime
minister, was a 'sort of teenage madness'.
You could throw in one other small item - the European Union. Broadly
speaking, Labour is for it, the Conservatives increasingly against it. It
was Lady Thatcher who dramatised the connection between Europe, the monarchy
and nationhood when, as prime minister, she spoke of the single currency as
a threat to the Queen's head on the coinage. Conservative Eurosceptics tend
to be Peelites; they view the institutions of England, and the character of
the English, as strengths that 'enabled this country, in her contests and
the fearful rivalry of war, to extort the admiration of the world'.
That may have been stirring stuff in 1838. Today, with the nation in reduced
circumstances, the British constitution clearly needs modernising. To say
that what Parliament ordains is all the law you need is no longer tenable.
If Ulster can have an assembly, why not Scotland? The Crown must adapt to
survive. The Commons should sit for a fixed term. The people should be given
a choice on electoral reform. Labour must counter emotional declarations of
greatness with suchlike reasoned propositions. Alas, bombast usually wins.
Reform sounds sensible to me. But does it stand a chance against 'the Queen,
God bless her'?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir LESLIE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to add a footnote to Mr Giordano's reasoned letter to you
(December 1).
My spell of duty with the British Gas Board covered the concluding years of
nationalisation and the first few years of privatisation. The effects of the
change were far more profound and dramatic than can be generally realised
and were felt throughout the organisation.
Prior to the change, all real authority lay with the ministry. The board
could propose but not decide. Senior executives saw themselves as fulfilling
ministry requirements. They were remunerated accordingly at rates close to
civil service rates (with the concomitant benefits of jobs for life and
pensions). Promotion depended to a great extent on the availability of 'dead
man's shoes'. If success was obtained (such as bringing North Sea gas into
British homes), it was entirely due to the relentless energy of the chairman
of that day.
Overnight, the board was required to assume responsibility for customers,
shareholders, employees and the country. The loss of monopoly destroyed any
remaining vestiges of 'cosiness'. Some managers found they could not live
with the new situation and had to go. For the first time, new blood had to
be brought in. The company was now exposed to the full weight of competition
from British, American and French majors. Only the best would do and,
fortunately, Dick Giordano and Cedric Brown are numbered among them.
Of course, the divesting of responsibility from the ministry should have
provided a substantial benefit to the national economy by the release of
many civil servants, and not just in the gas industry.
This benefit in itself would have offset Cedric Brown's salary many times
over.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Trying to be all things to all music
creators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WAYNE BICKERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The report by Alice Rawsthorn of the pending Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation into the Performing Rights Society ('MMC to probe
Performing Rights Society', December 1), while inevitably stronger on
accusation than our response, neatly illuminated a collecting society's
fundamental problem.
The top stratum of performing rights earners - and U2 was extensively quoted
 -whose proportional contributions to administration costs really make the
work of the PRS possible, wants more income, more quickly, for lower
administration deductions. Huge concerts, major world tours and continual
networked broadcast of their compositions gives them the right to demand
this, they believe.
Yet the composers of what the Office of Fair Trading referred to as 'less
popular forms of music' want something for any and every performance of
their works - no matter where, no matter how small the licence income for
the performance may have been, and no matter how great the administrative
cost may be. Small concerts, no world tours and rare or non-existent
broadcasts give them the right to demand this, they believe.
Because the UK has no other national performing right society, PRS is a de
facto monopoly, and understandably will attract the attention of the OFT and
the MMC from time to time. We have spent 80 years trying to be all things to
all music creators, and we are tackling head-on the levels of administration
cost engendered by that aim.
It is not in the interests of some of our critics to admit that their
demands are already being pragmatically met, but we are confident that the
MMC inquiry will show that our policies and practices are in the best
interests of our membership as a whole.
The complex nature of our job is highlighted by the fact that even the FT
totally misunderstood part of the issue. You reported that PRS now only
collects 'royalties' on live performances at 550 'big venues'. PRS total
1994 income from all sources will be more than Pounds 160m. Our live
performance licence income in 1994 totals about Pounds 13m of that. We
license and collect fees from some 40,000 venues where live music is played.
We distribute royalties partly on the basis of programme information from a
sample of big, medium and small venues.
Of the Pounds 13m referred to, only Pounds 750,000 came from classical
performances.
I wonder how many of the companies featured in the FT's pages have shown -
as PRS has - income growth well in excess of inflation, and steadily falling
costs, for five years, during and emerging from a period of deep recession.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The FT Interview: Undaunted by hurdles ahead - Ingvar
Carlsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who has just taken charge of a country with one of the biggest
holes in Europe in its public finances, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's
recently restored Social Democratic prime minister, shows a remarkable
degree of confidence about the task facing him.
Sweden will have a budget deficit in the current fiscal year of SKr200bn
(Pounds 17bn) - about 13 per cent of gross national product. The state debt,
the fastest-growing among industrialised countries, will top 90 per cent of
gross national product next year.
The financial markets remain nervous about the new government's ability to
reconcile its commitment to the country's big welfare system with the need
for drastic action to cut public spending. Mr Carlsson, however, insists
that the job will be done.
'It went very rapidly in the wrong direction and I am very optimistic about
the possibilities to change this again,' he declares.
He ticks off a list of measures. A package of tax increases (the largest for
years in Sweden) and spending cuts announced last month will shave SKr57bn
from the deficit. These come on top of SKr18bn in cuts inherited from the
previous centre-right government of by Mr Carl Bildt, the radical leader of
the conservative Moderate party. Further measures worth another SKr20bn -
mainly cuts - are promised in the January budget.
'Honestly, I don't think the market is aware yet of what we are doing,' he
says. 'But they will see the facts. (The measures) will stabilise the total
Swedish debt before 1998, which was the target we set in the election
campaign. I think it is possible in 1997.'
Nor is Mr Carlsson worried that his government's forecast of more than 3 per
cent growth next year - on which the deficit reduction plan depends - is
ahead of most market expectations.
'I met a large group of industrialists only last Monday and they say all
forecasts now are underestimating the activities already taking place in our
companies. I don't think we are over-optimistic. Now there is a real swing
in investment and demand is also coming in the domestic market, so I think
we will have a very good year in 1995.'
So far, the markets have reserved judgment on the government's economic
policies: long-term interest rates in Sweden are 3.5 percentage points
higher than in Germany. Mr Carlsson knows that, if the January budget fails
to convince the markets, continuing high interest rates will dog his efforts
to cut unemployment.
But in the meantime, the prime minister is clearly enjoying his return to
power, savouring his clear election victory in September and the Yes vote in
last month's referendum over membership of the European Union.
The silver-haired Mr Carlsson, party leader since 1986, exudes relief that
the political status quo has been restored, after Mr Bildt's coalition set
out to transform Sweden into a full-blown liberal market economy.
Instead, Mr Carlsson is reassured that Swedes flocked back to the Social
Democrats (in power for more than 50 of the last 60 years) in order to
preserve their welfare state - as far as present straitened circumstances
allow.
Even though he campaigned in favour of EU membership, Mr Carlsson will take
a markedly more cautious and traditional approach to the Union than his
predecessor. Mr Bildt saw joining the EU as part of a strategic swing - both
politically and economically - away from Sweden's tradition of aloof
isolation from the rest of Europe. He spoke, for example, of Swedish
neutrality as having lost its meaning.
Mr Carlsson - whose party held out against EU membership for years,
primarily to safeguard the country's neutral stance - rejects the idea that
neutrality is dead. He knows that almost half of all Social Democrat
supporters voted against membership in last month's referendum and is keen
not to widen the gulf further.
He is careful to emphasise that Swedish military non-alignment and
neutrality are still endorsed by parliament. Sweden will become an observer
in the Western European Union, the EU's defence organisation, but not a full
member - nor will it join Nato.
'I think it is not in the interests of Nato or of Sweden to change the basic
security policy in northern Europe,' he says. 'We have had a very stable
situation in northern Europe for many years with the kind of security policy
we have had so far, and I think it could be dangerous to give Russia the
feeling that we are encircling them.
'Of course, with the Berlin Wall torn down in 1989 we have a completely new
security situation in Sweden. The old, very difficult policy for us between
east and west - that's gone. But when you come to the core - are we prepared
to give up military non-alignment? - the answer is no.'
On social policy, however, Mr Carlsson and his government will aim to take a
leading role in the EU's fight against unemployment. With unemployment in
Sweden having reached unprecedented levels, at about 13 per cent of the
workforce, the Social Democrats support concerted employment policies for
the EU. Mr Carlsson supports moves to add conditions on employment levels to
the fiscal and monetary criteria set at the Maastricht summit for European
monetary union.
'I think that more and more politicians are aware that, if Europe doesn't
better solve the unemployment problem, it is not only a problem for
individuals, it is a problem for European democracy,' he says. 'If we in
these good years have 8-10 per cent unemployment and we meet the next
recession from that very high level, I think we will enter a very dangerous
situation.'
The prime minister will enter the debate on unemployment at the EU summit in
Essen at the end of this week, pushing for action to implement
recommendations made in the policy 'white paper' produced by the EU
Commission in December 1993. He cites infrastructure investment, active
measures to get jobless workers into work schemes and wide-ranging moves to
upgrade education.
'I think there will be a struggle about it,' says Mr Carlsson. 'But I am
glad to be a part of the struggle and not having to watch it from the
outside as a non-member. Now we can be on the inside and I look forward to
that.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Clandestine Marriage - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Hawthorne abounds in urbane charm. Whether on TV as Sir Humphrey in
Yes (Prime) Minister or as Alan Bennett's George III (The Madness of)
onstage, he is a constantly generous pillar of charm and civilised old-world
values. Now, in the 1766 comedy The Clandestine Marriage, he has returned to
the West End, not merely as actor, but also, for the first time, as
director; and urbanity and charm are in good supply.
It is not, on this occasion, a charm that runs deep. Indeed, his own
performance, as the rheumatic old ninny Lord Ogleby, coasts by on charm,
when other directors might have challenged him to give a more verbally
audacious performance. Made up to look like an invalid toad in britches,
pasty-faced with black-ringed eyes, he has given himself some splendid
physical comic business. When he thinks the pretty young heroine is
confessing her love for him, he adorably (a) looks startled (b) cannot
resist a smirk (c) starts to swagger (d) waves his stick round in the air.
Lovely stuff. But there are too many cute facial appeals to the audience.
The Clandestine Marriage is good Christmas fare, for its tale is Cinderella
with a twist. Fanny Sterling is the only source of real grace and beauty in
her family. Her elder sister and her aunt (Mrs Heidelberg) are ridiculous
termagants; her father is a self-made man who is ruled by financial
considerations; and all of them undervalue her. Fanny, however, as the title
tells you, is already married in secret - to penniless Lovewell. Alas, her
sister's fiance Sir John Melvill defects to her cause; and then Lord Ogleby
also becomes her suitor; and confusions escalate.
It takes time, but the play's comedy slowly rises - so much so that the
funniest line of all occurs right at the end. This is from Mrs Heidelberg:
who announces, when Fanny's marriage is discovered, 'She's ruined] - and I
forgive her.' Yet this line would not be funny were it not for Susan Engel,
who gives a marvellous performance with, above all, the imagination that are
so vital to period comedy of this kind. The role has numerous
mispronunciations and malapropisms, but Engel makes sure that the main joke
is not these but herself: a bizarre booming contralto from the Low Countries
in a towering Gainsborough wig. The way she uses her fan is exemplary -
never opened, but wielded, like a stiletto.
That such a performance can flower here is credit to Hawthorne; so is the
very acute playing in small roles. (From the moment William Oxborrow takes
snuff, as Trueman, he announces himself as a beautifully inventive comic
actor.) And yet Deborah Findlay, whose sheer attack is so welcome as the
elder Miss Sterling, is allowed to give a truly stupid performance, forever
shaking her red curls in the hope of a laugh, jumping between three or more
accents, and gesticulating busily from the elbows out. Simon Chandler, as a
posey Melvill, keeps his hands, often frozen in the air, around
shoulder-level. Elizabeth Chadwick and Jonathan Cullen, as the clandestine
lovers, stress the nervous tension of their roles at the expense of
convincing us of their tenderness.
But Christopher Benjamin does good work as nouveau riche Mr Stirling; and
Timothy O'Brien's sets and costumes are exemplary - elegant and persuasive
without ever drawing attention to themselves. Finally the play, and charm,

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Richard Eyre to leave the Royal National Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director of the Royal National Theatre, Richard Eyre, is to leave his
post. Eyre, who took on the job in 1988, is planning to go freelance. His
decision is not entirely unexpected: when his first five year term expired
in 1993 he signed up again for three years only. He is actually adding
another few months to his contract before departing in 1997.
After such a long period immersed in the task of running a large company
with a turnover approaching Pounds 30m a year, Eyre will be broadening his
horizons. Last month his first opera production, La traviata, opened at
Covent Garden.
Taking over at the National from Sir Peter Hall, Eyre quickly made his mark.
He was responsible for adding successful musicals, most notably his own
production of Guys and Dolls and Nicholas Hytner's production of Carousel to
the repertoire: both went on to commercial success in the West End. He has
also invited outside companies to take over the stage, including small but
innovative troupes like Complicite and Cheek by Jowl.
He has had a run of artistic and commercial successes, like Alan Bennett's
The Madness of George III and Wind in the Willows, the David Hare Trilogy,
and most recently An Inspector Calls. During most of his stewardship the
National Theatre has enjoyed box office success and critical acclaim.
In the last year Eyre's touch has faltered slightly with a string of
American plays, some of which (notably Johnny on a the Spot, which he
directed himself) were poorly received. But any small deficit in 1994-95
will be more than absorbed by the accumulated reserves, and with an
attractive programme for next year to be announced today, including
Euripides' The Trojan Women, his successor should inherit a sound craft.
Eyre is also making good in 1995 one of the gaps in his programming, a
paucity of plays by new playwrights, with first works from comedy writer
Patrick Marber and from Paul Godfrey.
Just who will take over will be a matter for speculation for some time. But
among the favourites must be Stephen Daldry, who has progressed through a
small theatre, the Gate, to run the medium-sized Royal Court. He might
welcome the ultimate challenge and has good links with the National - he
directed An Inspector Calls.
An even younger contender could be Sam Mendes who on Thursday sees the
opening of his first big musical, Oliver, the royalties from which would
enable him to survive on the director of the National's salary of Pounds
80,000 plus, a miserly sum compared with the rewards of regular freelance
work.
Another possible candidate, Nicholas Hytner, might find the job restricting
after enjoying the variety of directing operas and films as well as plays.
And there is always Sir Ian McKellen, already an associate director at the
National, as are outsiders Deborah Warner and Declan Donnellan.
Whoever takes on the job will find Eyre a hard act to follow. He has enjoyed
a popularity almost unique in his profession and has totally devoted himself
to the National. He has built and consolidated the theatre's reputation as
one of the most firmly established, highly respected and artistically
flourishing arts companies in the country.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Sketches by Boz - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year offers a bumper selection pack of Dickens in London. Over the next
fortnight Oliver] opens in the West End, A Christmas Carol at the RSC, A
Tale of Two Cities at Greenwich and The Oxford Stage Company brings its
adaptation of Great Expectations to Richmond. With Martin Chuzzlewit still
rolling along on BBC2 and Hard Times scheduled for Christmas Day, there is
no escape from his gallery of rogues.
The enterprising Battersea Arts Centre has come up with a little hors
d'oeuvre to whet your appetite for the meatier Dickens to follow in the
shape of Sketches by Boz, an evening of newspaper articles by the young
novelist. The evening is conceived as an old-fashioned 'entertainment'
mounted, cabaret-style, in the cafe, where candles on the tables and food
and drink on offer create a convivial atmosphere.
On stage a cast of five work their way through half a dozen sketches adapted
for stage by Robert Butler and spliced together in Fair Play Theatre
Company's production with sardonic little ditties of the time. A
Dickens-like master of ceremonies at a lectern links the scenes and
occasionally stoops, with marvellous disdain, to speak the words of some
unsavoury character or other. The only other props are a piano, a table and
a couple of chairs, and round these the company presents a parade of
grotesques and unfortunates.
You can certainly see the young Dickens sharpening his satirical pencil for
the characters that were to people his novels. There is the gauche, gaunt Mr
Watkins Tottle, whose faint heart is trampled on by an unscrupulous 'friend'
and an insensitive young woman; there is the Scrooge-like killjoy who
delights in ruining his godson's Christening party; there is an artful
dodger deported by a judge who never looks up from his paperwork, and a trip
to the pawnbrokers reveals a cauldron of miserable souls.
The show gradually spirals downhill until the last sketch brings us to the
cell of a condemned prisoner in Newgate, Dickens writing with all his might
to convey to his readers the terror and misery of a man in such
circumstances.
These are clearly the work of an angry young man, who writes with more heart
than head in places - 'The Black Veil' is particularly melodramatic. But
this evening of miniatures, performed by a spry, witty company, is an
illuminating introduction to the young writer who was to become such a
household name - and seasonal companion.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: A well-dressed 'Fairy Queen'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It hardly matters that we shall be inundated with performances of The Fairy
Queen over the next 12 months. The work is so tricky to put on stage that
anybody who wants to mount a production to mark Purcell's tercentenary year
is likely to come up with a solution different from any others.
The original entertainment was lavishly appointed. Purcell took
Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, added five extended musical
masques, threw in a variety of dances and made sure that the new scenario
included as many visual delights as possible, from a tableau of the passing
seasons to an exotic garden overrun by dancing monkeys.
It is difficult to imagine its like today; more difficult still to imagine
where the money would come from.
Most performances find themselves obliged to do without at least one
element: either the actors or the dancers are given the night off. Roger
Norrington's concert version last year saved itself the cost of the stage
spectacle, but did bring together the play and the music (the play
unexpectedly won hands down). Perhaps finding that to be a long evening, the
English Bach Festival took the opposite route for its fully-staged
production at the Royal Opera House on Sunday.
Not a line of Shakespeare was uttered, but the visual trappings were as rich
as the company's finances would allow. The costumes, some of them based on
the original designs by Inigo Jones, kept coming in a seemingly endless,
no-expense-spared parade. The work of the costumiers and headdress-makers
could keep other period productions supplied second-hand for years.
As an evening of music and drama, however, this Fairy Queen was less
successful. The masques are really five interludes in the play and having
five interludes without anything in between makes a lightweight offering.
After fighting to keep stage and pit together in the first half, Howard
Williams managed to instil a greater sense of confidence after the interval.
He had the advantage of an experienced first soprano in Jennifer Smith and
valuable contributions from the bass David Mattinson; but the rest of the
cast was mixed.
While there are better musical accounts of Purcell's music to be heard
elsewhere, no other has recently tried to match the dance to the music in
the proper period style, and that was where the main value of this
production lay. Under the guidance of the choreographer Stephen Preston, the
various dances for the warbling songsters, the green men, the haymakers and
the monkeys could all be seen as well as heard. The allegory of Night also
seemed especially effective in Jonathan Cocker's sympathetic staging.
Bit by bit the full range of The Fairy Queen is coming to light, as each
performance sheds its own ray of understanding on the work. The English Bach
Festival has shown what a carefully-researched period style can achieve.
Next up is English National Opera's projected production, which the safe
money can bet will be different again.

An unexpectedly good evening in. Omnibus looks at Robert Louis Stevenson,
the centenary of whose death falls this year, in Stevenson's Travels
(10.20pm, BBC 1) with PD James and fellow Caledonian literati Candia
McWilliam and Alasdair Gray. This extraordinary story-teller has been taken
for granted too long. What the deadpan social satire in Without Walls: Chez
New:House of Glass (9.30pm, Channel 4) reveals is less a Treasure Island for
our times than a Jekyll and Hyde parable of modernity and high technology,
as we suffer with Debra from Canonbury while she tries to get her ultra-new
house built.
This is preceded by Battersea Bardot (9pm), a catchpenny title for a tawdry
tragedy. The irony is that while Cathy Come Home sparked off a national
scandal about homelessness, the star, Carol White, went on to a disastrous
career that ended in drugs, penury and obscure death in America. It sounds
as trite as London Kills Me (10pm, Channel 4), Hanif Kureishi's unoriginal
expose of the underside of a not so swinging London.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: The Kirov's 'Kitezh' - Opera in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the end of the cold war other opera companies from the east have set
about marketing themselves in the west, but none has done so with the
determination of Gergiev and the Kirov Opera. True to form, Gergiev set out
to trump every previous success for the company's Paris visit to the Theatre
des Champs-Elysees, which lasts no less than two months and brings together
the Kirov Opera and Ballet for the first time ever outside Russia. The
programme includes four fully-staged operas, three full-length ballets and
sundry concerts - an awesome exercise.
Unfortunately, the Kirov Opera's opening night proved less than electric. To
mark the occasion, the company had commissioned a new production of
Rimsky-Korsakov's The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, a four-hour
grand opera blending mystic pantheism and romantic fairy-tale. It might be
asking too much of the piece to suggest that the production should reveal
any deeply serious dramatic themes, but all Andris Liepa made of it was a
static evening of stand-and-sing in the dustiest Russian tradition.
Ironically, a production like this would have been easier to accept if it
had been old (and thus traditional) than, as it was, being advertised as
brand new. The sets were a confectioner's delight, every one sickly sweet in
a style that looked to western eyes like 1950s kitsch.
It did not help that the Kirov's star of the moment, Galina Gorchakova, had
pulled out through illness. The role of Fevroniya, a virgin who wanders
through forests communing with nature, embodies all that the opera is about.
The Kirov was lucky to have a singer of the stature of Lyubov Kazarnovskaya
on hand, but she sounded unsure of herself and her constant ear-to-ear
smile, as she frolicked up and down, tried one's patience. One more swish of
her skirt and she looked likely to break into a chorus of 'The hills are
alive'.
Even that, though, would have been well sung. Kazarnovskaya has a warm,
lyric soprano, probably closer to what Rimsky-Korsakov had in mind for the
role than the dramatic Gorchakova. The Prince whom she marries after his
death in a kind of mystic Never-Never-Land (cue chorus dressed like wedding
decorations) Yury Marusin, white-toned but effective. Gennady Bezzubenkov,
as Prince Yury, led his people in prayer with a fine, authoritative Russian
bass. Nikolay Putilin brought intensity to his role as Poyarok, who is
blinded by the invading Tartars. The smaller roles were strongly cast.
The music of Kitezh is generally described as being influenced by Wagner,
from whom Rimsky-Korsakov learned much about quiet religious ecstasy, rather
less about how to sustain long paragraphs of musical thought. Gergiev could
not help the tension slackening, but he did get fine playing from the Kirov
orchestra. There was no faltering of tone quality or intonation in the most
exposed passages, even at the end of a long evening, as midnight approached.
The company's reputation for the finest musical standards remains
unblemished.
In Paris, however, the other three operas - Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko,
Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Musorgsky's Khovanshchina - promise to
rouse more enthusiasm.
Kirov Opera at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees until December 10; Kirov
Ballet December 20-31.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Artists respond to ancient Egypt / Review of the 'Time
Machine' exhibition at the British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Egyptian sculpture gallery of the British Museum has been called one of
the great rooms of the world. For the last few weeks 12 artists have had the
run of it, creating work for Time Machine, a collaboration between the
British Museum and the Institute of International Visual Arts. Until the end
of February visitors will discover not only the thrillingly old civilisation
and its relics, but also the links between the ancient and modern worlds
explored by the new works.
For Henry Moore, the Egyptian Gallery was a source of profound inspiration.
Contemplating these magnificent fragments, he realised that it was not size
alone which made sculpture monumental. 'What I found in the Egyptian pieces
was a monumentality of vision.' The craftsmen who gave this vision form
laboured together in a great work of glorification, of their kings and of
their gods. Many devoted their lives to this task; they lived in villages
near the sites of the royal tombs, passed on their positions to their sons,
and were themselves buried in decorated vaults.
At the end of the 20th century, no such supreme vision requires the
subjection of individual craft or skill to a total world view. Instead, we
live in a world of constant questioning, where the boundaries of society
shimmer and shift. The responses of the artists to the challenge set them by
James Putnam, curator in the Egyptian department, who had the idea for the
show, could not have been more varied.
Stephen Cox, for example, has long been devoted to finding and carving the
rare, hard stones favoured by the Pharoahs, and 'Flask' made in 1991, sits
in elegant harmony beneath a statue of King Amenophis 111 of 1400BC. Kate
Whiteford, too, has produced paintings brimming with confidence, finding an
echo of her habitual resonating red and green pigments still visible on the
false door of Ptahshepes, transition point between life and death.
Igor Mitoraj works in a monumental style, his sculptural technique and
images dependent on ancient and classical predecessors but presented with a
questioning, surrealist twist. Marc Quinn has reprised the perspex cast of
his head, which became infamous when filled with his blood, to make a
refrigerated receptacle for a hibernating frog. An Egyptian symbol of birth,
it seems to be snoozing peacefully despite the bright lights and fascinated
onlookers.
Rita Keegan has brought her own family history to set beside that of the
ancient gods, choosing a deity of fertility to guard the video screen on
which images of her mother and father are mixed with those of the Old
Kingdom pair statue of Kaitep and Hetepheres of 2300 BC. David Hiscock takes
us into the world of the supermarket by transforming the Rosetta Stone into
a bar code, and introduces a touch of modern day idol worship by
photographing 'the hands of sculptor Kiki Smith wearing ancient rings.'
These late 1990s symbols of consumerism and fame seem oddly touching among
so much ancient magnificence. Only Alexander Mihaylovich seems to have lost
his head completely in the face of such tough competition. His huge
painting/construction 'Reconstruction' towers above everything else in a
piece of kitsch Las Vegas style scene-stealing which only confirms Moore's
wise words about size.
Present as a photograph only is the installation made from 30 tons of golden
sand which Andy Goldsworthy created specially for the exhibition over one
weekend, but which could not be allowed to remain in a gallery tramped
through by seven million visitors a year. Goldsworthy frequently creates
ephemeral pieces outdoors, which are photographed and left for nature to
reclaim. This time, for those of us lucky enough to see it before its
removal, the snaking golden form brought a symbol of the energy of creation
into the heart of the gallery, drawing the great relics together in its
coils. Its unique setting gave the sand an added dimension. For a few brief
hours, the graven images of the ancient rulers of Egypt, isolated in their
London magnificence, once more lorded over the desert from whence they came.
Time Machine, Ancient Egypt and Contemporary Art, British Museum until
February 26 1995.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Sound of silence / A look at how technicians are
making turboprop aircraft quieter by creating noise of their own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF NAIRN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers on commuter airlines should soon be able to work or snooze more
easily after installation of cabin noise reduction systems in turboprop
aircraft.
The technology applies the theory of active noise cancellation (ANC) to
reduce the high levels of cabin noise in propeller-driven aircraft. A vast
range of potential applications - from quelling vehicle vibration and taming
refrigerator rattle, to muffling machinery - has attracted high-tech
start-ups and mainstream manufacturers alike.
The ANC theory was developed 60 years ago, but immature technology and
prohibitive costs killed early development projects. Now it is finally
moving out of the lab and on to its commercial feet.
The systems use electronics to detect an unwanted sound and then generate a
second sound wave of equal frequency but different phase (where the sound
wave's troughs coincide with the peaks instead of each other). The two waves
combined tend to cancel each other out, leaving a much reduced sound.
While the theory is simple, implementation is not, particularly in real
applications where noise is a cocktail of different, changing frequencies.
The cabin quieting system developed by Ultra Electronics of the UK took four
years of testing before its introduction this year on Saab commuter
aircraft.
The dominant noise in a turboprop aircraft comes from the spinning
propellers vibrating the fuselage, and varies with engine speed. The ANC
system, by monitoring the engine speed, knows in advance the main frequency
 -the one responsible for the most noise - to cancel.
Inside the cabin of the 50-seater Saab 2000, 72 microphones measure the
noise at different locations and feed a control unit. Here, powerful digital
signal processor (DSP) microchips and patented algorithms generate
mirror-image signals which are fed to 36 loudspeakers concealed in the cabin
trim. According to Ultra Electronics, the result is a 12 decibel, or 75 per
cent, reduction in noise at the main frequency at high speed.
Conversation is not affected by the noise reduction because the system
reduces sound only at low frequencies, such as that generated by the engine.
High frequencies are better suppressed using cheaper passive techniques such
as sound-absorbent materials, which function poorly at low frequencies.
Saab Aircraft, Saab's aircraft-making division, is the first to fit the
cabin quieting system as standard. De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft
maker, and Avions de Transport Regional, the Franco-Italian consortium, plan
to follow. The system costs Dollars 70,000-Dollars 100,000 (Pounds
44,000-Pounds 63,800) to install, according to craft size.
Like many regional airlines, Crossair, the Swiss regional carrier, liked the
lower operating costs of turboprops over jets, but not their noisy
reputation. Without ANC, turboprops can generate an intrusive 85dB of noise
against 78dB for a jet. (US federal law sets a workplace noise limit of 90dB
for an eight-hour working day).
Cabin quieting is one of the applications of ANC made feasible by the
tumbling cost of DSP microchips. 'The first DSP chips in the 1980s cost
Dollars 1,500 but replaced a Dollars 700,000 minicomputer. Today, those
chips cost Dollars 2-Dollars 3,' says Steve Dickmann, president of
Digisonix, a US pioneer of ANC. The company says it sees its best markets
for ANC application in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
Conventional passive silencers cut the noise spectrum or 'white noise' of
fans in ducts. But they cut high frequency noise more than low frequencies,
leaving a rumble.
Digisonix sells a duct silencer that uses ANC to cut more evenly across the
frequency spectrum. Each active silencer costs from Dollars 300 to Dollars
3,000 depending on the size of the system. It can also reduce energy costs
over conventional passive silencers. These reduce noise by slowing the air
flow in ventilator shafts with 'baffles' or obstacles. More powerful fans
are needed to propel the air through shafts when baffles are used to cut
noise. Active noise reduction eliminates the need for baffles.
In one 500,000sq ft building in Florida, Digisonix silencers yield energy
savings of Dollars 50,000 a year, according to Dickmann.
Domestic appliances and vehicles, which once seemed the most promising areas
for ANC, have proved two of the toughest markets.
Whirlpool, the US white goods manufacturer, developed a simple system to
reduce the worst vibration in a dishwasher. But the company stopped
development because it believed the cost was prohibitively high in a
price-sensitive sector. 'The home appliances business is very cost-driven,'
says Luigi Coglio, head of sound research at the company's development
centre in Italy.
Electrolux, the Swedish group, tested ANC on all its products. Its market
research indicated that customers were willing to pay extra for a quieter
cooker hood fan, but not necessarily for a quieter dishwasher. But even for
cooker hoods, the market appears limited because of the extra cost - about
Dollars 100 on the retail price. Nonetheless, the company believes there is
a market at the top of the range, and it will use ANC technology in a new
hood to go on the market soon.
Three years ago, Nissan unveiled the first production car with ANC. The
Bluebird model was sold only in Japan, however, and other car makers that
tested ANC felt that the technology was immature or too expensive.
'They believe that noise should be controlled by more conventional means
(such as padding or better design),' says Dave Quinn, chief engineer with
Lotus Engineering, the research arm of Lotus Cars.
'Tomorrow's models will not be so easy to quieten,' says Quinn. Their
lightweight materials and lighter engines cut fuel consumption but are less
effective at deadening engine noise. Adding 10kg of padding conflicts with
the aim of reducing weight, so carmakers are dusting off ANC plans.
Elesa, a joint venture between Fiat-owned components group Magneti Marelli
and Noise Cancellation Technologies of the US, claims a bright future for
its car cabin silencing product. This works like the aircraft system and
shares the car's hi-fi speakers, trimming the production cost to about
Dollars 75. The product has been tested on 20 models and clocked up 20,000
km. It cuts cabin noise by around 50 per cent at cruising speeds, the
company says.
Vittorio Moreggia, general manager, says the system will be adopted by a
European car maker in 1996. Elesa has also developed an engine mount to cut
cab vibrations and an exhaust silencer. The latter is furthest from
production, but tightening legislation on vehicle pass-by noise is kindling
interest, particularly from truck makers.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Science offers an improved service - The
direction of UK government research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the industrialists, officials and academics engaged in crystal ball
gazing for the UK's Technology Foresight Programme begin to draw up their
conclusions, some themes are emerging.
One likely outcome of the programme, a wide-ranging examination of future
technological trends designed to guide research, is that more research will
be devoted to the needs of the service sector.
Some officials think that as much as 10 per cent of the government's Pounds
3.3bn civil research budget could be redirected over the long term towards
projects relevant to service industries.
This is partly because the exercise has opened up new lines of communication
between the government and the service sector. Robert Hughes, the junior
science minister, describes the Foresight programme as 'breaking new ground
by covering financial services, retailing and leisure . . . which use huge
amounts of technology but which have not before been closely involved in
science and technology policy.'
Another reason why more attention is being focused on the service sector is
the rapid pace of technological change.
In financial services, for example, the stockbrokers working on the floor of
the London Stock Exchange before 1986 had little use for new technology.
Their modern counterparts, however, are avid consumers of information
technology and recruiters of physicists and mathematicians.
Recent advances in communications and electronics are likely to make a
significant impact on service companies. The way that services are delivered
could be transformed by developments such as the information superhighway
and the increasing use of personal computers in the home.
Although some of the technologies expected to influence the coming decades
are already in use, others sound like science fiction. Topics discussed
include miniature robots to unclog diseased arteries, automatic translation
of telephone conversations in different languages, and business meetings
conducted in virtual reality.
But even the most ambitious ideas may be more realistic than
non-technologists would imagine. Michael Hughes, a director of BZW, the
broker, who is chairman of the financial services Foresight panel, said the
results of the exercise pointed to faster change than expected. 'A lot of
what we felt would be there within 10 to 15 years will be there in five.'
The Foresight panel, with representatives from banks, actuaries,
universities, the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Department of Trade
and Industry, identified 68 issues, including the impact of multimedia on
retail banking and using data encryption for greater security in
transferring money.
Its early findings predicted technological change concentrated in the retail
side of the financial services industry, which would be affected by
developments such as multimedia and the information superhighway, rather
than the wholesale sector which has already seen rapid changes.
The work of the Foresight panel goes beyond examining the technological
feasibility of potential developments to considering the potential social,
skill-based and regulatory constraints.
When the conclusions of the Technology Foresight Programme are published in
a few months, its findings will affect the research priorities of government
departments, research councils and higher education funding councils. Most
areas of government research will be affected over the next few years.
Other predicted outcomes of the programme are less obvious and do not depend
directly on government action. The programme is expected to give companies a
greater understanding of research conducted by the government, academics and
other companies.
Increased awareness of work in other sectors has been particular-ly
valuable, says Hughes: 'One of the greatest values of this exercise is the
networking among people from different industry groups.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Pursuit of 'best' debtors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; Trade, the consumer debt recovery company, has introduced a
computer-based credit scoring system designed to cut legal and
administrative costs by enabling companies to pursue cases most likely to
yield repayment.
Its Epic 2 system provides users with a detailed score for individual
debtors and an assessment of the likely success of litigation.
Epic 2 uses account information on debtors, such as their repayment records,
supplied by users, such as banks, building societies and public utilities.
It combines this with information on county court judgments and consumer
credit data supplied by Equifax Europe, the credit ratings agency.
Legal &amp; Trade says there are currently 3m debtors on the database, of which
250,000 have been assessed as worth pursuing for debt repayment.
Typical results from the banking and utility sector, according to Legal &amp;
Trade, suggest that if a business normally achieves a 30 per cent success
rate by suing 1,000 debtors a week, Epic will increase this to 60 per cent.
This means a business can sue about 500 debtors and still win about 280 of
the cases. The amount of money recovered may not change, but savings are
made by cutting the cost of pursuing hopeless or marginal cases.
Epic 2 replaces a forecasting system introduced in 1990. Legal &amp; Trade says
credit scoring technology has improved since then, and that it has widened
and updated database material.
The Epic 2 service is provided by Equifax from its mainframe computer.
Access is via a PC, on tape or disk, on-line with a modem, or manually.
Before computerisation, credit assessors made manual checks by sending
representatives to individual homes. This was more costly and it meant the
assessment depended in part on a representative's subjective view, according
to Legal &amp; Trade.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Court has power in swap rate case -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has been asked to rule whether it has
jurisdiction to hear a case concerning the Brussels Convention on
Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments referred to it by the English
Appeal Court.
The case concerned interest rate swap contracts between Glasgow District
Council and Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. In performance of the
contracts, Kleinwort Benson paid Glasgow District Council sums totalling
more than Pounds 800,000. After these payments, the House of Lords ruled
that local authorities such as Glasgow District Council did not have the
power to enter into such contracts.
In the light of the Law Lords judgment, Kleinwort Benson brought a High
Court action against Glasgow District Council for restitution of the sums
paid out under the swaps contracts.
The parties agreed the contracts were governed by English law, that England
was the place of performance and that it was the place where the harmful
event occurred. However, they were in dispute about which UK courts had
jurisdiction to hear the dispute.
Kleinwort Benson argued the English Courts should have jurisdiction. Glasgow
District Council claimed the Scottish Courts should hear the case.
The English High Court decided it did not have jurisidiction. Kleinwort
appealed and the Appeal Court referred the issue to the Luxembourg court.
The claims of both sides were based not on the Brussels Convention but on
the provisions of a schedule to the 1982 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments
Act, which incorporates the Convention into UK law. One of the act's
provisions allows for questions relating to any Convention issue to be
referred to the ECJ.
Such a reference is not made under the Rome Treaty but under a 1971 Protocol
to the Brussels Convention. Because of this technicality, the issue of the
ECJ's jurisdiction to hear the case arose.
Both Glasgow District Council and Kleinwort together with the German and
Spanish governments argued the Court did have jurisdiction to give a ruling
on the questions referred to it.
Their arguments were based on the fact that the reference related to the
Convention; that even if it concerned the application of the internal
legislation of a member state, the national law in question referred to
provisions of Community law for which the ECJ had jurisdiction; that it was
necessary if there was to be a uniform application of Community law; and,
that the mere fact that the case concerned the assignment of jurisdiction
between courts in a single member state should not deprive the ECJ of its
jurisdiction.
However, the French and UK governments, together with the European
Commission argued the Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the
reference. Their arguments included: the fact that the dispute did not
concern an international jurisdictional issue, but rather a conflict of
jurisdiction in one member state; that the reference was governed
exclusively by national law; and, that even if the Court did give a
preliminary ruling, the national court would not be bound by that ruling as
it would only be an advisory opinion and in such an event, it would be
ruling on questions of national law contrary to its own case law.
It was argued the Court's case law on the interpretation of Community law
applied by national legislation should be strictly construed and only apply
where the national law directly transposed the relevant Community law. That
was not the position in this case.
On the separate issue of which UK court should hear the dispute, Kleinwort
claimed that jurisdiction should be given to the English courts either
because England was the place of performance of the contracts or because it
was where the harmful event occurred. Glasgow District Council argued the
normal rule should apply, whereby people are sued in the part of the country
in which they are domiciled.
The advocate general's opinion is expected next year followed by a full
judgment of the ECJ.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Stampede for India overdue - Global
firms must now expand on to the subcontinent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL PAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last two years, the emerging Indian market has played second
fiddle to China in the strategic thinking of most international law firms.
In spite of its size (a population of 900m), the three-year-old economic
liberalisation programme instituted by Narashima Rao, the Indian prime
minister, has yet to convince western investors of India's secure long-term
potential.
British law firms must now turn their attention to India's immediate future.
Otherwise they will lose the advantage they enjoy over their American rivals
through traditional Anglo-Indian cultural links.
Only three western law firms, White &amp; Case, Chadbourne &amp; Parke, and the UK's
Ashurst Morris Crisp, have opened offices in India - in contrast to the
stampede to open offices in Hong Kong and China.
Others are bound to follow, but it is not yet clear when. Much legal
business in India just now is generated by energy projects and by the
continuing popularity of global depository receipts (GDRs) among western
investors. GDRs, issued by depository banks, are a convenient method of
purchasing shares in Indian companies and now account for the majority of
emerging market paper listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange. Investment
funds have also proved popular with investors during the last year. About 22
have now been set up.
While this work can easily be handled from London or Hong Kong, mounting
foreign direct investment in India, accelerating capital markets activity
and infrastructure projects are all forcing lawyers to spend longer periods
in the country. Foreign direct investment is expected to rise to Dollars 2bn
next year and portfolio investment has now reached Dollars 4.1bn. Although
below Chinese levels, these figures indicate steady positive growth.
If India follows the Asian pattern, US law firms will only start to arrive
in force when their chief institutional clients do the same. Most British
law firms, however, have no such tradition to follow. There is therefore
time for them to take advantage of historical Anglo-Indian links and of the
fact that India's legal system is modelled along English lines.
Yet Ashurst Morris Crisp, in Delhi, is the only British firm with an Indian
office. Mr Philip Hurst, an Ashurst partner, says the firm opened an office
there because of demand from UK clients active in the infrastructure field.
'Although as a firm we don't have many foreign offices, client pressure last
year brought us to the conclusion there were huge opportunities for us in
India,' he said.
New Delhi as the centre of government is the best place for those firms
looking to specialise in infrastructure project work. Chadbourne &amp; Parke, a
firm which specialises in project finance, was the first foreign firm into
India. Mr Greg Ullman, a Chadbourne partner, confirms Ashurst's thinking.
'When we pitch for work on infrastructure projects it definitely helps us to
have an office here. But you need a niche area of practice in India. There
is no point opening an office just hoping to build up a practice,' he said.
Capital markets lawyers are forced to consider India's financial centre,
Bombay, where commercial property rates are almost as high as Hong Kong.
The process of opening an office can also be daunting. Administrative
decisions are often a long time coming in India. And there is vocal
resentment from some quarters of the Indian legal profession, looking to
protect itself from 'the foreign onslaught' as it was described recently in
the Indian Financial Express.
Ironically, practising Indian law is not on the agenda for most foreign law
firms, which are much happier referring domestic work to local law firms
(which with their lower fee rates are often the preferred advisers on many
joint ventures).
Ashurst is not the only British firm active in the Indian market, however.
Freshfields and Linklaters &amp; Paines stand out as lead advisers on the
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) Dabhol Power project, advising respectively MSEB,
the state electricity board, and Enron, the US project company. The US firm
White &amp; Case acted as advisers to the lenders.
Freshfields hopes in the future to capitalise on its projects experience
elsewhere in Asia, especially when the transport development programme goes
on stream. Freshfields advised on the Malaysian North-South Highway project.
Linklaters is also prominent in Indian capital markets work. Mr Nikhil
Mehta, head of Linklaters' India business group, says: 'India really took
off for us in 1992 when we acted for Reliance Industries on its global
depository receipts issue.' Since then the firm has advised on 31 public
issues.
But the real challenge for firms looking to move into the Indian legal
services market will be to develop their practices beyond their initial area
of specialisation, he says.
Capital markets work can be managed from outside India. But it is also
frequently the area where competition between US and UK firms is strongest
and the Americans will not be slow to set up in the market once investment
banks provide the impetus.
To pre-empt this, many lawyers believe British firms need to open in India
now and develop broad-based practices in the infrastructure, foreign direct
investment and capital markets fields. British foreign direct investment in
India has only recently begun to pick up speed, but the recent British trade
delegation underlined future intentions, with a strong presence from UK road
construction companies. The delegation also received assurances that efforts
would be made under the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, to facilitate
British lawyers setting up in Indian cities.
Simmons &amp; Simmons, Denton Hall and Masons are three City solicitors firms
with well-developed Indian practices all facing the dilemma of exactly when
to make the commitment.
Denton Hall is active in the power sector and as Mr Henry King, its
chairman, admits: 'if we opened, we would be looking to make the leap from
that sector to capital markets.' But, he acknowledges, it is all a matter of
timing. 'Rather like driving in India, you need excellent judgment and
plenty of luck.'
There is no doubt US lawyers intend to play an active role in India's
development and White &amp; Case's Bombay office is a good indication of what
may follow. It handles foreign direct investment, capital markets work and
project work and expects to see rapid growth in Indian companies looking to
raise finance from US offerings as Indian business restructures.
That optimism looks well-founded given Wall Street's continuing infatuation
with India. US analysts are confident that the Indian economic
liberalisation programme has sufficient momentum and 144A offerings (private
placements in the US) of Indian deals will become prominent.
It is no surprise that White &amp; Case should be among the first into India -
the firm has a record of moving quickly into new markets - but others will
follow soon enough. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom is already active in
Indian markets as is Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, which acted for the India
Fund Inc in February. Mr John Lobrano, a Simpson partner says: 'We have
strong relationships with all the major US banks and if they opened out
there it could possibly prompt us to reconsider.'
British law firms which fail to exploit their current advantage over US
competitors could be making a serious strategic error which they will live
to regret.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington-style lobbying by law firms is coming to Westminster. City
solicitor Lovell White Durrant is the first of many considering setting up a
business lobbying department.
Lovell sees the move as a natural extension of its lobbying activities in
Brussels, where its lawyers have been involved for 20 years in putting
clients' views to decision-makers on Europe. Lovell has hired David Tench,
former head of legal affairs at Consumers' Association, to guide its lawyers
through the Whitehall maze.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Survey shows UK firms lead on
financial advice - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK law firms dominate the global market for financial legal advice,
according to Global Research, the independent market research division of
Euromoney Publications.
Global Research interviewed 221 heads of legal departments at financial
institutions across Europe, North America and the Asia/Pacific region. More
than 300 law firms received recommendations, but Clifford Chance, the UK's
largest international law firm, emerged as clear leader, with 72 mentions.
Second was Allen &amp; Overy with 47; third, Linklaters &amp; Paines with 35; and
fourth, Baker &amp; McKenzie, the only firm with US origins in the top five,
with 23 mentions. Slaughter and May was fifth with a score of 19.
The research showed that most financial institutions will reduce the number
of law firms they use over the next few years, increasing competition among
lawyers for a bigger share of a growing volume of work. The amount of legal
advice that institutions will need is also expected to rise by 20 per cent
between 1994 and 1996 with a corresponding 10 per cent reduction in work
done in-house.

FT  06 DEC 94 / People: Hutchings and the price of promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greg Hutchings, who earned Pounds 1.2m last year as chief executive of
industrial and foods conglomerate, Tomkins, could earn less this year in his
new role as executive chairman. The promotion is part of a reshuffle
announced yesterday.
Hutchings enjoys a complex remuneration package which includes incentive
payments based on earnings, dividend and share price performance, but given
the company's share price performance over the past year, it was probable
Hutchings' earnings would be less than last year's. Since January, Tomkins'
shares have fallen from a high of 282p to last night's 216p.
Leaks to the weekend press forced the early announcement yesterday of the
reshuffle, which was originally planned for January. Michael Moore, Tomkins'
part-time non-executive chairman for 11 years and a director since 1981, is
retiring at the age of 58. The company said yesterday the reshuffle had been
planned for several months and denied there had been any acrimony over
Moore's departure.
Other directors are to be promoted; Ian Duncan, becomes deputy chairman and
retains his post as managing director (finance). Bob Muddimer, chairman of
the foods division Ranks Hovis McDougall, becomes joint managing director,
operations, with Tony Reading, head of the company's US division.
Jim Butler and Lionel Stammers have resigned as non-executive directors to
focus on their other board commitments. They will be replaced by Roger
Holland, chairman of Cray Electronics, and Mr Ali Wambold, a managing
director of Lazard Brothers in London.

FT  06 DEC 94 / People: Amzallag - pulling BNP together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Amzallag, 50, has been given the job of making BNP's presence felt in
the UK. He has been appointed managing director of BNP UK Holdings which
oversees the UK operations of the recently privatised French bank.
BNP, one of the oldest-established French banks in the City, has assets of
over Pounds 9bn in the UK and employs more than 800 staff. However, its
various operations - ranging from its traditional bank branch, to BNP
Capital Markets and BNP Mortgages - have tended to work independently of
each other.
The latest reshuffle is part of an effort to achieve greater synergy and
co-operation between the group's financial and commercial banking activities
in the UK. BNP says it wants to build on its traditional strengths in
foreign exchange, lending and bonds.
Following the French parent's decision to reorganise its worldwide
management structure along product lines, responsibility for BNP's worldwide
bond business has been delegated to London. Philippe Truffert, managing
director of BNP Capital Markets, will head the operation. BNP says that it
also intends to develop a significant presence in London in structured
finance, international private banking and emerging markets.
BNP is unusual among foreign banks in the City in having its own board of
local UK directors chaired by Lord Hunt, 75, a former civil servant. Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of Kingfisher, has been appointed a non-executive
director of BNP UK Holdings.

The prize for being first to the draw on the new Venture Capital Investment
Trusts, details of which were published last week in the UK Budget, must go
to Rothschild Asset Management.
Hardly had the Chancellor of the Exchequer sat down after announcing
significant tax breaks for investors prepared to back unquoted companies
than Rothschild was committing to launch a trust.
This trust will invest in the food sector. It will focus on companies with
potential for rapid growth that are involved in product or market innovation
or technology development, investing up to Pounds 1m in any one business as
the new rules allow.
Such has been the early enthusiasm among venture capitalists that other
trusts will not be far behind.
The question whether investing in these risky investment trusts is wise will
be addressed elsewhere in this paper. After the finance bill, this page will
review the kinds of growing businesses the trusts might back.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Standing up to Japan's
giants - How small companies are holding their own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How does a small, family-run parts supplier protect itself from the whims of
large, powerful customers on which it depends heavily for business?
The question has haunted Akira Jimbo, president of Jimbo Seisa-kusho, as he
has steered his small components manufacturing company through boom and bust
over three decades.
Jimbo Seisakusho, which specialises in the manufacture of small parts such
as nuts and bolts for electric tools, line printers and medical equipment,
is located in an industrial region west of Tokyo.
The company employs about 25 people and delivers 80 per cent of its output
to a Japanese maker of heavy electrical machinery.
At a time when many small Japanese suppliers have seen business dry to a
trickle in the country's sluggish economic environment, Jimbo has been so
busy it has had to turn orders down. Growth in revenues has been in double
digits this year, rising 30 per cent in August alone.
The struggle to find a way to enable his company to stand on its own stems
from the bitter experiences Jimbo has had with large customers over the
years. The company has faced collapse twice in the past.
'We used to manufacture products in volume but during times of difficulty,
our customers would tend to take these products in-house or competitors
would undercut us,' Akira Jimbo explains.
In today's high-yen environment many small Japanese suppliers are again
losing business to their customers or lower-cost countries in Asia.
'Anything that can be made in China or other cheap countries is being taken
away,' he laments.
Jimbo also found that large customers often copied manufacturing techniques
the company had developed through trial and error. This is a particular
problem in Japan where relationships between suppliers and their customers
are extremely close, making it difficult for small suppliers to stand up to
large customers.
'In the past we used to rack our brains about how to make some products
faster and better than others. But customers would send people over to look
at what machines we used and how we had them developed and order exactly the
same machines from the same companies which supplied us,' Akira Jimbo
recalls.
His solution has been to reduce dependence on mass production and
concentrate on making things that other people cannot make. The company has
discarded all its mass-production machines which were copied by its
customers.
Instead, it has developed expertise in producing very small nuts and bolts
which others, including clients, find impossible to imitate. For example, it
developed a method to make a nut for the Monju fast-breeder reactor that is
just 2.4mm wide and 1.5mm thick and which has a screw inside that is cut at
an angle.
'There aren't very many companies which can do this kind of work because it
requires extreme precision,' Akira Jimbo says.
The company's ability to produce such small parts stems from the use of
digital computer techniques to program machinery and processes. Akira
Jimbo's son, who trained as an engineer, is the programming brain behind the
controls used.
The expertise it has developed has meant customers seek the company out. It
does not ask for work.
'When you go asking for work you have to offer a 10 per cent cut in prices.
But if they come asking you, you can put 10 per cent on top of the going
price,' Akira Jimbo says.
With that advantage, the company has been able to follow a golden rule never
to take on work that could be shifted overseas, and it no longer suffers
from being copied by its clients either.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Cult of the big company -
Peter Brooke, pioneer of venture capital for high-tech companies in Europe,
talks to Richard Gourlay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Brooke thinks his time at Harvard Business School was the worst two
years of his life. The presumption that there was an answer to every problem
in business irritated him.
But the American entrepreneur, who was to found Advent International and
become a pioneer of venture capital investment in high-tech companies in
Europe, did take a course taught by Georges Doriot on management. Doriot
founded American Research and Development, which became one of the first
successful US venture capital organisations in the 1950s.
But Doriot was much less successful when he returned to his native France to
try to repeat the US success in Europe. That failure then provided Brooke
with an invaluable lesson when he followed his former tutor across the
Atlantic to built Advent International.
Instead of trying to find and evaluate deals from a central office, as
Doriot tended to do, Brooke made sure he had partners in each country who
could unearth potentially interesting businesses and understand local ways.
Twenty years on, Brooke says Europe remains a difficult environment for
venture capitalists. Hindered by the lack of a true single market and a
constrained entrepreneurial culture, Europe is still very different from the
US as a market for private equity investment. But it is not impossible.
Over the past 18 months, Advent International has raised Dollars 315m for a
global equity fund, forty per cent of which is to be invested in Europe and
some of which will be invested alongside the Dollars 1bn its affiliates
already have available for investment on the Continent.
'The main opportunity in Europe is in those countries that are restructuring
to handle the competitive future,' Brooke says. The break-up of large
corporations and return to core businesses means companies and management
teams are on the move. And the transfer of family-owned companies from
founder to a next generation provides another opportunity.
But Brooke is gloomy about Europe's chances of producing a large number of
high-tech opportunities for venture capital backing. Advent International's
own 1980 technology fund is making money, 14 years later, but the returns
are not exciting, he says.
The issue is not that entrepreneurial flair and technical skills do not
exist. It is just that in Europe these abilities have tended to stay hidden
inside large companies.
'There is a certain reluctance among good technologists and managers to
leave the womb of a Siemens or Alfa Lavell to go into a small company,'
Brooke says. 'It is not necessarily a lack of entrepreneurial spirit, it is
a matter of custom and culture. Success is measured by how well you have
done within Siemens. Leaving is almost regarded as being anti-social.'
Brooke believes this cult of the large company in Europe still prevents
talented individuals from going it alone. 'Take the structure of the German
industrial management,' he says. 'You have engineers, production managers,
marketing and finance people. But if an engineer does a spin-off he has
absolutely no idea of marketing.'
Brooke's view of Europe as a venture capital opportunity is at odds with
moves by some large private equity investors, such as CVC Capital Partners,
Barings and Hambros, which have been expanding steadily into continental
Europe.
But without naming names, he is not sure some of the larger fund managers
are particularly venturesome. He is scathing about private equity investors
who do not build companies, engineer 'simple leveraged buy-out' deals and
'sit around having lunch trading deals'.
True venture capital, he says, involves the identification of an area of
technology and detailed research into its application followed by active
selling of the idea that venture capital can help build businesses.
'A lot of people have lost sight of this with all the leveraged buy-outs,'
he says. Advent International, he claims, never engages in this practice,
even when - as now - the most promising area for venture capital investment
arises out of restructuring businesses. 'If we do use debt in a deal we
would never use anything but free cash flow (after research and development
expenditure) to pay down the debt.'
One way Advent International has attempted to add value is by providing
support from its Boston headquarters to the businesses it backs. It will,
for example, help with strategic issues such as entering new markets or how
to approach the Federal Drug Administration to get approval for a new
product. Brooke believes this service sets Advent Interantional apart from
other venture capitalists. But he also knows competition is likely to hot
up.
Established investors of private equity in the UK and Europe have recently
raised large new funds and are just as aware that they need to add value if
they are to outsmart the competition. 'If there is an oversupply of capital
we have to continue to prospect and not do things so that pricing gets out
of control,' Brooke says.
Brooke is enthusiastic about plans now being worked out to form a European
equivalent to Nasdaq, to provide dynamic companies with earlier access to
capital. But, he says, some companies should be nurtured in private longer.
Too many float to provide exits for investors and not to raise new money.
After more than 40 years in venture capital, Brooke attracts disciples, just
as Doriot did. His goal is still to build Advent International into the
world's best private equity investor. But at 65 he wants to get out of the
business. His trouble is that right now - as when he was at Harvard - he
doesn't have the answer for how to do it.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Change to league tables planned: Shephard says added value
in school statistics must be intelligible to parents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government league tables of school performance should be changed to take
account of pupils' achievements when they started at the school, government
curriculum advisers said yesterday.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, accepted their report but
said any measures must be 'straightforward to calculate and intelligible to
parents'.
The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing,
proposed three separate measures to show how much children improve while
they are at schools in England and Wales.
The first is a model which would plot a school's academic 'output' (as
measured by its GCSE results), against its 'inputs' (pupils' performance in
tests taken at the age of 11).
A second more complicated option would estimate the proportion of pupils in
a school achieving results better than expected. Their performance would be
computed from the average GCSE results eventually achieved by children of
different levels of ability at 11.
A third possibility would be to divide schools into three groups - those
with performance in line with expectations, those performing better and
those performing worse.
The authority has recommended against using measures which take social and
economic factors into account, in spite of repeated survey evidence that
schools with the weakest GCSE results serve socially deprived catchment
areas.
Dr Nicholas Tate, the authority's chief executive, said social factors would
have affected the 'baseline' achievements of children when they started at a
school, so the models proposed would all take social problems into account.
He added that there was 'a balance to be struck between accuracy and
manageability'.
All the proposals would require much extra information to be published about
schools, including the number of pupils who changed schools between the
beginning and the end of the age range, and the estimated error in the
school's predicted performance.
The group also wants to investigate publishing three-year rolling averages
of schools' performance, and an 'improvement index' which would show a
school's improvement over previous years in percentage terms.
The authority says that 'raw' data, which does not take into account pupils'
abilities, should still be published.
Teachers' unions remained hostile. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the
National Union of Teachers, said: 'If the proposal is simply a way of trying
to give respectability to discredited league tables then it is a waste of
time. For the study to have any value it must be de-coupled from the
government's obsession with league tables.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Directors worried about losing staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More directors are concerned about losing staff than about the skills
shortage, according to a survey of job trends published today.
In a poll of more than 400 companies across the UK, one in four senior
directors said retaining employees was the most important issue in human
resources.
A similar poll in April revealed that more directors were concerned about
the lack of skills among employees. The skills gap now ranks second in the
list of personnel priorities, with 20 per cent of directors citing it as
their most pressing problem.
Mr Alec Reed, chairman of Reed Personnel Services, which carried out the
telephone poll at the end of last month, said: 'While companies are
confident that salary rises will be held at an average of 3.2 per cent, they
are already feeling the effects of a tighter labour market, with its
attendant pressures.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Glaxo helps fund vaccine centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's first all-round vaccine research centre, the Jenner Institute, is
to be set up with joint funding from government agencies and Glaxo, the
largest UK drug company.
Glaxo will pay Pounds 10m to build and equip the centre alongside the
Institute for Animal Health at Compton, Berkshire. The company and the
government will each contribute half its estimated Pounds 60m running costs
for 10 years.
In return, Glaxo will have the first option to license and develop any
potential products from the research, paying royalties to the Jenner
Institute.
Four government agencies - the Office of Science and Technology, Department
of Health, Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council - took the initiative to 'combat a widely
perceived shortfall in British vaccine research'. Although there are pockets
of specialised research in academic laboratories and small companies such as
Medeva and British Biotechnology, the UK has no large vaccine research
centres to match those elsewhere in Europe and North America.
Officials decided to set up the centre as a model research partnership
between public and private sectors, as outlined in last year's science white
paper.
Mr David Hunt, science minister, told the centre's launch conference in
London yesterday that all UK-based pharmaceutical groups were approached but
only Glaxo wanted to take part.
Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, said: 'It's a great signal about the
scientific promise of vaccine research that a company like Glaxo which left
the field some time ago is now prepared to come back in.'
The institute will carry out basic research into the way the human immune
system can be harnessed to fight disease - not only viral and bacterial
infections but also cancer.
The sponsoring organisations hope the institute will be running in time for
the 200th anniversary of the world's first recorded vaccination in May 1796
by Edward Jenner.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Phone groups face December revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oftel, the UK telecommunications regulator, issues a consultative paper this
week which will lead to the most far-reaching changes in industry
regulations since the privatisation of British Telecommunications in 1984.
Some of the changes could have profound implications for the cost of
telephone services - currently on a downward trend - in both the residential
and business sectors.
The 'December Document' is ostensibly about the cost to the growing number
of public telecommunications operators of interconnection to the BT network.
Any public telephone operator in the UK has to link to BT's network at some
point to deliver a service, and interconnection charges can represent
between a half and two-thirds of an operator's costs. Oftel has been
fielding a torrent of complaints that the regime is unfair, arbitrary and
inimical to business planning.
The document will tackle this problem and account separation - through which
BT can be measured on the performance of each of its operations - in detail.
But Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, is also taking the
opportunity to explore a range of questions - many with no easy answer -
which have been thrown up by the complex development of the
telecommunications industry.
These range from the 'universal service obligation' - the need to provide a
service on economic terms to the isolated, disabled and infirm - to the
measures which should be taken to regulate the industry's most recent
entrants, the suppliers of multimedia services which are not themselves
telecommunications operators.
There are also suggestions that Mr Cruickshank will seek to open a debate
over the future of Oftel itself, asking at what point the role of the
regulator should cease to exist in a freely competitive market.
Some of the more important questions to be addressed this week are:
How to set interconnection charges to allow operators flexibility in pricing
their own services. At present, interconnection charges paid are directly
related to BT's tariff structure because BT connects its competitors' calls
at commercial rates. In other words, because interconnection is such an
important element of an operator's costs, its freedom for price innovation
is constrained by BT's pricing strategy. One answer is to relate pricing to
capacity; a fear is that many newer entrants have insufficient information
to calculate their capacity requirements.
How to resolve the nightmarish issue of the 'access deficit contribution'
(ADC). BT, as owner of the nationwide network, is obliged to provide a
universal service at reasonable cost. It is prevented by Oftel from raising
line rental charges by more than the retail prices index plus 2 per cent
annually. This protects vulnerable residential users but the subsequent lack
of 'rebalancing' costs BT revenue.
The argument is that all operators should make a contribution to these costs
 -an ADC. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the previous director-general, ruled that to
help entrants, operators pay no ADC until they reached a specific market
share. At the moment only Mercury pays ADCs.
The complexities of calculating the charges are daunting. A principal theme
of the paper is expected to be the way the telecommunications market is
becoming buried under a tangle of regulations, and the need to simplify
matters for all competitors.
How to define and calculate the universal service obligation. For such a
central issue it is remarkable that no formal definition exists, nor an
estimate of how much it costs to provide.
Oftel will attempt a definition and look at ways of identifying costs. It is
likely to make clear that it will be a cost for the operators to bear rather
than a tax on the public.
Responses to the paper are invited before the end of March and the new
framework is expected to be published in the summer.
The debate will be followed with intense interest not only in the UK but by
telecommunications authorities and companies in Europe and beyond. It is
asking the questions they all have to answer.

FT  06 DEC 94 / The 'Machin' set for scrap heap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Machin' payphone, symbol of Mercury's assault on the UK
telecommunications market, is set for the scrap-heap, Alan Cane writes.
The phone kiosk was first seen at Waterloo railway station, London, in July
1988. In spite of the estimated 100m calls that have been made from the
distinctive blue and silver kiosks, the shells bearing Mercury's logo will
be progressively removed, beginning next March. By the end of the year all
will be gone.
In six years, Mercury installed 2,873 payphones in a variety of city centre
sites, airports and stations. All but 10 accept only Mercurycards.
But the company's contribution to Britain's street furniture is small
compared with the 330,000 or payphones that have been installed by British
Telecommunications, and the operation has never made money.
Now it is to be axed as part of Mercury's radical retrenchment which will
see it join with cable companies to offer residential telephones and seek a
buyer for its customer equipment business.
The Mercurycards will still be available from retailers until March and will
be useable in the company's payphones until the end of the year. Some 16m
have been sold since 1988.
People with cards they do not or cannot use will be able to return them to
the company for a refund.

FT  06 DEC 94 / TUC counts cost of equal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equalising the state pension age at 65 will cost women aged between 20 and
44 an average of Pounds 14,756 each, says the Trades Union Congress.
The pensions bill, expected soon, will introduce a common retirement age of
65 for men and women following a European ruling that the present retirement
ages of 65 for men and 60 for women are discriminatory. The TUC says: 'The
government is replacing direct discrimination in pension age by indirect
discrimination.
'Men, and in particular relatively affluent men, are far more likely to have
pension arrangements that will allow them to take early retirement,
therefore a pension age of 65 will lead to more women than men having to
work until the state pension age.'
The change will be phased in between the years 2010 and 2020. Women now over
44 will still be able to retire at 60 but those born after March 1955 will
have to wait until they are 65. Women now aged between 38 and 43 will
receive a state pension when they are aged between 60 and 65.
The TUC estimates the total cost to women between 20 and 44 at Pounds 139bn,
and has used the last census to break down the total lost pension in England
and Wales by region, county and district council.
The TUC said the government had estimated that it would cost Pounds 3.5bn a
year to equalise the state pension age at 60, but the unions say this rests
on extremely pessimistic actuarial assumptions.
They commissioned an independent projection which put the cost as low as
Pounds 700m a year after taking into account savings in unemployment and
other benefits from younger people moving into jobs freed by those retiring.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Adviser attacks town hall pay-off terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The redundancy terms an-nounced yesterday for local authority workers who
lose their jobs through reorganisation have been termed 'inadequate' by the
commission advising on the reform.
The maximum compensation, based on age and length of service, will be 66
weeks' pay. Until the age of 50, there will be a mandatory pay-off scheme;
after that, it will be discretionary.
These compare with a maximum of 84 weeks' pay for those who lost their jobs
when metropolitan counties were abolished in 1986, and about three years'
pay for some Treasury civil servants made redundant as part of civil service
restructuring.
The dropping of plans to make payments discretionary for employees of all
ages was a significant concession announced by Mr David Curry, the local
government minister. The proposal had been opposed by both employers and
unions as unworkable.
Mr Alan Atherton, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission, the
quango advising the government on implementing local authority reform, last
month called the compensation 'inadequate' and said councils would need
funding to pay off workers.
Local authorities say the terms are not good enough to encourage employees
to volunteer for redundancy. They say this could create legal difficulties
because employees' jobs and terms and conditions may be protected by the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as
Tupe.
Ms Tina Day, of the Association of County Councils, one of England's three
local authority organisations, said: 'I don't think these terms are
sufficiently attractive to make people volunteer to leave. That means people
will have nothing to lose in terms of creating as much trouble as possible
in Tupe claims.'
Authorities claim that the local government finance settlement, the toughest
for a decade, will add to difficulties in funding the reorganisation, due to
take place in England in May 1996.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's local government spokesman, said his party would
vote against all reorganisation orders in parliament unless the compensation
package was improved. He described the local government review process as a
'shambles'.
In the settlement, it emerged yesterday that councils' capital spending will
be cut by 12.3 per cent, from Pounds 7.3bn to Pounds 6.4bn.
The local authority associations say councils will be able to increase
budgets by an average of 1.6 per cent next year. However, there are wide
variations, with shire districts able to raise spending by 3.3 per cent on
average, but metropolitan districts only able to raise budgets by 0.5 per
cent.
Local authorities also claim that the tough financial settlement from the
government this year, which saw a cut in all central government finance for
councils of 0.4 per cent, will make reorganisation harder to achieve.
Analysis by authorities since the settlement was announced shows that the
proposed strict 'capping' measures to stop excessive rises in council tax
will allow them to spend an extra Pounds 1.1bn in excess of the government's
projected level for total standard spending of Pounds 43.5bn. Their current
total spending is about Pounds 45bn, so this could be met by drawing Pounds
400m from reserves. However, this makes no allowance for the effect of
inflation, wage rises, or increased numbers of clients.
The shift in grants has produced other winners and losers. Grants for fire
authorities will now be allocated on measures including the length of a
county's coastline. Previously, the Isle of Wight had been underfunded
because the allocation formula assumed that fire brigades could draft in
reinforcements from neighbouring counties.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Credit demand continues at high level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for credit among UK consumers eased slightly in October, although it
continued to run at a high level. Official figures yesterday suggested that
finance houses took the lion's share of the business.
The Central Statistical Office reported that net lending to consumers by
finance houses, through unsecured lending from building societies and on
bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, fell to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 451m in October from Pounds 479m in September but
was well above the Pounds 320m of October last year.
After record net lending of Pounds 632m in August, high consumer credit
demand in the latest two months ensured that net lending, as measured by the
CSO each month, reached a record Pounds 1.56bn in the three months to the
end of October.
However, yesterday's release saw the last of this 'narrow coverage' of
consumer credit business. In future the Bank of England will supply more
detailed lending figures, including lending by banks on personal accounts,
by insurance companies, retailers and on all bank credit cards and charge
cards, each month.
Yesterday's figures showed a jump in net lending by finance houses to Pounds
437m in October from Pounds 381m in September, but business failed to reach
August's Pounds 486m record. In the three months to the end of October, net
lending by finance houses was a record Pounds 1.3bn, up from Pounds 1.02bn
in the three months to July.
By contrast net lending through bank credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard
systems fell to Pounds 14m in October from Pounds 102m in September. Such
lending was a net Pounds 241m in the latest three months against Pounds 154m
in the previous period.
City analysts said the October figures suggested finance houses were gaining
market share, probably through providing credit for special deals in the UK
car market. Although new car sales have been weak in recent months, the
Finance and Leasing Association yesterday reported increased financing of
used cars by its members.
The increased use of bank credit cards as a means of payment lifted the
amount of new credit advanced to consumers to a record Pounds 5.31bn in
October from Pounds 5.28bn in September. While new credit advanced on bank
credit cards increased to Pounds 3.07bn from Pounds 3.02bn, however, new
lending by finance houses fell to Pounds 2.03bn from Pounds 2.04bn.
Mr David Hardisty, the association's chairman, said rising credit was not
feeding though into higher consumer spending. 'It just means that consumers
are spreading their costs,' he said.

FT  06 DEC 94 / M0 growth falls back to 7.1% in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of annual growth in M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, fell
back in November, Bank of England figures yesterday showed.
Measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, M0 grew 7.1 per cent in the year to
November.
This was lower than in October and September when M0 grew by 7.3 per cent
and 7.2 per cent respectively.
However, the annual growth rate was slightly higher than the market had
expected and remains well outside the government's target monitoring range
of 0 to 4 per cent.
With the markets dogged by speculation about whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will raise
interest rates when they meet tomorrow, analysts were yesterday divided
about the implications of the data.
M0 has traditionally been taken by the Bank of England as an important
inflation indicator. However the Bank and Treasury have recently moved away
from using monetary aggregates to set interest policy, not least because M0
has diverged from retail sales and inflation trends this year.
Ms Helen MacFarlane, economist at brokers Hoare Govett, said that the
slowdown in M0 should 'move it down the authorities' risk list'.
'Month-on-month M0 growth seems to be moving back more in line with retail
sales. If true, this implies that November may have been a poor month for
retailers, although this may reflect prices rather than volumes,' she said.
Mr Andrew Cates of brokers UBS yesterday argued that the M0 data suggested
that a there was a strong case for a base rate rise this month.
'The current growth in M0 clearly gives cause for concern about future
inflation,' he said, pointing out that in spite of the fall in the annual
growth rate of M0 in November the three month annualised rate remained
strong, running at 7.2 per cent in November, compared with 5.3 per cent in
August.
The rate of annual growth in notes and coins, which represent 99 per cent of
M0, grew by 6.8 per cent in the year to November, compared with an annual
growth rate of 7.1 per cent in October.
The Bank of England yesterday said the measure for broad money supply M4
grew by 3.9 per cent in the year to October.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Figures confirm faltering mortgage market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A withdrawal from the mortgage market by centralised lenders contributed to
a fall in new net lending in October compared with the corresponding month
last year, figures released yesterday show.
The statistics published by the Bank of England confirm the faltering state
of the mortgage market, with seasonally adjusted figures for new lending
lower in October than in September.
Centralised lenders sell through intermediaries rather than through branch
networks. This year borrowers redeemed Pounds 130m more in loans in October
than were taken out.
In October last year centralised lenders undertook Pounds 137m of new net
lending, more than 8 per cent of the total market.
It is the third successive month that the new net lending figures have shown
centralised lenders with a 'negative' share of the mortgage market.
Overall, new gross lending totalled Pounds 4.85bn in October - a drop of
almost 8 per cent on the Pounds 5.27bn equivalent in September, though it is
still about 5 per cent higher than in October last year.
New net lending - which deducts from the gross lending the loans redeemed by
the borrowers - was Pounds 1.54bn in October against Pounds 1.64bn the
previous month. The figure represents a fall of more than 8 per cent on
October last year.
The greater difference between the figures for new gross and net lending
this autumn compared with last year suggests that more re-mortgaging is now
being carried out.
Figures for loans approved but not yet undertaken suggest that the market
will remain flat in the immediate future, though they show that in this
respect the market has improved since October last year.
Total new commitments came to Pounds 4.82bn in October, compared with Pounds
4.86bn in September.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Councils detect Pounds 9m more fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England and Wales have detected Pounds 34m worth of
fraud in the last financial year - Pounds 9m more than 1992-93, says the
Audit Commission, the local government watchdog.
Benefit abuse accounted for 98 per cent of cases, with a total value of
Pounds 26m, up from Pounds 20m. Most involved people abusing the systems for
housing and council tax benefits, and little was committed by councillors or
officers.
However, the commission refused to speculate on the overall level of fraud,
saying that 'by definition you cannot get a handle on it because it is
undetected'. It added: 'There are areas of fraud which are growing and
authorities need to look out for them.'
These included student award fraud, which rose from 228 cases, worth only
Pounds 220,000, to 922 cases worth Pounds 2.3m.
Most (90 per cent) were in London, where it is relatively easy for students
to make multiple applications in different boroughs, and where there are now
about 30 higher education institutions. The increased detection rate
followed a joint initiative by London councils, which used computers to
discover multiple claims.
There was also a sharp increase in renovation grant frauds, from Pounds
450,0000 to Pounds 1.1m.
The commission said the figures for corruption, involving offences such as
bribe-taking by council officers, were encouraging, with only 36 cases
reported, compared with 54 the previous year.
The commission suggested improving co-ordination between councils and said
information technology should be used to uncover multiple claims. In one
London borough fraudulent claims of Pounds 300,000 were identified by the
London Committee for Action Against Fraud.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Consumer spending up in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer spending through credit cards was stronger in November than in the
same month a year ago, figures from a leading credit card group suggested
yesterday, Gillian Tett writes.
Data from Barclaycard showed that total spending, in real cash terms, on its
cards was 9 per cent higher in November than a year ago, when adjusted for
the number of processing days in the month.
Spending processed between November 21 and December 2, which is regarded by
most retailers as the first two weeks of the crucial pre-Christmas period,
was at least 7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Total spending through Barclaycard credit cards, which represents slightly
more than one-third of total credit card spending, was Pounds 516m between
November 21 and December 2 this year, the figures showed.
Although the growth may partly reflect an increase in the use of credit
cards for making payments, it also suggests that consumer spending last
month may have been slightly better than some retailers had expected. In
recent months the rate of annual growth in retail spending has slowed
slightly.

FT  06 DEC 94 / EU may shake up betting levies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting on overseas horse races such as the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe could
become more expensive if a European Union draft directive becomes law.
The proposal, attached to an agricultural directive, is designed to raise
more money for the European bloodstock industry. But it would mean that bets
taken on races in other parts of the EU would incur a levy imposed by the
country in which the race was run.
A UK bookmaker would have to pay the 5 per cent French levy for a bet on a
French race rather than the UK levy of just over 1 per cent.
In the Irish Republic, where there is no levy on off-course betting, the
proposal would have a more general effect. More than 80 per cent of all
Irish bets are placed on UK races and would attract the British rate.
Mr Tom Kelly, director-general of the Betting Offices Licensees Association
in the UK, was in Brussels yesterday lobbying against the recently changed
text of the agricultural directive.
The original plan was to link intellectual property law and betting by
giving control of betting information such as odds to the organisers of
horse races. This would have conferred a right on them not available in any
member state.
Mr Kelly said yesterday the European Commission appeared to have listened
and dropped the intellectual property clause. But he believed it was wrong
to introduce, in effect, a new tax through an agricultural directive and
said the plan also breached subsidiarity rules. Horse racing was supposed to
be an industry which set its rules at the national level, he said.
British bookmakers say the French can afford a 5 per cent levy because their
overheads are lower - they can operate in bars and cafes.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Tube plans restart of tunnelling: Austrian method guidelines
listed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground has submitted plans for restarting work on part of the
Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee line extension using the controversial New Austrian
Tunnelling Method.
Work was halted as a precaution on two Jubilee line stations after a tunnel
being excavated using the method collapsed under Heathrow airport in
October.
Plans for restarting work on the Jubilee line stations have been submitted
to the Health and Safety Executive which is conducting an investigation into
the Heathrow collapse and the suitability of using the method in London
clay.
The executive has asked contractors working on the Jubilee line extension
and the Pounds 300m rail link from Heathrow to Paddington station in central
London not to use the method until they are satisfied that proposed designs
and construction procedures are safe.
Mr Hugh Doherty, project director for the Jubilee line extension, said
yesterday: 'We would hope to resume work as soon as possible but cannot say
whether this will be before or after Christmas. The stoppage only affects
two out of 11 stations on the extension. The bulk of work is continuing
normally.'
The Health and Safety Executive yesterday published a discussion paper which
included a proposed checklist of procedures which it recommends should be
adopted by designers and contractors opting to use the method.
The Austrian technique, which has been used internationally for about 40
years, encourages engineers to utilise the strength of the ground
surrounding a tunnel to minimise the extra strengthening required to prevent
collapse during construction.
The technique can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than conventional tunnelling
methods.
The executive said the success of the method depended upon precise
predictions of ground responses to excavation together with sophisticated
measuring procedures to allow engineers time to strengthen the tunnel if
there were unexpected movements.
Investigators into the Heathrow collapse are concentrating their inquiries
on the possibility that it may have been caused by human error or design

FT  06 DEC 94 / Use of leases to inflate profits ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies will no longer be able to inflate their profits after accepting
incentives from landlords to take up a lease.
In the past when a tenant took a new lease and accepted benefits, such as
upfront payments called 'reverse-premiums', they could be credited to the
profit and loss account.
Other benefits offered to tenants, particularly large retailers, have
included contributions to fitting-out and re-allocation costs and rent-free
periods.
The Accounting Standards Board has decided that from December 23 such
incentives should be spread over the whole length of the lease or until the
rent meets the market rate.
The rules, issued by the ASB and devised by its Urgent Issues Task Force,
were prompted by worries that there was no clear guidance on accounting for
such incentives.
The issue came to a head last February when the Financial Reporting Review
Panel commented on the case of Pentos, the specialist retailer.
Pentos had disclosed that its 1992 accounts, which showed a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 4m, included upfront payments from landlords of Pounds 6.3m.
A draft set of rules issued by the task force in May prompted several
submissions but in its final directive the task force has stuck to its view
that the benefits received should be spread out and not allowed to be
credited in one sum.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Eggar pledges to disclose coal bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday he would make as public as
possible the bid figures relating to British Coal's privatisation as he
indirectly criticised one of the companies which failed to have its tender
accepted.
He said the publication of the figures meant some people 'would have been
better advised to be a little cautious before jumping to conclusions'. This
was considered by members of the Coal Industry Society, which Mr Eggar was
addressing, to be a reference to Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal
Investments.
Last week Mr Edwards and his advisers were highly critical of the bidding
process which allowed RJB Mining, the government's preferred bidder for the
English regions, to pay Pounds 116m of the Pounds 815m final price in
instalments. They said Coal Investments had been refused permission to make
such arrangements, although this was denied by the government.
Mr Eggar said there had been misinformation and 'less than pleasant
innuendo' throughout the bid. He said the sale was likely to be considered
by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, and the Commons
public accounts committee.

FT  06 DEC 94 / SFO fails to ban press from Maxwell case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office yesterday failed in an attempt to have a blanket
reporting ban placed on a High Court case in which Maxwell pensioners are
trying to recover Pounds 60m from Credit Suisse bank.
The SFO - backed by lawyers acting for some of those being prosecuted over
the Maxwell affair - had argued that reporting of the case should be stopped
because publicity could damage the chances of Mr Kevin Maxwell and others
who are facing criminal charges from receiving a fair trial.
However, Mr Justice Lindsay, the judge in the Credit Suisse case, ruled in
favour of 10 national newspapers, including the Financial Times, which had
opposed the proposed ban.
In the civil case, the trustees of the Mirror Group Pension Scheme and the
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the largest manager of the
Maxwell pension funds, are suing Credit Suisse over its acceptance of
pension fund assets as collateral for a Pounds 50m loan to the Robert
Maxwell Group.
They are arguing that Credit Suisse knew, or should have known, that the
assets belonged to the pension funds.
Both the SFO and lawyers for some of the defendants argued that the issues
in the civil case overlapped with those that the jury in the criminal trial
would have to consider.
However, Mr Edward Bannister QC, for the newspapers, argued there was an
important public interest in the Credit Suisse trial being reported.
The case involved the conduct of leading institutions and whether they had
overstepped certain commercial boundaries, he said.
The Credit Suisse case is expected to end next summer - after the start of
the first Maxwell trial scheduled for April.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Anger as Blair stands by monarchy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's leadership last night stood by its plans to reform the monarchy in
the face of furious government claims that the opposition's constitutional
reform proposals would lead to the break-up of the UK.
Amid growing acrimony, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, made clear that he
had approved comments by Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, broadcast in
a BBC Television Panorama documentary last night.
But Mr Stephen Dorrell, heritage secretary, challenged Labour in the Commons
to make royal reform an election issue, and accused the party of seeking to
impose a 'straitjacket' of political correctness on the royal family.
Mr Straw, who suggested a reduction in the number of royals carrying out
official functions, said his comments were in line with existing party
policy.
Labour officials also suggested that his remarks reflected the views of the
Prince of Wales, who has made little secret of his belief that the monarchy
must change with the times.
However, ministers queued up to attack Mr Straw's comments, underlining
Conservative hopes that the issue will deflect attention from the
government's problems over Europe and value added tax.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said Labour's proposals, which include
ending the royal prerogative, would lead to 'the break-up of Britain as we
know it'.
Mr David Hunt, the cabinet's chief political troubleshooter, claimed that Mr
Straw's comments were out of line with Labour policy and challenged Mr Tony
Blair to overrule him.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said people would be disgusted by
a policy that threatened the monarchy's future. He told BBC Radio: 'What
most astounds me is that Labour throws around constitutional change without
any thought, with absolute gay abandon.'
Mr Dorrell, speaking during the resumed Budget debate, said Labour had begun
its attempt to change tradition in the summer when Ms Mo Mowlam, then shadow
heritage secretary, suggested the royal family should move from Buckingham
Palace into a 'designer palace'.
While Labour leaders had then sought to distance themselves from Ms Mowlam,
that defence had been 'blown to smithereens' over the weekend by the latest
proposals by Mr Straw. Mr Dorrell accepted that a debate on the future role
of the royal family was desirable, but fundamentally disagreed with Mr
Straw. To government cheers he forecast that if the debate went to the
'court of public opinion' the Conservatives would win hands down.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, suggested that the majority of
the people probably wanted the monarchy to end when the Queen's reign
finished. He said it was not because of the growth of republicanism per se -
'I wish it was' - but because of the 'shenanigans' that had taken place at
Buckingham Palace.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Council cleaning overspend revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than half the local authorities in Britain are paying a total of Pounds
170m too much each year for their office cleaning, a study published today
concludes.
About three quarters of the councils have awarded their building cleaning
contracts, which are subject to compulsory competitive tendering, to
in-house Direct Service Organisations (DSOs).
Dr Stefan Szymanski of the Imperial College Management School, who carried
out the survey for CDC, the local government research organisation, said the
best explanation for the overspending was that in a large number of cases
the competitive tendering process for local authorities' building cleaning
contracts had not been properly implemented.
The findings are in line with an earlier study by Dr Szymanski into local
authorities' contracting out of refuse collection. This found that councils
which retained the services of DSOs tended to have higher costs.
Dr Szymanski said: 'My findings show that competitive tendering, in a
significant number of local authorities, is little more than a fiction.'
His report says that the annual cost of local authority building cleaning,
excluding schools, is Pounds 500m, producing an average annual cost for each
council-tax household of Pounds 20.
Dr Szymanski compared the cleaning contracts of 232 local authorities with
bids by 40 private-sector cleaning companies for a contract to clean 1,000
sq m offices. The bids for this fictitious contract ranged from Pounds 5 to
Pounds 11 a sq m annually - the so-called 'competitive benchmark'.
The survey estimated that more than half the 232 councils have awarded
contracts costing more than Pounds 11 a sq m, and of these 75 per cent are
held by DSOs.
It also found that fewer than half the contracts awarded within the
competitive benchmark had been awarded to DSOs.

FT  06 DEC 94 / City levy 'may fund transport infrastructure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport projects in London and other large cities could be financed by a
business levy similar to the non-domestic rate, under proposals put forward
by the Corporation of London yesterday.
Businesses would be able to vote on whether to support the levy in their
area - though they would have to abide by the majority decision - and would
be involved in monitoring how it was being spent.
A study by Mr Tony Travers and Mr Stephen Glaister of the London School of
Economics, on behalf of the corporation, includes plans for an
infrastructure fund for London to complement the government's
private-finance initiative.
The Treasury yesterday reacted negatively to the proposal, saying it would
increase the burden on business at a time when rates were due to fall and
that it did not represent 'true private finance'.
The City first began looking at methods of raising additional finance for
transport when CrossRail, a plan for a cross-London rail line, was mooted.
Another 1p in the pound on business rates in Greater London could raise
Pounds 75m a year towards the capital cost of transport schemes or to the
repayment of interest on loans. The scheme's managers could expect to raise
10 times their annual revenue from the levy in the form of commercial loans.
Mr Travers said: 'London's infrastructure is badly in need of reinvestment
but government funding has remained below the levels officially accepted as
necessary to reinstate and maintain the railway network.'
The infrastructure fund would be easy to understand because the rating
system already exists and it would be relatively easy and cheap to collect
the levy, Mr Glaister said.
The idea is for a trust or similar organisation to be established, combining
private and public-sector membership. It would devise a package of transport
schemes seeking backing and propose this to local businesses.
The government would have to commit itself to maintaining existing
public-spending levels for transport if businesses were to be expected to
contribute, Mr Travers said.
Legislation would be needed to permit the introduction of a levy. Some US
cities have designated improvement districts, which raise funds from local
business. In France, a city may impose a levy on businesses to finance
transport infrastructure.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Fall reported in business failures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of business failures in the third quarter of this year fell to
its lowest level since 1989, a business survey has found.
The survey, conducted by Trade Indemnity, the credit management group, says
that there were 784 business failures in the third quarter of this year.
This was 5 per cent lower than in the second quarter, and 33 per cent lower
than the same period a year ago.
However, Trade Indemnity pointed out that the fall in business failures
appeared to be slowing, with some regions, such as the north-east, west
Midlands and East Anglia, recording a rise in business failures between the
second and third quarters of this year.

FT  06 DEC 94 / NatWest breaks ranks on Sundays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is planning to open several branches over the next
two Sundays to take advantage of the pre-Christmas shopping rush.
NatWest is thought to be the first of the UK's big four clearing banks to
break ranks and open branches in some main retailing centres on a Sunday.
About 20 branches in eight of the bank's 19 regions will be open from
10.30am to 3.30pm and are likely to offer a full counter service, enabling
customers to withdraw cash and check balances. The branches will be staffed
by volunteers.
The bank said it would consider in the light of the experiment whether to
extend the service throughout the year. Banking staff fear such a move by
NatWest would be the first step to seven-day working as its competitors
would almost certainly follow suit.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Lloyd's faces resistance to deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts by Lloyd's of London to reach a deal to end legal action by
lossmaking members are facing resistance from those who would have to pay
most of the bill, the insurance market's ruling council is expected to hear
tomorrow, Ralph Atkins writes.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, last
Wednesday met 'errors and omissions' insurers - providers of negligence
cover to professional agencies being sued - as part of his efforts to
increase the pressure for a new settlement.
Although E&amp;O insurers are understood to be divided over whether fresh
negotiations are in their interest, the majority believe firmly that they
have no incentive to enter talks at this stage.
Tomorrow's council meeting is expected to decide whether attempts to forge a
new deal should be stepped up.
Earlier this year Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market - rejected a deal worth Pounds 900m and have
subsequently pursued court actions for claims totalling about Pounds 3bn.
The E&amp;O insurers argue that the sums available to fund any deal have not
changed and that lossmaking Names continue to have unrealistic expectations
about how much they might eventually receive - either through court action
or a settlement. Much of the E&amp;O cover was provided within the Lloyd's
market, funded by other Names.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Bail for three in fraud hearing

   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Barclays Bank official and two other men, all accused of attempting
a multi-million pound bank fraud, were remanded on bail at City of London
magistrates court yesterday.
Mr Guy Wheeler, of Gonalston, Nottinghamshire, who supervises seven Barclays
Bank branches, was remanded on bail of Pounds 25,000 until May 19 next year.
He appeared alongside property developer Mr John Doherty, of Morpeth
Terrace, Victoria, London, and Mr Maurice O'Leary, of Bexleyheath, south
London.
All three are charged with conspiring together on or before December 2 1994
to defraud financial institutions by inducing them to believe that a forged
bank guarantee supposedly issued by a Barclays branch in Derby, was genuine.
The magistrates also ordered Mr Wheeler to live at his recorded address,
surrender his passport, not apply for any travel documents and not contact
witnesses or either of his co-defendants. Mr Doherty was remanded on Pounds
50,000 bail and Mr O'Leary on Pounds 10,000 bail on the same conditions, as
well as having to report twice weekly to police.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Money laundering in property feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three-quarters of property professionals and their advisers have acted in
deals which raised suspicions of money laundering, according to a survey for
solicitors Herbert Smith.
A third of those questioned said their clients included companies whose
dealings were slightly doubtful.
Most suspicious transactions involved buyers transferringfunds offshore.
Buyers willing to pay over the market rate for a property or pay in cash
were also seen as suspicious.
The Criminal Justice Act 1993 and subsequent money laundering regulations
make it a criminal offence to fail to report suspicions of laundering
involving drug-trafficking or terrorist activity.
Surveyors or estate agents could face up to five years in prison if they
harbour suspicions about a transaction and do not report it to the
authorities.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Work to start on office complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent and SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work will start next month on a Pounds 58m office development in Manchester,
the largest single project in the city centre for 30 years.
Agreements were announced yesterday for the pre-letting of 70 per cent of
the 219,000 sq ft to lawyers Addleshaw Sons &amp; Latham and accountants Ernst &amp;
Young and Price Waterhouse.
The complex of two office blocks and a public piazza will be next to
Manchester's Pounds 42m concert hall for the Halle Orchestra. The hall,
which is under construction, was largely publicly funded. It will be
developed by Amec Developments and funded by PosTel Investment Management,
which represents the Post Office and British Telecommunications pension
funds.
The project - a flagship for the government-backed Central Manchester
Development Corporation - almost failed to get off the drawing board because
of the recession.
Amec rescued it in 1992 in partnership with Beazer and the development
corporation but has since taken over as sole developer and negotiated the
three pre-lets.
The project will enlarge Manchester's city centre, where good office space
has come under increasing pressure in the past 10 years as the financial and
professional services sector has been bursting the seams of what is known
locally as the 'Square Half-Mile'.
Greater Manchester has had no shortage of office development, particularly
around the airport and at Salford Quays and Trafford Park in the disused
docklands at the end of the Manchester Ship Canal. But the new project is
the most significant in the city centre since the Piccadilly Plaza complex
in the 1960s.
National Mutual Life Assurance has acquired 6.8 acres of land next to
Birmingham International Airport and plans to start work on a 230,000 sq ft
office development next year, Simon London writes.
National Mutual has yet to find tenants for the Trinity Park scheme. It is
building speculatively in the hope that better rents can be achieved by the
time work is finished.

FT  06 DEC 94 / BBC urges support for move into global market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC last night appealed to the ITV companies and the Independent
Television Commission to support the corporation's move into the global
marketplace.
Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general, said that if the BBC was unable to
supplement the licence fee either programme quality would suffer or there
would be a revival of the argument that the BBC should carry advertising.
'I do not believe this would be in the interests of British audiences, the
British programme-making industry - or perhaps even the ITV companies,
Channel 4, Channel 5 or the cable and satellite service,' Mr Phillis told a
Royal Television Society dinner.
He said he was convinced the corporation could serve the UK audience and
compete worldwide.
To ensure that commercial activities were consistent with 'the BBC's special
qualities' and brand values, staff would today receive copies of new
commercial policy guidelines.
The guidelines will set out the sort of commercial activities which the BBC
can focus on and also give guidance on sponsorship, co-productions and
promotional activity.
Mr Phillis said: 'Producers and editors throughout the BBC must have a clear
understanding of what they should and should not do when faced with
commercial opportunity.' He also called for co-operation with the rest of
the television industry on the introduction of digital terrestrial
television.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Government given rough ride on the VAT see-saw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government hopes and fears see-sawed in the Commons last night on the eve of
the crucial vote which will determine whether the increase in value added
tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent will have to be
reconsidered.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, swept out of the chamber after hearing Mr
David Sumberg, Conservative MP for Bury south, confirm that he will vote for
reconsideration when the five-day Budget debate ends tonight.
A succession of Tory MPs warned of the dangers of proceeding with the
increase but Mr Sumberg was the only one to announce that he would vote for
a Labour procedural motion to reopen the issue.
Mr Sumberg suggested that VAT on domestic fuel could be kept at 8 per cent
by forgoing some of the income tax cuts planned for the future, or through
new tax measures. He said he would vote for Labour's procedural motion
because it would give the country, the House and, most important, the
government the chance to think again.
Mr William Powell, Conservative MP for Corby, said he had still to make up
his mind on whether to vote against the government. He recognised that his
constituents shared his hatred for the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel
although he did not believe that a further period of uncertainty, which a
government defeat would bring, would be in their interests.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, the former minister and Conservative MP for Brent North,
described VAT on domestic fuel as a 'bad tax' which might prove as unpopular
as the abandoned poll tax.
Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown, campaigning in the Dudley West
by-election, highlighted a ministerial move to extend VAT to transport
relating to entertainment, recreational activities and car parking at
airports.
This received little publicity when it was announced last week, although
Labour estimates it will raise Pounds 45m.
While the measure does not affect the VAT zero-rating of public transport in
general, Labour believes it is 'the thin end of the wedge'.
'For the first time it introduces the principle of VAT on transport,' Mr
Brown said.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Authorities net half a win by uniting on staff: The bitter
battle over redundancy packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
County and district councils have fought an increasingly bitter battle over
local government reorganisation, but in the matter of staffing they have
managed to speak with one voice.
Yesterday Mr David Curry, the local government minister, announced
provisions for personnel policy which addressed one of the main problems
authorities had identified, but left another untouched.
The big concession is to make redundancy packages mandatory. Previously, the
proposal was that redundancy pay should be at the discretion of local
authorities, within strictly defined limits set by government. Councils
themselves believed that this would be unworkable.
However, the government has not conceded on the total package of money
available in compensation, which remains at pay equivalent to 66 weeks.
This decision, described as inadequate by the Local Government Staff
Commission, the independent body set up by the government to advise on the
staffing issues of reorganisation, could ensure intense political
opposition.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's local government spokesman, said his party would
vote against all reorganisation orders in parliament unless the compensation
package was improved, and described the process of the local government
review as a 'shambles'.
Both districts and counties called for a package at least in line with the
1986 reorganisation of metropolitan counties, when 84 weeks were on offer.
Local authorities also claim that the tough financial settlement from the
government this year, which saw a cut in all central government finance for
councils of 0.4 per cent, will make reorganisation harder to achieve. The
proposed strict 'capping' measures to stop excessive rises in council tax
will further limit their room for manoeuvre.
Analysis by authorities since the settlement was announced last Thursday
shows that the 'cap' will allow them to spend an extra Pounds 1.1bn in
excess of the government's projected level for total standard spending of
Pounds 43.5bn. Their current total spending (once changes in
responsibilities for community care are taken into account) is about Pounds
45bn, so this could be met by drawing Pounds 400m from reserves.
However, this makes no allowance for the effect of inflation, wage rises, or
increased numbers of clients.
Four councils must cut their budgets to meet the proposed cap. They are
Derwentside, in County Durham, faced with a reduction of 3.07 per cent on
current levels, Watford in Hertfordshire, down 1.27 per cent, Leicester,
down 2.4 per cent, and Ipswich, down 5 per cent.
Several others have scope to do much more. For example, East Cambridgeshire
can increase spending by 48.02 per cent without incurring a cap, while South
Cambridgeshire can raise it 69.74 per cent.
The shift in grants has still produced winners and losers. Grants for fire
authorities will now be allocated on measures including the length of a
county's coastline. Previously, the Isle of Wight had been underfunded
because the allocation formula assumed that fire brigades could draft in
reinforcements from neighbouring counties.
The new formula means rises of 30 per cent in funding for the Isle of
Wight's fire service, and of 40 per cent for Cornwall's, but landlocked
counties have suffered significant reductions. As the total grant for fire
services was unchanged from last year, every winner from the process had to
be balanced by a loser elsewhere.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Pensions body suffers Dollars 71bn funds shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which guarantees the basic pension
benefits of American workers, has a Dollars 71bn shortfall, a 34 per cent
increase from last year.
The agency yesterday said that 8m workers and pensioners are covered by the
underfunded plans. Some 75 per cent of the shortfall is in plans sponsored
by prospering businesses. However, about Dollars 18bn of underfunding -
covering 1.2m people - is in plans sponsored by companies with sagging bond
ratings.
The underfunded plans are concentrated in a relatively small number of
companies. More than half are large plans, primarily in the steel, vehicle,
tyre and airline industries.
However, legislation to reduce the gap by more than two-thirds was included
in the financing provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
pact which won congressional approval last week.
The new legislation requires companies with underfunded plans to accelerate
their funding and calculate required contributions according to
government-approved methods. It closes a loophole that has allowed some
companies to minimise pension contributions and requires companies which
have severely underfunded plans to set aside enough cash and marketable
securities to pay for at least three years of benefits.
Companies will be required to notify employees if pension plans are less
than 90 per cent funded. The pension guarantee agency guarantees basic
benefits of about 41m Americans. Its guarantee is limited to Dollars
2,556.82 a month, often less than the promised benefit.
Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, headed a task force early in 1993
which examined the pension problem and proposed several solutions. 'We can
now begin to reverse the trend that posed a risk to workers and retirees,'
he said. 'A solid pension will be part of the deal for workers who have
counted on and earned the American dream of a secure retirement.'

FT  06 DEC 94 / Orange County taxpayers face up to bad bet: Bond market
gamble that could cost Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wealthy and very conservative taxpayers of Orange County, California
could soon find themselves picking up the bill for what amounts to one of
the biggest-ever mistaken bets on the direction of interest rates.
Late last week, investment officers in this prosperous area to the south of
Los Angeles estimated that they were sitting on a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
910m) paper loss from their dealings in the bond markets this year. They
tried to play down the scale of the disaster: this was only 7 per cent of
the Dollars 20bn of investments the county controlled, they said.
In reality, things are much worse. The Orange County fund actually was worth
between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 8bn and used what amounts to a form of
borrowing to leverage up the value of investments under its control.
The Dollars 1.5bn of losses (some on Wall Street say it is closer to Dollars
2bn) have cut the value of the fund to some Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.5bn, a
loss of a fifth or more.
Until Orange County actually sells the securities in its investment
portfolio, these losses will not be realised. In the meantime, the case has
already turned into a political circus, and is fast pitting politicians
against Wall Street in the latest big test case for the derivative markets.
Ironically, for an area dominated by Republicanism, it took a Democrat to
bring about this debacle. Mr Robert Citron, who resigned yesterday as the
county's treasurer, was an elected official, in common with his counterparts
in other counties in California (but unlike much of the rest of the US.)
Mr Citron's - and Orange County's - problems stemmed from a mistaken bet on
interest rates at a time when the US bond markets have suffered their
biggest tumble in memory. After posting above-average investment returns for
some time - the treasurer's fund is generally estimated to have made around
twice the return of most other bond funds in recent years - this marks an
abrupt reversal of fortune.
According to an executive at one Wall Street firm which deals heavily with
the county, the losses should be seen in the context both of the fund's
previous good performance and 'the biggest rout in the bond market's
history'. But none of that will come as much consolation to local taxpayers.
Mr Citron's strategy fell into two parts. First, to leverage his
investments, he in effect borrowed about Dollars 12bn by using the
securities repurchase market. This involves selling securities and at the
same time agreeing to buy them back in the future.
The cash was then used to buy more securities, which in turn were sold in
the repurchase (or 'repo') market, and so on, until the fund's exposure
reached Dollars 20bn.
If the securities rose in value, the investment return was multiplied: but
if they fell - which turned out to be the case - the losses were also
leveraged.
The second part of the strategy was to use investment instruments which also
accentuated the fund's exposure to the bond markets. Mr Citron is believed
to have controlled between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 8bn of inverse floating
rates notes (instruments which pay a higher investment return, the lower
interest rates fall). These have the same effect as using the 'repo' market,
leveraging the profits (or losses) from changing interest rates.
For Orange County taxpayers, the big question now is whether the county will
be forced to liquidate some or all of its investments, and so turn the paper
losses into real ones, or whether it is able to restructure the fund either
to defer losses or to avoid having to take any losses at all.
Much will depend on the amount of cash at its disposal. The county invests
funds on behalf of about 170 different public bodies - from cities to school
districts and water authorities. It holds their surplus cash as well as tax
revenue which it has collected and which it pays out to meet the operational
needs of the different entities.
One local agency - the Irvine Ranch Water District, with Dollars 300m in the
fund - is agitating hard to get its cash back, and is likely to be followed
by others. According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency,
about 40 per cent of the money in the fund can be recalled by the agencies
concerned, while the rest must be invested in the fund under state law.
A second call on the fund's cash comes from the operating needs of the
agencies concerned. The 37 school districts, which account for about 13 per
cent of the value of the fund, need to pay teachers' salaries and other
bills, and cannot wait for the county to work out a long-term plan for his
fund.
The cash liquidity in the fund is already estimated to have fallen to
Dollars 350m, from more than Dollars 1bn in September. If the county cannot
keep his investors at bay, it will have to start selling securities and
taking investment losses.

FT  06 DEC 94 / US broadband licence bids start today: Government hopes for
world's largest auction of public assets in forthcoming wireless personal
telecoms sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bidding opened in Washington yesterday for what the US government hopes will
be the world's largest auction of public sector assets.
The Federal Communications Commission's auction of broadband wireless
telecommunications licences could last for weeks, and some industry analysts
have said bidding could go as high as Dollars 15bn.
The FCC will sell off 99 licences for a 30 megahertz wide frequency for
wireless personal telecommunications services in 51 separate geographical
areas, from huge markets such as New York and Los Angeles to the tiny
territory of American Samoa. The third big auction of telecommunications
frequencies the FCC has conducted, it is expected to be by far the biggest.
Earlier auctions of national and regional narrowband licences for advanced
paging services raised bids of over Dollars 1bn. But Mr Reed Hundt, FCC
chairman, says the broadband auction will launch an entire new industry that
will provide the telecommunications services of the 21st century.
The FCC received initial applications from 74 companies, consortia and
individuals to take part in the broadband auction, but only 23 stayed in the
running when the time came to make refundable advance payments.
The size of each bidder's downpayment is calculated at 60 cents per person
reached by the frequency and will determine the maximum size of market each
can bid on.
The biggest applicant, a consortium grouping the long-distance phone company
Sprint with Telecommunications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Enterprises, has
put down Dollars 118m, which will allow it to bid on licences covering a
total of nearly 200m people.
Other major bidders include long-distance phone giant AT&amp;T, the Pacific
Telesis local phone company and a consortium of three other Bell local phone
companies. Mr Craig McCaw, who sold his cellular phone company to AT&amp;T, will
also be bidding for markets in which he knows he will not be competing
against AT&amp;T.
Applicants can bid in secret by computer, with one round of bidding a day.
New bids must raise the price by at least 5 per cent, and each company or
consortium must submit at least one bid in each round stay in the ring. But
companies can change their strategy in mid-auction to target a different
region if they see their first choice as too expensive.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Quebec independence push clouded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh uncertainty has entered the debate on Quebec independence with the
serious illness of Mr Lucien Bouchard, the separatist side's most popular
and, arguably, most canny leader.
Mr Bouchard, who heads the Bloc Quebecois, the party which represents the
sovereignty cause in the federal parliament in Ottawa, is likely to be out
of the political arena for several months. His left leg was amputated late
last week in a bid to stop the spread of deadly necrotising myositis, also
known as 'flesh-eating disease'.
The francophone province's newly-elected separatist government has indicated
however, that Mr Bouchard's absence will not interfere with plans for an
independence referendum during 1995.
The government is due to unveil part of its referendum strategy in Quebec's
national assembly later today. It is expected to set up a public commission,
which will ostensibly examine the benefits and costs of independence, but in
reality will give the separatists a high-profile platform in the run-up to
the referendum.
Doctors at St Luc Hospital in Montreal said Mr Bouchard entered hospital a
week ago for treatment of phlebitis when the attack by the muscle-consuming
bacteria was discovered. He remains in intensive care and will require
several months of convalescence, they said.
Political analysts are unsure whether Mr Bouchard's brush with death will
help or hinder the separatist cause. Some commentators predict his
popularity will soar, much as President Ronald Reagan's did after an
assassination attempt in 1981. Separatists have seized on the political
nuances of a note which Mr Bouchard scribbled to his doctors: 'Que l'on
continue' (let us continue).
Others suggest, however, that Mr Bouchard's absence from the political scene
for a prolonged period could harm the separatists' campaign. In particular,
it is likely to blunt the Bloc Quebecois' offensive in the House of Commons.
Mr Bouchard has generally been a voice of moderation in separatist ranks.
His absence could thus bolster the influence of the more headstrong Mr
Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and leader of the provincial Parti
Quebecois.
Mr Parizeau pledged in last summer's election campaign that a separatist
government would immediately declare Quebec's wish to begin talks on a split
from the rest of Canada. But Mr Bouchard's calming influence appears to have
persuaded the new government to hold off.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US leads Gatt ratification rush

Ratification of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement by the US Congress
last week looks set, as hoped, to open the way to the rest of the world to
follow in the next few weeks.
By yesterday, 42 of the 125 countries participating in the round had
completed the national procedures needed to approve it. Officials at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade expect 100 to have done so by the end
of the year.
Almost 50 are expected to have acted by Thursday, when senior trade
diplomats meet in Geneva to confirm January 1 as the date when the agreement
and the new World Trade Organisation come into effect.
No minimum quota has been set for the number of countries that have to
ratify the deal before it can come into force. But it is generally accepted
that, in addition to the US, they must include Japan and the European Union.
In Japan, the lower house of the Diet (parliament) ratified the agreement on
Friday, as part of a clutch of trade bills which included a Y6,010bn (Pounds
38bn) spending package to help cushion the impact of farm trade
liberalisation. The upper house is due to ratify at the end of this week,
though this is a formality.
The EU Council of Ministers plans to ratify the agreement and approve
legislation to implement it at a two-day meeting starting on December 19.
That will follow expected approval of the agreement by the European
Parliament next week.
But because of the ruling by the European Court last month that the
agreement involves 'mixed competence' between the European Commission and
member states, each EU country must also approve it before it can take
effect.
So far, only Britain, Germany and Ireland have completed the process, though
it is well advanced in several other countries, including Italy and Spain.
Brussels is confident that all 12 EU members, along with new entrants
Austria, Finland and Sweden, will have acted before Christmas.
However, Portugal is delaying ratification until the Council of Ministers
has formally approved an Ecu400m (Dollars 508m) aid package to help the
country's textile industry adjust to the phasing out of trade barriers
agreed under the round.
The aid has already been agreed by the European Commission and Parliament,
but may not be approved by the Council before its meeting on December 19.
Portugal says that if the Council did not act this month, it would be
prepared to hold up ratification until next year, though this is widely
interpreted as a bargaining tactic designed to ensure a speedy decision on
the aid.
France's national assembly is ready to ratify the agreement on December 14,
but its government is pressing for the December 19 Council to assess US
implementation - and particularly how Washington intends to maintain its
Section 301 trade legislation. France wants the Council to approve a
proposed EU 'illicit practices' regulation, designed to open other
countries' markets.
Ratification has hit snags in two other important trading countries. In
Australia, action is being held up at least until next week by two minor
party senators who hold the balance of power in the Senate.
In South Korea, the opposition Democratic Party, which represents farming
interests that would be hurt by the deal, may try to block approval this
week by the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. The DP has indicated
support for the WTO, but may try to use ratification to exact concessions
from the government on a number of issues.
In both countries, the threat of delays does not appear serious. However, it
is potentially embarrassing politically, because Australia has strongly
championed the round, while Mr Kim Chul-su. South Korea's trade minister, is
a candidate to head the WTO.
Only four countries - Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Cyprus and Poland - have
told Gatt they may be unable, for different reasons, to ratify by the end of
the year.
Switzerland and Liechtenstein have to allow time for a possible referendum
on the deal. Cyprus wishes first to complete a wide-ranging revision of
trade policy related to its bilateral trade agreement with the EU. Poland
says it may not be able to complete the required changes to legislation by
year-end and is reluctant to ratify in advance.
Current Gatt members have up to two years to ratify the deal after the WTO
comes into force, but must then apply its provisions as if they had been
members from the start.
This leeway may be reduced further if Gatt members decide later this week to
terminate the Gatt agreement before the two years are up. Many countries are
said to be in favour of a one-year cut-off, during which time the Gatt and
WTO would operate in parallel.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Chile expected to start Nafta talks next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of US, Canada and Mexico are expected to announce on Sunday
their intention to begin negotiations next year over Chile's accession to
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The announcement is being planned for the last day of the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, where President Bill Clinton is hosting a meeting of 34
heads of state and government from the western hemisphere.
Officials involved in the pre-summit deliberations say the announcement
would help to provide a symbolic climax to the meeting, which most Latin
American governments believed until recently would yield little of
substance. They say further talks are necessary before an announcement is
certain.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, yesterday said: 'Our goal is
to have an interesting announcement on Sunday led by the President of the
United States and involving Chile.' Officials close to the talks said the
aim was to announce plans to begin talks soon on Chile's accession to Nafta.
Nafta, which groups the US, Canada and Mexico in a free-trade zone, came
into effect at the start of this year. The Clinton administration has often
stated its intention to negotiate free trade agreements with other Latin
American countries, with Chile the first in line - either bilaterally or
through Nafta, but has never specified a schedule.
The US had been unwilling to commit itself to extending Nafta before the
ratification of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement by the US Congress
last week. Trade officials from the three countries believe that unless
agreement is concluded over Chile's accession next year, the process will
become embroiled in the 1996 US presidential election campaign.
They admit that since the disposition of the new members of the US Congress
is still uncertain, Mr Clinton's ability to push through trade legislation
cannot be taken for granted. However, officials see a chance for passage of
a fast track authority, limited to Chile. This would avoid a line-by-line
scrutiny by the US Congress of the accession agreement, which would make
passage all but impossible.
Chile is a small economy compared to the other three - it is a sixth the
size of of Mexico's, itself a 20th of the US - and most of its exports
already enter the US at zero or low tariffs. However, an agreement is seen
as giving further comfort to investors in Chile and reduce the vulnerability
of Chilean exporters to trade disputes with the US. Most importantly, it is
viewed as providing momentum for the Nafta process. 'It's like a bicycle; if
we stop pedalling, everyone will fall off,' said one official.
Officials expect Mr Clinton, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new Mexican president,
and the Canadian prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, to invite Chile's
President Eduardo Frei to join them on the podium to make the announcement.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: West urged to step up aid to eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west needs to do much more to help eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union on the path to sustainable growth, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe says in its latest Economic Bulletin published today.
Although most eastern European economies are showing signs of recovery from
the slump following the revolutions of 1989, output is still falling
throughout the former Soviet Union, the ECE notes.
It predicts a 2 per cent rise in average gross domestic product in eastern
Europe this year but a 16 per cent drop in recorded GDP in Russia and an
average drop of nearer 20 per cent for the Commonwealth of Independent
States as a whole.
The report says the region's long-term growth remains threatened by a dearth
of investment in industry and infrastructure. Official help has been minimal
and private foreign investors hesitant. 'Private investors simply do not see
their role as prime movers in the transition process,' the report says.
The ECE, which groups 55 nations in eastern and western Europe, central Asia
and North America, calls for more and better targeted aid to remove
obstacles to transition to market economies, the basic reason for lack of
foreign investment. The west should also quickly remove remaining barriers
to eastern exports.
Foreign direct investment into eastern Europe was just under Dollars 4bn in
1993 and Dollars 1.3bn in the first half of 1994, the ECE notes. By
comparison, Mexico alone received Dollars 3.3bn in FDI in the first six
months this year, a 25 per cent increase.
At the same time, most transition economies have no access to international
capital markets - the exceptions are Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia
and soon perhaps Poland - and a third have still not qualified for an IMF
programme entitling them to loans by international donors.
As a consequence, eastern Europe is dependent largely on scarce domestic
resources to finance investment, and on exports to pay for needed imports of
capital equipment.
Exports to the west have risen sharply this year, helped by economic
recovery in western Europe and especially Germany, the region's biggest
trading partner.
However, so-called 'sensitive products' such as steel, textiles and
clothing, which account for about half east European exports to the EU, are
still subject to restrict ions.
Full liberalisation of trade with the west would have a big psychological
impact in eastern Europe and among potential foreign investors, the ECE
argues. East European exports to the west have risen by almost 40 per cent
since 1990, but trade in the other direction has jumped by nearly 80 per
cent.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China 'must raise transport spending'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China must spend at least Dollars 111bn on upgrading its over-burdened
transport system by 2000 if it is to maintain its planned export-led
economic growth, according to a report on Chinese infrastructure.
The report, by the east Asia analytical unit of the Australian department of
foreign affairs and trade, predicted that up to 20 per cent, or more than
Dollars 20bn, of transport funding would come from abroad, but warned that
the Chinese authorities would need to improve markedly the investment
climate to attract these funds.
'Accumulated infrastructure bottlenecks pose a threat to future growth in
China,' the report said. 'China's rapid economic growth is today fast
outstripping the country's physical infrastructure in the power,
telecommunications, water and transport sectors.'
In 1992, delays in the delivery of coal supplies from northern mines to
southern power plants and factories cost China an estimated Dollars 70bn.
The World Bank had called for a doubling of capital investment in Chinese
transport to meet demand in 2000.
The report criticised China for not giving enough priority to upgrading and
expanding transport and distribution systems and said bottlenecks 'need to
be recognised as a major constraint on the fulfilment of economic reform
policies and greater prosperity in China'.
'So inefficient and inflexible is the infrastructure that it is slowly
dawning on foreign investors that investing in China is not as profitable as
it might have seemed. Producing goods in potentially the world's biggest
market, where there is no efficient distribution system, does not generate
good returns.'
While China's exports had fuelled annual GNP increases averaging 9-10 per
cent, transport had 'continued to suffer from decades of neglect'.
Investment in transport as a share of GNP declined in the 1980's from 1.7
per cent to 1 per cent by 1990. Total investment in China grew by 37.6 per
cent in 1992 while investment in transport registered growth of only 3.8 per
cent.
Insufficient transport funding was coupled with a 100 per cent increase in
transport volume from 5.47bn tonnes in 1980 to 11bn tonnes in 1993. China's
transport network has the highest freight utilisation rate in the world.
Freight intensity measured in tonnes per unit of GNP is 10 times the level
of India and Brazil while the tonne kilometre of traffic per unit of GNP is
three times higher than the other two countries.
The report said that while China had sharply increased freight and passenger
charges for railways, waterways and roads, the tariffs were still 10-15 per
cent below financial costs. Lack of market pricing mechanisms in the railway
system were a deterrent to foreign investment.
China was also proving slow to grasp the possibilities for investment
offered by build, operate, transfer (BOT) schemes. The report said efforts
to transpose the western BOT model to China had met with resistance because
of 'cultural dissonance' between foreign investors and the Chinese
authorities.
This applied particularly to the internal rate of return (return on
investment calculated over the life of the project), with the Chinese
insisting on low rates. This had deterred investment in critical areas such
as the power sector.
The report recommended that China's transport policy should focus on
construction and upgrading facilities as a means of expanding the overall
transport capacity, and also achieve a 'more efficient' balance among
available transport modes.
It quoted a 1994 study by Peregrine, a Hong Kong brokerage, which estimated
that China would need to invest Dollars 52bn in highways, Dollars 47bn in
railways, Dollars 7bn in ports, Dollars 3bn in airports and Dollars 2bn in
internal waterways by the year 2000.
The Peregrine report said China would need to spend Dollars 121bn on power
generation and telecommunications by 2000. Of this about 20 per cent or
Dollars 47bn would come from foreign investors in the power, transportation
and telecommunications sectors.

FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israel to launch satellite in 1995
</HEADLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spacecom, an Israeli company, has announced plans to launch a Dollars 250m
communications satellite called Amos 1 before the end of next year. The
satellite will provide direct broadcasts into homes.
Amos 1 will immediately compete against the outdated Saudi-backed Arabsat
which is due to be replaced in 1996.
Mr Shlomo Tirosh, Spacecom chief executive officer, said Amos 1 would be
able to relay video, voice and data services from Iran to Libya but would
concentrate on Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gulf.
The new satellite will beam to customers equipped with 60cm dishes and will
operate in the KU band which uses transponders more powerful than the
previous generation of transmitters.
Spacecom will lease segments in Amos's seven transponders to Arab and
Israeli customers as well as international clients such as HBO, the pay-TV
subsidiary of Time Warner, CNN, the Atlanta-based world TV network and Canal
Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, which will directly market their
programmes in the Middle East.
Spacecom is a joint venture between Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), one of
Israel's largest companies, and three other Israeli companies, Gilat
Communications Engineering, C Mer, a telecommunications company and GSSC, a
satellite venture. The lightweight-class satellite will be launched by a
French-made Ariane rocket and will stay in orbit for 10 to 11 years. It was
manufactured by IAI with Deutsche Aerospace and Alcatel.
Amos 1 will also seek telecommunications business and provide data, voice
and oral telephone on the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) market, which
is being used increasingly to provide two-way communications in the US and
Europe.
Mr Noam Fink, Spacecom operating officer, said Gilat would eventually
transfer its services including data broadcasting to Amos 1. Among the
services currently provided by the company are distribution of financial
information and satellite services for paging companies.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Israelis debate peace accords

A political debate about the viability of the existing Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords is under way in Israel as both sides get set to resume talks
in Cairo today on extending Palestinian self-rule to the Israeli-occupied
West Bank.
Several Israeli ministers have expressed reservations about continuing to
implement the so-called Declaration of Principles, which sets out interim
phases leading to a permanent solution by 1998.
The next interim stage, at least nine months behind schedule, seeks Israeli
troop redeployment out of Palestinian population centres by the eve of
national Palestinian elections. Politicians and military experts believe it
is almost impossible to redeploy troops and keep adequate security for the
150 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, home to 120,000 Jewish settlers.
The review of the declaration follows a warning from Israel's senior
military intelligence chief that clear signs exist of 'Lebanonisation' in
the Gaza Strip, with armed militias poised to fight each other.
Some ministers favour regrouping settlements into blocks; others favour
moving directly to talks about a final settlement with Palestinians, to
decide a line of withdrawal including uprooting some settlements; some
favour halting the process until the Palestinian authority can guarantee
better security.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, implied an impending revision
of the process after he said at the weekend that adjustments might have to
be made between the two parties. The cabinet will meet tomorrow in special
session to continue the debate.
Palestine Liberation Organisation officials warned any unilateral change to
the declaration of principles would kill the peace process, and accused
Israel of using delaying tactics. Mr Ahmed Qurie, economics 'minister', said
any change to the principles should be made by negotiation.
At least five Israeli ministers who want to step up the pace of implementing
the accords believe it is impossible to complete the next phase of the
process without relocating at least some settlements.
Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin has so far ruled out quitting a single
settlement ahead of a permanent solution. He has expressed reservations
about the ability of the Israeli military to maintain security if it is
forced to redeploy out of Palestinian centres such as Hebron, Nablus and
Ramallah. The government has begun building roads to ensure settlers can
avoid areas under Palestinian control. Some ministers believe such moves
will not guarantee security.
Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, believes redeployment can be completed
without moving settlements into blocks. Mr Rabin has warned about reopening
the agreement. The government is reluctant to hasten political conflict over
removing Israeli settlements, which it wants to put off until after the 1996
Israeli general elections.

Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, yesterday called on Taiwan's
foreign ministry, the first US cabinet official to do so in 15 years in a
sign of Washington support for the island's democratic reforms and
recognition of its growing economic clout.
Mr Pena visited Mr Fredrick Chien, foreign minister, stepping up bilateral
ties despite previous objections by China. The meeting was significant as
Beijing tolerates economic ties but frowns on those carrying diplomatic
import.
The Clinton administration official is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of
the US-Taiwan Economic Council, a private business organisation. He is to
meet Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, Mr Lien Chan, the premier, and other
officials.
Washington severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing.
The US has since maintained strong but low-profile informal ties with
Taiwan.
On Saturday, Taiwan held elections for provincial governor for the first
time and the first elections in three decades for city mayors. Pressure from
the US Congress, supportive of Taiwan's democratisation, led the
administration to upgrade ties in September, after the first review of
Taiwan policy since 1979.
Mr Pena is only the second US cabinet official to visit Taiwan since 1979.
Ms Carla Hills, then US trade representative, came to the island in 1992 but
did not meet the foreign minister.
Mr Pena yesterday met American Chamber of Commerce members to discuss
infrastructure projects in Taiwan. A high-speed railway, urban mass transit
systems and a fourth nuclear power plant are among projects planned or under
way. He also met Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of Taiwan's planning ministry.
Today he is due to witness a Dollars 226m (Pounds 141m) contract signing by
Westinghouse Electric of the US and Taiwan's environmental protection agency
to build two solid-waste incinerators on the island.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Modernising India still hobbled by old divide: Mass
education and the media have failed to stop a surge in caste-awareness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of 120 demonstrators demanding Indian government recognition for
their caste last month has come as a grim reminder of the grip of caste
consciousness on Indian society.
The victims, including 30 children, were trampled when about 40,000
protestors from the Gowari caste clashed with police in Nagpur, in the
western state of Maharashtra. They had gathered to demand their caste should
be added to an ever-growing list of 'economically- and socially-backward
communities' entitled to preferential access to government jobs and college
places.
Because of the tragedy, they got their way: the next day the Maharashtra
state government acceded to their demands in an effort to quell the Gowaris'
anger.
As India struggles to liberalise and modernise its economy, it is
paradoxically passing regulations which encourage caste-based social
divisions. Neither the growth of mass education, nor the relaying of modern
values through radio and satellite television have been able to stop a
noticeable upsurge in caste-awareness.
The danger is that the government will be distracted by the needs to buy off
more and more caste-based communities to the detriment of social peace and
economic efficiency. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has warned
that without faster economic growth India could be condemned to divisive
arguments about sharing out the pie.
The roots of caste in India go back at least 2,000 years. The common
explanation is that caste differences deepened when pale-skinned Aryans
invaded India from the north and came to dominate darker-skinned local
inhabitants, who were pushed south. A hierarchy emerged with brahmins
(priests) and kshatriyas (warrior-landowners) at the top followed by
vaishyas (merchants) and shudras (craftsmen). This left an underclass of
labourers, who later became known as untouchables. Each level is subdivided
into thousands of local communities, whose members support each other and
tend to inter-marry.
Although rapid urbanisation since independence has caused a blurring of
caste divides in the cities, they persist even at the English-speaking
university-educated pinnacle of society. Every Sunday, the Times of India,
like other newspapers, lists hundreds of marriage advertisements arranged by
caste, in which among the many attributes required of the ideal bride is 'a
wheatish complexion', that is, fair skin.
People from backward castes face invidious choices. They can accept their
divinely-ordained lot, as most have done for generations. Or they can try to
pass themselves off as upper caste in the hope of a good marriage, at the
risk of discovery. Or they can do the opposite - exaggerate the degree of
their backwardness to secure extra points in the complex and
corruption-ridden affirmative action programmes which recognise no less than
six different levels of 'backwardness'.
'Backward caste' protests are almost as old as caste itself, particularly in
the south, where the low caste people are most numerous, forming up to 75
per cent of the Hindu population compared with a national average of about
52 per cent. Also the early arrival of Christian missionaries in the south
helped to promote demands for equality and for positive discrimination.
The cause of the 'backward castes' was taken up in earnest by Dr BR
Ambedkar, an untouchable who rose to be a minister in independent India's
first government. His crusade failed to remove caste prejudice but it did
secure a constitutional commitment for 22.5 per cent of government jobs and
college places to be reserved for untouchables, the lowest of the low.
The quotas have since been expanded beyond the dreams of their original
authors, notably in 1990 when the government awarded special treatment to a
further 27 per cent of the Hindu population - the so-called 'other backward
classes.'
Even though the Supreme Court then capped the total reservation at 50 per
cent, politicians have bent the rules to win support from lower caste
voters. Last year, the southern state of Tamil Nadu set a 69 per cent quota.
Neighbouring Karnataka this year went for 73 per cent.
At the same time, the lower castes have steadily shed their deference for
the ruling Congress (I) party, which has dominated Indian politics since
independence, and organised their own parties. They first seized local
assemblies in the south in the 1960s in Tamil Nadu and are now making
inroads in the north.
Their biggest recent success has been in Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state and cradle of its politics, where a combine of lower caste
parties took power last year.
While these political gains have turned individual low caste leaders into
well-known figures, they have yet to bring much benefit to their
poverty-stricken followers. For example, although the 22.5 per cent quotas
for the lowest castes has been in place since the 1950s, the actual share of
government jobs is less than 10 per cent.
Mr Manuhara Prasad, director of the Ambedkar Foundation, a low caste
lobbying organisation, says: 'We are a ritualistic democracy not a real
democracy.'
So far, no low caste party has succeeded on the national stage. Linguistic
and cultural differences limit their appeal. But their local power has
undermined support for Congress. So Congress leaders have been forced to
strike more and more political deals with lower caste leaders - exchanging
tacit support in state elections for similar backing in general elections.
This has worked up to a point. But the result has been a sharpening of
quarrels over quotas. In a country with a rapidly expanding population and
only modest economic growth, that has proved to be dangerous.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arab world 'in pollution crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East and North Africa are in environmental crisis, with a quarter
of the Arab world living without access to safe water supplies and a fifth
in cities with 'unacceptable' levels of air pollution, Mr Ciao Koch-Weser,
regional vice-president of the World Bank, said yesterday.
He was presenting a 78-page World Bank environmental strategy plan to an
annual meeting of Arab League ministers responsible for the environment. The
bank was ready to double lending for environmental projects in the region to
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) a year, he said.
The report paints a grim picture of pollution in the Arab world, which it
says costs Arab League states Dollars 10bn a year, or about 3 per cent of
their combined gross domestic product, half of which is accounted for by the
health costs of respiratory and other pollution-related diseases.
It says 60m Arabs have no access to safe water, nine Arab states are
annually consuming more than 100 per cent of their renewable water
resources, and 45m people live in cities with air pollution at least five
times World Health Organisation-accepted levels.
The report urges Arab states to increase institutional structures to deal
with environmental problems (only a handful of states have ministries for
the environment, for instance), to cut energy and water subsidies, which it
says amount to Dollars 25bn a year, and substantially to increase
information and awareness about the levels and dangers of pollution. 'This
region is still quite far behind in terms of this awareness,' Mr Koch-Weser
said.
The bank puts the cost of properly addressing such issues at Dollars
6bn-Dollars 8bn for the Arab League states, which it says can be 'paid for
from domestic sources without substantial hardships'. It suggests raised
petrol taxes, pollution charges and more efficient pricing and cost
recovery.
Unchanged policies, the report continues, would result in a 60 per cent rise
in air pollution from vehicles alone and a 50 per cent rise in municipal
solid waste and toxic pollution in the next decade. This would double
present health costs attributable to pollution.
In Cairo alone, according to Mr Bjorn Larsen, a World Bank environmental
economist, lead pollution levels are at present 2-10 micrograms per cubic
metre, against WHO acceptable levels of 0.5-1 mcg per cubic metre.
About 80 per cent of lead pollution comes from vehicle emissions in Cairo,
where the vehicle stock is on average 15 years old and the estimated health
cost of this pollution is estimated at 7 US cents per litre of petrol.

FT  06 DEC 94 / S Korea eases foreign exchange controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government yesterday announced it would ease foreign
exchange controls by the end of the decade. But the measures are more likely
to benefit Korean companies seeking financing abroad than foreign investors
wanting to gain access to Korea's financial markets.
Seoul imposed tough controls on capital flows as a result of a debt crisis
in the 1970s and has maintained them since in an attempt to control the
money supply and reduce inflationary pressure in South Korea.
The finance ministry measures announced yesterday resulted from
recommendations of an advisory committee in September. Korean companies will
be able to raise long-term foreign commercial loans from next year to
finance the purchase of factories and advanced manufacturing equipment or
technology from abroad. Foreign loans usually carry lower interest rates
than domestic loans.
Other remaining restrictions on corporate loans abroad will be removed by
1997.
Korean companies will also be granted more freedom to raise funds on foreign
capital markets through bond or securities issues by 1997. Foreign bond
issues are now subject to a monetary ceiling which totalled Dollars 1.25bn
(Pounds 800m) this year.
The foreign funds inflow is expected to increase from Dollars 6bn in 1995 to
Dollars 20bn by 1999, which will result in an appreciation of the South
Korean currency, according to the finance ministry.
But foreign investors in Korea are expected to be disappointed by the
package. Although the foreign shareholding ceiling in listed Korean
companies will be raised from 12 to 15 per cent next year, the government
has not yet decided whether to abolish the quota by 1999.
The opening of the bond market to foreign investors is expected to be
limited to issues that Korean investors consider unattractive, such as
non-guaranteed bonds issued by small and medium-sized companies beginning in
1996 or 1997.
Limited investments in non-guaranteed bonds by large corporations will be
allowed in 1998 or 1999, but the government has not given a commitment to
the full opening of the bond market.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is likely to
demand further financial liberalisation for foreign investors during talks
on South Korea's scheduled entry into the group in 1996.
Foreign companies will be allowed to issue stocks in South Korea next year
and won-denominated bonds by 1997, although the latter may not be attractive
because of high domestic bond rates.

FT  06 DEC 94 / NZ warned of inflation dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand is now reaping the benefit of the economic reforms introduced
since the mid-1980s, but the challenge for policymakers will be to ensure
that high growth does not lead to a resurgence of inflation or a
deterioration in the balance of payments, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development said yesterday.
Its latest survey predicted growth of 3.9 per cent this year and 3.5 per
cent next, making New Zealand one of the fastest growing OECD economies, the
report said. It was based on data available around mid-year, since when the
economy has appeared to be growing even faster, prompting the Reserve Bank
to tighten monetary conditions, most recently last week.
'The main challenge for policy now appears to be managing the risks
associated with fast economic expansion, while enhancing growth and
employment prospects,' the report said. 'Although the current monetary
policy and labour market arrangements should reduce these risks, they have
yet to be tested in a strong growth environment.'
The task would be made easier if the current improvement in New Zealand's
fiscal situation, which has seen the budget swing into surplus, were used to
redeem government debt, the report added.
'The current speed of budget consolidation being probably the minimum
required to ensure a balanced policy mix, a loosening of the fiscal stance
risks placing undue pressure on monetary policy.
'A strong case can also be made for running budget surpluses in the medium
term,' it said, citing the need to reduce the level of net public debt
relative to gross domestic product, 'an area where new Zealand has performed
badly by international standards.'
New Zealand's high growth rate was finally starting to help reduce
unemployment, but with the rate expected to remain over 8 per cent next
year, there should be enough slack in the labour market to mitigate
pressures on wage rates, the report said.
This should be consistent with inflation staying within the official target
range of zero to 2 per cent, while the current account balance of payments
deficit, which last year held roughly steady at NZDollars 41.65bn (Pounds
16.8bn) should decline.
The OECD said it expected the implementation of the Uruguay Round of world
trade liberalisation to bring a one-off net gain to New Zealand of some 0.6
per cent of gross domestic product, largely as a result of increased world
prices for its beef, dairy, forestry and fishing products.

Rafidah Aziz, the minister of industry and trade, was being investigated
over the allocation to her son-in-law of 1.5m of shares in a listed company.
Mrs Rafidah is a leading figure in Dr Mahathir's cabinet. She has been at
the forefront of Malaysia's drive to attract foreign investment. She has
also been an outspoken critic of some western trading practices and has been
a leading advocate of the idea, inspired by Dr Mahathir, of forming an East

Mr VP Singh, former Indian prime minister, resigned from parliament
yesterday amid what his aides called frustration at political corruption and
a big rift in his centrist Janata Dal party over economic reforms. But the
62-year-old Mr Singh, who led a minority government for 11 months after the
1989 elections, told a news conference he was quitting for personal reasons.
Janata Dal aides said he was frustrated by parliament's handling of a
financial scandal and frequent defections by his group's deputies, some of
whom have crossed over to Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's Congress party.
Mr Singh is regarded as a supporter of sweeping free-market reforms that
began in 1991 under Mr Narasimha Rao. He is seen as having carefully
concealed his objections to the anti-liberalisation stance of his Janata Dal
and Left Front partners.

Indian authorities yesterday stepped up their inquiry into a spy scandal
which erupted last week at the heart of India's premier space organisation
and threatens to jeopardise the country's missile programme. Two top
scientists of the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro)
were arrested by Indian police on suspicion of having leaked vital
information on India's space programme. Detectives will also investigate
Indian press reports hinting at the involvement of two unnamed west European
countries in the espionage.
Bangalore's scientific community has reacted with shock and disbelief at the
arrest on November 30 of Mr Nambi Narayanan, deputy director of Isro's
Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. Mr Chandrasekharan, Indian representative
of Glavcosmos, the Russian space agency, was arrested on November 3 for
allegedly leaking defence secrets to two Maldivian women suspected to be

India successfully launched a polar satellite launch vehicle in October. The
space programme has powered ahead in spite of a setback last year when the
US attempted to stop Moscow from going ahead with a Dollars 250m deal to
provide India with cryogenic engines. The US said the engines could be used
by India to launch missiles and would violate the Missile Technology Control
Regime.

Mr Rafik al-Hariri yesterday withdrew his resignation as Lebanese prime
minister after talks in the Syrian capital Damascus brough a reconciliation
with his rival, Mr Nabih Berri, the parliamentary speaker. Disagreement
between the two led Mr Hariri to offer his resignation on Friday, plunging
Lebanon into political uncertainty.
In Damascus, Syrian officials said Hariri had decided to abandon his
resignation attempt following the intervention of and would resume his work.
The two told Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, who had intervened to seek a
solution, that they would put aside their differences over Lebanon's
post-war reconstruction. They returned to Beirut last night.

<TEXT>
Singapore is to liberalise the resale of public switched telecommunication
services from next month. The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore
(TAS) will allow companies to buy telecommunications services from Singapore
Telecom, which dominates telecom and postal services on the island, and
resell these services to their customers, Mr Leong Keng Thai, TAS policy
director, told a news conference. The aim was to maintain Singapore's
competitiveness. Public switched telecommunications services include
international direct dialling and subscriber trunk dialling calls as well as
data services such as facsimile and electronic mail.
The liberalisation of resale will introduce competition at the retail level
for services currently under Singapore Telecom's exclusive licence, Mr Leong
said. TAS had asked the company to develop a bulk discount scheme under
which any reseller who has annual billings of a minimum SDollars 150,000
(Pounds 65,000) would enjoy discounts ranging from 2 per cent to 8 per cent.
TAS will first license the reselling of telecommunications services by
hotels and service apartments from January 1 next year, he said. Those
enterprises are already resellers of services through commercial
arrangements with Singapore Telecom. TAS, in consultation with the Singapore
Hotel Association will also cut hotel and service apartment phone surcharges
from April 1, 1995, Mr Leong said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Namibia's ruling Swapo party is poised to strengthen its hold on power in
the country's first post-independence elections this week and aims for a big
enough majority to allow it to change the constitution at will, Reuter
reports from Windhoek.
Political parties and analysts say they expect Swapo to be re-elected with
an increased majority in polls tomorrow and on Thursday.
'Opposition parties failed to unite around alternative ideas and policies
during the past four years of democratic rule. They are in disarray,' said
Mr Andre du Pisani, a political scientist at the University of Namibia.
'Swapo could well win two-thirds of the votes, the requirement to
unilaterally change the constitution.'
The former guerrilla movement holds 42 of 72 national assembly seats,
against 21 for the main opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) and
nine for smaller parties.
In 1990, Swapo failed to win the two-thirds majority needed to write the new
constitution alone. The present constitution, negotiated with opposition
parties, restricts President Sam Nujoma from seeking a third term.
'We must go for more than two-thirds majority,' Mr Nujoma said. 'Our slogan
is 72 seats, all for Swapo.' He and his colleagues would change some aspects
of the constitution. 'There are some clauses which favour opposition parties
and we might want to get rid of those clauses,' he said.
Political analysts say the DTA, which helped run Namibia during rule by
South Africa, had since independence in 1990 produced no alternative
policies or fighting spirit.
About 650,000 people are expected to vote in this week's presidential and
parliamentary elections.

<TEXT>
Mr Mario Soares, Portugal's Socialist president, has clashed with the
centre-right government of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva over the issue
of Angola, Portugal's former colony. Mr Fernando Nogueira, defence minister,
tendered his resignation after Mr Soares vetoed the reappointment of General
Narcisco Mendes Dias, air force commander, because of alleged military aid
to the Angolan government. Mr Cavaco Silva rejected the resignation and
officials described the president's veto as 'deeply unjust'. By blocking the
reappointment, Mr Soares is holding Gen Mendes Dias responsible for the
alleged servicing of Angolan government fighter aircraft by a Portuguese
company, damaging Portugal's standing as a neutral arbitrator in Angola's
civil war. Newspapers have published details of the military assistance, but
the government denies knowledge of the service contracts. However, Mr
Nogueira has accepted the resignation of the head of the public-sector
company involved, saying the government should have been informed. The
dispute is the most serious clash between the president and the government
since Mr Soares was elected in 1986 and comes less than a year before the
next general election.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin's security service admitted responsibility
yesterday for a raid on a Russian bank. On Friday about 35 masked gunmen
blocked off Most Bank's headquarters, next door to Russia's White House. A
spokeswoman for the service said the forces were sent to investigate reports
of heavily-armed men in a car belonging to Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, president
of Most Bank. The security service barred entry to the building and searched
cars belonging to the bank. Six drivers and security guards from Most Bank
were detained, but later released. Mr Gusinsky said he would take legal
action against the security service for 'overstepping the bounds of power'.
A bank spokesman added: 'They knew perfectly well that our guards received
permission to carry arms on this road one year ago.'

Pressure mounted on rebel Chechnya yesterday as the Russian defence
minister, General Pavel Grachev, admitted that aircraft which bombed the
breakaway region's capital last week, killing nine people, were Russian.
Moscow had previously denied that its aircraft were involved.
Gen Grachev and two other top security officials yesterday left Moscow for
the southern region neighbouring Chechnya. Gen Grachev, interior minister
Viktor Yerin and Mr Sergei Stepashin, head of the counter-intelligence
service, flew to Mozdok in North Ossetia for a tour of inspection of the
Russian soldiers and military hardware being amassed around Chechnya's
borders. Gen Grachev was reported last night to be ready for negotiations
with General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, as early as today. He
was quoted as saying that a decision on the future of Chechnya would be made
by Thursday. However, Gen Dudayev told the official Russian news agency,
Tass, that he remained in favour of 'negotiations on an equal basis with the
Russian leadership' - an apparent demand to involve President Boris Yeltsin
in the talks. This has already been ruled out by Mr Yeltsin's aides. There
are growing demands in Moscow for hostilities to be put on hold in favour of
negotiations. The Russian military and the secret services are being blamed
for precipitating an abortive attack by the Chechen opposition on the
capital Grozny 10 days ago - more than 20 Russian servicemen were taken
prisoner in the action.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Major says Bosnia war could spread
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said yesterday that a UN withdrawal
from former Yugoslavia would have tragic consequences, including the
probable spread of the conflict beyond the borders of Bosnia.
At the same time, British officials accompanying the prime minister to the
European security summit in Budapest said a pull-out might become inevitable
within a few weeks' time, because of the worsening conditions in the war
zone.
'There will a tragedy if the situation on the ground makes it impossible for
Unprofor (the UN protection force) to carry out its mandate and forces it to
withdraw,' Mr Major told fellow heads of government from more than 50
nations of Europe and North America.
British officials said they took some comfort from the fact that the
presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia had all, over the past 48 hours,
assured the UK of their continued support for the UN's presence in the
conflict zone.
The officials also reported signs of progress towards agreement on a
Bosnia-wide ceasefire, seen as vitally necessary if a UN pull-out is to be
averted.
At present, the Bosnian Serbs are pressing for an indefinite ceasefire while
the Moslem-led government prefers a time limit on any truce. US president
Bill Clinton appealed to the Bosnian Serbs to desist from aggression and
enter negotiations on the basis of the internationally agreed peace plan.
'Settle your differences at the negotiating table, not the battlefield,' he
said in Budapest, reflecting Washington's new emphasis on a diplomatic
approach to settling the Bosnian crisis.
Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic struck a militant tone in his speech to
the summit, denouncing the failure of all international organisations to
deal with the conflict in his country and the Bosnian Serb assault on the
northern enclave of Bihac.
'The whole of the international community, embodied in the UN and the mighty
Nato, cannot save one endangered city,' he said. He said the situation in
Bosnia reflected the 'hesitation, incompetence and sometimes ill will' of
the west, and denounced Russia for supporting the Serbs at the UN. He said
the result of the war would be a 'discredited UN, a ruined Nato and
demoralised Europeans'.
The Bosnian leader said Paris and London had been described as 'Serbia's
protectors' because they had prevented all attempts to counter Serb
aggression against his country. 'No one can force our 150,000 soldiers to
hand over their weapons,' he added, calling the conflict a 'war of
liberation' which would not be lost. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
said the Bosnian leader had adopted a more conciliatory stance in private.
'I've just had the most constructive discussion I have ever had with
President Izetbegovic,' he told BBC radio. Mr Hurd said he and his French
counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, had on Sunday 'rammed home' to Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic that he must do his utmost to ensure that the
UN could continue to operate.
'Otherwise he will find that the UN will be forced to withdraw,' he added.

Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday unveiled a programme

the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism. Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the SPD leader, said the grassroots would be strengthened through creating
local offices, co-operation with the trade unions, more travel by the
federal leadership to the east and a training programme for local
politicians. In October's federal elections, the SPD polled 31.9 per cent of
the vote in the east, compared with 37.7 per cent in the west.

The German government is expected to decide tomorrow how and when it will
respond to a request from Nato for German Tornado fighter-bombers to back up
airstrikes in Bosnia, officials said yesterday.
But the Nato request, made last week, has revived sharp divisions within the
country's political establishment about what military role Germany should
and can play following the end of the cold war and the unification of east
and west Germany in 1990.
It has also rekindled memories of the second world war when Germany backed
the fascist, or Ustasha regime in Croatia, and bombed Belgrade, the capital
of Serbia.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, will discuss the request with Mr
Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign
minister.
But officials yesterday said Mr Kohl's room for manoeuvre was limited
because of the government's slim parliamentary majority as well as
opposition within the cabinet to sending the Tornados. A spokesman for the
Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner in the governing coalition, and
which holds the foreign ministry portfolio, said it was 'highly sceptical'
that either the government or the Bundestag would ever agree to send the
Tornados to fly patrols over Bosnia.
In contrast to Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which runs the
defence ministry, the FDP has staunchly opposed any active military role for
Germany outside Nato territory.
Mr Karsten Voigt, foreign policy spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD), yesterday described the entire discussion as highly
'irresponsible', given the political and military risks.
However, several commentators, including Mr Walther Stutzle, the military
expert and editor-in-chief of Tagesspiegel, said yesterday: 'Germany
apparently still believes it can take time to recover domestically (from
unification) and overlooks the fact that a giant mess is brewing on its
doorstep.' Mr Robert Hetkamper, a commentator for ARD state television said:
'If Germany refuses . . . that could drive a deeper wedge in the alliance.'
Nato asked Germany for the Tornados because, apart from the US, it is the
only Nato country which has fighter-bombers equipped with Electronic Combat
Reconnaissance devices, or ECRs. This military technology can neutralise
surface-to-air missile launchers by jamming their radar systems.
But Nato diplomats yesterday said the request was made also in the knowledge
that constitutionally Germany can now send troops out of Nato territory
following a ruling by the constitutional court last July.
Since then, German pilots have manned the Advanced Early Warning Aircraft,
or Awacs, which have monitored the no-fly zone over Bosnia.

FT  06 DEC 94 / CIS sends out deadly economic signals: High inflation and
falling output are rampant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States continue to
experience high inflation and falling production - the deadly mix of signals
which point to incomplete economic reforms, or reforms barely attempted.
Probably dragged up by Russia's growing inflation in the autumn, inflation
jumped sharply in October in nearly all the CIS states (the former Soviet
republics except the three Baltic countries).
According to figures from the CIS statistical committee reported by
Interfax, consumer price rises in October over September showed Georgia, one
of the most desperate of the former Soviet states, suffering the highest
price inflation, at 36.3 per cent - with the neighbouring Caucasian state of
Azerbaijan in second place with 28.3 per cent, Belarus at 25.4 per cent and
Kazakhstan at 24.8 per cent.
Russia, for which later figures are available, had inflation of just over 14
per cent in November, compared with 15 per cent in October - a reduction
which was smaller than forecast.
The one country again to show growth in these figures was Armenia, the
smallest of the three former Caucasian Soviet republics and the one most
impoverished by the war with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno
Karabakh. Its growth in gross domestic product of 1 per cent is, however,
from an industrial base reduced to less than half of its Soviet-era
capacity.
In most other states the production drops are in the order of 20-plus per
cent for the 10 months of January to October compared with the same period
in the previous year.
These figures are likely to be exaggerated, possibly by large amounts -
since the Soviet era tendency was to exaggerate output to express conformity
with the plan while the present tendency is to express low output to avoid
taxes.
However, there is little doubt that the official figures measure a trend
which remains downwards. Georgia is again the worst hit, with its already
low level of industrial output down by a measured 42 per cent (figures
January to September) - followed by Moldova, with industrial output down
31.1 per cent.
The basic distortion in the figures is because of the Soviet era habit of
measuring only physical output. They thus do not capture, or at best
inadequately reflect, the rise in services and trading. However, this rise
has been most marked in Russia. In other ex-Soviet states, the figures of
decline are probably closer to reality.

Greece's yearly inflation rate fell to 10.3 per cent in October, from 11.0
per cent the previous month, according to statistics service figures
published yesterday. Monthly consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in November
because of higher prices for food, clothes and consumer durables. The
government no longer expects to reach its target of single-digit inflation
by December but last month's decline, together with delays in raising
administered prices, makes it likely inflation can be held below 11 per cent
this year, against 12.1 per cent in 1993. Greece's inflation rate is still
more than three times the EU average.

European Union finance ministers yesterday mounted a challenge to Mr Jacques
Delors, the outgoing Commission president, by refusing to endorse the use of
additional borrowed funds to pay for multi-million-Ecu cross-frontier
transport projects.
Mr Delors has argued that without extra capital raised by the Union, most of
the 14 ambitious infrastructure projects may not get off the ground. But
ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday agreed that funding for each project
should be tackled on a case-by-case basis using only private finance,
national exchequers, loans from the European Investment Bank and designated
EU funds. The ministers' recommendations will be presented to the Essen
heads of state summit later this week.

Italian local elections over the weekend increased the fragility of the
right-wing government and turned the spotlight on the possibility of a
centre-left coalition. Centre-left opposition alliances won the mayoral
races in the run-off for four out of six regional capitals, two of the
regional councils and a majority of the small local administrations being
contested. Prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement
showed signs of losing momentum and in the south the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance surprised every commentator by the poor performance in
its heartland.

France looks set to ban corporate contributions to political parties after
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said last night he had overcome his
'hesitations' about such a sweeping move to clean up French politics. He
said he would put to the National Assembly a four-point plan to stop
companies bankrolling political parties, to reduce the ceiling on spending
in next year's presidential election by 30 per cent, to introduce an audit
of politicians' personal wealth, and to improve fairness and transparency in
the award of public contracts.
Mr Balladur acknowledged that he had initially hesitated about a total ban
on corporate campaign contributions, out of concern that this would put
political parties into the hands of the state, which since 1990 has financed
a portion of their activities. But he had previously suggested a three-year
experimental freeze on companies giving to political campaigns.
Mr Balladur, who has lost three ministers to corruption charges in recent
months, cannot afford to appear lax on this issue in the run-up to the
presidential election. The National Assembly is to start debating reform on
Friday, with its conservative majority now clearly, like its Socialist and
Communist opposition, in favour of separating business and politics.

FT  06 DEC 94 / EU ministers agree on loan for Ukraine: Ecu85m should pave
way for balance of payments aid

<TEXT>
EU finance ministers yesterday sent a belated signal of support for the
reformist government in Ukraine with an agreement in principle to provide an
Ecu85m (Pounds 67m) loan.
The EU loan should pave the way for an international rescue plan to fill the
looming Dollars 1bn (Pounds 610m) gap in Ukraine's fourth quarter balance of
payments, which threatened to re-ignite inflation and cut short energy
imports this winter.
The compromise in Brussels yesterday means the Ecu85m loan will be disbursed
only after the International Monetary Fund completes negotiations on a
Dollars 1.5bn standby loan to support the reform programme.
It is also tied to closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, though Ukraine's
promise to meet its debt arrears means that Ecu400m of EU should be released
soon to help pay for the Kiev government's nuclear clean-up.
The US and Germany lobbied hard for a deal in Brussels, arguing it was vital
to bolster President Leonid Kuchma, a central planner turned economic
reformer who campaigned for signing the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty
France and the UK - which had previously held up an accord - fell into line
after their partners agreed to impose tighter conditions on future EU
macro-economic aid to third countries, with Ukraine being treated as an
exceptional case.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, told colleagues that
the EU should not turn itself into a 'shadow IMF'. He called for clearer
rules on EU lending to distressed countries, and a study is expected to be
produced next year.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister who chaired yesterday's meeting,
overcame French reservations by forging a compromise on aid to Algeria.
Ministers agreed with the Commission to provide a maximum Ecu200m to be
released in two tranches to support structural reform in the north African
state.
Mr Waigel heralded the agreement as an important statement of European
support for Mr Kuchma, who had embarked on a 'courageous and ambitious'
reform programme.
The decision on Ukraine yesterday must still go through the European
parliament, and it leaves open the question of how much the EU will be ready
to contribute next year to cope with expected balance of payments
difficulties. But in the short term, it unlocks further funds from the US
and other Group of Seven industrialised nations, including Japan. The US has
already offered around Dollars 100m, with Canada offering Dollars 25m.
Ministers also agreed to provide macro-economic aid of up to Ecu130m for
Slovakia, to be released in two tranches to help with reform.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Door to 1997 single currency left open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EU finance ministers yesterday left open the door for a move to a single
European currency in 1997 with a carefully-couched endorsement of the
current wide fluctuation bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The 1997 date for the creation of a monetary union in Europe is still viewed
as a remote possibility only, but the decision in Brussels yesterday
underlined political commitment to the Emu project.
The 15 per cent fluctuation bands were introduced as a temporary measure
after the currency crisis in 1992-93 which forced several devaluations and
the departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM. The wider bands have so
far helped to deter similar speculative assaults.
In a joint statement yesterday, EU finance ministers studiously avoided
declaring that the present arrangements were 'normal'. One of the key
provisions of the Maastricht treaty is that a currency seeking to join Emu
must have been inside its so-called normal bands for at least two years.
Instead, ministers agreed to endorse an opinion on the wide bands drawn up
by the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the future European
central bank which is supposed to supervise the single currency.
The EMI noted that the wider bands had prevented big exchange rate
depreciations and excessive exchange rate intervention with their
potentially inflationary consequences. 'In the light of this experience and
in the current circumstances, the EMI council considers it advisable to
maintain the present arrangements.'
Mr Waigel resolutely refused to say whether the 15 per cent bands would
continue right up to the point of a decision on whether to move to a single
currency, or whether ministers would support a progressive narrowing of the
bands.
Instead, he reaffirmed the need for price stability and sound public
finances which would avoid exchange rate stability. The August 1993 decision
to suspend intervention obligations and introduce 15 per cent fluctuation
bands had succeeded, he said.
The other important criteria for moving to a single currency are that
government budget deficits fall to 3 per cent or less of gross domestic
product, and that government debt falls consistently towards a target of 60
per cent of GDP.
Though 1997 remains a highly ambitious target, many observers are
reassessing the possibility of a move by a privileged few currencies led by
the D-Mark to monetary union in 1999. However, public opinion in France,
Germany and the UK among the main European economies remains divided.
The European Commission pressed for a statement on the wide bands to keep
hopes alive that the 1997 date for Emu could be met, arguing that it was
important not weaken the provisions of the Maastricht treaty.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Ukraine wins extensive guarantees for renouncing nuclear
power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine said last night it had won extensive guarantees from the US, Russia
and Britain in return for renouncing any aspiration to be a nuclear power
under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally
joined yesterday at the CSCE talks in Budapest. The accession of Ukraine to
the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for the Start-1
treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former Soviet nuclear
warheads, to enter into force. Under the deal the US, Russia and Britain
pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, not to use or threaten force against
Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if it faced nuclear
aggression. In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of
Russian commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from
infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion.

France's opposition Socialist party yesterday refused to be co-opted into
accepting anti-corruption reforms by the prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, in advance of a parliamentary debate on the issue on Friday. The
opposition wants to remain free to insist during the parliamentary debate
that the conservative government reverse its easing of anti-corruption
measures passed by its Socialist predecessor.

FT  06 DEC 94 / EBRD may finance Slovak N-plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are to
meet in London today to discuss financing a nuclear power plant in Slovakia.
A final decision  - due after 70 days of consultation  - is set to be one of
the most difficult in the bank's short history.
If the bank decides to provide 30 per cent of the DM1.3bn (Pounds 530m)
needed to complete two partly-built reactors at Mochovce in Slovakia it
would be the first time a multilateral development bank had agreed to
finance a new nuclear plant. Previous development funding has concentrated
on essential safety work at existing plants in eastern Europe.
The sensitivity of the project  - a joint venture involving Electricite de
France, France's state-owned generator, and Slovensky Energeticky, the
Slovak generator  - has encouraged the EBRD to launch a public participation
process, and thus avoid any charges of lack of consultation. Today's meeting
will be followed on Thursday by the publication of an environmental audit,
part of the safety review, and a 'least-cost' analysis which compares
Mochovce, a Soviet-designed pressurised water reactor, with conventional
gas-fired plants.
Opposition to the WWER 440/213 Soviet-designed pressurised water reactors is
based on doubts about their safety and their economic viability. Environment
groups such as Greenpeace and Global 2000 believe that more should be done
to increase energy efficiency and that the cost of gas, supplied by Russia,
is being overestimated. These groups presented a petition of over 100,000
names, mostly Austrian, to the bank yesterday.
Mr Heiner Luschin, the Austrian EBRD director, questions the safety costs of
the project and is uneasy at the EBRD's involvement. '(The situation where)
financial support is provided for highly subsidised electricity through an
international organisation supposed to promote open-market economies is one
I find very difficult to understand,' he says. Mochovce lies around 120km
east of Bratislava and 160km from Vienna.
Mr Thierry Baudon, the bank's deputy vice president, believes support for
Mochovce is a difficult but necessary decision. Support for Mochovce can be
'traded' for Slovak guarantees to close an older, more dangerous,
pressurised water nuclear plant at Bohunice, he says. 'You have got to ask
why we are going through this nightmare when we could have cooked the
figures to show that gas was more profitable. . . but we want to close
Bohunice. . . and we would have had no leverage to close it down (without
Mochovce).'
Mr Baudon recognises that the consequences of the loan may be difficult,
however. 'On economic, environmental and safety grounds I deeply believe
that this is the right thing,' he says. 'Whether we should do it for the
good of our image is a completely different matter.'
Others feel less confident about the economic outlook for Mochovce. A study
of two partially-built 44O/213s in east Germany three years ago concluded
that DM2bn would be needed to bring each unit up to acceptable safety
standards. The government decided this cost could not be justified and the
plant was never completed.
Mochovce is more than 80 per cent complete but has been mothballed for three
years. Only a small proportion of the funds required to complete the plant
would be spent on construction. The rest would be allocated to upgrading the
reactors to acceptable safety levels.

FT  06 DEC 94 / US bank agrees to derivatives controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the New York based bank, has agreed to a Federal Reserve
direction to impose tighter controls on parts of its derivatives business.
The Fed move, in the form of a so-called 'written agreement', is thought to
be the most severe regulatory action taken against a big US commercial bank.
It follows several big, well-publicised losses on derivatives in the US over
the past year by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Metallgesellschaft,
and by investors such as Piper Jaffray.
Although Wall Street has blamed the losses on the institutions themselves,
they have raised concerns in some regulatory quarters about the way in which
complex financial instruments are sold to supposedly sophisticated buyers.
Under the deal with the Fed, Bankers Trust said it would adopt new
procedures for controlling its leveraged derivative operations, financial
instruments that have been at the centre of two lawsuits brought against the
bank this year.
The value of these instruments moves disproportionately with movements in
underlying securities or markets, making them among the most volatile and
complex of financial instruments.
Mr Charles Sanford, the bank's chairman, sought to play down the
significance of the accord with regulators. Leveraged derivatives, he said,
accounted for less than 5 per cent of the bank's revenues. He said Bankers
Trust had already taken steps itself to counter any shortcomings in its
controls.
A Fed official said regulators would use the agreement to keep a close watch
on Bankers Trust's leveraged derivatives business.
He said the action signalled the central bank's intention to keep a close
watch on the derivatives activities of other US banks. 'You can read this as
a red alert for other players,' he said.
Bankers Trust last month agreed to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8.5m) settlement of
one dispute over leveraged derivatives it sold to Gibson Greetings, a US
greetings card company. The bank is still fighting a legal action brought by
Procter &amp; Gamble, which also lost money on a Bankers Trust instrument when
US interest rates started to rise this year.
The regulatory action requires Bankers Trust to establish better controls
over how it assesses the appropriateness of particular derivatives for
particular customers; how it markets the instruments; the information it
provides on the value of the instruments as underlying markets move; and the
way it supervises the business overall. The bank said it had largely put the
changes into effect already.
The bank is also required to set up a special board-level committee to
monitor compliance with the Fed agreement, improve its training programme
for sales staff and strengthen its internal auditing.
The 'written agreement' is one of the strongest forms of administrative
enforcement action available to US bank regulators.
Bankers Trust is believed to be under pressure to agree similar actions with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Yeltsin denounces Nato plans to expand eastwards: Russian
leader warns Europe could slide from cold war to 'cold peace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, in a tough speech to a summit on European security,
yesterday denounced Nato's plans to expand into eastern Europe and warned
that the continent could slide from a cold war into a 'cold peace'.
In one of the most hard-hitting messages from Moscow to an international
forum since the fall of communism, Mr Yeltsin said Russia was worried by
Nato's enlargement programme, laid out in Brussels last week, and poured
scorn on the alliance's pledge to 'export stability eastwards'.
The Russian leader's message was in sharp contrast to that of US president
Bill Clinton who, in a speech immediately beforehand, had hailed Nato as the
bedrock of security in Europe, and emphasised that no country could exercise
a veto on its expansion.
'If Nato does expand, so will security for all European states, for it is
not an aggressive but a defensive organisation,' Mr Clinton said.
Later, a senior US official said Mr Yeltsin had misrepresented western
intentions.
The Russian leader called repeatedly for the Commonwealth of Independent
States - the group of 12 ex-Soviet republics of which Russia is by far the
strongest member - to be recognised as an international organisation that
could guarantee security in the former Soviet Union.
The proposal - effectively a demand for the recognition of a Russian sphere
of influence - was made at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, which groups 53 nations, including the US, Canada, most European
countries and the ex-Soviet republics. Mr Yeltsin described Russia as the
'eastern buttress' of European security and stability.
'Europe, which has not yet discarded the legacy of the cold war, risks
plunging into cold peace,' he told the meeting. 'Russia respects the
interests of all participants of the CSCE, and it expects its own interests
to be taken into account.'
In an implicit rejection of the Russian demand for supremacy within the
former Soviet Union, both President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany spoke out against the notion that powerful countries could impose
their will over smaller neighbours. Mr Clinton called for the CSCE to adopt
rules 'which can guard against the assertion of hegemony or spheres of
influence'.
Mr Yeltsin said Nato was engaged in a difficult search for a new role in the
aftermath of the cold war. 'It is important that this search should avoid
creating poles of division, and that it brings European unity closer,' he
added.
Moscow has repeatedly warned against Nato's expansion plans, under which
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would join the
organisation. Russia, however, would be excluded.
Mr Yeltsin said: 'We hear the explanation that this is an 'expansion of
stability' in case of an undesirable turn of events in Russia. But, if for
that reason they want to push the limits of Nato's responsibility to the
borders of Russia, I will say one thing - it is too early to bury democracy
in Russia.'
Commenting, the US official said: 'The outside world is not giving up on
democracy in Russia . . . and the process of Nato expansion is not rushing
headlong anywhere.'
Mr Yeltsin's words were a blow to US hopes that Nato could admit new members
soon without upsetting Russia. The alliance agreed last week to a US plan
for an expansion procedure. Despite Mr Yeltsin's harsh public words, he had
a cordial 40-minute meeting with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Portillo to oppose German move on EU labour standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, will today oppose an attempt
by the German government to pass a resolution strengthening minimum labour
standards for the European Union.
His stance seems certain to isolate him from his ministerial colleagues at
the social affairs council meeting in Brussels. Mr Portillo fears the German
proposal may usher in a new wave of social regulations damaging to European
business, and bring the UK government into further conflict with other
member states.
The UK government has resisted European Commission attempts to strengthen
workers' rights because it believes they add to labour costs and undermine
competitiveness.
While the German motion would not enjoy any legal force, its approval by the
ministers would increase the pressure on Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs
commissioner, to produce a new programme of social directives mainly to
improve worker rights.
Until recently, Mr Flynn appeared to have ruled out any further legislation,
emphasising the need to concentrate on tackling unemployment and enforcing
existing social directives in member states.
But a number of EU countries, including Germany, as well as the European
parliament and several European trade unions, are pressing the Commission to
extend the EU's existing binding and enforceable minimum labour standards.
Mr Flynn appears to have changed his position and has now promised to draw
up a new agenda of social legislation.
Today's 10-point German resolution would cover:
Equality of treatment for part-time workers and those on fixed-term
contracts;
Prohibition of discrimination of workers who exercise their rights to
complain or take legal action or refuse to perform unlawful tasks;
The right of a worker to be heard in internal company matters;
Protection of the privacy of workers, in particular over the collection,
processing and transmission of data;
Adequate protection for workers against dismissal;
No sex discrimination against workers;
The right to 'an appropriate continued' payment of wages on holiday and
during illness;
Administrative co-operation in cross-border temporary employment;
The integration of disabled people into working life;
The establishment of impartial and free counselling and job placement
services.
Mr Portillo is also expected to veto the draft EU directives on part-time
and fixed-contract work. The other member states would then be likely to use
the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty to pass the measures.

<TEXT>
US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is expected to resign soon,
administration sources said, in what would be a blow to President Bill
Clinton as he deals with a Republican-run Congress. Mr Bentsen, 73, a former
Democratic senator from Texas, called the reports premature but stopped
short of denying them outright. Robert Rubin, a former Wall Street executive
who heads the White House's national economic council, is a leading
candidate to replace Mr Bentsen.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Major pushes for new law on executive pay awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent, and NORMA COHEN, Investments
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies could be forced to secure shareholder approval for executive
salary awards under proposals to be considered by a cabinet committee next
week.
Mr John Major is pushing strongly for a change in the law to make salary
packages paid by public companies subject to an affirmative vote by
shareholders at annual meetings.
The proposal would dramatically strengthen shareholders' rarely used powers
to question directors at annual meetings.
The plan emerged from an ad hoc meeting of senior ministers convened by Mr
David Hunt, the cabinet troubleshooter, after Mr Major condemned
'unjustified' pay rises in the Commons.
The prime minister believes it would allay public anger about big pay rises
such as the 75 per cent awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, chief
executive of British Gas.
However, Mr Hunt referred the issue to the cabinet's industrial and consumer
affairs committee, EDI, after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, made clear his opposition.
Mr Heseltine argued that stronger shareholder powers would make it difficult
for UK companies to recruit world-class foreign executives, who often demand
lucrative salary packages as compensation for relocation.
He told Mr Hunt that the pool of talent available to companies would be
reduced, damaging the competitiveness of British industry, if directors knew
their packages would be subject to open debate and possible rejection.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, supports Mr Major's drive for change, partly
because of reservations about the willingness of institutional investors to
support attempts to supervise salary packages under the existing law.
The proposed change would probably require primary legislation, but the
government's small programme of 12 bills in the present parliamentary
session means that it could be brought in quickly.
The practical implications of the proposed change, including the need for
legislation, are being explored by an interdepartmental working party of
Treasury and DTI officials that will report to EDI next week.
However, the working party is being led by Mr Heseltine's officials,
suggesting that the case against the proposals is likely to be put strongly
to ministers.
Institutional fund managers dismissed Mr Heseltine's fears about
competitiveness. 'It is not the absolute level of executive pay that
shareholders object to. It is when you see shareholder wealth being
dissipated by management,' one said.
Others said there were better ways of curbing excessive pay, such as forcing
companies to make executive contracts easily available to shareholders. 'If
they were simply to go for proper disclosure, that would help a lot,' one
said.
The government could also set limits on favourable tax treatment for share
option schemes or pension arrangements which failed to meet guidelines
recommended by the UK's leading shareholder groups.

The group, which has had a patchy trading record over the last 10 years, has
suffered from the fact that 15 shareholders held more than 90 per cent of
the shares.
'Its status as a public company was an anomaly,' said Mr Christopher
Burnett, chairman since October 1991.
A new company, known as Chiefco, has been set up to buy Vivat. On Friday, it
claimed to have bought, or to have irrevocable undertakings on, at least 69
per cent of the shares. It is offering 65p a share cash, a premium of 71 per
cent over the closing price on Decem-ber 1.
Chiefco is owned by NatWest Ventures, USI Holdings, Phoenix Fund Managers
and Mr Heidi Djilani, chairman of Lee Cooper Tunisie.
USI Holdings is part of the Singapore based Wing Tai clothing group and has
swapped its 29.1 per cent stake in Vivat for a similar stake in Chiefco.
CNM, a French holding company, has sold its 28.1 per cent stake to Chiefco.
Mr William Jackson of NatWest Ventures said the company's main problem had
been the lack of liquidity in its shares. 'Whatever the management does -
good or bad - the shares do nothing.'
In the last three years the shares, which closed at 65p on Friday, have
traded between 23p and 45p.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Another milestone for Canadian
bank - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Canada will report fiscal 1994 earnings on Tuesday, and is
expected to be the first Canadian financial institution to post annual
profits of more than CDollars 1bn (USDollars 727m). Royal's results are
likely to follow the same pattern of declining loan losses, stronger credit
demand and rising income from fee-related businesses reported by other
Canadian banks over the past two weeks. Another common theme is that the
year ahead will probably be even more profitable as business activity in
North America continues to quicken. Royal is passing another milestone, with
Allan Taylor, its chief executive, retiring to make way for the more
assertive (and considerably younger) John Cleghorn.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Poll gives Delors a wider lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors yesterday widened his lead over other potential French
presidential candidates in an opinion poll that coincided with strong
denials by the Balladur government of reports that it is trying to help Mr
Bernard Tapie challenge the outgoing European Commission president for the
left-wing vote. The Ifop poll in the Journal du Dimanche showed that Mr
Delors, with 23 per cent support, was the preferred presidential candidate
over 13 others, led by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur with 17 per cent and
followed by Mr Jacques Chirac with 11 per cent. Mr Delors has promised to
announce by Christmas whether he will run for president.
With 6 per cent in yesterday's Ifop poll, Mr Tapie still runs fourth among
presidential preferences. But some pundits believe that the maverick Mr
Tapie could eat into Mr Delors' electoral base if he too, were to run for
the presidency, and some newspapers suggested late last week that this is
just what Mr Balladur is seeking to arrange by keeping Mr Tapie out of the
bankruptcy court, to the annoyance of the justice ministry.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Berlusconi's fans rally in cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of supporters of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, took to the streets of Italy's largest cities over the weekend, as
anti-corruption magistrates kept up the pressure on his business associates.
'This is a demonstration in support of Berlusconi, a man who has saved the
country,' Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and a close friend of Mr
Berlusconi, told a rally of more than 20,000 supporters in Rome yesterday.
The rallies were co-ordinated by the local 'clubs' of Forza Italia, the
political movement founded by Mr Berlusconi this year. They were prompted by
Milan magistrates' decision two weeks ago to invite him in for questioning
about alleged bribery of tax police by his Fininvest business empire.
Yesterday, Mr Jas Gawronski, the prime minister's spokesman, said Mr
Berlusconi would be unable to meet the magistrates before December 13
because of international commitments.
The delay will give Mr Berlusconi more time to build on the goodwill
generated last week when trade unions cancelled a general strike after
concessions on the 1995 budget and pensions reform.
The Northern League, the most volatile of Mr Berlusconi's government allies,
was not involved in the rallies and was attacked by many demonstrators for
not backing him wholeheartedly. The results of a second round of mayoral
elections yesterday could see Forza Italia punished for its uncomfortable
alliance with the League in northern cities such as Brescia and Sondrio,
where its candidates were lagging after the first round.

MONDAY 5
Budapest security summit
Presidents Bill Clinton of the US and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, and Boutros
Boutros Ghali (left), secretary-general of the United Nations, are among
more than 50 world leaders attending the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe summit in Budapest (to Dec 6).
The session, the culmination of a two-month review conference, is due to
focus on the organisation's future.
Russia is keen to strengthen the CSCE, which includes all European and
Commonwealth of Independent states as well as the US and Canada. However,
divisions among Nato members over Bosnia are likely to overshadow
proceedings.
European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels ahead of the European
Council summit in Essen on Friday and Saturday. Germany, which holds the
rotating EU presidency, will push hard for agreement on Ecu85m (Dollars
108m) balance of payments assistance to Ukraine.
Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, will appeal
for support for funding trans-
European networks to improve transport and energy infrastructure. Ministers
are also likely to review currency stability since last year's crisis in the
exchange rate mechanism.
Olympian task:
Greece's socialist government is due to propose controversial legislation on
overhauling Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. A survival plan
agreed with the European Union includes a Dr491bn (Dollars 2bn) debt
write-off, management restructuring and early retirement for at least 1,500
employees. Pilots' privileges, including a day off on their birthdays, are
to be curtailed.
Global phones: The International Marine Satellite Organisation, Inmarsat,
opens a five-day meeting in London to discuss whether it should set up a
global mobile phone network.
Safety at sea: The International Maritime Organisation's Maritime Safety
Committee meets in London to review shipping safety standards in the light
of recent accidents (to Dec 9).
FT Survey: Thailand.
Holidays: Thailand.
TUESDAY 6
Ireland awaits a premier
Bertie Ahern, leader of the Fianna Fail party, will be hoping to be voted
Ireland's prime minister by parliament when it reconvenes today.
Installation of a prime minister should give fresh impetus to the Northern
Ireland peace process.
East European economies face a brighter future, according to a report out
today from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. However,
output is still falling in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
John Major's UK government faces another testing vote in parliament, this
time on a procedural motion which would allow the opposition Labour party to
challenge the imposition of VAT on domestic heating fuel. The government,
technically in a minority after the suspension of some members, could lose,
but will probably scrape home.
UK economic policy: Last week's UK Budget comes under the scrutiny of the
cross-party House of Commons treasury and civil service committee. MPs will
question Treasury officials on expenditure and taxation, fiscal and monetary
policy in preparation for meetings next week with Jonathan Aitken, the chief
secretary, and Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Saleroom: Christie's in New York is to auction a Maltese Falcon statuette
used as a prop in the 1941 film of the same name, based on Dashiell
Hammett's novel and starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor.
The statuette, one of two made for the film, is expected to raise between
Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 50,000. It is being sold by the estate of actor
William Conrad, star of the 1970s television detective series Cannon, who
received it as a gift from Warner Bros studio chief Jack Warner in the
1960s. The other falcon is owned by a Beverly Hills dentist.
Blue heaven: The International Whaling Commission's whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic is due to come into effect. It covers the feeding grounds of 90
per cent of the world's whale species, including blue, sperm and sei, and
effectively confines whale hunting to part of the Atlantic.
Rugby: The Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge is played at
Twickenham in London.
FT Surveys: Swiss Banking and Japanese Industry.
Holidays: Finland (Independence Day), Spain (Constitution Day).
WEDNESDAY 7
Namibia goes to the polls
Namibians begin two days of voting in their first elections since
independence in 1990. Incumbent president Sam Nujoma's South West African
People's Organisation is expected to win comfortably, despite allegations of
corruption from the main opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance. Were
Swapo to garner a two-thirds majority, it could make alterations to the
constitution.
UK interest rates:
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Eddie George (left), governor of the Bank of
England, meet to discuss interest rates in the light of last week's Budget
proposals. The arguments for and against a rise in base rates from 5.75 per
cent are finely balanced.
The Bank fears strong economic growth may trigger inflationary pressures.
Analysts believe Mr Clarke will urge delay at least until January to prevent
a pre-Christmas upset to the retail trade and to allow the public to digest
his Budget measures.
Kyrgyzstan and the World Bank co-sponsor a two-day investors' conference in
Paris. The republic, which has been following an International Monetary Fund
programme, has stabilised its currency, the som, and is set to bring
inflation below 1 per cent a month. Western economists are predicting its
economy will expand by 1-2 per cent in the second half of next year.
VSEL bid: Michael Heseltine, UK secretary of state for trade and industry,
has until today to rule on whether bids for the submarine maker VSEL by
British Aerospace and GEC should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. It is thought unlikely that either bid will be referred, leaving
the battle to be fought out in the stockmarket.
Lloyd's of London: The council of the insurance market is expected to
discuss the possibility of forging an out-of-court settlement between
loss-making members and professional agencies being sued for negligence.
Peter Middleton, chief executive, has been testing support for fresh
negotiations after Names rejected in February a deal that would have been
worth about Pounds 900m. All sides agree a deal is in the best interest of
the insurance market. The problem is deciding how much each must concede.
East Timor: The 19th anniversary of the invasion and occupation of the
former Portuguese colony by Indonesia will be marked by protests in
Australia, Britain, Canada, Portugal and the US.
FT Survey: Zimbabwe.
THURSDAY 8
Gatt members ponder WTO
The 125 participants in the eight-year-old Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meet in Geneva to set a January 1 start-date
for Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation.
Ankara's state security court is due to give its verdict in the treason
trial of eight Kurdish MPs, accused of infringing Turkey's anti-terrorism
laws by maintaining ties with guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers party
(PKK) and advocating a separate Kurdish state.
Nigeria's constitutional conference in Abuja begins a month's break, six
weeks after it was due to offer draft proposals, before resuming in January.
UK telecoms: Oftel, the regulatory body, publishes a consultation document
on interconnection, concerning the prices BT's competitors have to pay to
use parts of its network.
Saleroom: The Marquess of Cholmondeley is disposing of items from Houghton
Hall, his house in Norfolk, at Christie's in London. Among the highlights
are chairs designed by William Kent and a painting La Lecture de Moliere by
Jean-Francois de Troy, which could top Pounds 5m.
FT Surveys: Business in the Community and Vietnam.
Holidays: Argentina, Austria, Brazil (some states), Chile, Italy, Peru,
Portugal, Spain (Immaculate Conception).
FRIDAY 9
Summit of the Americas
President Bill Clinton hosts the Summit of the Americas (to Dec 10). All the
leaders of the region, with the exception of Cuba's Fidel Castro, foregather
in Miami. The main item on the agenda is trade. Given Mr Clinton's weakness
after the disastrous mid-term elections, many are sceptical that the fine
words expected from the US on the goal of hemispheric economic integration
can be translated into practice.
EU summit: Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl hosts the two-day European
Council summit in Essen. The meeting is being billed as a cornerstone of the
German-led strategy to build a 'wider' European Union to include the former
communist countries of central and eastern Europe. Other topics include
measures to boost employment, EU strategy toward North Africa, the crisis in
Bosnia, and efforts to beef up Europol into a European FBI.
Sinn Feinn, the political wing of the IRA, and the British government are
due to begin talks in Belfast, opening a new phase of the Northern Ireland
peace process. They have been deferred from Wednesday at the IRA's request.
Decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals will top the agenda.
Bank of Japan is to release its quarterly Tankan business outlook, the most
authoritative guide to the short term economic outlook. It will appear
against the background of strengthening signs of a recovery.
WEEKEND 10-11
Peace prize ceremony
On Saturday, Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and foreign minister
Shimon Peres, together with PLO chairman Yassir Arafat, collect the 1994
Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. The three were awarded this year's controversial
prize in October for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East, but
the extremist Islamic movement has since been seeking to undermine progress
of the accord. This year's Nobel Peace Prize is the first to be shared by
more than two recipients.
Japan's main opposition forces intend to merge into one party (Shinshinto)
on Saturday at a meeting in Yokohama.
Nasreen trial: On Saturday, the trial in absentia of the Bangladeshi
feminist writer Taslima Nasreen is due to begin. She is accused of insulting
Islam in her works. She fled to Sweden in August.
Saleroom: Manhattan Rolls-Royce dealer Michael Schudroff, who is closing
shop and moving to smaller premises in Greenwich, Connecticut, auctions some
50 vehicles, part of his collection of vintage Rolls-Royces, at Sotheby's
New York on Saturday.
Germany's liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in the ruling
coalition, begin a special congress on Sunday in Gera, Thuringia, to
redefine the party's aims after its poor showing in the recent federal
elections (to Dec 12).

Monday: Provisional UK M0 money supply data for November and consumer credit
figures for October should shed some light on UK consumer demand. The annual
rate of M0 growth is expected to slow, while demand for consumer credit
should remain buoyant.
Thursday: Details of west German third-quarter growth should show continued
steady expansion of gross domestic product at about or just under 2 per cent
a year. Although some economists earlier forecast a consumer-induced
slow-down, industrial and export demand seem to have more than compensated
for thin pay packets. The first pre-Christmas sales figures, however,
suggest a less-than-festive season for retailers.
Analysts differ over whether this year's penultimate Bundesbank council
meeting will lead to a reduction in the discount rate. Recent teasing hints
from bank directors, suggesting a cut is more likely than an increase, have
maintained interest in the topic.
In the UK, Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, appears before the
Commons treasury and civil service committee to be quizzed on monetary
policy and interest rates.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (8): 'Our democracy is on trial' -
Interview / Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai talks about his aims, hopes and
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHUAN LEEKPAI, the Thai prime minister and Democrat Party leader, has
surprised his political allies and enemies alike by surviving at the head of
a fragile five-party coalition government for more than two years; if he
continues for another two years this would be the first time a
democratically-elected government in Thailand - a country notorious for
coups d'etat - has completed a full term in office. But some of his critics
say Mr Chuan has survived merely by avoiding hard decisions.
Recently the coalition's Palang Dharma party fired its cabinet ministers,
including the foreign minister, and imposed a new batch of ministers on Mr
Chuan.
Victor Mallet and Peter Montagnon asked Mr Chuan how he coped with this and
other issues.
Q: How do you deal with this political system where you are not able freely
to choose your own cabinet? What is your style of government?
PRIME MINISTER: I know that it's a very difficult system but I think
Thailand will have to live with coalition governments for quite some time,
so we must try not to make that weakness a limitation on the ability of a
coalition government to work and last.
I think a democratically elected government has to prove that it can work
efficiently, that it can handle the problems of the country quickly without
giving in to mob rule or influential groups. From my experience I believe
that some governments tend to create excitement for the media and the people
to satisfy them in the short term but in the end create more problems for
the government. I was determined not to have that happen, which I think is
the reason why we were heavily criticised during our first months.
As for the reshuffle in the Palang Dharma party that was not something that
was the wish of the government; it was to do with the internal problems of
the party. And we have a kind of gentleman's agreement that on matters of
personnel we would leave it to the judgments of individual parties unless
there are very, very good reasons for me to exercise a veto right. Some of
these changes will force me to work harder because a lot of the ministers
will have to start from the beginning, but it's necessary to keep the
administration going and I think that despite the anxiousness of the people
in general about these changes we can carry on working together.
Q: But the government is criticised for not being decisive enough in
tackling problems, such as Bangkok's traffic. What decisions are you taking?
The traffic problem is not a new problem. It didn't start with this
government and it's a result of past neglect. As for old (mass transit)
projects with contracts already signed, we may or may not agree with these
projects but we have no other option but to support their implementation,
otherwise there will just be more delays and the problem that the government
would be breaking the contract. Over the last two years, there are many
projects and measures that we are implementing, otherwise the traffic would
be much worse than it is today ..
We are the first government to focus on the decentralisation of economic
activities and therefore help ease the growth of Bangkok. By creating jobs
in rural areas we have managed to prevent about 100,000 or 200,000 people
from migrating to Bangkok.
The decentralisation policy I think will be seen as a success clearly in the
next two to three years when the growth of Bangkok will be reduced and
factories in Bangkok will be moved out. The decentralisation we're talking
about is on all fronts, not just political power but for instance education,
financial institutions, these are all going to be decentralised and we will
not allow Bangkok to grow the way it's done in the past.
Q: What effect will the shortcomings of the education system have on
Thailand's competitiveness?
During the last two years we've now managed to extend education so that
about 92 per cent of primary school leavers in the latest educational year
are going on to secondary school. And I believe that although we do have
problems it is within our capabilities to upgrade our education system and
remain competitive. But there are shortages in some areas, such as engineers
and the sciences. We have too many social science graduates.
Q: What will Thailand have to offer Thai or foreign investors that can't be
found more cheaply in the future in other Asian countries?
The fact that companies like Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, even Chrysler
decided to choose us as a centre for their production shows that they see
some advantages. So if the tax system is quite favourable and other factors
are comparable, we have an opportunity. We are quite a big market here with
60m people and also with considerable purchasing power, and geographically
we are at the centre of the south-east Asian region. And the established
market system that we have had for a long time and a democratic form of
government will also be contributing factors. The one weakness we may have
is that we've never been a colony so we're not very good at foreign
languages.
Q: How are you tackling the growing gap between rich and poor?
It is true that in Thailand and other countries in the region the tax system
has failed to catch the rich people. But overall during the last one and a
half years the group of people who are the poorest - the farmers - have had
their incomes considerably increased. And we have helped the very poorest,
that is the landless farmers. We have managed to push our land reform
programme. That is the most perceptible change that we have created in rural
areas.
We're not going as far as these schemes in European countries. We're merely
supporting farmers to be able to stand up on their own with the
supplementary income; and their children will be absorbed by the growth of
the industrial sector so the proportion of people employed in the
agricultural sector will be steadily reduced. It's just that those who
remain must be able to make a living. We have allocated budget for three
years now - 69 per cent of the budget will now go to rural areas.
We have to continue the trend of allocation in the budget and because the
fiscal position is rather healthy we have some room for manoeuvre for this
purpose. We will stick to these priorities and we hope that the next
government would then continue and may see results. In any case we will put
this objective in the eighth development plan in a way that would, I guess,
commit future governments to this course. I think the approach is broadly
accepted and there is very little opposition - it just depends on the
determination of the people who come in to implement it, because usually the
people who form policies are based in Bangkok.
Q: At the half-way point, how do you rate your chances of being the first
elected government to survive a full four-year term?
In a parliamentary system, parliament can always dissolve and there could
always be changes. For a coalition government made up of five political
parties, I'm satisfied with two years. For the remaining time it's important
to support the system. Once the system is widely accepted any future changes
will then go according to democratic rules. I can assure you that there will
be no extra-constitutional forces leading to the fall of this government -
that is what I've been determined to maintain.
Q: Some say this would be a good time for you to call an election. Do you
think so?
I know that generally there are such feelings, but whatever we have we don't
have enough money to fight some of the other parties in some areas. So I'm
not thinking of dissolution at the moment. I'm trying to think how to fight
vote-buying in the future. This problem will get worse. I've been in
politics for 25 years and I can see the trend. There is more vote-buying
now.
Q: Why is that? Isn't Thailand becoming wealthier and more sophisticated?
Because there are more businessmen in politics. In the past they used to be
lawyers and teachers and these are not people who buy votes. There are more
businessmen and some of these people believe money can buy everything so
they use the buying system. That is a cause for concern.
Q: Have you been able to reduce corruption in general?
I'm trying very hard. The majority of the cabinet attach great importance to
this but we are worried about officials at lower levels particularly with
the budget for rural areas.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (6): A diet of dung beetles - Poverty in
the north east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To liven up dreary nights Bangkok bars will sometimes hire a bizarre cabaret
act: a couple of grossly overweight transvestites who stagger on to a
makeshift stage, writes William Barnes.
Although this is a familiar routine the crowd roars with laughter as the two
performers - with impressive imitations of advanced drunkenness - brightly
explain the various unprintable things they will do for a pittance.
Welcome, you might say, to Isarn - the north-east of Thailand. What makes
this cruel lampoon so dangerously funny for many Thais is that it contains
more than a hint of the truth about the realities of life in Isarn.
For behind the rapid industrialisation of Bangkok and other urban areas
there is another Thailand, one where - far from capital's gridlocked
Mercedes, Volvos and BMWs - people sometimes supplement their meagre diet by
eating such local delicacies as dung beetles and tadpoles.
Official statistics show that Thailand as a whole has done well in
eradicating poverty, infected water and the other symptoms of third world
misery. Latest figures show that the average per capita income in Bangkok is
more than Bt13,000 per month.
But in Isarn, the figure is only Bt1,244. No area of the country is poorer
than the arid north-east which accounts for a third of the land area and a
third of the population. The Bangkok authorities only exercised effective
sovereignty over this area of the country - historically a part of the Lao
Kingdom - towards the end of the 19th century.
Over the last three decades economic planners have vaguely assumed that the
local economy would prosper as a result of the dams and roads that Bangkok
built.
Yet many inhabitants' lives appear as difficult as ever. The traditional
rice farming supplemented by a little hunting and fishing has been badly
disrupted by environmental damage.
Forest cover in Isarn has dropped from 43 per cent to 15 per cent in 25
years; salt mining and bad irrigation has spoilt much good land. Farmers -
who rarely have proper land title - are sometimes thrown off the land to
make way for eucalyptus plantations.
It is a sign of the population's frustration that communist insurgency in
Isarn ended only in 1980, and that some villagers in this predominantly
Buddhist country have converted to Christianity.
The failure of the Thai educational system is nowhere more painful than in
Isarn. In Thailand as a whole, only a third of workers have more than the
compulsory six years of what critics say is often mediocre schooling, but in
Isarn the real figure is believed to be much lower than the national
average. The education system is seen as having little relevance to life's
harsh realities. Illiteracy is high.
Yet almost every villager nowadays has access to a television set which
emphasises how good life is in Bangkok.
Villagers will often borrow money - not from banks to whom they can offer no
collateral - but from money lenders. The result is more misery.
Most children are packed off to work by their middle teens as labourers,
factory workers or worse, only to be discarded in their mid-20s when they
can no longer gut chickens or polish gems fast enough.
Barely educated, unsophisticated in the ways of the city and dark compared
with the pale-skinned Sino-Thais, many Isarn migrants are prey to prejudice
and entrepreneurial vultures.
There could be 2m Isarn workers living in Bangkok slums or on the eastern
seaboard industrial complex; no-one really knows because they remain on the
electoral roll of their old village.
Even Thailand's modestly sophisticated economy appears to have a limited use
for an undereducated workforce: over the last six years of very high
economic growth the total number of Thais working overseas has climbed
sharply from 268,000 in 1988 to 430,700 this year.
Last year, Isarn workers abroad channeled Dollars 300m back to the
north-east through the banking system; at least as much will have been
carried back by hand. This money is important but it simply serves to
emphasise Isarn's role as a cheap labour pool and a 'home' for workers (who
may in any case never return to live in their old villages after so many
years away).
The post-communist opening up of Indochina should bring more trade and
business to Isarn although the current proposals for new transport links -
such as a highway from Isarn through to Danang on the Vietnamese coast - may
not be the panacea that is sometimes suggested.
The current Thai government is pouring billions of baht into economic
development in the region, but private investors are harder to attract.
There seems little hope that more than a handful of big manufacturers will
be lured into the region soon given its dearth of skilled labour; half the
Dollars 2bn private investment that went into Isarn last year went into
Nakhon Ratchasima, a town on the edge of the region and the nearest to
Bangkok.
'The villagers complain that the manufacturers we bring in only want to
exploit them. But frankly what do they expect - I don't think we are going
to see many aerospace manufacturers down here,' says Mr Sukich
Maneethirapattanakul, director of the Regional Development Centre in Khon
Kaen, a government think tank.
In Khon Kaen, a bustling Isarn market town, several local businessmen
proudly said that this was the fishing net manufacturing centre of Thailand.
This is a dubious honour: the Isarn Friends of Children, a charitable
organisation, recently found children working in the fishing net factories
for less than Dollars 2 a day.
Mr Amnuay Viravan, a former deputy prime minister and banker who will
contest the next election in Khon Kaen on behalf of his newly formed Nam
Thai political party, is more optimistic.
'I knew the north-east 35 years ago - believe me things have improved
enormously. Now I think Isarn can join the economic mainstream - its people
are tough enough and hardworking enough to overcome the problems,' he said.
For centuries before Bangkok claimed control of the region power lay in the
hands of the most influential local families. Little has changed, and the
rural poor cannot look to Thailand's corrupt police force for support.
In election after election, political parties have bought their way into
power by bribing the desperate and malleable voters in the north-east with
cash or promises.
One Khon Kaen social activist, who asked not to be named, said that
education was the key to unlocking the grip of corrupt local government on
Isarn's future: 'How can someone who doesn't even read decide which
politicians will do more than try to fill his own pockets?'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (5): A pattern emerges - Bangkok's
business district / William Barnes describes how a central business district
is emerging from the sprawling chaos of Bangkok as institutions start to
gravitate towards certain focal points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangkok's traffic jams, skilled staff and poorly enforced commercial laws
might seem enough to stifle the city's ambitions to become an international
business centre.
Yet amid the polluting haze which bathes the capital (a tolerance for
airborne pollution is as useful as a portable telephone) it is now possible
to discern the makings of a viable, even attractive, regional business hub.
Bangkok is one of the world's great unplanned metropolises. Many urban
schemes have been proposed over the years, but no-one has possessed the will
or the means to overcome the combined inertia of bureaucrats and
self-serving politicians.
The first urban rail scheme was proposed 25 years ago. But little progress
has been made in building any of the city's three planned mass transit
systems.
Yet it is worth remembering that Bangkok, where more than half the country's
wealth is created, is merely choking on its own success. The number of
foreigners moving into Bangkok will increase because Thailand needs their
technology to produce the higher value-added exports it must sell to remain
competitive.
Many international companies will continue to place their regional offices
in Bangkok because Thailand remains a relatively cheap place to do business
yet has a large and increasingly wealthy domestic market.
The price of renting a top grade office in the first quarter of 1994 was
Dollars 176 per square metre per year, compared with Dollars 1,020 in Hong
Kong and Dollars 307 in Singapore.
But trying to work out where to set up shop in Bangkok's sprawling chaos can
be a tough decision given the dire consequences of becoming committed to a
property half a kilometre beyond the wrong set of traffic lights; you could
condemn your colleagues to years of having to leave mid-morning for a lunch
appointment.
Nevertheless during the 1990s the accelerating movement of previously
scattered businesses towards certain focal points revealed the outlines of a
central business district (CBD) at the heart of the Bangkok metropolitan
area - which is one-and-half times the size of Hongkong or seven times the
size of Singapore.
Property consultants differ over the exact dimensions of the CBD but most
agree that it is bounded in the north by Ploenchit Road (and the British
Embassy) and sweeps southwest, stopping some way short of the river.
'We are starting to see a very definite congregation of finance and services
type companies in this area. But only in a specific number of buildings
which shows that quality is becoming important too,' says Mr Paul Scales,
Jones Lang Wootton's managing director in Bangkok.
Certainly, Silom Road, Sathorn Road and Wireless Road are important
locations, even if the area - broken in two by Lumpini Park - is still big
by City of London standards.
Even three years ago Thai investors appeared rather unconcerned about
location. That has changed, and a feature of the property market in 1994 has
been the phenomenal success of condominium projects within the CBD.
Rentals on the fringes of the developing financial district may be suffering
because companies want to be in, rather than merely near, the CBD.
Thus Sukhumvit Road - traditionally the foreigners' ghetto - has fallen
somewhat out of favour because of its particularly bad traffic, even though
its western end links to the emerging CBD.
Prime rentals are lower on Sukhumvit than around the busy junctions of the
Vibhavadi Rangsit and Phaholyothin roads in the north of the city where
trading and automobile companies have gathered; such areas acquire their own
hotels, entertainment areas and housing.
Similarly the riverside hotels risk losing business customers because their
picturesque location is separated from the northern end of the CBD by
frequent traffic congestion.
However, Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest financial institution,
along with the Bank of Ayudhya, could drag other financial companies with
them when they move to new headquarters sites by the river in about 1996.
Other casualties are the companies which were lured on to the awkwardly
placed Asoke Road - a particularly congested route running off Sukhumvit -
which was touted at the beginning of the decade as a new financial district.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (7): Traffic jams and bottlenecks -
Indecisiveness hampers vital public works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few people who have struggled to meet an appointment through Bangkok's
gridlocked traffic would disagree with the proposition that Thailand's
infrastructure is in a mess. Such is the pace of development, and so wholly
absent a co-ordinated transport policy, that the roads simply cannot cope
with an ever increasing volume of cars.
Yet the long-suffering Thais themselves are strangely accepting of the
situation. Politicians from the Bangkok region say traffic tops voter
concern, but still the pressure is not such as to force the government to
act. Perhaps the infrastructure problems matter less in the short run than
outsiders at first sight imagine. Or perhaps everyone knows there is little
the government can do.
Both thoughts contain a grain of truth. With an economic growth rate
expected to be in the region of 7 to 9 per cent over the next couple of
years, there is little discernible impact yet on the economy from
infrastructure bottlenecks. The traffic jams in Bangkok are highly
conspicuous, but elsewhere the road network is good. If congestion in the
capital causes growth to shift to the provinces, then, some would argue, so
much the better. Development of the national economy would be better
balanced.
The real problem concerns Thailand's ability to make sensible decisions for
the longer term. Unless the government can secure an efficient
infrastructure, the country's competitive advantage could disappear.
Thailand would find it hard to attract productive investment if a poor
infrastructure made doing business just at the time when cheap labour from
nearby Indochina was coming on stream.
Unlike many developing countries Thailand has no need to sell off state
enterprises at fire sale prices to cover its budget deficit. Indeed with
government finances in surplus that particular question simply does not
arise. Instead its privatisation programme has been driven more by the need
to make state enterprises more efficient and to co-opt private capital for
the expensive investments that inevitably lie ahead.
The World Bank has suggested that as much as Dollars 12bn a year could need
to be spent on the infrastructure for the next five years. 'A major concern
is that sectoral reform ensures that existing efficiency is maintained and
guarantees that huge infrastructural investments  ... can be financed and
implemented in a timely manner,' the bank said in report last month.
At this point the real problems begin. 'Thailand's economic management has
been very strong on the macro side: it has been absolutely lousy on the
micro,' says Mr Ammar Siamwalla of the Thailand Development Research
Institute.
'The problem with infrastructure has nothing to do with lack of capital.
It's much more the lack of capability of public decision-making.'
To be fair, Thailand's record is not all bad. Egat, the electricity
authority, has a long tradition of good technical management with the result
that the power supply, though hardly cheap, has been reliable. There has
been a notable improvement in the telephone service since the government
pushed the two state operators - the Communications Authority of Thailand
which deals with international calls and the Telephone Organisation of
Thailand which serves the domestic market - into granting concessions to
private operators.
The snag is that the underlying legislation is not adapted to such an
approach. The state enterprises retain basic monopoly rights which creates
uncertainty for the private operators. Reshuffling of the concessions after
they were granted on the grounds that one of the private operators,
TelecomAsia, stood to earn too much looked arbitrary and capricious. At best
it was a reminder that there is no coherent and predictable regulatory
framework.
A number of other developments compound the impression of regulatory
weakness.
Egat retained a controlling interest in the generating company EgCo when it
was privatised recently. The World Bank has recommended that Egat reduce its
stake in EgCo to below 50 per cent as soon as possible.
The Japanese company Kumagai Gumi was squeezed out of Bangkok's second
expressway consortium in March after it had been built - and after it had
become clear that the road would be much more profitable than originally
expected. The fiasco over Bangkok's proposed mass transit system continues.
Contracts have been signed by three separate authorities with three separate
operators. Hopewell, the Hong Kong construction company controlled by Mr
Gordon Wu, is working with Thailand's state railways. Bangkok Land is
working with a sub-division of the Ministry of the Interior and another
local company, Tanayong, is working with the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority.
None of the projects is designed to interconnect, but since contracts have
been signed, the government cannot easily scrap the whole thing and start
again from scratch .
The common thread running through all these cases is the need first for
co-ordinated planning to ensure that the public receives the services it
requires, and second to establish a regulatory system that will prevent
abuse of monopoly power in sectors where competition will always be limited.
Such a prescription may seem a tall order for a developing country. Even in
the UK, which has considerable experience of regulating privatised
utilities, regulation seems flawed at times. But the Philippines is
attempting to tackle the monopoly question. It is ultimately essential if
the private sector is to take a significant role in the provision of
infrastructure.
That poses several difficulties for Thailand. One is that many state
enterprises are profitable in their own right and their managements are
highly paid. They will not open themselves up to competition easily, as the
case of Egat has shown.
Another is that Thailand's consensus approach to coalition lacks the
single-mindedness needed for firm and impartial regulation. The peculiar
history of the Bangkok mass transit suggests that the coalition only works
because all the vested interests are allowed to have their say, despite the
inherent contradictions.
Democracy has survived in that way for two years now. At least where the
infrastructure is concerned, the task for the next two may lie in making
order out of chaos.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (4): Strains and pains of growth -
Financial services are expanding rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, Thailand's financial markets seem to be developing at a
similar cracking pace to the economy as a whole. Last month saw the official
launch of a new bond market, while in its first two years of existence the
Securities and Exchange Commission has tightened up considerably on
regulation. It is now considering the introduction of a derivatives market.
Thailand will certainly need such a rounded capital market to finance the
development of its own infrastructure. It is also almost certainly desirable
if the country is to continue to attract a reasonable share of overseas
portfolio investment. In recent months foreign buyers have accounted for
roughly a quarter of equity purchases on the stock market.
Yet it would be asking too much for the development to proceed smoothly.
Though market regulation has improved, practice does not always quite match
up to theory, at least where corporate disclosure is concerned. The much
trumpeted new bond market is unlikely to conduct a lot of business in the
short term, because there is as yet no representative government benchmark
bond. Uncertainty over the tax treatment of bond trades is also holding
business back. The first day of trading saw turnover of only Baht 6.9m.
Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, SEC deputy secretary-general, points to a number
of achievements since his organisation was set up. 'We have brought the
issues to the public in quite clear terms,' he says. Brokers seem to agree.
'It's not a revolution, but they are chipping away,' says Mr Graham
Catterwell of Crosby Research.
Bringing even a semblance of order to what was basically a market dominated
by a few large players able to ramp particular issues is no mean feat for
the SEC. It has meant taking on some powerful vested interests, but the SEC
can claim two successes:
It brought a series of prosecutions of people charged with artificial
share-price manipulation. Though the court cases failed in the first
instance to secure conviction, Mr Prasarn argues that the SEC's
demonstration that it was serious has had a deterrent effect. 'There were
bubble stocks, which rose despite unfavourable fundamentals. That's quite
diminished,' he says.
The SEC has tightened up on the rules concerning new issues. The old pattern
was for large slices of a new issue to be made available cheaply to
executives of the company concerned, the lead underwriters and other parties
closely involved. Now at least 30 per cent of a new issue must be placed
with retail investors and only 10 per cent may be set aside for preferential
allocation. The SEC also requires new issuers to employ independent
financial advisers who advise on the issue price and are jointly responsible
with the company for the information in the prospectus.
These measures have enhanced the integrity of the market, but brokers say
more remains to be done. A particular bone of contention is the haphazard
way in which company results are announced. Though the rules in this regard
are quite clearly defined, in practice the process by which information is
disseminated through the stock exchange to investors looks flawed.
Normally only a headline earnings figure is revealed and it may be days or
weeks before a fuller version becomes available. During that time, however,
some investors will have been able to obtain details of the financial
statement, and thereby put themselves in a privileged position vis-a-vis
those who have not.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand itself denies there is a problem. 'We have
specific rules already about what companies have to disclose periodically,'
says Mr Seri Chintanaseri, its president. The exchange has several ways of
disseminating the information, including its daily bulletin while company
announcements are also available in its library for inspection, he adds.
As in other countries it is hard for the SEC to clamp down on insider
dealing which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Evidence is
hard to come by, but the SEC is trying to combat this by requiring potential
insiders - individuals closely associated with a comany - fully to disclose
their transactions. It also wants companies to make public statements when
the movement in their share prices becomes excessive.
Regulating Thailand's financial markets is made harder by the sheer pace of
change. The SEC is keen to introduce a derivatives market, for example,
because it will provide institutional investors with a means of hedging
their positions and make the market as a whole more efficient. But a
pre-requisite for the development of equity futures is an end to the ban on
short-selling of shares. This in turn will weaken the SEC's ability to
combat artificial manipulation of share prices.
On the other hand, if the SEC delays too long, derivative markets for Thai
financial products will simply develop offshore where they cannot be
regulated.
Already the cowboy image of the financial markets has receded as greater
institutional presence adds to depth and liquidity. According to Mr Chaipat
Sahasakul of the stock exchange, 70 per cent of the shares in issue are held
by institutions, though small retail investors account for a similar
percentage of the average daily turnover of Dollars 375m. The retail share
is declining and the exchange has already noticed a reduction in price
volatility.
Foreign investors have made their presence felt, though there is still very
little evidence that they are directly concerned with matters of corporate
governance. Thai institutional involvement is growing as well, though mutual
funds make up only between 5 and 10 per cent of equity market transactions.
Brokers say they expect life insurance companies to start playing a larger
role. The government's plan to set up a pensions scheme next year may also
reduce the domination of the market by retail players.
When that happens the regulators will be able to settle down to a more
normal life. Meanwhile they are having to come of age at breakneck speed.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (3): Haven of financial freedom -
Bangkok's influx of foreign banks echoes the rise of Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many foreign bankers in Thailand can reach their desks these days only after
dodging through gangs of construction workers busy refurbishing their
Bangkok offices, writes William Barnes.
After years of watching their fortunate domestic counterparts profiting from
Thailand's economic boom, foreign bankers are now manoeuvering to take
advantage of the liberalisation of the banking sector.
'The truth is that the regulatory environment is already probably one of the
best in Asia. It's probably the most enlightened in Asia next to Hong Kong,'
says Mr David Hendrix, general manager of Citicorp in Thailand. 'There is an
unbiased and fair treatment of foreign banks that doesn't exist in many
other countries in south-east Asia.'
Foreign banks have rapidly expanded their wholesale banking business since
the late 1980s, and anticipate further liberalisation. The more vigorous of
the 14 foreign banks allowed full branch licences have seen their lending
grow fivefold in less than six years.
Business picked up in 1992 when the Thai monetary authorities introduced the
offshore banking scheme known as the Bangkok International Banking Facility
(BIBF). Foreign banks have quickly captured half the important out-in
lending business (foreign loans for use in Thailand) under the BIBF.
Lack of a full branch licence is clearly not a barrier to expansion: the 22
branchless foreign banks have managed to garner a quarter of the BIBF
business providing Thai corporations with cheaper funds, usually in dollars.
After years of making profits from the wide spreads ensured by their
lucrative domestic banking cartel, Thailand's 15 commercial banks have been
slower to make a mark in the offshore loan business. Much of the Thai banks'
'BIBF' lending appears to have been found by bringing existing offshore
loans under the BIBF umbrella.
If the liberalisation of the Thai banking industry looks as though it will
be painful, then that is partly the point: the Bank of Thailand, the central
bank, has long term plans for Bangkok as a financial centre and wants local
institutions lean enough and canny enough to compete in the global arena.
Although strong credit growth has again allowed Thai banks to report
enviably juicy profits for another year, Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the
finance minister and a former president of one of the country's biggest
banks, has repeatedly sounded the warning bell.
Perhaps the ongoing Gatt negotiations on trade in services have stopped Mr
Tarrin from revealing a precise liberalisation timetable, but the outline
plan seems to be to allow foreign banks to open up to two branches with
restricted services outside Bangkok; to increase gradually the services in
which they can compete and - perhaps by the turn of the century - to allow
foreigners to extend their branch networks further.
Five more foreign branch licences have already been promised for 1995. Mr
Vijit Supinit, Bank of Thailand governor, has hinted that at least two of
those licences are likely to go to Japanese banks because, despite the
massive Japanese industrial presence, only two of the 14 foreign banks with
branches are Japanese.
Thai finance and securities houses are the prime candidates to pick up the
handful of new licences that have also been promised to local institutions.
To encourage the weaker Thai banks to merge with their stronger brethren the
authorities will let them sell their surplus licences to Thai finance
houses.
The bigger Thai banks, meanwhile, will remain formidable competitors, led by
Bangkok Bank, south-east Asia's biggest bank whose new president is the
35-year-old Mr Chartsiri Sophonpanich.
Local banking chiefs have acquired a mania for 're-engineering'. The first
fully automated bank branch was opened recently as an experiment in Bangkok
 -a far cry from the traditional serried ranks of low-paid clerks
laboriously shuffling paper.
It remains to be seen if the foreign banks can wrest significant retail
business from the big locals with their branch networks of up to 400 sites,
when the provinces are going to be the key growth area for retail banking.
Electronic banking, however, may obviate the need for a big branch network
now that the government has allowed foreign banks to use local ATM networks.
Most foreign banks will probably be satisfied that they can adequately
service their international customers with just one or two branches. The
Hongkong Bank, like Citicorp, will move into its new banking tower in this
decade partly because the country's burgeoning middle class - two-thirds of
the population is under 30 - will require extensive financial services.
'Thailand has been underemphasised in the past - I don't think that will
happen in the future,' says Mr Sandy Flockhart, the chief executive of the
Hongkong Bank.
The retail sector is likely to remain a sideshow for the Japanese banks,
which will continue to focus on working with Japanese companies investing in
Thailand.
The biggest bugbear cited by foreign bankers - aside from some minor tax
wrinkles and the traffic - is the shortage, and hence high turnover, of good
Thai staff who have a reputation for job hopping. One European banker said:
'It's really painful to see a young banker you have nurtured lured to a
rival - but it's the same for every bank so I guess it is still a level
playing field.'
Foreign bankers talk of the banking opportunities in taking a lengthening
list of companies to the stock market, of financing the country's
multi-billion dollar infrastructure programme and helping corporations tap
the capital markets for funds. Citicorp's Mr Hendrix compares Thailand with
the 13 years he spent in Hong Kong: 'There's a lot that I saw in the
evolutionary development of the Hongkong capital market that I am seeing
here - only at a much quicker pace.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (2): The focus changes - Exports lift the
economy's performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai economy continues to defy the pessimists who predict that after
three decades of rapid growth it must surely stumble.
Despite fears that Thailand may be losing its competitive edge to lower cost
manufacturers in China, Vietnam or Indonesia, economists at the Bank of
Thailand, the central bank, have confidently predicted economic growth in
excess of eight per cent for the next three years.
The lack of a comprehensive industrial strategy, the inadequacy of Bangkok's
transport and communications infrastructure and rising labour costs have all
been cited as reasons for economic turbulence.
But these problems are offset by the Bank of Thailand's steady hand on the
monetary tiller, the entrepreneurial spirit of the country's Sino-Thai
business families, substantial natural resources and a sizeable population
in a strategic location.
This became famously apparent in 1988 when the economy was first lifted into
very high growth by the wave of Japanese manufacturing investment that
flooded into Thailand; a three-year leap in the value of the yen - from Y252
to Y125 per dollar - had made Japan-based exports increasingly
uncompetitive.
By 1990 the Thai economy was overheating but Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait dampened the speculative fever. The February 1991 military coup
d'etat damaged confidence as well, and many investment decisions were put on
hold during the military's failed but bloody attempt to suppress
pro-democracy protests in the summer of 1992.
But protesters' shouts had hardly died down when it became clear - with
political stability promised by prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai's new,
reformist government - that pent-up spending pressure was pushing the
economy into a higher gear again.
In 1993, driven by accelerating domestic demand, especially 'feel-good'
consumer spending, the economy expanded by 7.9 per cent compared with 7.6
per cent in 1992. This year, while domestic demand remains strong, there has
been a change of focus: the global economy's expansion has prompted a surge
in exports which should see the economy grow by more than eight per cent in
1994 and 1995, according to Bank of Thailand estimates.
The value of exports grew by 20.3 per cent in the January-September period
this year; particularly noticeable have been a sharp increase in sales of
high value-added items - exports of computers and computer parts rose 44.1
per cent. Traditional commodity sales also recovered. Rice exports rose 17.6
per cent after contracting 9 per cent in 1993.
These exceptional figures are partly explained by low exports in the first
half of 1993, and there would be no alarm if export growth slowed in the
final months of this year. For the year as a whole, exports are expected to
expand by between 16 and 20 per cent.
It is a sign of the Thai economy's increasing sophistication that capacity
constraints are a cause of concern. The issue was hardly debated at all
before this decade.
Official capacity utilisation figures are still being developed and may not
be very accurate, but economists believe there is still sufficient slack in
most sectors of the economy - cement and semiconductors are exceptions - to
contain inflation; it needs watching but is not currently considered a
serious threat.
One reason why economists are so confident that the growth rate can be
maintained is a new wave of Japanese investment. This latest surge of
capital injection has, like previous ones, been driven by a rising yen,
although there are important differences.
Much of the new investment is in the form of expansion by companies already
well-established in Thailand, such as Toyota.
Mitsui, the conglomerate whose Thai operations are its largest outside Japan
and the US, intends to invest another Dollars 3bn in the region - mostly in
Thailand - in the next five years.
Component suppliers are also sweeping into Thailand behind the big Japanese
multinationals. 'We are handling 200 medium-sized companies who are here
chasing the big brothers,' says Mr Mitsutoshi Koyama, general manager of The
Sakura Bank.
This latest investment wave will be shorter than the first; but it will also
do less damage to the current account and feed into higher output more
quickly than the first time around.
The Board of Investment - which vets projects for tax breaks - has reported
that investments are currently coming in at about the same level as the peak
year of 1988. Mr Koyama warns against underestimating Japanese investment
because much of it is now raised in Bangkok and reckons that Japanese
companies have invested a total of Y400bn in the last two years.
Many of the investments now being made should turn productive during the
course of 1995; hence the predictions that economic growth will accelerate
to nine per cent or more in 1996 before slowing somewhat for the remainder
of the decade.
The once worrying current account deficit is currently at its smallest level
for five years at five per cent of GDP. It will inevitably rise again but
for the right reasons - to perhaps a new peak of over six per cent in 1996 -
before easing off quite sharply by the year 2000.
In spite of the favourable medium-term outlook the pessimists can still
point to the failure of the education system - only a third of the
population has more than six years of schooling - which threatens the much
heralded climb into higher value-added growth.
New figures compiled by the Thailand Development Research Institute show
that for the first time this year exports of high-tech or sunrise industries
have outpaced those from low-tech, or sunset, industries.
Mr Chalongphob Sussangkarn, head of the TDRI's macroeconomics programme,
says it has taken only eight years for capital intensive production in
Thailand to overtake labour intensive products in value, whereas in the past
other east Asian economies have taken more than a decade.
'By the end of the century the high-value products could account for 70 per
cent of exports - yet we have left it two decades too late to develop our
own technological expertise,' Mr Chalongphob said.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (1): Industrialisation pays off - Thais
are enjoying one of Asia's best economic performances. But pockets of
poverty remain to be eradicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand continues to lurch from one political crisis to another, but its
economic performance has been consistently robust. Real gross domestic
product growth averaged 7.4 per cent a year between 1971 and 1993, and is
likely to average more than eight per cent from now until the end of the
decade.
Although Thailand is still regarded as a 'developing' country,
industrialisation has already brought material benefits to most of its 59m
inhabitants and made it into one of south-east Asia's most remarkable
success stories.
No fewer than 97 per cent of the residents of greater Bangkok live in a
household with television, while 84 per cent have refrigerators and 52 per
cent video cassette players. Outside Bangkok, the figures fall to a
still-impressive 86 per cent for television, 50 per cent for refrigerators
and nine per cent for video machines.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the mild-mannered prime minister who heads the coalition
government elected in 1992, has started to redress the balance between the
wealth of Bangkok and the relative poverty of the countryside by directing
investment and government spending into the remoter provinces.
His most important achievement, however, has been to extend compulsory
education from six years to nine, a decision regarded as long overdue and
essential if Thailand is to improve the skills of its workforce and compete
successfully in high technology industries against other emerging Asian
economies.
It will take many years for education reforms to translate into better
industrial performance - the first pupils to benefit will leave school three
years from now - but in the meantime Thai exports continue to grow rapidly,
with 'new' manufacturing industries making items such as computers and
vehicle parts overtaking 'old' businesses such as textiles.
Japanese companies seeking to escape from the high costs imposed by the
strong yen in their home base continue to regard Thailand as a favoured site
for new investments. Large corporations such as Toyota are now being joined
by a growing number of smaller component manufacturers that want to take
advantage of the lower manufacturing costs and new markets available in
south-east Asia.
Thailand can now see the advantage of liberalising various sectors of its
economy hitherto protected as 'infant industries' from outside competition,
and seems to be opening up the economy faster than its rivals in Indonesia
and Malaysia.
The government has begun gradually to liberalise the banking sector and the
motor manufacturing industry, for example, because it believes this will
help Thailand to become a regional hub for such activities.
While the bureaucrats at the Bank of Thailand (the central bank) and the
finance ministry perform their traditional function of controlling inflation
and ensuring that the government pursues prudent macro-economic policies, Mr
Chuan can focus his considerable political skills on keeping his government
in power.
Survival for a democratic government in Thailand is no easy task, although
the armed forces, which have staged 17 coups d'etat 17 since the end of
absolute monarchy in 1932, are not seen as a particular threat at present.
The last time they organised a coup in 1991 they quickly handed control to a
civilian prime minister, and when they sought to keep power by parliamentary
means in 1992 they were prevented from doing so by street demonstrations
during which troops shot dead about 50 unarmed protestors.
Mr Chuan's main problem is the fragility of his own five-party coalition
government. The present parliament is largely a product of a corrupt system
of politics wherein most rural voters elect influential patrons - who are
expected to extract money from Bangkok for their constituencies - instead of
choosing candidates and parties on the basis of their policies.
If Mr Chuan stays in power for another two years, his would be the first
democratically-elected government in Thai history to serve its full,
four-year term of office. 'The Thai people will have to learn that the
democratic system lasts four years,' sighs Mr Akapol Sorasuchart, a Bangkok
MP for Mr Chuan's Democrat Party. 'They have never, ever experienced that
any elected person, let alone a government, lasts more than three years.'
Among the recent humiliations Mr Chuan has had to endure at the hands of his
coalition partners were the unilateral decision by the Palang Dharma (Moral
Force) party to change all its cabinet ministers (including the foreign
minister) and a public rejection by Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, head of the
New Aspiration Party, of the government's policy of promoting local
elections.
'A cabinet decision is not God. It's just a piece of paper,' Gen Chavalit
said. This prompted Mr Suthichai Yoon, a leading newspaper columnist and
executive editor of The Nation, to comment: 'With coalition parties like the
New Aspiration Party, who needs an opposition in the first place?'
Opposition politicians, meanwhile, are happy to exploit the coalition's
weaknesses. In their latest attack, they have criticised the government's
much-touted land reform programme, suggesting that some land in the resort
island of Phuket was corruptly distributed to the undeserving rich instead
of the landless poor.
Some of the government's accusers in the land reform scandal are not exactly
angels themselves and Mr Chuan's government is probably more honest than
most of its predecessors, but the endless twists and turns of Thailand's
byzantine politics have had a debilitating effect on the prime minister's
ability to take decisions and enforce them.
Until now the Thai economy - driven by Sino-Thai entrepreneurs and free from
the ethnic and religious divisions suffered by neighbouring countries - has
prospered in spite of chronic political instability.
But as the economy becomes more complex the need for good government and
improved legislation and regulation becomes ever more urgent.
The most notorious problem stemming from successive Thai governments'
failure to do what governments are supposed to do is the chaotic traffic
congestion in Bangkok. After two decades of negotiations involving dozens of
contractors and government agencies, Bangkok has no mass transit system -
and the three that are currently planned do not connect with each other.
Such difficulties are not confined to transport. In telecommunications,
private companies are finally installing millions of long-awaited new lines,
but a duopoly of state organisations retains overall control and the
regulatory environment is murky.
Thailand needs billions of dollars for investment in infrastructure
projects, but delays are due mainly to an inability to make decisions rather
than lack of money.
Thailand regularly runs a budget surplus, and the country's gross domestic
savings ratio rose to 37 per cent of GDP in 1993 from an average of 22 per
cent in the decade to 1980. Foreigners would make up any shortfall by
investing in Thai infrastructure if they had confidence in the legal system
and the government's ability to set priorities.
'I've always believed that our infrastructural problems have nothing to do
with lack of capital,' says Mr Ammar Siamwalla, president of the Thailand
Development Research Institute (TDRI), an independent foundation. 'We
require public sector decisions and that is what is missing.'
Another concern is that the private sector is poaching the underpaid Thai
civil servants who have hitherto kept the economy on an even keel through
even the worst periods of political turbulence.
According to the TDRI, a permanent secretary's salary in 1990 was worth only
15 per cent of its real value in 1909. In the finance ministry, says Mr
Ammar, 'We're seeing the last of the mandarins departing this year and in
the next few years.'
Despite such obstacles, Thailand's recent history suggests that it will
adapt to changing circumstances fast enough to achieve continued economic
growth. Political stability, however, remains an elusive goal.
At the very least, the methodical Mr Chuan will need the rest of his current
term of office and a second term with a stronger mandate if he is to fulfil
his aims of promoting development in rural areas, narrowing the widening gap
between rich and poor, imposing the rule of law and strengthening democracy.
Mr Chuan himself is aware that his coalition is fragile, and says he will be
satisfied if he can lay the foundations for an orderly transfer of power.
'For a coalition government made up of five political parties, I'm satisfied
with two years,' he says. 'For the remaining time it's important to support
the system. Once the system is widely accepted any future changes will then
go according to democratic rules.'

The market, which last week saw the Hang Seng index plunge 5 per cent to a
low for the year, faces another raft of potentially negative news this week,
writes Louise Lucas.
Brokers say that regional funds, raising cash in anticipation of
redemptions, are likely to continue selling while the dominant fear of
rising interest rates will continue to deter investors.
Today the market will be digesting Friday's unemployment figures from the
US, but investors will also be acting on news of spiralling inflation in
mainland China.
An arm of the State Planning Commission reckons that the retail price index
will rise by 21 per cent next year, which would be the biggest recorded jump
since the Communist takeover in 1949.
China shares have already been performing badly - the new H share listing,
Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company, fell 12.8 per cent on its debut on
Friday.

The reappearance of foreign demand, coupled with continued demand by
domestic public funds, enabled the Nikkei 225 to regain the 19,000 level
last week, although low trading volumes, down to 210m shares on Friday,
raise questions about where the market is heading this week.
The market will be awaiting Friday's publication of November's Tankan
economic survey. James Capel expects the results to show continued
improvement in business conditions.
Both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices are expected to show
clear improvement with companies more bullish about their sales and profits
expectations.
Capels adds that companies of all sizes will continue to report no
difficulty in obtaining funds, laying to rest the suggestion that Japan may
suffer from a credit crunch during the recovery phase.

Brazil has been attracting a raft of positive recommendations from brokers
in the course of the past week, and the outlook looks bright, writes John

Merrill Lynch has forecast that the equity market will grow by 50 per cent
during 1995 and out-perform the rest of Latin America. The country's
economic stabilisation programme, masterminded by president-elect Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, and the introduction of a new currency, the Real, in July,
has so far cut inflation to around 3 per cent last month from around 50 per
cent in July.
Baring argues that 'the ingredients are now in place for Brazil to complete
its transition to stability and for companies to start to reap the benefits
of a more predictable environment'. Consequently, the broker has raised its
overweight asset allocation to 39 per cent from 35 per cent.
Foreign &amp; Colonial reckons Brazil could be one of the best performing
emerging markets in the world throughout next year. While the new
administration, which takes office in the January, will have numerous
problems to tackle immediately, F &amp; C believes that the backdrop of a strong
currency, strong president and economic package in place, will outweigh the
difficulties.

Thursday brings the release of third-quarter GDP data and UBS is sticking
with its growth forecast of 0.6 per cent over the quarter and 1.8 per cent
on the year.
However, the bank points to recent statements by the economics ministry that
growth was as strong as in the second quarter as indicating that there might
be some upward risk.
November unemployment, also published on Thursday, is expected to be flat,
after the steep decline in October.
UBS adds that the Bundesbank, holding its regular council meeting on
Thursday, will watch real economic developments with interest, although the
data is unlikely to have a significant impact on policy.
'Recent statements by council members suggest that they are quite confident
that inflation will decline further, M3 growth should slow and progress will
be seen in the attempt to consolidate the public budgets,' says UBS.
Hence another small rate cut seems possible, although this week seems too
early with a move more likely around the turn of the year.

More 10-month figures come from the German banks this week, with Dresdner
reporting tomorrow, Deutsche on Wednesday and Vereins and Hypo on Thursday,
but few analysts expect them to set the market alight.
In a pan-European review of the banking sector, Merrill Lynch notes that
November saw the bounce from French and Belgian banks that it had been
anticipating, producing eight out of 10 of the best performers in Europe.
However, Merrill continues to believe that there will be no sustained late
cycle rally, in spite of the current buoyancy. It is not encouraged by the
environment of rising rates and looks to specific stocks only to deliver
longer-term performance.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Next rate rise may be closer than expected -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE 100 index has now launched no less than 10 successful assaults on
the 3,100 mark since falling through that level at the end of March, when
the Federal Reserve tightening moves began to bite.
On most of these occasions the index looked set to consolidate above 3,100,
only to fall back below that level every time. And behind those falls on
virtually every occasion was the threat of, or an actual rise in interest
rates.
After the series of US rate rises, the first UK interest rate increase since
the sterling currency crisis in September 1992 was responsible for dumping
the FT-SE firmly below 3,100.
The market fought back well, penetrating 3,100 in mid-November and cruising
to 3,147 the week before the Budget amid a sequence of impressive economic
numbers, indicating continued low inflation - the lowest for 27 years - and
good growth.
Then a blast of Wall Street-inspired weakness knocked the FT-SE back below
3,100. And there were worrying signs last week that there could be more
trouble. Wall Street, which has shown it still sets the agenda for stock
markets worldwide, is looking decidedly uncomfortable.
Almost every US economic indicator pointed to the economy still growing
strongly. Third-quarter gross domestic product was revised upwards, the
consumer confidence index surged alarmingly and the National Association of
Purchasing Management index rose more sharply than expected. Topping this
was a non-farm payroll number which easily beat forecasts.
The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets on December 20 and another
rate rise in the US, with all its implications for Wall Street, and
therefore UK equities, could be on the cards.
Notwithstanding the impact of falling US markets, the UK Budget was followed
by a firm performance by sterling and gilts, which in turn triggered a
flurry of overseas demand for equities. There was also a growing feeling,
however, that the next rise in UK interest rates is closer than previously
expected.
The chancellor is to meet the governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday
and there are worries that a rise could follow their meeting, although many
observers see January as the likeliest time to lift rates. Fretting about
about such a move will not be good for equities.
Dividend news continues to reassure the big income funds. Seeboard's 21 per
cent rise sets the scene for what promises to be a bumper interim reporting
season for the regional electricity companies. Similar good news is expected
from the four 'recs' reporting this week. And watch for double-digit rises
from Airtours, Siebe, Compass and Carlton Communications.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Finland steps up the pace - European
privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News late last week that Finnair, the Finnish national airline, plans to
raise about FM500m (Dollars 103.3m) through an offer of up to 12m new shares
to domestic and international investors has highlighted the attitude of the
Finnish government to privatisation.
There are a total of 12 groups on the privatisation list, including Finnair.
Others are Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group; forestry concern
Enso-Gutzeit and Imatran Voima, the power company.
The government will not participate in the Finnair issue, which is being
co-ordinated by Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, so its stake will be
cut from about 70 to 60 per cent. This is typical of the approach the
government has taken to the sale of state-owned assets.
While other European governments have used privatisation proceeds to bolster
state coffers, so far most of the proceeds of Finnish privatisation have
gone directly to the companies themselves. This is because heavy debt loads
and Finland's deep recession between 1991 and 1993 left the companies with
weak balance sheets.
Allowing proceeds of privatisation to go to the companies concerned has
meant they enter the private sector with strong balance sheets.
'These Finnish companies are now in a very good position,' said Mr Anders
Bergendahl, Merrill Lynch relationship manager for Scandinavia.
The attraction of Finland for the international investor has been increased
by liberalisation of capital markets. Finland has relaxed restrictions on
foreign share ownership.
The Finnish equity market is the most cyclical in Europe, largely due to the
predominance of paper, chemicals, metals and capital goods sectors.
Some analysts are recommending investors to be overweight in cyclical
sectors. Research by Mr Mike Young at Merrill Lynch points out: 'Finnish
equities have consistently outperformed during economic recoveries.' He
adds: 'Our valuation models suggest the market is anywhere from being the
most overvalued to the most undervalued in Europe. Our interpretation is
that it is among the most undervalued.'
The Finnish government has taken a step-by-step approach to privatisation,
gradually reducing its ownership in a number of companies and only moving
cautiously below the 50 per cent threshold.
The pace of activity has increased in the past 12 months, with a total of
FM7.4bn being raised from the sale of holdings in five companies -
Outokumpu, the mining and metals group; Rautaruukki, the steel producer;
Valmet, the paper machinery manufacturer; Veitsiluoto, the pulp and paper
concern; and Kemira, the chemicals group.
The most recent move was the initial public offering made by Kemira, which
raised FM1.14bn and lowered the state's stake in the company to 75 per cent.
The government has parliamentary authorisation to lower its stake further in
all five companies.
The next company on the list is almost certain to be Neste. Some estimates
suggest the company is worth FM10bn, which would make it the biggest
privatisation so far.
International bankers believe arrangements for the Neste sale are well under
way, and expect it to come to market early in the new year. Morgan Stanley
is the ministry's adviser and Goldman Sachs is the company's adviser.
Bankers believe the government wants to push through a partial privatisation
of the company early next year before the March general elections.
One reason for the haste is that the elections look likely to return the
Social Democrats to power. They have been less enthusiastic about
privatisation than the centre-right administration and could try to slow the
process, particularly where strategic companies are concerned, such as
telecommunications and power groups.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Investors look for decisive move by Fed -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumbles of another interest rate increase are being heard once again on Wall
Street and the stock market does not like such noises one bit. But despite
investor fears that recent strong economic data will lead to another round
of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average followed soaring bond prices Friday to post its highest gain in over
a month.
The market may spend this week deciding whether it will post more declines
on fears of interest rate increases or continue to move in tandem with bond
prices, which seem at last to be cheered by the prospect of another monetary
tightening.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, says sentiment
is growing on Wall Street that the central bank will act quickly and
decisively - positive news for markets that have been worn down in part by a
long, drawn-out process of monetary tightening.
'There is a growing possibility that the Fed could hike interest rates in
December,' he says. Still, he says there is less than a 50 per cent chance
the Fed will act this month. The next meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee is scheduled for December 20.
Last week's deluge of economic statistics reinforced fears that the Fed will
have to act again quickly. Consumer confidence hit its highest level since
1990, the third-quarter gross domestic product figure was revised upward,
and the National Association of Purchasing Managers index of business
activity hit its highest rate in more than 10 years. The week closed with
news that unemployment fell to its lowest level in four years.
Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, says
part of the explanation for Friday's gain of more than 44 points by the Dow
lies in the fact that the market became oversold at the end of November,
having fallen almost 130 points in the past three weeks.
'The market is going to try and have a year-end rally,' he says. But he
warns that any year-end gains will probably not be large or long-lasting.
In the near term, he says, further interest rate increases could hurt stocks
by eroding corporate earnings and making fixed income instruments attractive
alternatives to stocks.
Although economic news due out in the next five days is less important than
last week's figures, investors will be able to take cues from some of the
new statistics. Figures due out today will give an indication of consumer
demand for cars and homes.
Also important will be figures on productivity to be announced mid-week. So
far this year productivity gains have kept wage inflation below other
elements of the surging economy.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar still the focus for traders -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resurgent dollar will be the focus of attention this week after breaking
through the Y100 level last Friday for the first time in two months.
The dollar recovered from about Y96 and DM1.50 when the Fed intervened to
support it at the beginning of November.
The dollar's recent rise appears to have been driven by higher US interest
rates and improved sentiment, based on the greater credibility of the
Federal Reserve recently.
Some investors also believe that the shift in power towards the Republicans
has changed the outlook for US policy, in a way which will benefit US assets
and the dollar.
A strong jobs report on Friday served only to bolster the expectation of
higher interest rates. This week there are no important statistical releases
to watch. Instead, the focus will be on the publication of the Fed's beige
book - which sets out the economic backdrop to the policy-making FOMC
meeting on December 20 - and congressional testimony from Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Fed.
In the UK, markets will be watching the monthly monetary meeting on
Wednesday, which could result in a further rise in interest rates.
The balance of opinion favours the Bank of England waiting for the new year.
An early tightening would be well received by markets, making UK assets and
sterling more attractive.
The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday, with the expectation that rates
will be left unchanged. Dollar strength, and fears of a further cut in
German rates, have caused D-Mark weakness recently.
The market will also be watching the lira, amid renewed talk of Italy
re-entering the exchange rate mechanism.
An agreement between unions and government on pensions last week helped the
lira, but political uncertainty remains a constraint.

A senior member of the State Law and Order Restoration Council has assured
overseas businesses of fair treatment, agencies report.
The official said that foreign investment at present stood at Dollars 1.3bn.
On October 29 1988, the SLORC declared a policy of moving towards a market
economy after more than 25 years' experimenting with socialism.
Economists note that the artificially high exchange rate of the kyat against
the dollar, and vestiges of the former command economy still hamper Burma's
economic progress.

First International Bank of Israel has introduced an instrument that will
allow domestic investors to invest in the dollar-shekel continuous foreign
exchange market, agencies report.
Under current law, only importers, exporters, banks and foreigners can buy
foreign currency in Israel for investment.
The instrument was made possible by the liberalisation of the country's
currency markets on July 4, when the government introduced a continuous
trading system.
This system now accounts for 68 per cent of Israel's forex trading.

Macedonia's privatisation agency is understood to be pressing the government
of the former Yugoslav republic to allow it to set up a stock exchange to
aid structural reform.
The agency has sold some 20 state-owned companies, worth Dollars 8m, out of
a total of 1,800 since it was set up at the beginning of this year.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil pins growth hopes on reforms - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's volatile stock market has shown spectacular growth this year and,
with a new currency bringing down inflation and a modernising new president
about to take office, many analysts are tipping it as the star emerging
market for 1995.
They point to Brazil's economy of 157m potential consumers, a dynamic
private sector operating at well below capacity and a stock market they
regard as heavily undervalued when taking into account the country's growth
potential.
'There's a lot of excitement at the prospect of Brazil returning to its
heyday of the 1950s to 1970s when its annual growth rate averaged 7 per
cent,' says Ms Emily McLaughlin, a director at London-based Foreign and
Colonial Emerging Markets.
Although trading has recently been sideways or down, the Sao Paulo stock
market's selected index of the 55 most traded shares has appreciated by
nearly 70 per cent this year thanks to optimism about the new Real currency,
which has led to a sharp fall in inflation, and the prospect of economic
reforms under future president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
But there are doubts. Some investors remember that a year ago Mexico's
market was being touted as one of the great prospects for this year, but has
instead fallen owing to a combination of political violence and poor company
results.
The prospects for Brazil's market, which had a capitalisation of Dollars
190bn at the end of October, depend on the introduction of economic reforms
to provide a base for long term company earnings growth, say analysts.
These reforms include tackling an unwieldy system of public finances, a
complicated and inefficient tax system and a social security system facing
severe funding problems as well as speeding up privatisation.
There is little likelihood of quick progress early next year. Mr Cardoso,
who takes office on January 1, is naturally cautious and will have to
negotiate reforms with a new Congress which takes office in mid-February.
Mr Robert J Pelosky, chief strategist at Morgan Stanley Latin America
Research in New York, is sceptical about how quickly Brazil will move on
reforms and he notes that the selected index has appreciated by about 300
per cent in the last two years, much of that due to expectations of economic
stability.
'The easy money has been made in Brazil and next year the government will
have to take some tough decisions. It will be a gradual process,' he says,
adding that the Brazilian market is comparatively expensive, trading at 19
times estimated 1995 earnings.
This scepticism appears to have been partly reflected by investors recently.
Since Mr Cardoso was elected on October 3 the selected index has fallen by
about 20 per cent due to profit-taking and the rise in international
interest rates as well as investors' belief that the reform process will be
slower than first expected and that privatisation of companies such as
Telebras, the telecom holding group, and Petrobras, the oil company, are
unlikely in the short term.
The market has also been worried about the precariousness of some parts of
the financial system during the current stabilisation.
Two weeks ago the selected index fell 12 per cent after worries about a
central bank liquidity squeeze, which has led to the liquidation of seven
small banks since the Real was launched in July. A central bank announcement
that it was relaxing the squeeze on smaller institutions helped calm
investors.
But trading has been flat. Average daily trading volume, including options,
was Dollars 315m in November compared to more than Dollars 500m in September
and October.
Analysts say the market is waiting for Mr Cardoso to announce his reform
proposals, including probable changes to the Constitution, and to evaluate
the chances of their approval in the new Congress.
Another uncertainty surrounds the future behaviour of foreign investors, who
have been one of the motors of growth for the market.
Last year net foreign investment in Brazil's capital markets, mainly in the
stock market, was a record Dollars 5.5bn and that helped the selected index
more than double in value.
But in the first 10 months of this year the net inflow has been Dollars
3.4bn and few analysts expect a huge inflow of foreign capital early next
year.
Analysts point out that Brazil, like other emerging markets, has been hit by
the turbulence in world interest rates this year.
'As usual Brazil is going against the tide. Just as international interest
rates are attracting money away from emerging markets the country is about
to implement reforms,' says Mr Roberto Serweczak, head of trading at brokers
Barings in Sao Paulo.
And Mr Pelosky notes that Brazil could be a target for profit-taking by
overseas investors: 'Worldwide stock markets are under pressure and Brazil
would be one of the obvious markets for profit-taking because of its gains
this year.'
A reduction in overseas portfolio investment could, however, please Brazil's
central bank which has been concerned about a large inflow of foreign
exchange contributing to an overvaluation of the Real.
The new currency has appreciated by about 15 per cent against the dollar
since its launch and although this has helped keep inflation down, by making
imports cheaper, many Brazilian exporters are suffering.
To signal its concern about dollar inflow the bank announced in October a 1
per cent financial operations tax on new foreign money brought into the
stock market.
Analysts believe the bank is unlikely to increase the tax unless there
appears to be a serious threat to the Real's stability caused by a high
dollar inflow. The government, say bankers, is keen to develop Brazil's
stock market with the help of foreign investment and it will probably need
overseas investors for its privatisation programme.
Some analysts believe the only substantial sell off next year will be Light,
the electricity company, although Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the iron ore
mining giant, is a possibility.
This lack of privatisation perspectives has led some investors to switch to
second line private sector companies, particularly in consumer related areas
expected to benefit from increased purchasing power following the fall in
inflation.
The trend has been reflected in the performance of the FGV-100 index, which
tracks private sector non-bank shares.
So far this year, and especially in the last three months, it has
outperformed the selected index, which is dominated by government-controlled
companies.
The FGV was up 175 per cent in dollar terms at the end of November compared
to a 71 per cent advance for the selected index.

Japanese government bonds ended little changed last week; while the JGB
futures contract was up slightly on the previous Friday, the yield on the
10-year benchmark bond remained steady at 4.64 per cent.
Early this week, the market is likely to be dominated by Friday's
developments in the currency markets, when the US dollar broke key
resistance against the Japanese currency at Y100 to the dollar.
The dollar's gains were fuelled by stronger than expected US employment
data, which revived speculation that the US Federal Reserve may soon raise
interest rates again.
Later in the week, attention will turn to Friday's release of the Bank of
Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on economic sentiment.
Analysts expect it to show a marked improvement in business sentiment for
the period from August to November and to confirm signs of continuing
economic recovery.
'Previous cycles suggest that when the Japanese economy improves, it does so
quite sharply,' said Mr Eric Fishwick, an economist at IBJ International in
London.
Friday's release of third-quarter gross domestic product data also provided
evidence of steady growth, showing a 3.7 per cent annualised
quarter-on-quarter gain, and accompanied by a chunky upward revision to the
second-quarter GDP number.

The US Treasury market is likely to remain on the same path it pursued last
week, a path that led to a further flattening in the yield curve as
investors prefaced trouble for the economy and further interest rate
increases ahead.
Last Friday's remarkable gains at the long end of the maturity range
narrowed the spread between two-year and 30-year yields to less than 50
basis points, half what it was less than a month ago.
The curve has been rapidly flattening as investors have bought long-term
Treasuries in the belief that the economy will start to slow down next year
and thus restrain any inflationary pressures in the system.
The next interest rate increase, in fact, could come a few days before
Christmas. Last week's exceptionally strong third-quarter gross domestic
product and November employment data indicated that the economy is growing
at a faster rate than the Fed wants. Several analysts now predict that the
central bank will raise rates again after the December 20 meeting of the
Fed's open market committee.
Prices should not move sharply in any direction this week given the lack of
key economic releases. Only today's motor vehicle sales figures for November
and single-family home sales for October are likely to generate any
reaction.

FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Short-dated dollar paper in demand -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when it seemed safe to wind down for Christmas, the eurobond market -
and especially its dollar sector - last week saw a burst of primary
activity.
What's more, many expect issuance to continue flowing in the next few weeks,
buoyed by retail demand for high coupons on short-dated dollar paper,
investors increasing their dollar exposure, borrowers seeking to complete
funding programmes before the year-end and underwriters keen on boosting
their standing in the industry's league tables.
'There has been a strong trend all this year, a strong bid for short-dated
dollar paper, and this is likely to last for the remainder of 1994 and into
next year,' said Mr Stephen West, a managing director at Swiss Bank
Corporation. 'A lot of money in Europe is held in dollars on a long-term
structural basis and this year that has been directed towards the short-end
of the yield curve.'
Most of last week's rush of dollar deals - 26 issues totalling Dollars 6.1bn
 -was driven by demand from retail investors attracted by the coupons on
short-dated US paper which, at close to 8 per cent, are high by historical
standards.
Following the Federal Reserve's rise in official US interest rates on
November 15, and in anticipation of further tightening, US short-term rates
have increased sharply.
'Short dollar rates have risen dramatically in recent weeks and eurobond
coupons between 7 1/2 and 8 per cent for two and three-year paper look very
attractive,' says Mr Denis Kelleher, head of debt syndication at Daiwa
Europe, who has seen especially strong demand for short-dated dollar paper
from Switzerland.
Given the dramatic yield-curve flattening that has taken place in recent
weeks, 'there is now not a lot of value in the 10-year sector, and many
investors have been moving shorter along the curve, with demand concentrated
between two and five years', he says.
However, some investors have ventured further out along the yield curve amid
growing confidence that US inflation will remain under control and that the
dollar will strengthen.
Much of the retail demand this year has been driven by redemptions and
interest payments, which have released a large pool of dollars to be
reinvested. November saw some Dollars 8bn in global bond and eurobond
redemptions and a further Dollars 2.6bn in coupon payments; in December
another Dollars 9bn in redemptions and interest payments falls due.
Moreover, some investors have started reducing their cash positions and are
cautiously returning to the bond markets.
Currency considerations are also boosting investors' appetite for dollar
bonds. There is a growing belief that the US currency will appreciate next
year after its disappointing performance in 1994.
'A number of investors have been underweight in the dollar this year, but
they are beginning to adjust their weightings in favour of the dollar,' says
Mr Roger Bates, director of bond syndicate at Deutsche Bank London.
Favourable swap opportunities have also lured borrowers to the short-end of
the yield curve. These have arisen due to strong demand for fixed-rate
assets inspired by a view among many borrowers that US interest rates are
set to rise further. This has enabled many borrowers to raise fixed-rate
funds and swap them for floating-rate liabilities at a rate significantly
below Libor.
Another factor behind the recent issuance boom lies in the fierce
competition among bond underwriting houses to secure a top position in the
industry's league tables as the year-end approaches.
'The league-table scramble risks overwhelming the market with supply,' warns
Mr Kelleher.
Despite the heavy supply, many of last week's offerings continued to find
firm demand. Walt Disney and PepsiCo - probably the two most significant
deals of last week's slew of offerings - were among several rare US
corporate names to tap into European retail demand at funding levels
significantly lower than in the US domestic market.
Furthermore, the pace of new eurobond issuance does not appear to be
slowing. Spain is expected to come to the market this week with a minimum
DM2.5bn offering of five-year bonds, led by Commerzbank and Bayerische
Landesbank, in a deal that could mark the revival of the D-Mark sector.
South Africa and Pakistan are both preparing for an entry into the
euromarkets, although they may have to wait until the new year to make their
appearance.

Attention in the gilt markets this week will focus on the timing of the next
UK base rate rise. With few major events expected, domestic factors are
likely to drive gilt movements.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, hold their regular monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday.
Expectations have risen that rates will be raised at this meeting. But many
economists suspect that a rise is more likely to be delayed until January.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets says: 'The politics of putting
up interest rates just before Christmas are very awkward. Also I can't
believe that the Bank would want to imply that it did not approve of the
last budget.'
Ms Katy Peters of Daiwa also believes a rate rise is less likely this month.
As she says: 'The budget's inflation forecast means there will have to be
some quite aggressive tightening. But I think the markets have already
priced in a move.'
Meanwhile, Wednesday's auction of 10-year gilts will be watched closely for
indications of the level of gilt demand. Today's figures on November's M0,
the narrowest measure of money supply, are not expected to have much impact
although many economists expect them to show the annual growth rate has
slowed.

As pressure grows in the US for a further interest rate rise after the
latest employment figures, German economists continue to argue over whether
the Bundesbank will produce a further rate cut in the present economic cycle
before heading upwards again.
This week's crop of indicators, including third-quarter GDP, manufacturing
orders for October and unemployment in November, are likely to show that the
German economy continues to be fairly robust after this year's recovery.
Since the Bundesbank is known to be concerned about gathering inflationary
pressures as industry's capacity utilisation continues to grow, a further
interest rate cut is unlikely at Thursday's central bank council meeting.
'The Bundesbank will not ease further in this interest rate cycle,' said Mr
Gunther Thumann, economist at Salomon Brothers, categorically.
Among those ranged alongside him are Goldman Sachs, Bayerische Vereinsbank
and Industrial Bank of Japan. The Bundesbank, however, has tried to keep the
bond market calm by suggesting that the next move could be either way.
So far, this has worked reasonably well. In two weeks' time, however, all
eyes will be on the Bundesbank again when it sets the M3 target range for
1995 and thus gives a clue to its monetary intentions.

FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Moves to woo investors in MinFin bonds -
Russian bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves to bring greater stability to trade in Russian hard currency bonds
could increase western investment in a market overshadowed recently by
publicity surrounding the spectacular performance and potential of some
local equities.
On Tuesday, Banque Indosuez and Morgan Grenfell - along with a number of
Russian banks and other traders - formed a new traders' association which
will aim to make the market for dollar-denominated 'MinFin' bonds more
'investor-friendly'.
In 1993, the ministry of finance issued more than Dollars 7bn of the bonds -
the country's largest hard currency issue - to Russians whose dollar bank
deposits were frozen during 1991's foreign exchange crisis.
Although only Dollars 100m to Dollars 300m of the paper is currently in the
hands of overseas investors, they could become popular alternatives to the
other two main classes of Russian debt, which are more widely held by
European and US investors: Dollars 1.9bn of fixed interest eurobonds,
primarily denominated in Deutschemarks, and Dollars 26.5bn in commercial
debt paper currently trading at a steep discount in the secondary market.
Trading in the five tranches of the MinFin bonds only really began this
year, with investors encouraged by the government's redemption of the first
tranche of some Dollars 266m in May.
With the remaining tranches trading at between 75 per cent of face value for
the shortest dated bonds to 30 per cent for the longest dated, potential
returns are attractive.
Based on a standard 3 per cent coupon, yields to maturity are roughly 15 to
23 per cent. Daily volumes reached Dollars 100m at the end of the summer,
rising sharply following the drop in the rouble in October and the
accompanying increase in demand for dollar assets.
Market expansion, however, has not been without its difficulties and in
recent weeks trading volumes have been as low as Dollars 15m a day.
'Events have often pushed investors to the sidelines, creating frustrating
illiquidity and exacerbating price shifts,' said Banque Indosuez.
Traders say that lack of liquidity has created additional problems for
investors because a single large trade can influence the entire market.
'Western institutions and investors are quite wary of market manipulation.
Investors are aware of the risks but they worry about the lack of
transparency,' says Mr John Gibbens of Morgan Grenfell.
In particular, custody and settlement arrangements have left something to be
desired. The bonds are one of the few merging market issues for which
clearing must be done in the country of issue.
Although traders insist that settlement procedures are far better than those
in the local equity markets, this year's increase in activity put the system
under some strain.
The new traders' association, whose founding members also include
BCEN-Eurobank of Paris, ICFI-Moscow Partners, Aljba Alliance, New Alliance
Corporation, Moscow Narodny and Vneshtorgbank, aims to tackle these problems
by establishing clearly defined settlement procedures and market practices.
Much of its work will be along similar lines to that of the New York-based
Emerging Markets Traders Association, to which it is affiliated.
In any event, traders argue that the MinFin bonds are better value than
either the eurobonds - which have been trading recently at more than 80 per
cent of face value - or the commercial bank debt.
While unpaid interest continues to accumulate on the commercial debt,
investors in MinFin bonds enjoy the benefit of regular interest payments -
so the paper has a lower 'carrying' cost.
Ultimately, investors will be influenced by Russia's efforts to reschedule
its commercial debt, which would involve a resumption of debt service
payments and the probable conversion of overdue interest into a new bond
issue.
Success would be certain to increase demand for paper currently trading at
31 to 32 per cent of face value on the secondary market, possibly to more
than 50 per cent.
Despite allegations in some quarters of a lack of political will to achieve
an agreement, there has been progress in recent weeks. In a research note
published last month, Mr Daniel McGovern, fixed income strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said he expected an agreement within three to four months.
Mr McGovern, formerly chief economist to Russia's creditor banks' advisory
committee, believes Russia's ability to service this agreement is quite
strong. 'The nascent growth in the real economy, a solid macro-economic
adjustment programme for 1995, and large hard currency earnings underscore
Russia's shift towards economic recovery,' he says.
However, many dealers are sceptical. Following recent reports of talks, one
trader said: 'The market is getting a bit jaundiced.' Another told Reuters:
'I'm cynical . . . We've seen too many false starts.' For them MinFin bonds
 -relatively well insulated from Russia's stormy political process - may
represent a better bet.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Playing ball with Steady Eddie - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one thing on which there appears to be complete consensus after the UK
Budget last week is that the recent hard-won improvement in the public
finances will be thrown away before the next election.
It is not just that the record of Mr Kenneth Clarke's predecessors continues
to dog him as he vainly protests that there will be no return to boom or
bust economics.
His overtly political approach to the chancellor's job leaves the impression
that he simply itches to bribe the voters with their own money in 12 months'
time. A fiscal credibility gap yawns beneath him.
Yet if the markets have delivered a lesson in 1994 it is that a consensus
tends to form just as the flaws in the argument are about to emerge. The
message is reinforced by the thought that Mr Clarke has heard the argument
so often that he would be stunningly naive not to aim off for the likely
consequences. The greater risk may lie in accident rather than in
Machiavellian design.
Lord Lawson's mistakes, after all, stemmed largely from a genuine misreading
of the economic cycle. Where might the pundits have gone wrong?
One obvious potential flaw in the case is that Mr Eddie George, the Governor
of the Bank of England, now wields real countervailing power, thanks to the
chancellor's own decision to publish the minutes of their regular meetings.
Mr George might thus be able to press Mr Clarke into compensating for fiscal
laxity with monetary tightening.
This would prevent an inflationary boom at the cost of an overvalued
exchange rate and a deteriorating current account. We would then have a
British version of Reagonomics, in which the Governor filled Mr Paul
Volcker's shoes.
The difficulty with this is not just that it seems counter-intuitive,
historically, to talk of sterling strength when the economy is booming. It
would also be asking a great deal of the Governor. He would, of course,
justify his actions by reference to inflationary threats rather than fiscal
policy as such. Yet he might nonetheless be perceived by many to be
undermining the actions of an elected politician and senior member of the
cabinet.
Even a fully independent central banker would not contemplate that lightly,
especially before an election. Would the markets come to his aid by
delivering an old-fashioned sterling crisis to create the conditions for
more prudent policymaking?
It is not difficult to put a case that the British economic recovery is
built on unstable financial foundations. With North Sea oil running down,
the current account has not been in surplus since 1985, while long-term
capital outflows have grown remarkably (see chart).
When the current account deficit and the long-term flows are put together in
what used to be known as the basic balance, a picture emerges of huge
portfolio outflows, financed by short-term inflows.
The extent to which British investors have been acting as long-term bankers
to the rest of the world becomes apparent in the second chart, which
contains the stunning statistic that Britain emerged as a bigger exporter of
portfolio capital in 1993 than Japan.
The position would have looked even more unstable were it not for the
support of US portfolio investors, who raised their purchases of UK equities
from Pounds 37bn to Pounds 49bn last year. In short, the chancellor is
hostage to foreign financiers to a quite extraordinary degree. How long will
he be able to maintain confidence in sterling?
Quite possibly for longer than he may deserve, because the figures are
improving miraculously. The Treasury is forecasting, not implausibly, that
the current account deficit will shrink from Pounds 10.5bn in 1993 to only
Pounds 4bn in 1994 and Pounds 3.5bn in 1995.
As for long-term capital flows, last year's figures look, with hindsight,
increasingly freakish. In the first half of 1994 the net portfolio outflow
was transformed into an inflow of Pounds 29bn, chiefly because of
repatriation of funds by domestic investors.
Yet this, too, looks freakish in the other direction. It is the first time
since the last quarter of 1987, which saw the October stock market crash,
that UK investors have repatriated funds. The more normal pattern is for
long-term outflows to accompany current account deficits. What grounds are
there for thinking that the future will be any different?
Capital flows are notoriously awkward to predict. But if Britain's
increasingly mature pension funds respond to the decline in their cash flow
and to new minimum solvency requirements by selling overseas equities in
exchange and more boring gilts, the capital account may become more stable.
Yet there are some, including Frank Russell, the pension consultants, who
argue that UK funds should diversify not less but more overseas, to reduce
their 60 per cent over-exposure to a single volatile asset class, UK
equities.
Then there is the likelihood that US mutual funds will sell UK equities as
American investors return funds to the banking system or to higher yielding
bonds. Or, again, the possibility that US pension funds, like the big
Japanese insurers, will lose their appetite for global diversification.
Yet the real joker in the pack may not be sterling but Mr Clarke. If he has
concluded that one more boom and bust would finish both him and his party,
he might just deliver a well-judged budgetary package that keeps both his
fellow Tories and the markets at bay. And he may play ball with Steady Eddie
because the ageing of the population has changed the politics of higher
interest rates: Ken the pensioner's friend.
This is not the consensus wisdom. But the odds on it look consolingly better
than the National Lottery.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Myth of empty sovereignty - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In France 'the notion of the unsurrenderable sovereignty of the 'Etat
nation' still carries weight, although this sovereignty has long since
become an empty shell.' Thus did Mr Karl Lamers, writing for the Christian
Democratic Union in a paper published just before the German parliamentary
elections, condemn French hesitation in taking concrete steps towards 'the
goal of a strong and integrated Europe capable of effective action.' In a
subsequent article for the FT (November 7), he extended this assessment to
all European states.
The view that sovereignty is empty has become a cliche in the debate on
Europe's future. Yet it is nonsense. French sovereignty is not empty, if by
sovereignty is meant the ability to pass laws conducive to the prosperity of
the people. Nor is this true only for a large country like France. The
fallacy is the identification of sovereignty with power. The ruins of the
Soviet empire are testimony to the extent of this mistake. The search for
the omnipotent state proved a sure route to its collapse.
It is true that sovereignty may also depend on a state's ability to sustain
political independence. This century has demonstrated that very few
countries are securely sovereign in this sense, perhaps the US alone. But
this does not mean that all the others are economically impotent. To assume
this is to confuse international economic transactions with war.
Needless to say, this mercantilist viewpoint is not restricted to Germany.
Listen to Elisabeth Guigou, formidably able French minister for European
affairs during the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty. She writes, in a
book which contains a position on European affairs close to that of Mr
Lamers, that 'divided, Europe would more than ever be the prey of the big
economic powers'.* A European crisis would 'leave each country alone to face
the American and Japanese mastodons'.
To understand why such fears are mistaken, one must turn one's gaze from
Europe to the other end of Eurasia. There we find a long-united colossus
around whose periphery hang three insular economies and a
politically-divided peninsular. The populations of these four vary in size
from 10 per cent of their neighbour's to less than 0.5 per cent. For
decades, all four were forced to look to world markets for economic
opportunities. In doing so, they found themselves confronting tariffs,
discriminatory quantitative restrictions and arbitrary 'anti-dumping'
provisions.
Here then must be the hapless prey of which Mme Guigou writes. But one of
them is, of course, Japan, the others being South Korea, Taiwan and Hong
Kong. Consider defenceless, free-trading Hong Kong, with its tiny population
of 6m. It has, according to the World Bank, attained a real income per head
greater than French or British levels and more than 10 times higher than
mainland China's. Its economy also grew at an average rate of 6.7 per cent
between 1980 and 1992. But many other economies in the east Asian region,
both large and small, matched or surpassed this achievement.
Large and small, that is the point. Look at the table, which lists the
world's 12 largest countries by population (with the European Union included
as one country). Are big, politically powerful countries also rich ones? The
US is, as are the EU and Japan. But take a look at China, India, Russia or
Pakistan. Have big countries enjoyed high rates of economic growth? Not
necessarily. On the whole, poor economies grew more quickly than rich ones,
because of the opportunity to catch up. But even this rule is not
infallible, as the Nigerian and Mexican disasters demonstrate.
Adam Smith argued cogently that free trade gives a country the same
opportunities as membership of a great empire. It fails to do so only if all
significant economies are rigorously protectionist. Then, indeed, it would
be necessary at least to be part of a trading bloc. There is, therefore, a
self-justifying prophecy implicit in the fears of those who advocate such
blocs.
Happily, this is not the world we live in. Many of the most successful
economies have, like Singapore, neither had large populations nor been part
of trading blocs. They have, instead, exploited opportunities for global
trade in what has proved to be an adequately open and competitive world
market.
To understand why this has worked it is necessary to appreciate how
governments are able to promote the prosperity of their people. This is
admirably explained in a book by Professor Russell Roberts of Washington
University in St Louis, by use of an imaginary dialogue between a television
manufacturer and David Ricardo, inventor of the theory of comparative
advantage.**
What then is the secret of wealth, according to the professor's David
Ricardo? It is to 'use your resources wisely. By resources, I don't just
mean the traditional natural resources of fertile land, oil and minerals,
but the know-how, education, ingenuity and drive of the people. Using your
resources wisely means giving the people the incentive to work hard and the
incentives to innovate, to take risks'.
The EU can do this, but so can (and have) Switzerland and Hong Kong. The
economic value of the EU to its members is not that, without it, the
economies of member states would be trampled underfoot by giants. It does
not depend on its being huge, but rather on its ability to induce members to
exercise sovereignty more wisely than they would outside it. Unless this is
clearly understood, the EU, for all its size, is doomed to poor performance.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Nickel in the LME spotlight - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When business starts at the London Metal Exchange this morning Russia will
be uppermost in many traders minds; and more particularly the north Siberian
town of Norilsk, site of the world's biggest nickel refinery.
It was concern about output losses following an explosion early last month
at the power plant supplying this refinery that was largely responsible for
last week's 19 per cent surge in the exchange's nickel prices. And the
general situation at Norilsk, faced with daunting financial and technical
problems, is giving rise to serious doubts about the plant's ability to
maintain production at last year's level of about 140,000 tonnes even if its
power supply gets back to normal quickly.
Norilsk needed 'a huge amount of capital and there is no sign that it is
getting any', said Mr David Allen, vice president for public and government
affairs at Inco of Canada, last week.
Inco signed a technical assistance protocol with Norilsk last year, but Mr
Allen said it was 'very difficult to conduct relations with them. . . they
have shown no interest'.
The company was so short of money, he stated, that it was failing to pay its
workforce for weeks on end and was being forced to cannibalise equipment to
keep going.
LME traders told the Reuters news agency on Friday that the three months
delivery nickel price, which closed at Dollars 8,952.50 a tonne, should
clear Dollars 9,000 easily and did not think Dollars 10,000 was an
unreasonable target in the medium term.
There will also be interest at the exchange to see whether or not copper,
its flagship contract, can continue the upsurge that was resumed last week.
A Dollars 116 rise on the week took the three months position to a four-year
peak of Dollars 2,943 a tonne at Friday's close. Traders said the next
resistance level was at Dollars 2,975 with Dollars 3,000 the main target.
'There have been quite a lot of financial institutions looking to buy into
the market,' one told Reuters.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Packer offshoot pulls out of
deal with cable group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications group set up as a
competitor to the government-owned Telstra, has announced that Mr Kerry
Packer's Publishing &amp; Broadcasting (P&amp;B) had abandoned plans to invest
ADollars 318m (USDollars 245m) in it. The investment would have bought P&amp;B a
15 per cent stake in Optus.
P&amp;B was created last month by the merger of Mr Packer's magazine publishing
and television interests, which include the leading Nine Network channel.
When the Optus deal was announced in April, it was seen as an attempt by Mr
Packer to gain a foothold in the fast-evolving world of 'superhighways' and
pay-TV.
Optus and Nine, plus two other partners, subsequently announced that they
were forming a joint venture company, called Optus Vision, to build a
national cable network.
This would be used both for pay-TV and local telephony services, breaking
Telstra's monopoly in the latter area.
However, P&amp;P never completed the Optus investment, and suggestions that Mr
Packer might not pursue the deal began to circulate after the government
decided that it would not allow Optus Vision exclusive rights to cable any
particular geographical area. Instead, it said laying duplicate networks by
Optus and Telstra would be permitted.
Optus Vision threatened to drop its cabling plans, but the government has
refused to budge. If Optus Vision sticks to its threat, Telstra - which has
linked up on the pay-TV front with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -
will be the only cable infrastructure provider.
In its announcement, Optus said only that it was disappointed, but
'respected their (P&amp;B's) right to make investment decisions according to
their own priorities'.
The telecoms group, which competes with Telstra in the long-distance and
cellular phone markets, is currently owned by a mixture of institutional and
corporate investors, including Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Mayne Nickless,
the AMP Society and Bell South of the US. It has said that it plans to float
on the stock market next year.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Moody's may upgrade two
Norwegian banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, said it has placed the long
and short-term ratings of Den norske Bank (DnB) and Christiania Bank,
Norway's two largest commercial banks, under review for possible upgrade.
Norway's banks have emerged this year from their deepest crisis since the
second world war.
For DnB, Moody's said the review would affect Dollars 160m of long-term
debt. 'This review was prompted by the bank's continued progress in reducing
the level of non-performing loans,' the agency said. In November, DnB
reported nine-month pre-tax profits nearly trebled to NKr2bn (Dollars 291m)
from NKr720m last year.
The volume of non-performing loans fell by NKr3bn to NKr7.2bn from the start
of the year with one third of the fall occurring in the third quarter.
Moody's said the review of DnB would focus on the bank's prospect's for
continued improvement in asset quality and on its ability to sustain
adequate profitability levels.
For Christiania Bank, Moody's said the review would affect Dollars 550m
worth of long-term debt and would focus on the bank's longer-term ability to
maintain sustainable pre-provision profitability levels and on the outlook
for further reductions of the bank's non-performing assets.
Last month, Christiania reported nine-month pre-tax profits nearly doubled
to NKr1.12bn as gross non-performing and doubtful loans were reduced by 27
per cent to NKr11bn. Net non-performers fell 37 per cent NKr3.6bn.
The bank recently announced that it had disposed of one-third of its
troubled fisheries loan portfolio in the US, reducing its outstanding loans
in Seattle to Dollars 127m from Dollars 323.5m, and said it will not have to
report further loss provisions in the fourth quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quebecor Printing, North America's second-biggest commercial printer, is
finally acquiring HunterPrint, the lossmaking UK printer, for about CDollars
3m (USDollars 2.2m).
HunterPrint will be Quebecor Printing's first foothold in Britain and it
plans further expansion soon, said Mr Pierre Karl Peladeau, president of
Quebecor Group and in charge of the Canadian company's European expansion.
Quebecor Printing in turn is a subsidiary of the Quebecor Publishing Group
based in Montreal and controlled by the Peladeau family.
Quebecor has been negotiating to buy HunterPrint for two years. Now it is
offering 2p a share for the ordinary shares and a further amount for the
preferred. It already has 54 per cent of the ordinary shares committed under
its offer.
HunterPrint, after a recent asset sale, has annual volume of about CDollars
80m. Quebecor is negotiating with trade creditors and will put new working
capital into HunterPrint.
Early this year, the auditors of debt-burdened HunterPrint expressed
'fundamental uncertainty' over its prospects as a going concern.
In August in an attempt to cut debt, the Corby-based company sold its only
active subsidiary, Hardy Printers, to a management buy-out team for Pounds
1.85m (USDollars 2.88m).
At the time, the company said that even after the disposal, it would 'only
have sufficient working capital for its current requirements through the
continued support of its existing bankers'.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Radical changes for Stillwater -
The platinum group could double production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stillwater Mining, the only producer of primary platinum group metals
outside South Africa, is to be floated on terms that value the Montana-based
company at about Dollars 230m.
Last year, Stillwater produced 3 per cent of the world's platinum and
palladium, metals essential for some anti-pollution catalysts. Apart from
South Africa, Russia's Norilsk is a big producer of platinum metals, but as
a by-product from its nickel operations.
Some Dollars 40m of the Dollars 54m net proceeds from the offering will go
to help double production by mid-1997.
In 1993, output was 66,000 troy ounces of platinum and 218,000 oz of
palladium. If the first expansion is successful, Stillwater might develop a
second underground mine to quadruple output.
A 'red herring' prospectus issued to international investors shows
Stillwater to have one of the richest platinum-palladium deposits but also
to be one of the highest-cost producers.
Nevertheless, the new management suggests it could become one of the
lowest-cost producers by implementing the expansion plan, by making radical
changes to mining methods and by building a base metals refinery.
This would extract copper and nickel from the ore locally whereas at present
Stillwater has to send material to Belgium for processing by Union Miniere.
Stillwater, which started operating in 1986, was jointly owned until
recently by Chevron, the US oil company, and Manville Corporation, one of
the US groups that suffered financially from a previous involvement in
asbestos mining.
Chevron, as part of its strategic decision to quit mining, disposed of its
stake in September. Stillwater funded the purchase of Chevron's holding by
privately placing shares and subordinated notes worth Dollars 49m.
Now the company intends to offer 4.5m shares and Manville will offer 1.2m
Stillwater shares at between Dollars 12 and Dollars 14 each. They shares
will be traded on Nasdaq.
Co-lead managers of the issue are Salomon Brothers, Kemper Securities and
Fleming Martin. Manville will cut its holding in Stillwater from 50 to 31
per cent - or 27 per cent if an underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised.
Stillwater suffered a net loss of Dollars 5.63m on revenues of Dollars 53.8m
last year, including a Dollars 7.9m one-time provision arising from the
reorganisation of the Chevron-Manville partnership.
For 1992, there was a net loss of Dollars 5.4m on revenues of Dollars 46.2m.
In the first nine months of this year Stillwater made a net profit of
Dollars 2.1m compared with a Dollars 1.5m profit in the same period a year
earlier.
Average cash costs fell to Dollars 177 a troy ounce last year against
Dollars 191 in 1992.
However, in the first nine months of this year, cash costs went up to
Dollars 183 an ounce because Stillwater's smelter was closed for three weeks
for maintenance.
Average realised prices last year were Dollars 376 an ounce for platinum and
Dollars 125 for palladium. In the first nine months of this year realised
prices were Dollars 377 and Dollars 124 respectively.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rothmans parent ahead at midterm

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and luxury goods group, has reported a 13.5
per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 352.9m (Dollars 550m) in the six
months to September 30, thanks largely to strong growth for its products in
far eastern markets.
The Zug-based group said sales advanced 7.6 per cent to Pounds 1.88bn, and
operating profit was up 11 per cent to Pounds 339m. It looked forward to
'satisfactory' trading results in the full year.
Sales of the tobacco division rose 4.3 per cent to Pounds 1.27bn. The volume
of cigarette sales was slightly ahead, with the main gains coming from Japan
and the UK.
Operating profit from tobacco jumped 15.1 per cent to Pounds 249.5m, thanks
to higher UK sales, price increases in France and higher sales and
production cost reductions in Malaysia.
Revenues of the Vendome luxury products subsidiary rose by 15.3 per cent to
Pounds 605m, and its operating profits gained 10.8 per cent to Pounds 98.2m.
All the company's major product lines, including Cartier jewellery and
watches and Dunhill leather goods, increased their sales. Growth was
strongest in far eastern markets.
Losses on other activities widened to Pounds 2.5m from Pounds 2.3m, as the
costs of developing the company's pay-TV interests in Europe more than
offset a Pounds 5.2m profit from the US catalogue retailing investment.
Additional investment in the pay-TV networks would be needed.
Group operating profits were reduced by Pounds 3m in goodwill write-offs in
the half year. In the comparative period last year, there was Pounds 0.9m in
goodwill write-offs and Pounds 12m in restructuring costs.
Pre-tax profits were boosted by net investment income of Pounds 16.9m, down
8 per cent.
Attributable profit was up 16.8 per cent to Pounds 112.8m or Pounds 19.64
per unit of shares in the Swiss company and its main Luxembourg subsidiary.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Budapest picks advisers for gas
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Creditanstalt Securities of Austria and Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, have won a mandate to advise the City of Budapest on the privatisation
of its gas supply company, the largest in Hungary.
The decision is a blow for NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, which is
advising the Hungarian government on the sale of the country's five regional
gas supply companies and had also hoped to advise the City of Budapest.
The decision to appoint advisers comes after last week's announcement of
government plans to privatise most of its energy industry, including 100 per
cent, less one golden share, of the regional gas supply companies, over the
next three years.
The City of Budapest, however, has yet to decide whether it will sell off a
majority stake in its gas company, which serves the capital's more than 2m
inhabitants.
According to Mr Gabor Demszky, the mayor, the privatisation of the company
will run in parallel with the sale of the state supply companies but the
city will decide on how much to sell off after next week's local elections.
International tenders offering majority stakes in the regional companies to
strategic investors are due in the spring and have attracted strong interest
from most of Europe's large gas companies.
Budapest Gas Works had fixed assets of Ft31bn (Dollars 281m) and revenues of
Ft26bn (Dollars 236m) in 1993. It supplied 2.5bn cubic metres of gas to more
than 700,000 industrial and domestic consumers.
The market price of the company, however, will depend on how much the
government allows gas prices, which are presently below world levels, to
rise.
The government, which still controls energy prices, is due to announce a
decision this week.

Ulster Bank, the Irish subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, has applied
for approval under Irish monopolies and mergers legislation to buy NCB, the
second largest Dublin stockbroker, for IPounds 25.5m (Pounds 25.1m).
The deal follows eight months of negotiation and will involve a payment of
IPounds 10.5m with another IPounds 15m over five years depending on
performance.
Mr Dermot Desmond, the broker's non-executive chairman and 56 per cent
shareholder, stands to receive more than IPounds 14m. At least IPounds 6m of
this will be paid initially, but Mr Desmond may actually receive a larger
portion up front as he is leaving the company. The rest will be split
between 35 other employees who own the balance.

FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Century Inns poised for debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Century Inns, which owns 300 pubs in north-east England, is planning to come
to the market early in the new year.
The group, which is expected to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 60m,
is aiming to raise more than Pounds 30m of new money. This would enable it
to repay much of its total loan capital and borrowings, also of just over
Pounds 30m, reducing gearing from 150 per cent to between 30 and 40 per cent
and allowing for further expansion.
Mr Alistair Arkley, chief executive, was unfazed by Thursday's last-minute
withdrawal of its flotation by Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer. 'Ours is
an entirely different business,' he said. 'We are in an oversupplied market
as a buyer, rather than a producer.'
Century was born as a Pounds 32m management buy-in in November 1991. Mr
Arkley, former managing director of Brent Walker Brewing and Trading, and
two colleagues formed the company to buy 185 tenanted pubs from Bass.
'We quickly saw opportunities to expand,' said Mr Arkley. 'We probably did
the fastest ever refinancing of an MBI - for very good reasons.'
The management raised a further Pounds 20m and did three deals that added
another 100 pubs to the chain by June 1992.
Mr Arkley believes his management team is strong enough to support a chain
of 500 pubs - 'beyond that you need another layer of management'. The team
was built up as people became available after the shake-out caused by the
anti-monopoly beer orders.
' We want to continue picking up pubs by tweaking debt and from the cash
thrown off by the existing business,' he said.
Most of the current pubs are tenanted houses. 'In order to improve profits
we have to get the rents up and sell more beer,' he said. 'Basically we are
wholesalers of beer and advisers to three-year tenants.'
However, he aims to expand the managed house side of the business, which
comprises just four pubs at present, and sees the future in family
facilities and catering.
Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of September rose from Pounds 4.66m
to Pounds 5.69m on sales of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.8m). Interest payable
fell from Pounds 3.42m to Pounds 2.83m, reflecting the repayment of Pounds
2.5m of debt.
Mr Arkley believes the latest figures are indicative of the underlying
growth in the business, which has the same number of pubs as it did the
previous year. Operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 8.39m in a
market that fell 4 per cent.
The management, which will be selling some shares, owns 19 per cent of the
business - a stake which would fall to about 10 per cent on flotation.
Schroder Ventures, with 67 per cent, and First Britannia, with 12 per cent,
have not decided how much of their stakes to sell.

FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Jacobs agrees Pounds 22m bid for Embassy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<TEXT>
John I Jacobs, the shipping company headed by Sally Line founder Mr Michael
Kingshott, has made a Pounds 22m recommended offer for Embassy Property, a
group in which he has a 6 per cent stake.
Mr Kingshott, chief executive, said he intended to build up Jacobs as a
shipping, transportation and property group, but Embassy's two largest
developments are likely to be sold off to generate cash.
The company is also close to finalising the purchase of the car delivery
business of BRS, a subsidiary of NFC, the logistics company.
Jacobs is offering one new share for every 65 Embassy shares. This
represents a 35 per cent premium to Embassy's share price before it
announced negotiations for the deal. At Jacobs' closing price on Friday,
this represented 1p per Embassy share, compared with the company's stated
net asset value of 0.84p.
However, Mr Kingshott said: 'There is unrealised value to come out of the
development properties, the properties are all valued at cost and there are
Pounds 16m of tax losses'.
The transaction would enlarge Jacobs' issued share capital by 51 per cent,
leaving Mr Kingshott with 12 per cent of the company, down from 15 per cent.
The deal is contingent on shareholders' approval and 90 per cent
acceptances.
He said buying into a company with property management expertise would help
develop the group's existing assets, such as warehousing. In addition,
Jacobs plans to move into port ownership. It already manages Thames
Europort.
The company also announced that Sheertrucks, purchased from Mr Kingshott and
partner Mr Colin Williams last June, achieved profits of Pounds 678,300 in
the year to October. As a result, the vendors will receive the maximum
deferred consideration of Pounds 1.1m in new shares priced at 50p.
