FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers to expand via Pounds 105m
syndicated loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Close Brothers Group, the merchant bank, is expected to announce today that
it has taken out a Pounds 105m syndicated loan to finance further growth of
its own loan book.
Of the funds Pounds 65m will be used to fuel an expansion of its asset
finance and leasing operations, which stands in contrast to flat lending by
the UK clearing banks.
'We've been growing the loan book pretty quickly when others have been going
backwards or sideways,' said Mr Rod Kent, managing director.
Close Brothers's lending has benefited from strong growth at its core
clientele of domestic small and medium-sized businesses. They have recovered
more rapidly than the large companies to which the UK clearing banks are
most exposed.
Factoring operations, Close Brothers's own included, have reported growth in
turnover at clients of 20 per cent this year. Lenders to small companies
have also suffered less from the shift of corporate borrowers from banks to
capital markets.
Close Brothers obtained the loan from a syndicate led by Barclays Bank at a
spread of 35 basis points over the London interbank market.
That compares with 60 basis points when the bank borrowed last year; the
change demonstrates the liquidity and narrowing of spreads on the syndicated
loan market.
The bank specialises in factoring and financing the purchase of print
machinery and insurance premiums.
Its loan book has grown at a compound rate of 25 per cent over the last four
years and stood at Pounds 406m in July.
Close Brothers, the fifth largest quoted UK investment bank, sustained its
record of unbroken profit growth over the last decade in its last annual
results. The company announced pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 ahead
from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 33.1m.

FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Beverley holders to decide over CVA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beverley Group shareholders are faced with the most crucial of recent crisis
decisions, after their company proposed a Company Voluntary Arrangement to
stave off liquidation.
According to Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, it should be an easy choice.
Liquidation would return nothing to shareholders, and only 0.6p in the pound
to unsecured creditors. A CVA will offer 4p in the pound to creditors.
A CVA provides for partial repayment of creditors, but leaves a clean shell
company with a solvent operating business, and therefore some future.
This may be only limited consolation for shareholders who have seen the
value of their investment plummet from 68p in 1990 to their pre-suspension
price of 6 1/2 p last June.
The company never fully recoverered from its failed bid for James Wilkes in
1992, which cost more than Pounds 2m. A series of asset disposals in
January, many to companies controlled by Beverley's directors, did little to
halt the slide. The final blow was a failed reverse takeover by a Hong Kong
Chinese group, costing another Pounds 450,000 in fees.
Mr Robinson claims that Beverley has one potentially profitable business,
Beverley Fluid Engineering (BFE), which has been starved of cash due to
parental difficulties.
By providing a structure for repaying creditors, the CVA will take those
liabilities off the balance sheet. Mr Robinson said this should add about
Pounds 3.5m to Beverley's asset value. A CVA for its BFE subsidiary will
enable part repayment of a Pounds 1.42m loan from its parent at an eventual
20p in the pound.
Beverley plans a placing to raise about Pounds 450,000, which will be
channeled straight into BFE, providing the funds necessary to pay off
creditors, who will receive tranches in April and May 1995, and April 1996.
Creditors and shareholders meetings will both be held on December 20.

FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Harmony in pub and shop deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harmony Property Group has announced the sale of six public houses,
comprising its managed house division, to Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based
regional brewer, for Pounds 3.25m cash.
The six pubs, one leasehold and five freehold, are all in the south-east. In
the year to March 27 1994, they generated turnover of Pounds 1.7m with a
book value of Pounds 3.7m at that date.
In return, Castle Arcade (Cardiff), part of Bridger Properties, in which
Gibbs Mew has a 75 per cent stake, is selling Castle Arcade, a Victorian
shopping arcade in Cardiff, to Harmony for Pounds 3.7m cash.
Mr Ian Jefferson, a Gibbs Mew director, also holds 25 per cent of Castle.
Gross income of the arcade is currently Pounds 433,000 and is expected to
rise to almost Pounds 500,000 when fully let.
Harmony, which has changed from a leisure to a property based group, also
announced the sale of Arion Properties, which lets residential property in
Edinburgh, for Pounds 750,000 cash. Net assets at March 31 1994 were Pounds
800,000. Proceeds will be reinvested in core activities.
Harmony's interim results showed losses up from Pounds 323,000 to Pounds
602,000 in the 27 weeks to October 2, after charging a Pounds 464,000
provision this time for losses on the sale of public houses. Turnover was
Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 2.25m for 26 weeks) and losses per share came to 0.38p
(0.5p).
No dividend is declared, but the company said it planned a capital
reconstruction in anticipation of making payments next year.
Mr John Main, chairman, said Harmony was 'in its strongest financial
position for some years'. Rental income was in the order of Pounds 1.6m,
overheads had been reduced and gearing was 'now at a sensible level'.
Mr Tony Potter has resigned as finance director and company secretary. He
will be replaced by Mr Richard Mellish.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Russian gas giant approaches investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gazprom of Russia, the world's largest gas producer, has made its first
approach to international investors in the build-up to a planned offering of
9 per cent of its stock.
Gazprom is spearheading a drive by Russia's largest oil, electricity and
telecommunications companies to follow their domestic privatisation by
tapping international capital markets.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank which has been advising Gazprom
since May, is expected to make a formal approach to industry and financial
investors early next year. It emerged last week that Mr Rem Vyakhirev,
Gazprom's chairman, spoke at a private presentation to 150 fund managers and
other potential investors in New York on November 10.
Expectations about the speed of the transaction, and indeed its likelihood,
have dipped as the state of Gazprom's accounts has become apparent. Gazprom
has hired Price Waterhouse to get its accounts in order and the pace of this
effort to improve the quality of information for investors will be critical
in determining the timing of the offer.
Kleinwort and Price Waterhouse have to judge the accuracy of estimates by
the BP Review of World Energy that Gazprom controls 24 per cent of world gas
reserves.
They will also have to verify claims that in 1993 the company produced
nearly 10 times as much gas as Exxon of the US. Apart from evaluating the
worth of vast and scattered assets, the auditors will also have to assess
potential environmental liabilities.
Financiers doubt the feasibility of the timetable for the issue. One said:
'If you told me it would take 10 years to audit Gazprom I would not be
surprised.'
The resilience of interest in Gazprom was demonstrated again last week as
foreign investors bid up the small float of shares on the Vladivostok Stock
Exchange. It was reported on Friday that Gazprom offered a tranche at
Rbs16,315 (Dollars 5). At that price, Gazprom would be valued at Dollars
118bn (Pounds 72bn).
Another of Russia's biggest energy companies, Lukoil, plans to make a
presentation to investors this week, also in New York. Lukoil, which
produces 15 per cent of Russia's oil, plans to sell 15 per cent of its
equity.
Lukoil and United Energy Systems, the Russian electricity company, are
expected to have American depository receipts in place by the first quarter
of next year. They are following AvtoVAZbank, a regional Russian bank owned
by vehicle maker AvtoVAZ, which has already filed for ADRs with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Appetite for Russian stocks is strong and regional investment funds alone
raised more than Dollars 300m last month. But a dispute between a Russian
metals group and an aluminium smelter over the validity of a Dollars 300m
shareholding has reignited investors' fear about safe custody of their
Russian holdings.
Some sections of the Russian government also believe the giant energy
companies should be heavily regulated to prevent their abusing their
dominant positions.

The acquisitive catering and healthcare group, is expected on Thursday to
announce profits of Pounds 57m for the year to the end of September, sharply
ahead of the previous Pounds 41.5m. The rise has been driven by
acquisitions, the biggest of which is Canteen Corporation, the third largest
US caterer. It was bought in June for Dollars 450m, and is likely to
contribute about Pounds 7m this time. While underlying growth is seen as
steady, this year's rail strike is thought to have cost the group's station
catering business about Pounds 1m.

The television and television services group is expected to announce a

results for the year to the end of September. Analysts' forecasts range from
Pounds 169m to Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 126.1m last time. It is
likely that the company, which has been showing strong growth in its main
businesses - video duplication, film processing and television - will come
in at the top end of the range.

Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retailing, financial services and

Attention will again focus on the secretive group's Pounds 1.5bn cash pile,

FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): City switched on for illuminating
results - RECs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity companies' (recs) interim results season gets into
full swing this week with the City expecting high dividend increases
following the 21 per cent rise announced on Thursday by Seeboard, the first
of them to report.
Midlands tomorrow, Swalec (Wednesday) and Norweb (Friday) are all expected
to raise payments to shareholders by at least 15 per cent and possibly
considerably more.
Profit growth will also be healthy, although this will be of less interest
to the City as so much of electricity companies' profits are made in the
second half of the year including winter.
The City will also be looking for the companies' views of the forthcoming
flotation of the National Grid which the recs own. Seeboard surprised
investors by announcing that it would demerge its holding in the Grid by
transfering shares to shareholders if a flotation takes place.
This puts pressure on others to follow suit, although some will want to wait
until the conclusion of talks with the government before making an
announcement.
Northern Ireland Electricity is expected to raise dividends by about 15 per
cent when it reports today. Scottish Hydro-Electric, which announces results
on Thursday, is expected to lift payments by 8 to 12 per cent

FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Raised glasses should show a fair
head - S&amp;N/Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two brewers' results this week will exemplify the industry's trends and
investors' intentions. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, reporting today, has
outperformed Bass, reporting on Wednesday, in both beer and stock markets.
They share beer and leisure as their two main lines of business, but
Scottish &amp; Newcastle has done better than Bass in both. The main factors
behind a rise in its interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 145m from
Pounds 109m are the acquisition of the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain and expansion
of its Center Parcs holiday villages. Brewing profits could be slightly
ahead thanks to cost savings.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle is not the darling of the sector, however. The
speculation that it might pick up some or all of Courage is making investors
cautious.
Bass is expected to report a more modest rise in pre-tax profits for the
year ended September to about Pounds 540m from Pounds 508m. Its brewing
margins are likely to have slipped because of discounting and
rationalisation costs while it has done well to hold volume in a market down
about 1 per cent. Its pub estate has enjoyed a pick-up in profits, but it is
less well-developed than some others in, for example, food.
On the positive side, Holiday Inns has enjoyed rising occupancy and room
rates, particularly in the US. Under firmer management, it is raising the
standards of laggard hotels in its chain while expanding rapidly worldwide.
The good news for investors is that Bass appears to be changing its tune
slightly on beer. In the past its ambition was to defend its leading market
share, currently 23 per cent. Heavy discounting, particularly against
Courage, took a toll on profits. It still wants to be number one but it
placed more emphasis on profits and brand development in its trading update
two months ago.

General Electric Company and British Aerospace.
Many see this as a skirmish in a longer war between the two British
manufacturers - GEC's campaign, waged for more than a decade, to win control
of BAe.
Privately GEC's executives and advisers admit that the company's main reason
for bidding for VSEL is a spoiling exercise. If GEC's bidding can force BAe
to pay too much for VSEL - or if it can seize control of the shipbuilder
itself - then BAe would be more vulnerable to any takeover offer from GEC.
GEC does not, however, have the use of all normal takeover ammunition in its
battle for VSEL. It promised the Ministry of Defence - a hugely important
customer of all three companies - that it would refrain from publishing
tracts designed to undermine the credibility of its rival. The MoD wanted to
reduce the risk of an erosion of customer confidence in BAe, the UK's
biggest defence contractor.
But, as in all takeover battles, there is a secret war being waged by GEC
and its advisers - the merchant bank Lazard Brothers and the stockbroker
Cazenove - in which they express their views in confidential letters, such
as the one to MPs leaked last week to the Financial Times, or in private
conversations. The nub of the GEC case is that BAe has been leaking cash at
an unsustainable rate.
Similarly, BAe and its adviser, Kleinwort Benson, are equally damning about
GEC's capabilities - especially its competence as a defence contractor.
GEC's letter to MPs sets out claims about BAe's financial fragility, based
on an analysis of BAe's listing particulars. It highlights five trends about
BAe in the past three-and-a-half years:
an operating profit margin before 'exceptional' provisions of less than 1
per cent on sales of more than Pounds 35bn;
'exceptional' provisions for liabilities in the order of Pounds 1.5bn;
a cash outflow, before rights issues and the sales less purchases of
businesses, of Pounds 2.5bn;
a fall in shareholders' funds from Pounds 2.5bn to less than Pounds 1bn;
a failure to resolve the problems in commercial aircraft and aircraft
leasing.
The letter says that VSEL's cash would therefore be 'absorbed in covering
the cash outflow arising from the large losses accruing in other parts of
its (BAe's) business'.
The financial snapshot of BAe is made to look even more gory. A claim that
total effective indebtedness is more than Pounds 1bn is for example made by
including two classes of preferred securities which have some of the
characteristics of debt and also the company's net exposure to aircraft
leases.
Similarly, BAe's net assets are reduced sharply by deducting items not found
in the accounts of many substantial companies. These include:
prepayments to its pension fund of Pounds 113m;
undepreciated costs of launching aircraft at Pounds 486m;
the capitalised costs of rationalising operations, totalling Pounds 343m.
In response, BAe says that this analysis is based on a highly selective use
of financial data and is backward-looking.
Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance director, said yesterday: 'There is
nothing in these figures which is new to either our investors or our
bankers, both of whom apply far greater due diligence in interpreting BAe's
accounts.'
He said that the Pounds 2.5bn cash outflow did not give a true picture of
operating performance because it included a Pounds 1.2bn reduction in cash
held on account for customers. It also included a Pounds 900m cash drain
relating to businesses - such as the Rover carmaker - now sold.
He said: 'Confidence is about the future. During the course of the VSEL bid,
and unlike GEC, BAe has consulted with its large shareholders extensively,
and the management team has their full backing. This was clearly shown by
the successful underwriting of the two-part rights issue to finance the VSEL
deal two weeks ago.'
Nonetheless there could be further cash outflows at BAe. At the end of last
year, its balance sheet contained Pounds 1.34bn of provisions to cover
future costs, such as the net exposure to aircraft leases mentioned earlier
and the forecast expenses of reorganising its businesses.
As the reorganisation is carried out over the coming months and redundancy
expenses are incurred - or as lease payments are made without receipt of
rental income - then provisions will be translated into cash payments.
BAe's campaign concentrates on GEC's management and export record. Put
another way, GEC's propaganda is aimed mainly at the stock market, while
BAe's is probably more effective in influencing opinion in Whitehall and
Westminster.
BAe, for example, believes that GEC has not been able to establish itself as
a credible defence prime contractor - a role it would have to take as owner
of VSEL or indeed of BAe.
It alleges poor performance - project mismanagement, late delivery - in
three contracts worth Pounds 3.4bn in aggregate: the Nimrod early warning
radar system, the Spearfish torpedo and the Foxhunter radar system for
Tornado aircraft.
BAe has collated considerable evidence on GEC's relationship with its
workforce, which it describes as 'poor'. In GEC Marconi Avionics, GPT,
Yarrow shipbuilders and GEC Switchgear it cites examples of strikes or
breakdowns in talks with unions. BAe is also critical of GEC's management of
its Yarrow shipbuilding business, where growth in sales per employee is
alleged to be worse than that of Vosper Thornycroft, an independent company,
and no better than VSEL's. BAe also points out that Yarrow has been largely
unsuccessful in winning overseas business.
However, in the run-up to the trade secretary's decision this week, BAe's
strongest card may be its analysis of GEC's assurances on job security and
research and development given during its last big bid. GEC has said it will
keep Yarrow open for seven years were it to acquire VSEL. When GEC and
Germany's Siemens made a joint bid for Plessey, the MMC report and bid
documents contained statements that the two companies had 'no intention' of
cutting employment at the acquired businesses and would retain their
independent research facilities. BAe's analysis shows that Siemens has stuck
to these intentions but that employment at Plessey defence subsidiaries
acquired by GEC has been cut by 39 per cent. It also points out that Siemens
expanded the R&amp;D facility which it bought, while GEC closed Caswell,
Plessey's silicon research group.
However, such arguments may soon be irrelevant. If, as is likely, the trade
secretary allows GEC's bid to proceed, the battlefield will switch
exclusively to the stock market.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Sacked workers may claim up to Pounds 2bn if Lords reject
appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords will today begin hearing appeals from the administrators
of Paramount Airways, and the receivers of Leyland Daf and Ferranti, in a
case with far-reaching consequences.
If the appeal is rejected, thousands of employees who lost their jobs at
other companies which failed will also be able to make claims against the
receivers and administrators who took over the businesses. Such claims could
reach Pounds 2bn. Payments to individuals would depend on the case and the
employment contract.
The accountancy firm Arthur Andersen, the receiver of Leyland Daf, the
automotive group, and Ferranti, the electronics group, joins Touche Ross,
the administrator of Paramount, in today's appeal.
The case has been taken to the Lords because of a court ruling in March
making receivers and administrators responsible for the contracts of
employees at troubled companies.
If receivers and administrators kept employees on after a 14-day period,
they were deemed to have 'adopted' the company's pay and benefits
obligations.
The ruling, which made it more likely that employees would lose their jobs
quickly after a company failure, was superseded by the Insolvency Act in
May. This measure absolved receivers and administrators of responsibility
for employment contracts after the 14-day threshold.
But receivers and administrators are still potentially liable for jobs lost
at companies between 1986, the date of the previous Insolvency Act, and
March's court ruling. Because of time limitations on claims, the period for
which damages could be sought is likely to be between 1989 and this year.
Some workers will have taken new jobs and may not wish to pursue claims,
which could render the final payout much less than Pounds 2bn. In some
cases, claims would be met from the assets of the company to which
administrators were appointed.
In most cases, the claims will fall on receivers, who are personally liable,
unlike the administrators. In the Leyland Daf and Ferranti cases, the
receivers are in a good position to meet claims because they still hold
assets from the companies involved.
If the Law Lords grant the appeal, the threat of having to meet huge claims
will be lifted from the insolvency profession.
A judgment is expected in the new year.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: French pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French capitalism continues to struggle without adequate capital. The
combined market value of domestic equities last year was equivalent to just
40 per cent of GDP. That compared with the UK's 128 per cent. The problem
will partly be alleviated by the privatisation programme which, it was
hinted, might include the massive France Telecom. But France's equity
culture will be strengthened far more by pensions reform.
At present, pensions are distributed directly by contributions from the
active workforce: there are no capitalised pension funds to invest in the
market. But the present system is unsustainable: the welfare deficit, which
last year reached FFr40bn, is set to deteriorate rapidly as France's
population ages. The reforms, which are politically contentious and whose
structure remains unclear, should be enacted after the presidential
elections next spring. Whatever is decided, the insurance companies' role
will be pivotal. The acquisitions of Sun Life by UAP, and Equity &amp; Law by
Axa were partly motivated by the need to gain fund management experience.
The bourse will be significantly strengthened as fund managers are attracted
by equities' better long-term returns. With more stable long-term
shareholders, France's corporations will no longer have an excuse for their
complicated cross-shareholdings which protect management from the market's
discipline. None of this will happen overnight. But reform should eventually
provide France with twin benefits of adequately funded pensions and a
stronger stock exchange.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: German exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's decision by BASF to de-list its shares from all of Germany's
stock exchanges apart from Frankfurt is a significant step for Finanzplatz
Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre. This is the first time a big
German company has made such a move but it is likely to be followed by
others concerned to reduce the costs of multiple listings.
BASF's decision reflects the reality of Frankfurt's dominant position. Its
share of turnover in German shares has risen from 43 per cent in 1980 to 74
per cent last year. So far this year, over 70 per cent of turnover in BASF
stock has been handled in Frankfurt. But though Frankfurt has gained in
importance, continued fragmentation still allows price variation between
exchanges and impedes liquidity. It is also unwieldy for companies to raise
capital and comply with disclosure requirements at seven different
exchanges. Increasing concentration on Frankfurt means greater transparency
and liquidity, which benefits both companies and investors.
Should more companies follow BASF's route, it will help Frankfurt compete
more effectively with London for German securities business. The trouble is
that regional ties will prevent some of Germany's largest companies from
cutting their links with their local bourses - however financially
beneficial such moves might be.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Italian banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credito Italiano's hostile bid for Credito Romagnolo looks set to succeed.
The weekend's improved offer will be hard for Rolo shareholders to refuse.
It is certainly better for investors than the defensive merger with Carisbo
dreamt up by Rolo's management. The deal does not look so good for Credit's
shareholders. Since its privatisation last year, the bank has come under the
sway of Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank, and embarked on an
expansion strategy. In doing so, it is probably overpaying.
It is also bizarre that a relatively inefficient bank such as Credit should
be buying a relatively efficient one such as Rolo. How well each group of
shareholders is doing is shown in the accompanying chart: Rolo's share price
has outperformed Credit's by nearly 100 per cent since bid speculation
surfaced in September. One can only hope that some of Rolo's efficiency now
rubs off on Credit.
Where Credit is right is in its belief that Italy's banking sector needs
streamlining. Ideally, the country would sport a small number of truly
national banks rather than about 1,000 mostly local ones. Though Credit's
bid for Rolo will hasten the rationalisation, the process is still likely to
be slow. Some large banks such as government-controlled Banco di Napoli are
in such bad shape that nobody is showing much enthusiasm to acquire them.
Meanwhile, many smaller ones are controlled by charitable foundations and
local interests, which are often more influenced by political than financial
logic.

FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Insolvency options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There have long been complaints that Britain's banks are too ready to shut
down insolvent businesses. One reason is that banks have first call on a
company's assets, so liquidation may suit them even if it does not maximise
a firm's value. Trade creditors and shareholders may do better by keeping
the firm going but are unable to insist on it.
In last week's Budget, the chancellor promised action to prevent firms going
needlessly to the wall. In particular, he is considering an ingenious method
proposed by three economists for resolving the conflict between different
classes of claimant. In the simple case, when there are only banks and
shareholders, the scheme works as follows: the banks receive all the
insolvent company's shares; but each shareholder has the option to buy back
his shares by paying the banks an equivalent proportion of what they are
owed. According to the economists, the scheme is in the interest of banks,
as they either end up owning the company or receive their money. It benefits
shareholders, as they can buy out the banks if they think the firm is worth
more than its debts. It should also prevent needless liquidation, as whoever
ends up owning the firm will only wind it up if that is the best way of
maximising value.
The main criticism is that the scheme becomes unworkable when multiple
classes of creditor are introduced. In particular, small trade creditors may
not have the expertise to decide whether to exercise their options to buy
out the banks. The economists have an answer to this criticism: why not have
a market in the options? Specialist investors who do have the necessary
expertise would then be able to buy up the options of small creditors. Some
think the whole idea is too clever by half. But it is actually not terribly
different from trading in nil-paid rights.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Brussels move set to spark row over EU data protection rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is heading for a confrontation this week with member
states over plans for EU-wide data protection rules it claims are essential
for the development of home banking and other services on Europe's
information superhighway.
The move by Brussels looks certain to reopen arguments over the willingness
of European Union member states to adopt the measures needed to complete the
single market.
At present, the cross-border provision of financial products such as
mortgages and life assurance policies via a computer screen is limited
because data protection regimes differ. As a result, member states often
fail to exchange essential information because one is not satisfied that
sufficient protection exists in another.
Brussels' plans for EU-wide rules are due to be announced on Thursday by Mr
Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single
market. He believes that efforts to create an information society in Europe
'will be in jeopardy if there is no co-ordination of rules for the exchange
of data'.
The business world 'needs legal security to invest. With-out the confidence
of its con-sumers in their data, this enormous growth market will not get
off the ground,' says Mr Vanni D'Archirafi.
However, member states, notably the UK, will argue that the draft laws are
heavy-handed and will impose heavy costs on the private sector.
Britain is most concerned about plans to extend data protection rules to
information stored on paper. Data protection in the UK covers only
information stored on computer.
It is also opposed to a proposed commission requirement that individuals be
told if information they have provided for one purpose is to be passed on to
another institution for another pur-pose.
Ms Emily Marks of the Confederation of British Industry said it would cost
millions just to give consumers access to data stored on paper.
But a Brussels official said: 'If you exempt manual data you will create a
tendency to circumvent rules by using old techniques. We want to have
precisely the opposite effect, of encouraging new techniques.'
He also argued that the UK was exaggerating the practical implications of
the draft directive. Apart from a 10-year transition period that would be
granted for member states to adjust their rules, it would be possible to
apply the rules pragmatically.
Nordic countries are also worried that the data protection rules could
conflict with open access to public documents and rules on freedom of
expression.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Labour reform plans for royal family prompt Tory outrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is drawing up a comprehensive constitutional reform package that
would cut the cost of the royal family and prevent ministers from using the
antiquated rules of crown privilege to bypass parliament.
The proposals prompted outrage from senior ministers, many of whom believe
the Conservatives would win a general election fought on constitutional
issues such as the role of the monarchy and the UK's place in Europe.
Labour's proposals, which will be given a preliminary airing tonight in a
BBC Panorama documentary on the monarchy, are being drawn up by a Commission
on Democracy that will report to the party's 1995 conference.
Initial attention is likely to focus on Labour's proposals for a big
reduction in the number of royals carrying out official functions, heralding
a smaller monarchy along Scandinavian lines.
However, the commission is also considering fundamental changes to the
sovereign's residual executive powers, most of which are in practice
exercised by ministers.
The powers include appointment of officials without reference to parliament,
making foreign treaties and binding regulations by executive order, and
exempting government activities from the law.
The democracy commission is also considering the practical implications of
Labour's plans to abolish the right of hereditary peers to vote in the House
of Lords, and to set up assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the English
regions.
It will also confirm Labour's plans for fixed parliaments and propose a new
bill of rights.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, accused Labour leaders of
'trying to placate their leftwing activists with constitutional reform -
downgrading the monarchy, splitting up the UK, subordinating Britain in
Europe.'
However, Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, said Labour was
contributing to a national debate prompted by public disgust at the
government's failure to uphold high standards of public behaviour.

Today sees the award of the J O Hambro Businessman of the Year Award 1954,
handed out by former Bank of England governor Lord Kingsdown.
Proceeds from the luncheon at the Savoy Hotel are destined for the Joint
British Cancer Charities, while the prize goes to someone who has made an
'outstanding contribution' not just to business but to the community and to
the country in general.
All fine and good. But 1954? Well, that is surely the sort of date that
would fit with the blurb flagging what is actually this year's award. 'The
occasion will be a mixed one,' it states, 'and we hope that wives and
secretaries will be among the guests.'

Oh, the perils of those otherwise seductive emerging markets. The Dollars
50m Vietnam Frontier Fund, which has Bangkok merchant bank Finansa Thai
controlling 70 per cent of its management company, was minded to throw a big
bash for the opening of its Hanoi office.
Out went the invitations to the great and the good, whereupon the Vietnamese
authorities churlishly pointed out that the office itself had yet to gain
approval. The whole affair has had to be postponed.
If that were not enough, a Frontier Fund director has simultaneously been
delivering an object lesson in the hazards of decorating letterheads with
trophy names. When one William Colby applied for his Vietnamese visa, the
powers that be had not forgotten the former head of the CIA, who had spent
most of his war in Vietnam, orchestrating efforts to overthrow the Hanoi
regime of the day.
The application was politely rejected - demonstrating that the country's
enthusiasm for US investment dollars clearly has its limits.

Nice try. Next February being the 50th anniversary of Yalta, the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Library and the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute wanted to
mark the famous meeting between FDR, Stalin and Churchill in some special
way. The plan was to invite a troupe of scholars, historians and survivors
of the original event to Ukraine.
Sadly, however, commemorating the accord which essentially delineated cold
war Europe has proved unfeasible in the chaos that is the post cold war era.
So it fell to Verne Newton, director of the FDR Library, to call the thing
off. Livadia Palace 'offers a beautiful setting', he writes, but the
conditions sound like a challenge even for the most ambitious conference
organiser.
'Water is trucked into villages such as Yalta because of a drought that has
dried up the springs and other sources of water. The fuel shortage is also
acute which means there is little heat available.' There are other problems
as well, apparently, 'such as an outbreak of cholera'.
Hence the tentative rescheduling to either Ditchley or Cambridge, in April.
Not the same, somehow.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: Taking a bath
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Observer's learned readers spy greater depths of significance in Bill
Rooney's decision to stage his comeback - just over a year after being
kicked out of Spring Ram - via another bathroom goods supplier called
Atreus. A doomed family of classical antiquity it may be, this House of
Atreus, but it looks as if Rooney did his research. After all, where did
Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus choose to murder the queen's husband,
Atreus scion Agamemnon, on his return from Troy? In the bath, of course.
Another reader, meanwhile, believes the choice is not just symmetric, but
prophetic, too. For it was to the House of Atreus that Hermes gave a Ram
(Golden rather than Spring, but still) which conferred kingship on its
possessor. In one version of the myth, Atreus carelessly loses the Ram to
his brother Thyestes and, endeavouring to get it back, hits upon the idea of
feeding Thyestes with the flesh of his own children. Which has to signify
that Rooney is planning a bid for his old company during which he will make
mincemeat of the current directors. Doesn't it?

FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: All that is Gold-man?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A tricky year for Goldman Sachs draws to a close on a suitably downbeat
note. Profits? But a pale shadow of last year's Dollars 2.7bn pre-tax
extravaganza. Bonuses? Commensurately lean. Adding insult to injury, one of
its number has turned up his nose at the offer of a partnership - for only
the second time in the firm's 125-year history.
Investment banker Kevin Conway, whose name appeared two months ago on the
once so highly prized list, and who had until the end of last week to sign a
partnership agreement, has broken the news to Goldman that he is off to
become a senior principal at New York buy-out firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice.
Goldman's rivals could barely contain their glee. Surely Conway's decision -
following on from a similar slap in the face to the prestigious Wall Street
house delivered by another independent spirit two years ago - only went to
show that partnership had lost its lustre as a guaranteed route to riches at
this generally much-envied institution? The ghastly rumour of possible
capital calls on partners themselves this year also resurfaced.
Nonsense, says Goldman very firmly to that piece of mischief, reminding its
rivals both that the 57 partners signed up still constitute a record new
intake, and that, in the last week, it has just pulled in an additional
Dollars 250m in capital from a Hawaiian institutional investor.
Conway's defection is of course also a feather in the cap for Clayton,
Dubilier - even if one cannot help wondering just how much it had to fork
out to win him.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Electricity grid-lock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After five years, talks on liberalising European electricity have made
little progress. The European Commission is battling to win a compromise
from governments which are determined to protect their energy industries.
But it now risks surrendering its original goals.
One of the main aims is to bring European electricity prices in line with
costs. The present wide variations in prices between member countries are
not well explained by differences in costs, and distort competition within
energy-intensive industries. Liberalisation would combat those distortions.
An integrated European grid would also use capacity more efficiently in
servicing peak demand.
Industrialists are right to argue that such changes would bring cheaper
electricity to many countries. But the industry poses tough problems for
competition policy, partly because of its economics, with high fixed costs
and low short-run marginal costs - in the case of nuclear power, these being
close to zero. Moreover, governments understandably worry about security of
national supply.
Talks have stalled over the Commission's proposal to allow power companies
access to national transmission systems, so-called 'third-party access'. One
concern has been 'cream-skimming'. Many national utilities cross-subsidise
unprofitable customers, whom they are obliged to supply under public service
obligations, with revenues from lucrative customers. Under third-party
access, such public service costs would need to be identified and shared
among network users.
Another concern is that countries with excess capacity would 'dump' cheap
electricity. Belgium and Luxembourg, in particular, worry that Electricite
de France could undermine their energy industries by selling nuclear power
at close to short-run marginal cost. They would be wrong to turn down cheap
electricity simply to protect national industries. But they have a
legitimate worry about predatory pricing: if their industries disappeared,
prices of imports might rise to reflect the full costs of nuclear power.
Such concerns are best answered by the provision of information about costs,
and by a degree of regulation. Scepticism that countries would give a
regulator the necessary information may be justified. Yet without
regulation, access is unlikely to deliver the hoped for benefits, because
this will not be a freely competitive market. One reason is the presence of
so many public enterprises. A more specific one is the large nuclear
component which markets, unassisted by governments, are loath to support.
The current stalemate may not end, since access will produce both winners
and losers in the short term, even if liberalisation is in every country's
long-term interest. But the Commission should resist the recent French
proposal for a 'single buyer' of electricity in each country. The scheme is
unlikely to give even large customers a choice of supplier, or to offer
national generators real competition.
If talks do not progress, the Commission could take more governments to
court for breaching the Treaty of Rome's provisions on free movement of
goods. But this tool is, claims the Commission, limited in its
effectiveness: it tackles only questions of imports and exports, not of
distribution and transport. If that route were to fail, the Commission could
press for an energy chapter in the 1996 inter-governmental review of the
Maastricht treaty. No route is easy, but the Commission must at least hold
to the principle of third-party access, which is essential to introducing
competition.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Leading Article: After the round
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate's approval of the Uruguay Round has removed a great
uncertainty overhanging the future of the world trade system. The trade
deal's passage through Congress guarantees that it will go ahead, and that
the World Trade Organisation will be set up as planned. Now that the
foundations of the new order have been secured, work on its construction
must get under way in earnest.
The first priority is for other Gatt members, many of which have held back
from ratifying the round until Congress voted, also to complete the process.
The EU bears a particularly heavy responsibility, since any slippage on its
part could delay implementation of the round. But it is desirable that as
many other countries as possible also be ready to participate in the WTO
from the outset.
The second priority is to appoint a leader for the organisation. Gatt
members are due this week to try to choose between three contenders: Mr
Carlos Salinas, Mexico's former president; Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former
Italian trade minister; and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister.
However, regional and political rivalries risk producing a stalemate.
That threat must be averted if the WTO is to fulfil the ambitious mandate
given it by governments. The organisation's success depends crucially on
strong and clear-sighted leadership, particularly in its early years.
Failure to agree quickly on a candidate could leave it directionless. At
least as damaging would be a repeat of the recent compromise over the top
job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where Mr
Jean-Claude Paye will continue as a caretaker for a further two years.
The third pressing task is to conclude negotiations on China's WTO entry.
China's effective integration into the multilateral trading system is vital
to the future of the world economy. However, progress in the talks has been
hampered by obduracy in both Washington and Beijing. The former continues to
insist, unreasonably, that China join the WTO as a developed country.
However, the latter still seems to be balking at the basic obligations of
Gatt membership and the constraints they impose on policy.
Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round should allow the Clinton
administration more scope for flexibility on this issue. However, Beijing
must also provide more convincing evidence that it is genuinely committed to
respecting international rules. If the gap cannot be narrowed soon by the
two governments' trade negotiators, their leaders may need to intervene
directly in an effort to reach a political settlement.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Personal View: Signals herald growth, not inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is inflation about to take off in the UK? The broad picture of output levels
suggests that it is. The most recent Confederation of British Industry
quarterly survey revealed that 51 per cent of companies reported their
current level of output as below capacity - compared with an historic
average of 58 per cent. This trend is widely perceived as a sign of a
resurgence of inflation - even though rising investment will partly
alleviate the problem.
However, the aggregate numbers - even for manufacturing - disguise a widely
varying picture at the sector level. Indeed, the main implication of the
survey results on capacity utilisation is for relative profits growth in
different manufacturing sectors. This means that fears of a resurgence in
inflation are overstated.
It is clear that capacity shortages are heavily concentrated in basic
industries at the early stages of the production process, such as chemicals
and metal-manufacturing sectors. Only 23 per cent of chemicals sector
respondents reported that they were working below capacity compared with an
historic average of 51 per cent. Only 19 per cent of metal manufacturers
were working below capacity compared with 46 per cent in January 1994. The
percentage of metal manufacturers reporting that a shortage of plant and
machinery is 'likely to limit output over the next four months' has risen
from 6 per cent in January 1994 to 64 per cent in October.
Not only is plant capacity utilisation much higher in basic industries than
in the rest of manufacturing, it is much higher than at similar stages of
previous cycles. This is not generally the case for the rest of
manufacturing - those industries at the more intermediate stages of the
production process.
In 'engineering and allied sectors', which account for about 40 per cent of
manufacturing output, 60 per cent of respondents still report they are
working below capacity, in line with the historic average for this series.
The further along the production process we look and the closer we get to
the final consumer, the more spare capacity there appears to be. In the last
survey 83 per cent of drink and tobacco manufacturers reported they were
working below capacity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the price pressures which were evident
in the last survey were heavily concentrated in the basic industries. A
balance (the percentage of respondents replying 'up' minus the percentage
replying 'down') of +55 per cent of metal manufacturers reported higher
prices, compared with +9 per cent for the survey as a whole, even though
their unit cost balance was - 39 per cent, implying that margins are
expanding rapidly in these sectors.
In the official producer output-price series, the highest rise over the past
12 months has been in the basic metals sector. In chemicals, a survey
balance of +21 per cent reported higher prices in October 1994. In the
engineering sectors, the price balance was - 2 per cent and the cost balance
+8 per cent, implying margins are being squeezed.
The picture that emerges is that because basic industries - at the early
stages of the production chain - have much higher-than-average (and higher
than is usual for this stage in the cycle) rates of capacity utilisation,
they have greater price-setting ability than previously.
The more intermediate manufacturers, meanwhile, with much more spare
capacity, are being squeezed between their suppliers and the
still-competitive final markets, to which they are closer. This picture is
consistent with that which emerged from the recent company-results season,
resulting in quantum profit-upgrades for the likes of British Steel and ICI
going hand-in-hand with downgrades for companies such as BTR.
Eventually the capacity and price pressures in the basic industries may get
passed through the production process, but there is currently no sign from
the survey that this will happen to any significant degree in the
foreseeable future.
The main implication for the next one to two years continues to be for
relative sectoral profits growth rather than macro inflation. Even then,
rising producer prices will be partly absorbed by the highly competitive
retail and distribution sectors, particularly if consumer demand weakens
further in the face of the second tranche of tax increases next spring.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Temptations held out to shareholders: The Russian government
aims to make investing in private companies more attractive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an irony that a confectionery company named in honour of the Great
October Socialist Revolution of 1917 promises to open a new chapter in
Russia's capitalist development. But the public share issue that the Red
October enterprise launches today may have a significance far beyond whether
the Moscow company receives Rbs70bn (Dollars 22m) to upgrade its production
lines for its Clumsy Bear chocolates and Lobster Tail sweets.
The broader purpose of the issue is to construct a model for raising finance
that can readily be copied by other companies. If successful, it could show
Russian companies how they might access untapped pools of domestic and
international capital to fund their investment needs.
The architects of the issue, which include the UK government's Know-How fund
and a small army of Russian and foreign advisers, also aim to strengthen the
local stock market infrastructure. By linking brokers and financial
institutions through this issue, and encouraging the public to invest in
productive enterprises rather than speculative ventures such as the MMM
pyramid scheme, the project can help to broaden the shareholder culture. The
Know-How fund is paying for nine companies in five Russian cities to follow
Red October's path.
'This issue is about more than whether one small confectionery company can
raise some money. It is about how to point 14,000 cash-starved privatised
companies towards available sources of capital,' says one Moscow-based
stockbroker.
One perverse by-product of Russia's vast and rapid privatisation programme
has been to create a back-to-front capital market structure. Russia is
perhaps unique in having created secondary markets, which sprang up to trade
the shares of the newly privatised companies, before it developed primary
markets where companies could issue shares to raise fresh funds.
The reformers in the Russian government are aware of this weakness and are
intent on rectifying it. In an interview with the Financial Times last
month, Mr Anatoly Chubais, recently promoted to first deputy prime minister
after spearheading the privatisation programme, defined the government's two
chief goals for next year as economic stabilisation and the development of
effective securities markets.
Mr Chubais believes these processes must go hand in hand. If inflation is 15
per cent a month, nobody will invest - even in sound enterprises; but
economic stabilisation cannot be achieved if Russian companies still have to
rely on inflationary state credits. 'Our citizens must be stimulated to buy
shares in serious industrial enterprises,' he said this week. 'People do
have money and are ready to invest it in amounts the federal Treasury could
not even dream of.'
He suggested domestic savings had increased this year from Rbs5,000bn in
January to Rbs20,000bn by November. Teams of Russian and western experts are
working feverishly to create the mechanisms and legal framework to enable
this savings pool to be sucked into productive investments.
Red October is perhaps as good a place to start as anywhere. Founded in 1867
as Einem, after the German entrepreneur who created it, the renamed Red
October subsequently grew into one of the best-known companies in Moscow.
Its products have been popular with generations of Russians who have a
penchant for sticky sweets.
Its highly visible site, occupying a famous red-brick complex on an island
opposite the Kremlin, is a Moscow landmark. It is not hard to imagine the
day when the site alone could be worth more than the company's nominal
valuation.
Like all Russian companies, Red October has severe problems, but at least it
is financially stable - making profits of Rbs16.6bn on sales of Rbs71.2bn in
the first six months of the year - and appears to have good growth
prospects. Despite being Russia's biggest confectionery company, Red October
accounts for just 3 per cent of the national market. The big western groups,
such as Mars, Cadbury Schweppes, Hershey's and Nestle, are flooding the
country with their products and may pose a serious long-term threat. But
these multinationals claim to be expanding the market as a whole, rather
than grabbing share from local manufacturers.
The share issue itself is divided into three tranches. Of the 3.5m shares on
offer, 1.5m have been reserved for Russian institutional investors, such as
banks and the nascent investment funds, which are expected to have a keen
appetite. Another 1m shares have been allocated for international investors
and will be marketed in London through James Capel, the stockbroker, where
the extent of the interest remains to be seen.
Many western fund managers appear to have taken the conceptual leap that
Russia is a country in which they want to invest. The progress on economic
reform and the relative political stability of recent months, combined with
the seemingly low valuations of Russian assets, have already attracted
speculative funds. But mainstream investors remain deterred by the
rudimentary nature of the market infrastructure and the lack of information
on company performance.
One of the most impressive aspects of the Red October issue is how far it
has gone to help dispel the latter concern by significantly raising the
level of disclosure among Russian companies. A 48-page prospectus has been
produced containing a wealth of financial information and summaries of the
company's history and strategy.
Nevertheless, the document candidly highlights the high risk inherent in Red
October as an investment proposition. The rudimentary accounts are heavily
qualified by Deloitte and Touche, the auditor. It would be impossible to
launch a fund-raising exercise in a developed stock market on the basis of
the information provided.
Whether the issue is judged a success, however, will depend on the appetite
of private retail investors in Russia for the remaining 1m shares. Other
stockbrokers, which have tried to sell shares in solid Russian industrial
companies, have failed to excite much interest, being drowned out by the
noise of speculative funds which promise seemingly stratospheric returns.
Red October concedes its sales pitch is emotional as much as financial. Mr
Anatoly Daursky, Red October's president, thinks many local investors will
relish the opportunity to buy a 'part of Russian heritage'.
But there are critics of the Red October fund-raising who say such projects
are too complicated and inappropriate for this stage of Russia's economic
development. The expensive paraphernalia of a stock market fund raising
demands too much management effort. Besides, why should Russian companies
give away a big chunk of their equity when they are valued so cheaply?
'Is this a means by which the Russian equivalent of the Fortune 500 can
raise capital? I do not think so,' says one Moscow-based western financial
expert. 'It would be too much hassle to try to raise Dollars 1bn in packets
of Dollars 10 shares.'
Significantly perhaps, the giants of Russian industry, such as Gazprom, the
vast gas concern, and Lukoil, the country's biggest privatised oil company,
do not yet see Russia's equity markets as being sufficiently developed to
raise money, and are aiming to raise capital in international markets. Both
have already succeeded in raising multi-million dollar debt finance packages
from German and Japanese banks secured on hard-currency export earnings.
Both companies are also seeking to raise money through international equity
offerings. Gazprom will sell 9 per cent, probably through a private placing
arranged by UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. Lukoil aims to sell up to 15
per cent of its equity abroad and obtain a listing on the New York Stock
Exchange. It will be a tortuous process, but it has already taken on western
auditors to prepare the necessary accounts and has hired lawyers and
management consultants to reshape its business.
Whatever the balance between debt and equity finance, whether from domestic
or foreign sources, it is clear Russian companies must find new capital from
somewhere.
'If you believe in the economic transformation of Russia, then you have to
believe that domestic savings will be channelled through intermediary
institutions into fixed capital formation,' says one Moscow-based financier.
'What is clear is that if reform is to work, the government has simply got
to get out of that business.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Time to compromise. European Union finance ministers look set to spend
today's Ecofin meeting in Brussels squabbling over whether to lend Ecu85m
(Pounds 67m) to Ukraine, Ecu65m of which the country will immediately pay
back to meet an earlier debt. Germany is pressing hard for the deal,
believing that it provides the EU with a cheap opportunity to do
considerable good. France and the UK fear that the deal would set a
dangerous precedent for the future. But letting the Ukraine's reform efforts
stumble over such a paltry sum would be more dangerous still.
Ukraine's president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, has taken the country a long way in
recent months. Private land ownership has been legalised; agricultural and
energy prices have been brought close to world levels; and the budget
deficit is at last, slowly, being brought under control. Recognising these
and other achievements, the International Monetary Fund is negotiating a
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 910m) stand-by loan to support Mr Kuchma's efforts. As
ever, the cloud hanging over Ukraine's brighter economic future is the trade
account.
Ukraine needs to find a way to fill the looming Dollars 1bn gap in its
balance of payments for the fourth quarter of this year. The IMF has pledged
to provide around one third of this figure, while the US, Canada and the
Netherlands have offered around Dollars 100m between them. A show of support
from the EU would unlock further funds from the US and other G7 countries,
and a much-needed debt re-scheduling agreement from Russia, Ukraine's chief
energy supplier and creditor.
The British and French governments oppose the deal on the grounds that the
EU is not in the business of making balance of payments loans to distressed
countries. Only one country - Moldova - has been granted similar support in
recent years. And the Moldovans, at least, had already reached a formal deal
with the IMF, and were therefore locked into a full-scale macroeconomic
reform programme.
Russia ought not to be in the balance of payments financing business either.
Yet, as Ukraine's largest energy supplier, it has provided more than Dollars
5bn in import financing over the past two and a half years, mostly in the
form of unpaid bills. The Russian government has accepted that its help will
continue to be needed for a while yet. But it understandably balks at the
prospect of continuing a task which the EU values at less than Ecu20m. A
gesture is needed. The ministers could pledge the money now, on condition
that it is disbursed only when Ukraine's IMF facility is formally in place.
But pledge they must.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Feeder-reliever airports supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH BOYFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr D R Hopkins, chairman of the British Air Transport Association, has
clearly not read my report, Plane Commonsense, published by the Adam Smith
Institute (Letters, November 28). Otherwise he would not have made so may
elementary errors in writing about my study which puts the case for
developing Northolt and Redhill as feeder-reliever airports.
For instance, Mr Hopkins appears to be under the misapprehension that
feeder-reliever airports could only handle business aviation, but my
recommendations envisage feeder-reliever airports accommodating aircraft
handling up to 120 passengers at Redhill and up to 160 passengers at
Northolt.
My proposals hinge on the observation that there is no realistic possibility
of constructing additional full-scale runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick.
The political opposition to such a move is just too great. I agree with Mr
Hopkins when he points out that 'new capacity must be provided where it will
expand and complement existing facilities along the Heathrow-Gatwick axis'.
This is precisely what Northolt and Redhill offer.
As I stress in my report, these two feeder-relievers could also accommodate
many of the aircraft serving regional cities as well as restoring service to
airports such as Liverpool and Humberside. Indeed, it is estimated that more
than 25 per cent of the aircraft currently using Gatwick, but carrying a
mere 5 per cent of passengers, could transfer to Redhill. In peak times, the
percentage rises to 33 per cent, thus freeing a substantial number of
precious slots at Gatwick's single runway.
Mr Hopkins is also badly informed when he asserts that the airline industry
is not fully supportive of this bold initiative.
TWA, American Airlines, Manx and the European Regional Airlines Association
are just a few of the airlines and industry groups that have indicated their
support for the concept of feeder-reliever airports such as the ones I
envisage at Northolt and Redhill. This is in stark contrast to the
development of Stansted where only one carrier supported the BAA's proposals
and British Airways appeared as an objector.
Finally, the sale of RAF Northolt, coupled with the lease-back of an
improved VIP terminal, would enhance rather than detract from the facilities
available for the Queen's Flight and ministerial flights.

FT  05 DEC 94 / No need to bribe British voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become the conventional wisdom among politicians and commentators
that the only hope the Conservatives have of winning the next UK election
(due not later than the spring of 1997) is by extensive cuts in income tax.
I have not the faintest idea who will win that election; but the view that
the crucial factor is income tax cuts is fatally flawed.
The reasoning - to dignify it by that name - runs as follows. An
unexpectedly sharp economic recovery has neither produced a feeling of
well-being nor improved the very low ratings of the Conservatives in the
opinion polls. So a further bribe by way of income tax cuts is required.
Elections, of course, are not determined by economic circumstances alone.
Otherwise Margaret Thatcher's second election victory in 1983 and John
Major's victory in 1992 are inexplicable. The Thatcher victory of 1983 was
achieved at a much earlier stage of economic recovery than has now been
reached in late 1994. The evidence suggests that the 'Falklands factor',
which emerged after the defeat of Argentina in those southern islands in
1982, was decisive.
Admittedly the third Thatcher victory in 1987 is more convincingly
attributed to feelings of economic well-being. But the Conservative victory
under John Major in 1992 remains more puzzling. The prime minister won at
the bottom of a recession when unemployment was again sharply rising and the
poll tax debacle a recent memory. There was no overall rise in living
standards in 1991, the year before that election. The most likely
explanation is that voters were persuaded that there had already been a
change of government when Major succeeded Thatcher in late 1990 and wanted
to give the new prime minister a chance.
Obviously economic well-being has a large part to play, when there are no
special countervailing factors. The reason the present upturn has failed to
produce such a feeling is not far to seek. The best single measure of living
standards is real personal disposable income after tax. The average increase
in this measure since 1970 has been 2.7 per cent per annum. But in 1994 it
has actually fallen by up to 1 per cent. Take-home pay has been squeezed by
the delayed tax increases announced in the two budgets of 1993, introduced
when the scare about a supposed Pounds 50bn budget deficit was at its
height.
The sources of the present recovery have been net exports, investment and
consumer spending. The latter has been financed from a lower savings ratio
rather than higher take-home pay. Such an increase does not make households
feel as good as higher consumption financed from growing incomes.
But the dawn can already be seen. The last of the staggered tax increases
will be levied in 1995. The way is then open for real incomes to rise
roughly in line with pay, adjusted for inflation. The Budget Red Book does
not forecast real personal disposable income in its tables. But there is a
verbal reference to disposable incomes rising by 1 1/2 per cent in 1995,
despite the residual tax increases, This is also the view of the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research  - although the London Business
School foresees another year of the zero growth in that measure, with
recovery beginning in 1996. Even the LBS sees this variable rising by 2.3
per cent - near the long-run average - in both 1996 and 1997.
Of course these projections are fallible. But the underlying trend is for a
return to normal growth of post-tax real living standards. And if the
mainstream projections underestimate future economic growth, as they
probably do, the rise in take-home pay will be larger still. Thus people
will be able to increase consumption without running down the savings ratio
any further. Moreover, as recovery continues and job totals rise, there
should be more confidence in employment prospects, despite continuing
reports of dismissals by particular firms.
Any feasible 'tax cuts' will be only a fraction of the tax increases imposed
earlier in this parliament. They will also be a drop in the ocean in their
effect on living standards; and if tax cuts threaten the improvement in the
public finances, even the ordinary voter who does not follow the financial
markets will still pick up the confidence tremors; and Labour will be able
to go to town on fears about the sustainability of recovery.
Moreover, all the political gossip has concentrated on income tax, which is
now a relatively minor tax accounting for 25 per cent of general government
receipts. Once the correction in the public finances has been made, there
could be a modest adjustment in income tax bands in an average year to
offset the way in which people creep up into higher tax brackets as real
incomes rise. But unless or until there is a change in the structure of
public services which voters demand of government, the great bulk of the
increase in living standards will have to come from pay in the marketplace.
Nor is there reason to think a once-for-all obvious pre-election tax bribe
will work. To adapt English humorist Hilaire Belloc: there is no need to
bribe the English voters considering what he or she will vote for unbribed.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Feisty fighter for a level playing field: Emma Tucker on the
policy of Karel Van Miert, the EU's reappointed competition commissioner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the European Union's 20 commissioners, Karel Van Miert, the feisty
Flemish politician responsible for competition policy, is one who frequently
takes it upon himself to tell the world what Brussels is up to.
Only last week, he triumphantly announced record fines on a price-fixing
cartel for the third time in a year. The cement industry was his latest
target, but whether fighting collusion, blocking a merger, or approving a
state bail-out, his are controversial decisions.
The former socialist MP has been reappointed as competition commissioner,
for a further five years from January. But after his first two years,
industry is asking whether Mr Van Miert is the right man to ensure fair
play.
When Mr Van Miert took over the competition dossier from self-styled
crusader Sir Leon Brittan, many expected his socialist vision to herald a
less rigorous approach.
Some of these early critics have revised their views. 'People have a very
positive view of Mr Van Miert,' says Ms Bernadine Adkins, a Brussels-based
competition lawyer. 'They think he has been very robust and has pursued Sir
Leon Brittan's line.'
Mr Van Miert has aggressively tackled Europe's highly regulated telecoms
sector and reorganised the Commission's merger task force to achieve
speedier decisions.
But aggrieved groups remain, among them private steel makers struggling to
compete without subsidies and consumers still faced with inflated European
airfares.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the federation of
European industry, wrote earlier this month: 'The essential corollary of
competitiveness - a strict competition policy - is being applied without the
necessary rigour and determination.'
Criticism of Mr Van Miert's 'pragmatic' approach has been most strident in
relation to several vast, and highly political state aid payments, and the
collapse of a joint industry-Commission steel rescue plan - which cut little
capacity but distributed subsidies.
In these cases political considerations took precedence over a strict
application of competition rules. One example was the decision not to
prevent the French government from paying FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) to its
bankrupt national carrier, Air France - a capital injection almost
equivalent to world airlines' entire losses last year, according to Sir
Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland.
In Northern Ireland, the Commission decided not to block a vast subsidy to
Hualon, a Taiwanese textiles plant, which competitors said would add to
capacity and threaten jobs in an over-supplied sector.
'State aids continue to be authorised too easily by the Commission. . . . to
the detriment of just those companies that have undergone the painful
process of restructuring,' wrote Mr Tyszkiewicz.
Mr Van Miert does not bear sole responsibility for this. Each case goes to
the college of commissioners and airline cases are handled by the transport
commissioner. In cases such as Air France and Hualon, say his supporters, it
would be naive to think that Mr Van Miert could have acted against pressure
from two of the EU's bigger member states.
There are also those who argue that a strict application of state aid rules
would be inappropriate while unemployment in Europe remains high.
'Mr Van Miert's idea of pragmatic competition is a little bit socialist and
dirigiste, but it is also in line with the times,' says Mr John Ratliffe, a
Brussels-based competition lawyer. 'You can imagine the consequences on some
parts of Europe if he just waded in and threw people out of jobs.'
But, says Mr Graham Mason of the Confederation of British Industry:
'Pragmatism might have been the order of the day during the recession, but
when things get better it should most definitely not be.'
It could even damage the internal market, as member states try to sustain
industrial capacity at unrealistic levels, rather than create the conditions
for businesses to adjust to competitive pressures.
A pragmatic approach has also allowed the persistence of contradictions
within state aids policy.
Decisions are affected by 'a combination of sectoral and horizontal
frameworks which lead to different treatments for different industries
without any real justification,' said a competition official.
In the case of Hualon, it was the application of regional development
criteria that allowed Mr Van Miert to bend competition rules to allow the
subsidies to be paid.
A particular cause of complaint are industry agreements covering sectors
such as textiles and cars introduced originally for economic or structural
reasons. 'These are the result of special situations but they seem to be
kept for ever,' said a Commission official.
Another big criticism of competition policy is of the procedures used by
directorate general 4, the Commission's competition unit.
The investigation into the cement cartel, for example, took five years to
complete. The time taken to investigate cartels, and the legal uncertainty
created, upsets reasonable commercial timetables for taking investment
decisions, argues industry.
The Commission has committed itself to investigating cases more quickly.
However, swifter processing of cases can involve a trade-off with legal
certainty. For example, where companies are planning agreements which may
distort competition, the Commission has taken to issuing so-called 'comfort
letters', informal statements to the interested parties of its view on
whether or not the agreement is likely to be judged anti-competitive.
The good thing about comfort letters is that they can be issued quickly.
However, they do not bind the Commission to a final decision, they provide
no immunity from fines should the agreement be challenged, and they are not
binding on national courts.
Mr Van Miert has also been looking at ways of reducing the case load on DG4
officials by devolving some responsibility to national courts. But the
problem with such an approach is that the efficiency of competition
authorities differs considerably between member states and there is a danger
that the law will be applied unevenly.
But while Mr Van Miert's plans for procedural changes have been
well-received by industry, it is on high-profile state aid cases that his
record will be judged.
Mr Van Miert has stressed many times that he does not intend to allow any
further payments to companies that have already benefited from state
subsidies. But a battle is looming. Last month he disagreed in public with
the outgoing Spanish transport commissioner over whether second payments
should be allowed in exceptional circumstances. Mr Marcelino Oreja had said
that state bail-outs could be justified under such circumstances as a
currency devaluation.
This is precisely the case that Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, is
expected to make when it asks the Commission for approval of a second
tranche of capital.
For the sake of the Commission's credibility Mr Van Miert is likely to argue
that a one-time, last-time payment means what it says and not - as
Commission officials joke - one-time, until the next time.
But the stakes are high. The blocking of a capital injection to Iberia could
provide the Commission with the best proof yet that it is taking its
competition duties seriously; for the first time since Europe's skies were
supposedly liberalised, a state-owned, national flag carrier might go
bankrupt and close down.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Potential to challenge Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIMOTHY LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Germans 'face higher UK tax charges on the earnings of their
British subsidiaries' following Budget tax changes ('Japanese and Germans
face higher charges', November 30).
It is ironic that they should do so by virtue of provisions intended,
according to the Inland Revenue press release of November 29, to 'remove any
uncertainty' over existing rules, following the European Court of Justice's
decision that certain Dutch tax provisions gave rise to illegal
discrimination - see Halliburton Services BV (Case C-l/93).
Whether the proposed provisions are as non-discriminatory as they first
appear may be questionable. Of more general significance is the fact that
the UK Inland Revenue is now openly taking account of EC law in formulating
proposals for new corporation tax legislation.
Company tax advisers, for their part, ought to be just as interested in
applying the EC Treaty to tax laws already in force. Many significant
provisions, including those relating to loss-relief for groups of companies,
appear open to challenge in the right circumstances.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Petty broadcasting restriction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW STUTTAFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon (The FT Interview, November
29), claims to have heard that 'British delegates' in Brussels are now 'more
conciliatory' towards proposed EU plans further to restrict the amount of
non-EU material that can be shown on European broadcast media. One can only
hope that he is wrong.
In the past such a policy could, perhaps, seek some remote justification in
the limited broadcasting capacity then available.
Fortunately, with today's technology such an excuse can no longer stand. The
proposed legislation can now be seen for the petty anti-Americanism that it
really is. National quotas no more belong in the TV schedule than they do in
the book shop.
In defending this policy, Jacques Toubon may well find comfort in France's
authoritarian traditions. The 'British delegates', however, would have no
such excuse and no reason to be 'conciliatory'. The free flow of ideas
should not be negotiable and the sooner this is explained to the European
Commission the better.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No place for mutuality in Halifax and
Leeds building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR HARVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Miles is wrong on at least two counts when he refers (Letters,
November 30) to the obligations building societies have to their members.
First, building societies do not repurchase depositors claims - they give
members their own money back. Mr Miles's implication that there is some
similarity with companies not being obliged to repurchase their equity is
misplaced.
Second, Mr Miles thinks that building societies have an absolute obligation
to give members their money back, when members want it. Power over when, or
even if, a building society gives members their money back lies, I am
afraid, with the society. Tucked away in the rules of every society are
words which say that the board has the power to suspend or limit the payment
of withdrawals when, at its discretion, it considers it necessary. Societies
may use such power rarely, but they do have it.
The real reasons why the Halifax has chosen to convert is simple - a mutual
form of corporate governance for an organisation of its size and complexity
involving 8m members simply does not work any more. Members of neither the
Halifax nor the Leeds have in the past nominated, voted, attended or even
appointed proxies in any significant numbers. The operation of a credible
form of mutual corporate governance has to be based upon member involvement
and participation. And among the UK's building societies it just does not
happen. The fleeting exception might be when Halifax and Leeds members are
asked to support the merger and subsequent conversion. The only real
question at that point will be just how large the inducement will have to be
to get them to do even that.
And if Mr Miles wants to know what effect the operation of financial markets
will have on the Halifax directors' behaviour when it becomes equity based,
all he has to do is ask Mr Mike Blackburn, the Halifax's chief executive,
how much he already cares about the rating that Standard and Poor awards the
Halifax currently.
Whatever the strength of the strategic reasons for this merger might be, one
has to applaud the Halifax board for wanting to free itself from the
hypocrisy of a mutual constitution that is only being maintained by the most
basic of life support systems. The kindest course of action for the Halifax
is to pull the plug through conversion to end this particular form of
corporate diversion.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Forward planning or wishful thinking? - Antony
Thorncroft talks to director of the Tate Gallery Nicholas Serota about his
dreams for Bankside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Serota has been making a list . . . and indulging in a pleasing
fantasy: detailing the works of art that he would like to acquire for the
Tate Gallery. Suddenly, his wish list is not just idle fancy.
A new 'Tate Gallery of Modern Art' already seems a likely candidate for a
National Lottery-funded millennium grant. The building - the abandoned power
station on Bankside - is in place; the short-list of architects to design
the transformation is selected; the Tate is confident that it can raise
Pounds 40m, half the cost, from its own resources. It is almost time to fix
the opening day in 2000 and draw up the guest list.
In the meantime Serota is planning how to stock his creation. The old Tate
will remain the home of British art; the new Tate, which will be roughly the
same size as the old building at Millbank, will continue the international
history of art where the National Gallery leaves off, somewhere around 1905.
As a new century and a new millennium starts, there might be some gentle
horse-trading between our two leading art museums, which these days enjoy a
good relationship. Neil MacGregor at the National Gallery might pass over a
Picasso or a Braque to the Tate in return for a Whistler or a Sargent, in a
little chronological tidying up.
It will, however, be minor stuff. The bulk of the display at the Bankside
Tate, which will total around 1,000 paintings and sculptures, will come from
the Tate's current collection: half from key works already frequently on
view, the other half promoted from the vaults which, through pressure of
space, always contain most of the Tate's holdings.
But approaching a third of the hang at Bankside, around 300 works, will,
with luck, be acquired in the next five years. These will be modern
masterpieces that will plug gaps in the Tate's collection.
And gaps there certainly are. Serota checks off his want list. 'We've not
much German or northern art; we want more Picasso and Matisse; we're not
strong on the Russian constructivists; we've no Latin American art; we've
not got the depth of the MOMA (New York) in pre-war art, or the Pompidou
(Paris) in post-war.'
Now the names come rushing out. 'I'd love a late Bonnard, Matisse, Dix and
Beckmann, Corinth, Giacometti, Brancusi, late Braque; we are not good on the
Cubists'. There is also the need to keep acquiring the contemporary - two of
the five chronological divisions envisaged in the Bankside Tate will be
devoted to post-1960 art.
Serota is proposing a three pronged attack. Some of the works on his list
will come from loans, some from gifts and some from purchases. It is the
thought of entering the market with a cheque book that gives Serota most
pleasure. For over a decade the Tate's annual grant for new purchases has
been frozen, a decade in which prices have soared. In the 1960s and early
1970s the Tate could still buy wisely and cheaply - a Brancusi 'Bird' for
Pounds 23,000; a Giacometti for Pounds 25,000. By the late 1980s the best
works of contemporary artists like Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and de
Kooning, to say nothing of established masters like Picasso, Matisse and
Braque, were fetching over Pounds 10m in the saleroom.
The Tate was forced to the sidelines. With help from the Friends of the Tate
there have been some purchases - a Richard Hamilton was acquired only last
week - but Serota says wistfully 'I can almost always find something in a
Sotheby's or a Christie's catalogue that I would like.'
Wishes could become horses, thanks, once again, to the lottery. The Heritage
Lottery Fund is prepared to be convinced that major works of art, suddenly
on the market, might make an essential contribution to the British heritage
 -even if created by a Frenchman or an American. Serota hopes that if
something marvellous comes up the Tate stands a chance of securing it, even
if it carries a Pounds 5m price tag. This should embrace most of the
masterpieces of the past generation, the area where Serota thinks the Tate
can still build up a collection the equal of anything in Paris and New York.
After purchases come loans. This is the trickiest area. There are many
dealers who would love to loan works by their artists in the certain
knowledge that a spell on the walls of the Tate enhances their reputation
and value. The Tate is circumspect here. Loans from serious collectors, and
especially from artists, are acceptable, especially as a loan can, over
time, merge into a gift.
The Tate has a good relationship with artists and will be looking for
immediate gifts from them. This, too, can be a delicate matter: artists like
to see their donations move swiftly from the vaults to the walls. In recent
years the Tate has gratefully accepted a Francis Bacon triptych; a portrait
head from Lucian Freud; a whole room full of works by Mark Rothko. When the
Tate bought a Jasper Johns the artist threw in some sculptures and prints on
loan; Giacometti sold a sculpture for a nominal price. Most artists will be
attracted by the idea of ensuring immortality by contributing a work to
Bankside - or so Serota hopes.
The Tate has been so successful in recent years that it is hard to imagine
that this, Serota's greatest project, will fall apart. Let's leave him
planning the future, acquiring two master works a year - 'a great Beckmann
and a late Bonnard; then a Picasso sculpture and an Otto Dix; a Giacometti
to make a display never seen in the UK before, and another Brancusi . . .'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Knock-about classicism - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Ballet's new triple bill has an awkward air. At its heart is
Balanchine's Symphony in C, choreography that so perfectly responds to its
score that a ballet-goer can surely never hear Bizet's early symphony
without recalling the dazzle and grace of Balanchine's movement, and sense
the bubbles sparkling in this champagne of the dance. On Thursday night the
fizz was distinctly non-vintage, and in a couple of interpretations as flat
as can be, but the patterns and the divine mechanics of the piece were there
to see - perhaps to inspire its cast to do better next time.
On either side of Balanchine and Bizet were ranged Ashley Page with his
realisation of John Adams' Fearful Symmetries - a mechanistic score that
traps Page's movement in its cogs - and William Forsythe with his favoured
musical thuggery from Thom Willems in Herman Schmerman, replacement for the
lost Michael Clark creation. The contrast is disquieting. The Royal Ballet
looks o'erparted by Balanchine, yet at ease in the physical blare, the
deformations, of Page and Forsythe. In a season when the company has shown
itself incapable of dancing its ancestral treasure Symphonic Variations - a
performance last week was crude enough to make angels weep - it is no praise
to say that the Page and Forsythe pieces were well done.
Forsythe's knock-about classicism was made bearable on Thursday by the
presence of Sylvie Guillem and Adam Cooper in the second-half duet. The
dance slithers through their bodies, twisting and forcing them into
aggressive, competitive behaviour. Mlle Guillem dances perfectly, with an
insouciant bravura and exactness in shaping wild curlicues of movement.
Cooper everywhere matches and challenges her. The duet is vulgar, redeemed
by its performers' no-surrender passion, but it is deleterious stuff,
because anarchic about classicism.
Fearful Symmetries is a case of activity leading to further activity, with
little of it purposeful. Dancers rampage, rush, look busy. Anthony
McDonald's scenery has an exasperating vivacity, forever playing
oh-such-clever tricks by changing colour, or manifesting acrid-toned shapes,
or erupting with neon lighting. It is hyper-active, and a bore, and adds to
the febrile air of the piece. Irek Mukhamedov roars with a tremendous
combination of speed and dense muscular power over the stage. What he does
is amazing, and oddly pointless. The rest of the cast knock themselves out
in Page's garrulities, though there are hints of drama half-glimpsed in the
penumbra of the set. But the piece is caught in John Adams's unrelenting
musical wheels, and is dragged too far before it can call a halt.
At Covent Garden on December 6, 7, 10, 14.

<TEXT>
There was a golden age of childhood in the late Victorian and Edwardian
periods, to judge from the great children's books of the time: E. Nesbit,
Kenneth Grahame, JM Barrie, the greatest of them marked by an underlying
sadness - perhaps at innocence lost or consciousness of how different the
adult world be from the youthful ideal.
At least it made a change from the days when children were considered little
adults. The history of how we look at childhood, how sacrosanct, fleeting
and vulnerable adults may have considered it, is the subject of The End of
Childhood (11.15pm BBC2).
The heavy-breathing Sarah Dunant, looking more than ever like the travesti
caricature of a Late Show presenter, touches on such fascinating questions
as whether present-day kids are actually young any more, what the nature of
innocence is, or whether it ever existed. I suspect we have turned full
circle and kids are little adults again; but this time on equal terms with
the big ones.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts: Bad behaviour? Moi? - Sandra Bernhard on the South
Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halfway through Sandra Bernhard's performance at the Royal Festival Hall she
reads out a letter from a fan who has renounced her devotion: she had been
to a Bernhard concert, where, instead of watching her idol lead the attack
of the Lesbian Front against the barricades of straight society, she was
forced to endure Bernhard's singing. The disillusioned dyke bewailed the
fact that the most starry icon of her tribe was a performer first and an
activist only in the dreams of her admirers.
My letter to Bernhard would be equally bigoted - stick to singing and cut
the reveries. They are too predictably camp, sending up with phoney
enthusiasm such sitting ducks as the intellectual powers of supermodels and
the fantasy of true romance. Sing, Bernhard, sing Bernhard, sing.
Sandy B, as she tags herself, cannot fail to impress. Over six feet tall,
she has the face of Mick Jagger and the dress sense of a nymphomaniac. No
wonder her slowly remorseless version of 'Sympathy For The Devil' brings
Lucifer into the auditorium more potently than the Rolling Stones original.
Sandra Bernhard must be one of the last people you would dare to follow down
a dark alley. With a suitably cowed and passive band she presents a unique
act; there is no British equivalent of a singer who spends most of her act
swearing at the audience, chasing hares, and subverting society - all done
in the seductive voice of a siren. There is little quality control and
Bernhard's own songs are beacons of self-indulgence, but she cleverly
repackages familiar material. Using 'Stairway To Heaven' as an intro to
'Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover' is a particular delight.
Anyone so belligerently materialistic has problems making a crowd love her,
but the audience was determined to enjoy this oh-so-modern phenomenon, the
woman famous for being famous. She comes across as too idiosyncratic for her
own good - but possesses a voice that will keep many more tedious performers
in clover.
Sandra Bernhard's current show is billed as 'excuses for bad behaviour': the
excuses being, 'me, me, me.' It is fun to watch such a stylish egomaniac at
a safe distance for a short time, but must be a burden to have to live with
such trendiness.

The hotel, in Pariser Platz, the square facing the Brandenburg Gate, is due
to open in 1997 as a 346-room hotel in the 'five-star-plus' category.
Last week Dusit Sindhorn, a Thai company, agreed to buy 50.2 per cent of the

collisions between trains in stations, accidents at level crossings, and
vandalism.
The number of 'significant train accidents' rose from 133 to 142.

In China's toughest move to date against smoking, Shanghai banned cigarettes
in almost all public places from last Thursday.
The country's largest city has plastered 'no smoking' signs everywhere from
cinemas to department stores. Not even karaoke lounges are exempt from the
ban, which carries fines, large by Chinese standards, of up to 2,000 yuan
(Dollars 265).
Local reporters dashed around Shanghai trying to spot offenders. But most
conceded the unthinkable was happening: hardly anybody was lighting up - or
'eating smoke', as Shanghai people say. There are 300m smokers in China.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Wind shear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first commercial aircraft with instruments to warn the pilot of
potentially fatal wind shear flew from Washington to Cleveland last
Wednesday.
Wind shear is a sharp difference in the speed of air movement from one spot
to another nearby. It becomes a hazard to aircraft, primarily on take-off or
landing. By the end of next year, every airliner - domestic or foreign -
landing in the US will be required to have similar equipment.
'This is a significant step forward in aircraft safety,' said Chuck Miller,
president of AlliedSignal, which makes electronic systems for aircraft. The
system has been three years in development.
Continental Airlines flight 1637 had little use for its bad-weather
instrument on the maiden flight last week. If there had been turbulence
containing microbursts - brief, powerful gusts of air, usually moving
straight down - the pilot would have had up to 90 seconds' warning, enough
time to avoid wind shear.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The in-between city - Smart Guide / Kuala
Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuala Lumpur (always referred to as KL by locals) is an in-between city.
Visitors who come south from Bangkok are relieved to arrive in a less
congested, greener city. But KL has a provincial feel about it and lacks the
Thai capital's vibrancy and variety. On the other hand, those who travel
northwards from Singapore are at first put off by KL's lack of efficiency
and order. But, in spite of the traffic, they find a more relaxed, lively
city than strictly controlled Singapore.
What is the best area to stay in?
KL is a comparatively small city, with a population of less than 3m, but it
seems as though everyone drives a car, all the time. The main commercial
district is referred to as the Golden Triangle. Most big companies,
including banks and brokerage houses, have offices there. If you are
visiting industrial areas in the satellite township of Shah Alam or
elsewhere in the Klang Valley (the area surrounding KL), think about staying
closer to the airport.
Where should I stay?
The Shangri-la, in the Golden Triangle, is generally considered to be KL's
best business hotel. The cost for a standard room (regardless of single or
double occupancy) is MDollars 410 (Dollars 160) a night, plus 10 per cent
service and 5 per cent government tax. However, costs can be almost halved
if you organise a corporate rate: all this involves is a call or letter to
the reservations manager.
Even if you don't have such an arrangement, it is worthwhile making
inquiries on arrival. The same rules apply at the Regent Hotel. A standard
room there is MDollars 450 plus service and tax. The Regent is a short walk
from the central business district but closer to the shops.
For something out of the ordinary, try the Carcosa. On a hill surrounded by
parkland, the Carcosa complex was the HQ of the British during colonial
times. It now functions as a state guest-house and hotel. The rate for a
standard suite - non-negotiable - is MDollars 950. The Hyatt Saujana, near
the airport, has standard rooms at MDollars 330 plus service and tax - and
an attached golf course.
Recommended restaurants?
For Malay cuisine try either Sri Melayu or Yazmin, near the Golden Triangle.
Both have low-key cultural shows each evening.
Extremely reasonable and appetising Indian vegetarian food can be found at
Ana Lakshmi, in the suburb of Bangsar, while there is a number of good
Chinese restaurants: food at the Hakka restaurant on Jalan Bukit Bintang is
among the best. It also has the advantage of having outdoor seating
(offices, hotels and restaurants throughout south-east Asia seem to delight
in running air-conditioning systems at near-arctic levels).
Bon Ton near the Hakka restaurant is a pleasant and subdued western-style
eating place. For something more old-fashioned, try either the Coliseum or
Le Coq D'Or. Sizzling steak is a speciality at both, though the elderly
waiters seem to enjoy abusing customers.
How about entertainment?
The nearest KL comes to distinctive entertainment after hours is at the Boom
Boom Room, under the shadow of a church in one of the older sections of the
city. There is good music and an interesting, slightly daring array of
shows, many featuring transvestites dressed in their best. Don't go before
10pm. Another doubtful establishment is the Top End club in Wisma Stephens,
in the business district - very badly lit, so be careful.
Otherwise KL has the usual range of discos, pubs and yuppie bars, which look
dreadfully similar all over the world. Cee Jay's and Uno's, both near the
Shangri-la, have good music.
What are the local business quirks?
Don't expect to settle anything on the telephone or by fax. Malaysian
business people, like most in the region, want to see potential business
partners. Though the Chinese make up only about 35 per cent of the
population, they control the bulk of Malaysia's economy. Finding out who is
who is vital. Even the bigger corporations tend to be tightly controlled by
one man.
Getting around?
Traffic problems mean that it is unwise to aim for more than three or four
appointments a day. Taxis are reasonable and can be hired by the hour.
However, hiring a hotel limousine is usually more comfortable. Suppose I
have a spare day?
It is relatively easy to get out of KL, but make sure you go at non-peak
hours. Malacca, on the coast, is about 2 1/2 hours away by car (airport taxi
drivers offer good rates for such journeys). It's a bustling town with old
Dutch settler architecture and streets of recently restored Chinese
shop-houses. Malacca's Nyonya cuisine - a blend of Malay, Chinese and Indian
 -is worth trying. The Peranakan restaurant, serving nyonya food, is in an
old Chinese house in Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lok. There is another branch on the
coast just outside town.
Fraser's Hill is an old highland resort about three hours' leisurely drive
from KL, founded by a reclusive colonial metals trader at the turn of the
century. At 1,530 metres, it offers cool nights and fresh air, and there is
a pleasant nine-hole golf course. You can stay in bungalows where cooks
serve up mushy peas and apple crumble. The jungle round Fraser's is slowly
being ruined by some appalling construction work, so go soon.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: When smoke gets in passengers' eyes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine sleeping away the overnight flight from San Francisco to London in a
comfortable, non-smoking Upper Class seat on a Virgin Atlantic jumbo - only
to be woken by waves of smoke puffed out 3ft away, writes John Westbrooke.
It happens because Virgin Atlantic has replaced a central block of Upper
Class seats with a lounge: a circular table surrounded by chairs but not
partitioned off. In line with the airline's hedonist philosophy, the area is
used for massages and manicures - and for smoking, though the seats on
either side are non-smoking. This can be a rude awakening for any traveller.
The airline says it is constantly monitoring passenger opinions on the
question of smoking. For example, included in its new interactive video
system, which is not yet available on all routes, will be questionnaires
which Virgin hopes will enable it to canvass passengers' opinions on such
topics, and respond promptly.
Nonetheless, Virgin is - uncharacteristically - lagging behind the
non-smoking trend. The leader is Delta, which from January 1 will outlaw
smoking on any route, anywhere. The response to its first non-smoking trials
a year ago was so favourable that, though it expects to lose some
passengers, it is going ahead with a complete ban.
The fact that Delta is an American airline no doubt helps. A bill banning
smoking on all transatlantic flights is on its way through the US Congress.
But it will be some time before anyone bans cigarettes on Middle East or
East Asia routes, and some third-world airlines still split aircraft into
smoking and non-smoking sections down the middle.
Canada and Scandinavia are among those that bar smoking on internal flights.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN body, wants a worldwide
ban by 1996, but this will be voluntary.
Other airlines say they are responding to customer wishes without aiming at
ultimate smokelessness. When it has two flights a day between two cities,
British Airways makes one of them non-smoking. All its services to
Australia, and all short flights to and from Continental Europe, are already
smoke-free.
On the other hand, Scandinavian airline SAS last year imposed a trial ban on
international flights and had to call it off after only two months, as
passengers complained.
Feel free to tell your airline what you think about this issue: it will
listen. Meanwhile, if you want to take your mind off your exposure to
passive smoking, next year Virgin will introduce mail-order shopping and
credit-card gambling on its entertainment channels.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Fujitsu plans digital challenge in US - The
Japanese computer group is preparing for a head-on multimedia clash with
Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, is planning a multimedia
initiative in the US, which could bring it into head-on competition with
Microsoft, the world's biggest software house.
In April next year, it plans to launch a US version of a futuristic, on-line
role-playing game which it has been testing for more than seven years in
Japan. Called Habitat, it creates a fantasy world on screen - a virtual city
in cyberspace, as multimedia experts would describe it - populated by
characters who take on the personalities of the players. There are some
10,000 regular subscribers in Japan.
Japanese sociologists are already fascinated by the way people behave when
allowed to adopt these electronic alter egos. Within Habitat there is a
'head shop' where players can change their heads, and a 'paint shop' where
they can change their clothes.
However, Habitat - which Fujitsu bought from the Lucas Arts Entertainment
Company, owned by George Lucas, director of 'Star Wars' (see below) - is
more than a game. It can function as an attractive, simple-to-use interface
to a broad range of information and educational services. Students can send
messages to each other on an electronic campus; shops and banks can be
created on screen; and players can send their electronic images off on
shopping trips.
Tatsuzumi Furukawa, Fujitsu main board director and multimedia projects
group manager, says that Habitat will be the first test of Fujitsu's
multimedia capabilities outside Japan. If it proves successful, the service
will be extended to Europe, beginning with the UK in 1996.
A successful Habitat in the US would find itself in direct competition with
Microsoft's planned Microsoft Network, an on-line information service which
the software giant is expected to launch next spring, and which will feature
shopping catalogues, financial services and news services. Microsoft's
prices are expected to be significantly below those of existing on-line
services such as America On-Line or CompuServe. It is expected to offer a
simple user interface, based on Microsoft's best-selling Windows software.
Much will depend on the quality of information available over the respective
networks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been busily signing up
information providers in anticipation of the start of Microsoft Network.
Fujitsu operates Japan's leading on-line business information service,
Nifty-serve, in partnership with Nissho Iwai. In 1993 it had revenues of
Dollars 130m (Pounds 79m) and profits before tax of about Dollars 13m.
Nifty-serve has a relationship with CompuServe, of the US, but Furukawa
agrees that over the next few years Fujitsu will have to form alliances with
a broad range of information providers. Some will be simple commercial
relationships, but others will be strategic partnerships: 'If an information
provider wanted to start a new kind of service, we would be able to help,'
Furukawa says. 'We have substantial experience now.'
Fujitsu's venture in the US is just one indication of the importance it
attaches to multimedia. It has set a target of expanding sales of
multi-media-related products and services to reach 20 to 25 per cent of
revenues by 1997. Currently the category accounts for only 2 to 3 per cent
of the group's sales.
As a leading electronics manufacturer, it already provides much of the
hardware which is making multimedia possible. It supplies, for example, four
out of the seven regional Bell operating companies with switches and optical
equipment for asynchronous transfer mode transmission, the new technology
which is expected to underpin the information superhighway.
Fujitsu sees multimedia, however, as the leading edge of its translation
from a predominantly hardware manufacturing group - it is best known for its
IBM-compatible mainframe computers - to a services orientated business. The
company is becoming involved in content, developing and marketing
information, entertainment and educational materials. Last June, it
established a Digital Media Group to co-ordinate these activities.
The group has a core of researchers who worked on software for Fujitsu's
pioneering FM-Towns multimedia personal computer (launched some six years
ago) and on three-dimentional animation. The idea is to seek out and work
with Japanese and overseas partners to develop and market software and
programs for CD-Rom, PC on-line communications, cable TV and other media
platforms.
Furukawa says: 'It is something we are taking step by step. In the US there
are many trials of multimedia developments such as video-on-demand. But we
are concerned with how to make a business out of multimedia after the trials
are over.'
The company has a three-pronged approach to the market:
First, there is the on-line information business, represented by Nifty-serve
and Habitat. Fujitsu has a strategic alliance with Sharp, the consumer
electronics company, which has sold some 400,000 personal digital assistants
(hand-held computers capable of accepting handwritten instructions). The two
companies are planning to link Nifty-serve to the PDA, to create a mobile
on-line information service.
Second, cable television. This is a novel service in Japan, and subscriber
numbers are low. But Fujitsu has invested in some 23 cable television
companies. It is a limited experiment; the investment in each amounts to
only 15-20 per cent of the equity, but it is providing a test-bed for trials
of interactive services.
Third, business multimedia. Fujitsu is marketing Team Office developed by
ICL, its UK subsidiary, in Japan. The software makes it possible to share
documents, and for colleagues to work together using linked personal
computers.
Fujitsu and ICL agreed to work together on multimedia developments last
year. The cultural shift was as great for ICL as for its parent. From
marketing large mainframes it had to focus on the home market, education and
entertainment.
McKinsey, the management consultancy, worked with the company for four
months to help ICL understand the dynamics of such a new market. The first
fruits - kiosk systems for the retail and financial services industry - are
now on trial with customers such as Argos, Woolworths and the Nationwide
Building Society.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Take me out to the high-tech ballgame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Jay Mariotti, racing his deadline for the Rocky Mountain News, types on his
lap-top the closing words of his report. An earthquake has cut short the
baseball World Series at Candlestick Park on the bay of San Francisco,
interrupting the game between the Giants and the Oakland Athletics.
Tremors have rocked the press box. The stadium has been evacuated. Mariotti
has a very big story. But even though he is a pack-leading
techno-journalist, how does he file from a disaster zone?
Anecdotally, sports-writers are the most versatile professionals of their
time: first to recognise and adopt the technologies that can make their
working lives easier; routinely meeting deadlines that would give other
journalists nightmares. They own arsenals of media machines.
To do his job, a typical US sports-writer will have a lap-top,
micro-cassette recorder, mini-TV (to monitor a game while attending
another), a radio and a car telephone as well as a home fax machine and a
powerful computer.
The Chicago Bulls basketball team recently brought their press room up to
state-of-the-art standards. But such conditions are rare. More often,
sports-writers have to find ingenious ways to send their stories,
surmounting technical difficulties that would appal colleagues on other
newspaper desks.
'It's not enough to be a sports reporter any more,' says Michael Mulligan of
the Chicago Sun-Times, assigned to follow the Chicago Bears football team
this season. 'Now you have to be a computer expert and a phone expert as
well.'
Writers are responding - quickly - to the waves of change sweeping through
sports generally, for sports organisations have also swiftly utilised the
so-called information superhighway.
The NBA's Faxback service allows users to dial in to the NBA's database from
a fax machine anywhere in order to call up statistics and press releases on
any team or player 24 hours a day. Details can be faxed or uploaded into
users' computers.
Sports coaches are taking analysis of games to extremes by using new
technologies. Gone forever are the days when Adolph Rupp, basketball coach
at the University of Kentucky, could post his play-book to his opponents
with a covering note: 'Here's what we're going to do. Try to stop us.'
Game analysis is now a science. For a long time, sports coaches have been
using video. 'We even look for video cameras in the shower,' says defensive
end Trace Armstrong of the Chicago Bears.
Further ahead, the possibilities offerred by virtual reality devices are
exciting. The day may not be far distant when a boxer or soccer player
rehearses for a fight or game against a specially-programmed virtual double
of his opponent.
Exactly how, in the end, did Mariotti file his story from the devastated San
Francisco World Series stadium? Answer: he found a single intact telephone
cable in the damaged stadium's parking lot. A colleague saw him, and within
minutes 20 international sportswriters had lined up - in time-zone order -
with their lap-tops. They may be techno-journalists but, strange to relate,
sports-writers are also gentlemen.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: A guide to UK telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK telecommunications industry offered little but POTS (plain old
telephone services), choice was easy. There wasn't any.
Now that privatisation and deregulation have brought in PANS (pretty awesome
new stuff), it's easy to become confused. What operator to use? What tariff
to pick? Which mobile phone service? The options seem endless, and the
individual companies do little to help the poor consumer choose.
Which is where The Deregulated Phone Book comes in handy. This simply
produced, cheap and comprehensive guide to the UK telecoms scene is intended
for domestic phone users and for businesses.
Richard McBrien, the publisher, says: 'The average user still thinks a phone
is just a phone, and that there is no real alternative to BT, except perhaps
Mercury. One of the aims of the book is to change this culture'.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Film empire strikes back - Games are feeling
the force of Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any Star Wars buffs who ever dreamt of fighting the Rebel Alliance by flying
an Imperial starfighter under Darth Vader's command can now act out their
fantasies by buying TIE Fighter, one of the dozens of new computer games on
sale this Christmas.
TIE Fighter is the latest launch from Lucas Arts, the games subsidiary
created in the early 1980s by George Lucas, director of Star Wars, at his
state-of-the-art entertainment laboratory at San Rafael, California.
Mr Lucas, who dropped out of the Hollywood mainstream over a decade ago to
pursue his passion for technology, was a pioneer of the use of movie themes
and characters in games. His Star Wars games often feature at the top of the
computer games charts and the Hollywood studios are now racing to follow
Lucas Arts into the games sphere. Time Warner earlier this year acquired
Renegade, a games software house. New Line, the film company owned by Ted
Turner, the new-media mogul, recently formed a Dollars 30m (Pounds 18m)
joint venture with France's Havas to develop a global games business. Even
record companies are muscling into the market. Motown, the music label owned
by PolyGram, recently launched a Motown Games subsidiary.
The next convert to the games sphere is mooted to be Walt Disney, which is
expected this week to announce plans for the formation of a new interactive
entertainment division. Disney, like other studios, presently licenses its
characters for use in games devised by other companies such as Sega and
Nintendo, the Japanese games specialists.
The catalyst for Hollywood's sudden surge of interest in computer games is
the emergence of the new generation of disc-based games. The games market
has since the early 1980s been dominated by the 16-bit cartridge consoles
made by Sega and Nintendo.
For the past year or so the market has been moving towards disc-based games
played on home computers and multimedia machines that are able to play
CD-Roms, or interactive discs. Lucas Arts and other companies have already
made the most of the enhanced qualities of disc medium to create more
sophisticated games. They will be able to reach new levels of sophistication
with the next wave of change - the launch of the 32-bit and 64-bit
disc-based games, that are now being introduced in Japan and will come out
next year in the US and Europe.
These games are much more powerful than the old 16-bit cartridge consoles.
They have the capacity to create cinematic sounds and images that are
perfect vehicles for the characters and plots of Hollywood movies.
'There's no doubt that CD-Roms and the new games formats could become a
phenomenal growth market,' says Michael Lynne, president of New Line in New
York. 'All the attributes of a motion picture will soon be available on a
computer screen, so we can apply our skills to create games and informative
'edutainment' products.' New Line, like the other studios, plans to become
more aggressive at adapting its movie concepts into games. However, Randy
Komisar, president of Lucas Arts, suspects that Hollywood may have
underestimated the complexity of the games market.
'There is scope to use the techniques of movie-making in a game - we do it
all the time,' he says. 'But film is a linear medium and a game is a virtual
experience. If you take the content of a movie to use in a game, it must be
developed so that it is exciting and engaging in an interactive context.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / People: A radical solution for Japan's double whammy -
Nippon Steel's Takeshi Imai tells Michiyo Nakamoto how he thinks Japan
should deal with a strong currency and domestic recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In just six short months, Takashi Imai has pulled off a spectacular coup
which has roused the envy of many of his colleagues in Japan's business
world.
Without so much as a whimper from Nippon Steel's unions, the president of
the world's largest steel company has lost 4,000 jobs from a total payroll
of 36,000 across the country. The majority of the 4,000 - most of whom are
white-collar workers - have been transferred to subsidiaries and affiliated
companies. They had expected to return from secondment to Nippon Steel
eventually; now they find that their move is permanent.
But as far as Imai is concerned, this achievement is only one step in the
pressing task of corporate and economic restructuring facing Japan. Sitting
in his office on the 20th floor of the headquarters building in the heart of
Tokyo's business district, the soft-spoken Imai preaches the need for
far-reaching changes.
Ever since Japan's economy has been subjected to the double whammy of a
strong currency and domestic recession, one of the biggest headaches
confronting business executives has been how to reduce spiralling labour
costs with the minimum of social upheaval.
'Looking back at the two oil shocks and at the yen's rise against the
dollar, it can be said that it was the yen's appreciation this time which
has had the worst impact on the Japanese economy,' says Imai.
At 64, Imai has been at the helm of Nippon Steel, a classic example of
Japan's spectacular industrial success since the second world war, for the
past two years. He has experienced the ups and downs of Japanese industrial
development at close hand.
On graduating from Tokyo University's law faculty in 1952, he immediately
joined Fuji Iron and Steel; he then rose steadily through the ranks of
Nippon Steel which was created through the 1970 merger of Fuji and Yawata
Steel.
The yen's latest rise, he says, has had a devastating effect on Japanese
corporate profits. The squeeze has been such that even with official
interest rates at historically low levels for over a year, companies have
been reluctant to resume capital spending.
In the case of Nippon Steel, with total revenues of about Y2,000bn (Dollars
20.83bn), the effect of the yen's appreciation has been to slash revenues by
15 per cent, or Y300bn.
Worse yet, in the longer term, the yen's surge against the dollar raises the
cost of domestic manufacturing on a dollar basis, thereby robbing Japanese
companies of their international cost competitiveness, Imai warns.
This situation has led to something of an exodus by Japanese manufacturers
to other parts of Asia which have lower production costs. But this is not an
easy option for industries which need to make use of as much excess capacity
at home as the Japanese steel industry is thought to have.
A more fruitful solution, then, would be to bring the cost of manufacturing
in Japan more in line with international standards.
On a corporate level, this means trimming bloated workforces and
bureaucratic organisations that hinder efficiency and maintain high costs.
To this end, Nippon Steel has introduced a programme of cost-cutting over
the next three years by which it hopes to recoup the Y300bn fall in revenues
it has suffered from the yen's rise. Imai is confident. 'We believe we can
complete half our targeted cuts by the end of January,' he says.
But on a wider front, bringing the cost of manufacturing in Japan closer to
international standards requires a wholesale review of both the Japanese
corporate system and the structure of the Japanese economy.
Take, for example, the annual spring wage offensive. This institutionalised
system of wage bargaining was useful when the economy was growing. 'When
manufacturing (capacity) is increasing or living costs are rising then it is
necessary to raise wages,' Imai says.
But that is not the case today; living costs are stable, real wages are
rising, and given that manufacturing is not expected to grow as it has in
the past, 'it is necessary to keep wages down for some time,' he asserts.
Imai, who is widely respected as a considerate leader with a sharp mind,
clearly practises what he preaches. Last year, along with other Nippon Steel
executives, he did not receive his annual bonus - considered part of an
employee's salary in Japan. His and other executives' salaries were cut 10
per cent in 1992, and by another 5 per cent this year.
Although Japan's blue chip companies have publicly declared lifetime
employment to be sacrosanct, Imai emphasises, albeit quietly, that it has
contributed to the high costs of Japanese industry and therefore needs to be
reviewed.
This need to bring costs down extends to the whole of the Japanese economy;
manufacturing industries which export their products and compete in the
international marketplace at Y100 to the dollar exist alongside protected
service industries - which are therefore operating with an exchange rate
equivalent to Y200 to the dollar, Imai says.
Stringent government regulation has not only kept the cost of manufacturing
much higher than in other countries, it has also prevented the Japanese from
fully enjoying the country's wealth, which should have been enhanced by the
yen's recent rise. 'That is why the business community has been saying that
regulation is the cancer of Japan, because it is keeping prices up,' Imai
continues.
Along with many of his fellow executives in the business community, Imai has
called for far-reaching deregulation of the Japanese economy; this would
introduce competition into uncompetitive industries, particularly the
service industries, and help close the price gap between Japan and the rest
of the world.
Deregulation would also encourage new businesses to start up - thus
lessening the impact of the unemployment created by the restructuring of
much of the rest of Japanese industry, Imai believes.
While to western eyes these ideas would seem logical, in a country which
favours harmony and gradual transition, such steps would lead to social
upheaval and invite potentially harsh criticism.
Imai's dedication to change, coming as it does from the head of a company
which has long served as a model of Japanese business propriety, is a
measure of the urgency and commitment Japan's business community feels is
essential if it is to overcome its latest, and perhaps most challenging,
ordeal.

FT  05 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Thompson digs in at Cominco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Thompson would undoubtedly prefer to remain the backroom financial
wizard of Vancouver's Keevil family, writes Bernard Simon. Instead, he has
been thrust into the high-profile job of chief executive of Cominco, the big
international lead and zinc producer.
A long battle against leukaemia has forced Cominco's present CEO, Robert
Hallbauer, to give up the reins as from January 1. 'Everybody would really
have wanted Bob to stay on if he possibly could, and I would have stayed
here,' says the self-effacing Thompson from Teck Corporation, the Keevils'
flagship company, which owns 36 per cent of Cominco.
London-born Thompson has been Teck's chief financial officer since
emigrating to Canada 14 years ago. He was previously joint managing director
of Messina, the South African copper and industrial group.
Now 55, Thompson has helped mastermind Teck's expansion. His achievements
include painstaking negotiations in the early 1990s with a group of Japanese
steel mills and dozens of international banks which led to the financial
restructuring of Quintette, North America's biggest coal exporter.
Cominco has been through a tough period. Technical problems have plagued its
Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska and the Trail smelter complex in British
Columbia. The company has cut off several limbs, including a fertiliser
business and a steel producer. Relations with British Columbia's
left-of-centre government have at times been strained.
But with the help of sharply rising metal prices, Cominco's fortunes have
recently improved. Its new Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile began
production last summer, and it is forging ahead with a development in the
Yukon.
Earlier this year Cominco bought control of Peru's biggest zinc smelter and
is already studying a sizeable expansion of the plant. 'We hope the
difficult years are behind Cominco,' Thompson says. 'What I'll try to do is
to focus people on new opportunities, because the company has to grow.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): More bubbles for Jacuzzi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next time you step into a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath spare a thought for Roy
Jacuzzi, 51, the man credited with bringing the bathtub out of the water
closet, writes William Hall. He started in the business when he was 12, is
responsible for more than half of Jacuzzi's 200 patents, and shows no sign
of wanting to step down as the king of the world's whirlpool business.
Roy's grandfather, who emigrated from north east Italy, set up a mechanical
engineering workshop in California in 1910. Soon he was making aircraft
propellers and built a passenger aircraft used by the US postal service.
Having diversified into irrigation pumps, Roy, who was head of research,
stumbled on the whirlpool by accident. One of his cousins suffered from
arthritis and Roy built a pump into the bathtub so that his cousin could
benefit from the water and air-jet treatment prescribed by the doctor.
In 1968 Jacuzzi started selling his whirlpool baths - he called them Roman
baths - from the back of a lorry at Dollars 700 a time. In 1974 President
Ford installed a Jacuzzi in the White House and the business took off. Today
the company has operations in Canada, Italy, Chile and Brazil, employs 2,200
people and turns over Dollars 400m a year.
It has sailed through the recession with no problems. Indeed Hanson, which
has owned the company since 1987, is so impressed with Jacuzzi's 'exemplary
levels of profitability' that it has decided to make Roy (below) chairman of
Jacuzzi Inc. Since he is already president and chief executive it does not
mean an awful lot. But it is the sort of extra trimming which would have
made his poor grandfather proud.

FT  05 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Everything rosy in Meyer Kahn's
beer garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watch out for Meyer Kahn, the boisterous chief executive of South African
Breweries, writes Mark Suzman. He wants to become a global player in the
international beer market, yet international investors would prefer him to
stick at what he knows best - managing a business which promises 5 per cent
plus annual volume growth for years to come.
Like many South African firms, SAB was forced to turn inward during the
apartheid era and tried to balance its stranglehold on the domestic beer
market by diversifying into areas such as retail and manufacturing.
But it is its domestic brewing business which has caught the eye of
international investors keen to play the South African stock market. After
Anglo American empire, SAB is the premier blue chip and its shares are more
highly rated than those of many brewers in far more politically stable parts
of the world.
Since the lifting of sanctions, Kahn, an irrepressible optimist about his
country's future, has wasted little time in pushing abroad. Already the
sixth largest brewery in the world by volume, the group's international
subsidiary, Westgate, has acquired breweries in Hungary, Tanzania and, most
recently, China. At the same time, the company's strong brands, Castle and
Lion lagers, have attracted a rapidly growing international following.
Kahn sees the developing world as his core market. He feels he has a
significant comparative advantage over the likes of Anheuser-Busch and
Heineken in these areas and denies any interest in competing head on with
them in Europe.

<TEXT>
Just when you thought it was safe to pack the children off to the cinema to
be engulfed by Disney revivals, here comes a wave of semi-radical sci-fi.
After Frankenstein everyone in the movies is tinkering with life, birth and
death.
We kick off with the comedy variant. In Junior, scientist Arnold
Schwarzenegger is made pregnant by fellow boffin Danny De Vito. Not, we
hurriedly add, in anything like the traditional way. De Vito invents a drug
which as side-effect can make men conceive. Whom better to try it on than
his colleague, played by a man whose whole life has been spent making his
body swell in strange places? Ivan Twins Reitman directs; Schwarzenegger
gamely dons the stomach padding; and rave reviews precede the film from
across the Atlantic.
Children may be unscathed by Junior, but think twice before risking them on
Cronos. This Mexican horror film is the grand guignol hit of the 1994 film
festival season.
A macabre gold bauble with mobile claws impales victims' flesh, thereby
conferring immortality. Several strange characters chase it and each other
around Mexico City, as the film turns into the year's wittiest, most sleekly
shot essay in modern Gothic. Writer-director Guillermo Del Toro is already
in Hollywood fielding movie offers.
Add The Shadow, The Nightmare Before Christmas and the new gay ghost story
To Die For - a British black comedy remaking Ghost with a
boy-meets-boy/boy-loses-boy/boy-is-haunted-by-boy slant - and we wonder if
we aren't in the afterglow of Halloween rather than the run-up to Christmas.
You can always take a break from heavy-duty big screen fantasy. Leave your
stocking out at night to be filled with videos and Santa Claus may deposit
Naked In New York. A cast of ancient and modern luminaries - Kathleen
Turner, Tony Curtis, Jill Clayburgh, Quentin Crisp - swap high-class banter
in a tangy comedy of Manhattan manners.
Or Santa may leave you The Last Seduction; the sly, dark tale of a woman
crook (Linda Fiorentino) dabbling in sex, murder and film noir stylistics.
As we said, the times may not be very Christmassy. But who says we adults
don't need a festive break too from time to time?

FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: 'Golf's next god' - Sport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Golfing statistics tell us that the vast majority of enthusiastic amateurs
never shoot better than 90 in their playing careers. So eat your hearts out
as I tell you of a boy who scored 84 in his first-ever round of golf.
'I was seven years old and shorter than every club except the putter,'
recalls Ernie Els, now a formidably broad 25-year-old and 6ft 3ins tall.
This year has been Els' annus mirablis. His victory in the US Open came
after an opening European Tour win at the Desert Classic in Dubai. It was
nailed down in October by a scintillating performance to secure the World
Matchplay championship at Wentworth. No one inside golf doubts that Els will
be taking the silverware home for many years to come.
The predictions are shivery in their intensity and unanimity. 'I think I
just played with the next god,' commented Curtis Strange (renowned as a
sourpuss) after partnering Els in the US Open. 'The last young guy I saw who
could touch Ernie was Seve Ballesteros 15 years ago,' says Open champion
Nick Price. 'He's young enough, strong enough and long enough to win any
tournament he tees up in,' was Greg Norman's verdict, after Els shot 61 and
took three shots off the course record on the opening day at Dubai.
Now Ernie is back home in his native South Africa. This weekend he played
before huge galleries of adoring fans at the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun
City. It is quite something for an amiable but somewhat reserved young man
to become a virtual national monument in a sports-mad country that can't
quite forgive Gary Player for growing old.
Early last week I caught up with Els, doing his sponsor a favour by
participating in a low-key pro-am event on the aptly named Wild Coast, 120
miles south of Durban. His two amateur partners, marketing executives from a
photocopier company, were near helpless with nerves, after being drawn to
play with the icon.
The gallery around the tee was decidely intimidating as Mike Brown duffed
his first shot and saw it trickle 20 yards down the fairway. Els smiled and
whispered something that had the blushing salesman actually laughing as he
marched towards the green.
There is no doubt that South Africans are on the verge of a great love
affair. On the eve of the US Open's final day a good luck fax message
hand-written by vice-president FW de Klerk was delivered to Els' hotel room.
From the recipient's perspective, such a wall of adoration and expectation
can begin to look less than attractive. 'On the tour it's been no problem.
It is when you get home that the hassle starts,' he reflected over a few
Castle lagers and a spin of the roulette wheel at the Wild Coast casino.
'Suddenly everyone wants to shake my hand and ask why I didn't play well
last week in Japan. Sorry mate, it's been a long year,' said Els, in
bitter-sweet mood. 'I don't like going into a bar or restaurant and being
recognised. People just come up to you when you're in the middle of eating.
The best place for me to go out right now is London. Nobody there gives a
damn who you are,' he added.
Irritation and exasperation at this new development in his life are
detectable just below the sunny exterior. Ernie's face is his misfortune. A
permanent grin beneath a thatch of blonde hair makes him as approachable as
Nick Faldo is forbidding. Chatting to Els in the public area of a hotel is
like trying to talk to your boss while running the till at Sainsbury's.
Every few minutes a new well-wisher stops by. Many are fellow players,
journeyman pros from the Sunshine Tour, friends from the old days - only
1993, in fact, but it might as well be in the history books in terms of
where Els is going.
'If Ernie stayed here, he'd probably win every event, every year,' says a
peer. It's obvious why he won't. And the demands of 15 events on the US tour
next year, half-a-dozen exemptions for European tournaments, plus a few
big-buck events in Japan, mean that the fans back home are most likely to
watch Els on television.
It won't be popular in a country with a natural tendency to see the rest of
the world from a laager. Els himself is smart enough to nurse a slight
foreboding. 'They put you up on this pedestal and its so easy for them to
pull you down again if you don't do exactly what they want. The knife starts
going in,' he reflected. 'It happened to Naas Botha here and to Greg Norman
in Australia.'
He makes the point that in 1993, when he won an extraordinary six
consecutive tournaments in South Africa, there was very little fuss made of
him. A year later he enjoys a few big wins overseas and the cry goes up
'Where's Ernie?'
It would be easier to bear if he were a natural, rootless cosmopolitan,
slipping effortlessly from Europe, to the US, to Japan. But he's not. Ernie
comes from an intensely family-orientated background in the affluent
Johannesburg suburb of Germiston. There's a putting green in the
back-garden, laid and tended a decade ago by father Neels, for young Ernie
to practise on. Another casualty. Fed up with intense celebrity of life in
the Golden City, Els is building a seaside home for himself and fiancee
Liesl in the small town of George, two hours' drive from Cape Town, but a
thousand miles from home. The Germiston putting green won't be getting much
use. Mr Els snr. has put his plans to re-plant the grass on hold.

Without Walls (Tuesday 9.00-9.30pm) does a piece on The Battersea Bardot,
aka Carol White, who hit the big-time - not to mention the bottle in the
1960s. After her appearances in Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow, there was
strong demand for her services from directors as diverse as Ken Loach and
Michael Winner. A poignant profile of a woman who was going to be a star,
but ended up as a black hole.
Now that politics is more about kissing babies than killing rivals, does
Machiavelli have any relevance? Timewatch (Sunday 9.00-9.50pm, BBC2) asks
David Mellor, Roy Hattersley, John Biffen, Clare Short and Sir Bernard
Ingham whether 'The Prince' can still provide any useful pointers. The
answer, surprisingly, is yes if Mrs Thatcher is used as a test case.
The slogan 'retail is detail' is drummed into every Marks and Spencer
employee, as High Interest (Sunday 5.10-6.00pm, C4) reveals, with board
members worrying about the amount of potato in the Vichysoisse. The
behind-the-scenes glimpses of M&amp;S at work are fascinating.

FT  05 DEC 94 / This Week: FT Guide to World Trade Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is the WTO being created?
To strengthen management of the world trade system and global economic
integration. The WTO will have a more formal structure, bigger powers and a
wider remit than the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has
operated on a 'provisional' basis since its inception in 1947. WTO members
must also accept all the organisation's provisions, whereas Gatt allows
countries not to subscribe to some of its agreements.
How many countries will belong to the WTO?
All Gatt's 124 members, once they have ratified the Uruguay Round world
trade agreement. More than 20 other countries want to join, including China,
Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and Vietnam.
Who will head the WTO?
Gatt members are supposed to choose this week between three candidates:
former Mexican president Carlos Salinas, former Italian trade minister
Renato Ruggiero and South Korean trade minister Kim Chul-su. However,
political wrangling may delay a decision until next year. In that event,
Peter Sutherland, Gatt's outgoing director-general, might stay on as a
temporary caretaker.
How much will it cost to run?
A SFr105m budget is proposed for next year, a small rise on the current
budget of the Gatt secretariat, whose roughly 400 employees will staff the
WTO. Gatt is lean compared with other international bodies, and most
governments want the WTO to stay that way. That is one reason why they
decided recently to keep it out of the clutches of the United Nations.
What will the WTO do?
Its immediate priorities will be to implement the Uruguay Round agreements
and complete outstanding negotiations on issues such as liberalising trade
in services. Its longer-term agenda may include the treatment of foreign
investment and links between trade and environment, competition policy and
possibly labour standards. These are all complex and politically
controversial subjects, which impinge directly on countries' domestic
policies.
How will it take decisions?
Like Gatt, the WTO plans to operate by consensus. However, this may become
harder as the centre of global economic gravity continues to shift from the
US and Europe, which have traditionally held sway in Gatt, towards
developing countries, notably in Asia. China's entry, in particular, is
expected to have a far-reaching impact on the WTO.
What new powers will the WTO have to enforce international rules?
It will have stronger and speedier mechanisms for settling international
trade disputes. An important innovation is that WTO dispute panels' rulings
will apply unless there is a consensus to reject them - the reverse of Gatt
practice.
So US critics are right to say that control over national trade policies is
being handed to faceless bureaucrats?
No more so than under Gatt. The WTO cannot compel members to accept rulings
they disagree with, though it can authorise other countries to retaliate in
such cases. Disputes panels' authority will depend heavily on establishing
confidence in their fairness, integrity and judicial rigour. In any case,
WTO members are free to withdraw from the body at six months' notice.
Will WTO members still be able to resort to unilateral trade measures?
The US and the EU say they reserve the right unilaterally to press for
concessions from countries which are not WTO members, or in areas where
there are no clear WTO rules.
Will there ever be any more big world trade rounds?
No one is sure. Exhausted by the eight-year Uruguay Round marathon, many
Gatt members hope the WTO will end such ordeals by developing into a
permanent negotiating forum. But some think it may be hard to make big
breakthroughs without the political momentum and scope for trade-offs which
omnibus rounds generate.
What will happen to Gatt?
It will continue temporarily, but governments are expected to agree soon on
a deadline for winding it up after the WTO gets into its stride.

RUGBY UNION: December 6, Bowring Bowl, Oxford v Cambridge, Twickenham
Cambridge' hopes suffered a blow late last month when Chris Tynan, the
Canadian international, pulled out of the team with what looks like being a
long-term neck injury. It means he will miss Canada's game against England
on Saturday, and the chance of facing Gareth Rees, his international partner
and Oxford's stand off, in the 113th Varsity Match.
Oxford took the honours last year, and on recent results look the stronger
side. The Dark Blues beat Romania 26-16, while Cambridge went down to the
tourists 27-18. Duck-egg Blues would be a better description for Cambridge
in the Romania match, because after 122 years, and tempted by a Pounds
50,000, three-year deal with a US company, they have changed the design of
their strip. They have, however, promised to return to their old-style
jerseys for Tuesday.
And what of the hullabaloo over money, between the universities and the
Rugby Football Union? The annual match has become so popular that it
generates around Pounds 700,000 gate money. The RFU takes 15 per cent of
that and, after expenses, the universities get around Pounds 150,000 each.
Now, claiming it is underpaid for what is a 'world-class' venue, the RFU
wants a bigger take of the profits. Oxbridge has responded with a threat to
move next year's match to Wembley. The universities should tread carefully.
Part of the attraction of the Varsity Match is its venue, the atmosphere it
generates and the area Twickenham provides for 'hospitality'. Redevelopment
means the ground's capacity will rise from 58,000 this year to 75,000 for
1995. So there is room for negotiation, and hopes are high for a compromise
to be announced on the morning of the game.
THE TEAMS:
Oxford: *M Joy (Marling and Keble) I Gray (Royal Belfast and St
Catherine's), S Bromley (Cardinal Langley HS, Liverpool and Keble), M Nolan
(Tonbridge and Pembroke), T Howe (Banbridge Academy and Keble) *G Rees (St

FT  05 DEC 94 / Architecture: Model for the millennium - Colin Amery on the
high standards set by Westminster Cathedral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Architecture and anniversaries seem to be inextricably linked, especially as
we approach the millennium. The announcement last week that the Millennium
Commission (which seems to be anxious to model itself on the Victorian
Commissioners of the Great Exhibition of 1851) is planning to support 12
major capital projects around the UK with 50 per cent of its Lottery income,
represents a major boost for architecture.
In the recent past there would have been no hesitation about what kind of
building you would erect to commemorate almost anything - you would build a
church or a cathedral. Today the lack of certainty about any system of
spiritual, rather than material, values makes commemorative buildings
difficult to conceive. There have been too many great exhibitions that are
usually meaningless in themselves, and they always result in empty 'expo'
sites, littering the world with their fantasies. One only has to think of
the Atomium in Brussels: the decaying geodesic domes from the New York World
Fair on the road into that city from Kennedy Airport; the crumbling Habitat
structures in Montreal and the collapsing remnants of Expo '92 - now looking
for a use in Seville.
How wise of the Hungarian Government to decide that it does not want to
waste money on any great expo in Budapest, and that it would rather build
more usefully and gradually for the future of the country.
Although the Millennium Commissioners have asked for all submissions for
these great capital projects to be of 'high architectural design and
environmental quality', there is absolutely no guarantee or system of
accountability that can reliably ensure that this is going to be the case.
The curious English system of entrusting almost everything to a well meaning
group of amateurs to judge the professionals has its virtues, but it also
has its limitations. There are some lessons from the past that can be
helpful when it comes to commissioning buildings and there is a particular
centenary coming next year that is significant. The great Roman Catholic
cathedral of Westminster will celebrate its first hundred years next year,
and mark this event by an important architectural exhibition.
It is significant that the catholic hierarchy in the 1890s attempted an
architectural competition that was a complete failure. In the end they
decided to choose the architect simply on the basis of the quality of his
work. The choice of John Francis Bentley was inspired and appropriate. He
understood both the aesthetic and functional ideas of the brief, and indeed
the political significance of the building of a new catholic cathedral
almost within the purlieus of Westminster Abbey.
I think that Westminster Cathedral (left) is one of the great buildings of
England. It is undoubtedly the greatest work of Bentley - and yet it is
still a somewhat under appreciated masterpiece. It has, for me, all the
qualities of a major piece of architecture.
These qualities are due to the very simplicity of the idea behind the
cathedral - it had to be cheaply built, as it was entirely funded by the
contributions of the faithful, and it had one very clear purpose - not the
triumphalism of the Church but the visibility of the celebration of the
Mass.
The cathedral is living proof of the continuation of the highest standards
of craftsmanship in England. Many of the marble floors, for example, were
only completed in the 1950s. The adoption of the Byzantine style for the
cathedral was extraordinary at the end of the 19th century and there are
those who would still consider it bizarre for London at the end of the 20th
century. But it is such a miraculous building in the atmosphere it creates
and the sense it gives of being, not in any sense a stylistic revival, but a
place with an integrity that is entirely its own.
There are not, as far as I can see, any plans for any new cathedrals to mark
 -what is, after all, the Millennium of Christ. Indeed, in the Millennium
Commissioners' report there is no mention of the Christian significance of
the event at all. Perhaps they should give all the money raised from the
lottery to the cathedrals of England - their need is great and there is no
need at all for the nonsense that the commissioners are currently cooking up
after their long tour of this island and their endless chats with the
worthy. I can think of no more worthy cause than the restoration and
endowment of the cathedrals of England for ever as a mark of the Christian
Millennium. I notice that the atheistic report on the cathedrals that Lady
Howe has just published is far more interested in the legal and 'management'
aspects of the cathedrals than in their role as spiritual storehouses and
beacons of enlightenment.
It is my opinion that her report should be ignored and the example of the
active, powerful and 'still under construction' 100-year-old cathedral of
Westminster should be the model for this millennium and beyond.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Down in the dirt to clean up IBM / Louise Kehoe
offers a contrasting view of business process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody who says they enjoy business process re-engineering is either crazy
or they have never done it,' says Bob LaBant, IBM senior vice-president and
one of eight executives in charge of revamping every aspect of IBM's
worldwide operations to make them more efficient and competitive.
Re-engineering is tough, painstaking work that involves re-examining every
detail of how a business operates, the IBM executive says. 'You have to
really get down in the dirt.'
For IBM, company-wide re-engineering efforts began in earnest with the
arrival 18 months ago of Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and chief executive,
who established it as a priority across the company's operations.
Each of the company's top executives has responsibility for re-engineering
part of IBM's business on a worldwide basis. LaBant, general manager of IBM
North America, is in charge of re-engineering marketing, sales, customer
support and service activities, or what he calls 'customer relationships'.
In the past, individual IBM product divisions have undertaken re-engineering
projects, but never before has there been such a large-scale, co-ordinated
effort across all of the company's activities.
One of the biggest challenges facing IBM is to transform a sales and
marketing organisation geared to mainframe computers into a 'solutions
provider' of complete information technology systems, while also creating a
low-cost distribution channel for 'commodity' products such as personal
computers.
To improve its ability to serve customers seeking 'complete solutions', IBM
earlier this year restructured its worldwide sales effort into 14 groups
focused on a specific industry such as finance, health, insurance and
manufacturing.
With the new management structure in place, LaBant is now focusing on
business processes - the way in which IBM performs myriad tasks involved in
forming and maintaining customer relationships.
The guiding principle behind the re-engineering is to meet customers' needs
more effectively. The process began about two years ago with surveys,
interviews and studies of customers. The results were boiled down to seven
requirements.
Customers told IBM: Understand me, the way my organisation works; fulfil
your commitments; be easy to do business with; be responsive and accessible;
communicate in my terms, not in IBM-ese; have competent people; and give me
competitive prices.
The next task, says LaBant, was to analyse to what extent IBM was meeting
these requirements. 'We had so many different ways of doing things, mapping
the sub-processes was very difficult.'
The result, however, is a list of 12 customer relationship processes each of
which is being changed to match more closely customer needs and increase
efficiency by eliminating duplication of work.
'Solution delivery' is one example. A critical element of this is pricing.
When a customer signs a contract with IBM to provide a complete information
technology system, it typically involves computer equipment, software,
technical support and consulting services as well as products from third
parties.
'Somebody has to put a price on all of this. It used to have to go through
several staff levels and then be referred to White Plains (IBM US
headquarters) for approval,' says LaBant. 'It would take six to eight weeks
to get a price back to the customer.'
Now pricing is delegated to the local 'client team' which arrives at a
figure with the help of a software program called a 'pricing tool'.
In other instances, work is being centralised. Finance and planning
functions, for example, are being managed on a national level.
'The things that get in the way of local teams have been consolidated on a
national basis. Those things that are directly related to dealing with
customers have been delegated to the field staff,' LaBant explains.
Not surprisingly, information technology is playing a vital role in IBM's
customer-relationship re-engineering. IBM has updated its use of IT to
include computer systems that support functions such as contract management,
opportunities management and skills management.
The re-engineering is also leading to job cuts. However, unlike past
workforce reductions at IBM, in which employees were offered incentives to
leave the company regardless of their role, experience or talents, the
latest cuts have been carefully targeted.
Earlier this autumn 3,000 support staff jobs were eliminated, reducing the
IBM US marketing and sales workforce to about 40,000, down from 71,500 in
1991.
'We made these (recent) decisions based on the affordability and benefits of
the work being performed, not a headcount objective,' LaBant stresses.
Reducing costs is crucial as IBM struggles to boost meagre profits after a
period of heavy losses.
'Sales general and administrative expenses used to represent 35 cents of
every dollar of IBM US revenues. We have dropped to the low 20s over the
past three years but we are going to have to drive it down into the teens -
not by cutting people but by re-engineering and getting our costs out and
cutting out work that we don't need.'
A critical element of re-engineering is winning the support of employees.
Edicts from headquarters are of little value unless the 'people in the
firing line' accept them, says LaBant.
He has formed a cadre of 'regular folks' as advisers. They include a sales
representative, a pricer, somebody in accounts receivable and a project
manager working with a customer. 'I know them well enough that they don't
sweet-talk me. They know I want bone-bruising feedback.'
Another technique is to hold 'town meetings'. One week each quarter, the IBM
US executives take to the road. 'Last week we were in Kansas City, Tulsa,
Dallas and Denver. We talked to about 2,000 IBMers.'
Comparing the performance of IBM against competitors is also important. 'We
are constantly benchmarking. I know the efficiencies of every one of my key
competitors.' Because no other company covers IBM's broad spectrum of
industry segments, LaBant has created a 'paper tiger', a mythical competitor
that is the 'sum of the best' performer in each segment. Today, he
acknowledges, IBM's efficiency is lagging. But he expects to be 'on the
paper tiger's back in 1995'.
But a re-engineer's work is never done: 'It is a continuum. When you say you
are done, you are dead.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Joan Woodward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial surveys in places like south-east Essex are so common these days
that they seem an unlikely foundation for management immortality. Yet the
conclusions which Joan Woodward (1916-1971) drew from research into 100
medium- and large-sized firms in that part of England in the early to
mid-1950s have ensured her a place in the pantheon of modern organisational
thinkers.
Together with others (including Tom Burns who featured in this column last
week) Woodward made a lasting contribution to the school of contingency
theory. This held that if companies were to perform well their structures
should be appropriate to the technology they used, their product diversity,
the rate at which they were changing and their size.
Woodward's findings - notably that different types of production process had
particular structures, management hierarchies, and 'spans of control'
(numbers of people reporting to one supervisor) remain relevant today.
'Looking forward from Woodward to see in what directions our knowledge about
organisations has been extended, one finds a bewildering array of empirical
and theoretical work,' write former colleagues Sandra Dawson and Dorothy
Wedderburn of Imperial College, London in their introduction to her classic
Industrial Organisation, Theory and Practice*. 'But the contribution of
Woodward is not obliterated.'
Much of what she discovered has been incorporated into received management
wisdom, while the recent shift towards services - an area in which she did
relatively little work - means her significance is sometimes overlooked. It
can be argued, however, that the contemporary debate on delayering and
business process re-engineering - the latter a management approach made
possible mainly by improvements in information technology - is a dramatic
reaffirmation of her ideas.
Later research by Woodward and others at Imperial - based in part on more
detailed case studies of some of the south-east Essex sample - explored how
companies exert control over their operations. They found that control
systems could be categorised around two variables: the degree to which
control was exercised either personally or indirectly (with the
idiosyncratic supervisor on the spot at one extreme and impersonal
administrative or automated procedures at the other); and the degree to
which methods of control were either localised in each unit of a company or
integrated and reconciled centrally.
Operations and planning manager of a munitions factory during the second
world war and consultant to a number of companies including Pilkington and
Ford, the woman who became Imperial's Professor of Industrial Sociology in
1969 is perhaps a worthy role model for today's management academics. 'Her
theory always came out of practical experience, she was always interested in
the real world,' recalls Wedderburn.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Giant with feet of clay / Tom Lloyd offers a
contrasting view of business process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The passionate defence of re-engineering by Michael Hammer and Steven
Stanton (FT, October 5) against what they see as misconceived criticisms is
a sign that this precocious giant among modern management nostrums is
suffering from growing pains.
There are three reasons why the spectacular, early success of re-engineering
has failed to blossom.
The first is that its status, within the overall management scheme, is
unclear; the second is that, as a consequence of the first, re-engineering
can be extremely dangerous, and the third is that re-engineering is already
out-of-date, in that it is a cost-cutting and re-structuring technique, at a
time when the prevailing management focus is switching to growth.
The equivocal status of re-engineering stems from the fact that it has great
power to change an organisation but that, notwithstanding the protestations
of its evangelists, it lacks a correspondingly powerful business philosophy.
Hammer says he is co-founder of the 're-engineering movement' and if it was
a 'movement' that began with the publication of Reengineering the
Corporation, his claim is justified. But is it a 'movement', in the sense of
the 'labour', 'co-operative', or 'building society' movements? A 'movement'
is a philosophy, and a call for action. Re-engineering calls loudly for
action, but its philosophy is prosaic in the extreme.
It simply replaces the old 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' prescription
with the more challenging and constructive injunction: 'make all your
processes the best-in-class'. Its focus is on corporate mechanics, not on
vision or strategy.
The mistake is to claim it is something more than that. It provides no
answer to such questions as 'which processes should I re-engineer?' and
'what strategic objectives will I have achieved, when I have finished?' It
will prescribe the discarding of processes when their functions can be
assumed by other processes, but it cannot say a process should be discarded
because its function has become strategically superfluous or that a process
should be out-sourced, because it would take too long, or cost too much to
re-engineer.
The dangers of this strategic silence were exposed in the tale of a
hypothetical catastrophe recounted in the Harvard Business Review by Francis
Gouillart and Fred Sturdivant of Gemini Consulting. A market-leading
printing company was losing market share to a rival offering quicker
order-to-delivery. The market leader's order-to-delivery process was
re-engineered, by cutting its larger product line, to reduce machine set-up
time. Order-to-delivery time fell, market share stabilised and a
re-engineering success was celebrated. But, through a combination of
competitive re-engineering and bench-marking, all firms in the industry soon
had the same product line, the same order-to-delivery time and the same
strategy, to become the lowest cost producer and compete on price.
A better strategy, Gouillart and Sturdivant argued, would have been for the
market leader to make the length of its product line a strength, and develop
separate processes for short and long production runs. But this would not
have occurred to the re-engineers because the only strategy they have
built-in is cost-minimisation.
The reason why re-engineers, armed with benchmarking data, are so dangerous
is that as soon as the stimulus of re-engineering becomes discrepancies in
benchmarking data, all firms in an industry start converging on a point of
no difference and thus of no profit.
The distinction between qualification, and differentiation criteria helps to
explain the danger.
Qualification criteria are attributes every firm must have to join the game;
differentiation criteria give a firm an edge. It is in the nature of
competition that today's differentiation criteria will be tomorrow's
qualification criteria. A few years ago, quality gave an edge, but quality
is a 'commodity' now. The dialectic of competition is inescapable - if a new
thing works, others will copy it.
A year ago re-engineering was a differentiation criterion. Now every company
is re-engineering, it has become a qualification criterion, and the danger
is that, left to its own devices, it will drive out all strategies except
cost minimisation.
Hammer's and Stanton's assertion that 'those who do it (re-engineering)
right, succeed', is not only tautological; it is also dangerously
misleading. The measure of the success of a re-engineering programme is not
the efficiency of the re-engineered processes, but the contribution it makes
to the achievement of the firm's strategic objectives.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: You can't judge a book by its reviewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most managers claim not to have the time to read management books. Fewer are
prepared to admit that the effort is probably not worth the gain. But most
would, in theory, like to sound erudite and well-read by mentioning famous
gurus and their latest concepts. The easiest way out seems to be to read not
the book, but the review which might give the gist of a 50,000-word book in
500 words. Do book reviews tell more about the author, the book or the
reviewer?
I believe it is the latter, and furthermore that regular reviewers are
gratuitously nasty. They know that only pessimism sounds profound; that
being a prophet of doom and gloom and biting criticism makes them sound wise
and insightful, while optimism and praise are perceived as foolhardy and
ignorant.
In a paper called 'Brilliant and Cruel', the American psychologist Teresa
Amabile asked people to judge excerpts from matched negative and positive
book reviews. She found that negative reviewers were perceived as more
intelligent, competent and expert than positive reviewers, even when the
content of the positive review was independently judged as being of higher
quality and greater forcefulness.
She believes that most reviewers know this and that it is simply a
self-presentation strategy by the intellectually insecure. Certainly, there
is nothing inherently more intelligent in criticism than praise. WH Auden
pointed out that one cannot attack a bad book without showing off, but some
reviewers apply that dictum to all books.
Management book reviews perhaps tell us most about the reviewer, something
about the author, but frequently little about the book.
Nearly 100 years ago Thorstein Veblen pointed out that many of the rich of
his time engaged in conspicuous consumption. They bought and displayed
products to show off their taste, wealth and refinement. All advertisers
have exploited this fact and are able to distinguish between a product and
an image.
Thus we have the company BMW, whose product is the motor car, but what is
really being sold? An upmarket image. Louis Vuitton makes luggage but sells
prestige. Disney owns and runs theme-parks but sells happiness, fun and an
innocent view of the world. As we can see from advertisements, a variety of
manufacturers of breakfast cereals are selling not muesli and cornflakes but
fitness and health. What does Estee Lauder sell? The product is make-up, but
hope is what it sells.
It is not a bad discipline for employees struggling with mission statements
or 'who-is-your customer' quizzes to attempt to distinguish the product,
tangible or intangible, from what is truly being sold to the consumer.
Consumer boycotts are increasingly common in the UK. Some are
media-oriented, where announcements and pleas are made with passion, drama
and supposed legitimacy by individuals or organisations. Others are
market-oriented where particular brand names are targeted by lobbyists and
protectionists. Some pressure groups aim to 'educate', that is to
proselytise rather than to boycott.
But what these consumer affairs activists have in common is that they
purport to speak on behalf of others. Most behalfers claim to represent the
consumer - which is patently absurd precisely because consumers have highly
varied, indeed conflicting, needs. Have they ever been elected? Worst, there
is no way they can know consumers' needs, wants or wishes.
Newspapers through sales, companies through market-research, even
politicians through their surgeries get some idea of the feelings, beliefs
and behaviour of the public, but behalfers rarely have access to the
diversity of public opinion.
Most are against things, anti this or that and in favour of more life-style
control or legislation. It would be hypocritical to attempt to ban or
restrict behalfers but no one should take them seriously.
I often travel long-haul on east Asian carriers, fortunately near the
'front-of-the-bus'. The cabin crew have a deserved reputation for being
conscientious about their somewhat mundane duties. But are they
over-staffed? Last week I had a long flight on KLM in business class. The
steward was attentive without being intrusive, charming but not rule-driven,
comfortably tri-lingual and good at reading passengers and anticipating
their needs.
Alone he served 20 filled seats two full meals. Compared with other carriers
the 'staff-student' ratio was low but the service exemplary. Perhaps, we
Europeans really have woken up to the threat of the Pacific Rim countries.
The long night of over-staffing may be coming to an end.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Republic's main pull for investors is low tax rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's main attraction as a foreign investment location is that it enjoys
Europe's lowest rate of corporation tax. The republic is heavily dependent
on foreign investment, which accounts for 75 per cent of Irish manufactured
exports, 55 per cent of manufactured output and 45 per cent of employment in
manufacturing.
According to the Industrial Development Agency, the government body which
co-ordinates policy, about 1,000 foreign companies now operate in Ireland,
taking advantage of a young and educated labour force to target the European
market.
The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax compares with 33 per cent in the UK,
the next most attractive regime. The terms run to 2010 for manufacturing and
2005 for financial services.
Subsidies cover an average of 20 per cent to 30 per cent of capital costs,
rising as high as 60 per cent in designated high unemployment areas.
The agency targets potential investors in four main areas - electronics,
healthcare, software and financial services. Banks, insurance companies and
mutual funds account for half of all the companies coming to Ireland.
It is the first choice of location overseas for US companies in the software
and healthcare sectors. The US accounts for 75 per cent of all foreign
investment companies. In electronics, only the UK attracts more US
companies.
As the republic has Europe's second highest unemployment rate, the main
thrust of agency policy is to create jobs. For every 10 people working in
manufacturing, four are engaged in agency projects. Foreign companies
assisted by the agency created 11,900 new jobs in 1993, and recovered a
further 3,800 jobs lost in previous years.
Moreover, foreign companies now pay five times more in corporation tax than
they receive in grants, with tax receipts increasing 23 per cent in 1993 to
IPounds 348m.

FT  05 DEC 94 / After the peace, the fight for jobs: Northern Ireland has
much riding on its investment conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's workforce is employed by the
British government. Many of the jobs in the security sector - up to 20,000 -
will be lost if the IRA and loyalist paramilitary ceasefires prove durable.
The province's unemployed total of 100,000 would jump 20 per cent unless
jobs are replaced.
That is why so much is riding on the success of the international investment
conference which takes place in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is hosting the event and will be backed
by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown. Invitations have gone out to leading
international companies, organisations which have contributed funds in the
past, local political leaders and leading EU trade officials.
Northern Ireland has an urgent need to attract inward investment and it is
prepared to pay generous incentives - as the controversial Pounds 61m grant
to help the textiles group Hualon set up a plant has highlighted.
The Industrial Development Board, which dispenses grants, has a powerful
array of lures to attract foreign companies. A Northern Ireland incentives
package can, in theory, amount to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of
total costs - though in practice it is usually far less. The IDB claims that
in 1993-94 the government contribution to new investment was 21.5 per cent
for both domestic and inward investment.
The IDB says that since 1986 overseas investment has totalled Pounds 1.6bn,
involving 265 projects and creating 22,702 jobs. The gross cost per job
assisted in inward investment promotions in 1993-94 was Pounds 27,424 -
meaning Northern Ireland has one of the most expensive job creation
programmes in the UK.
The IDB argues that it is necessary to spend money. The image of violence
has been a powerful deterrent to new companies, but the province is also
perceived by many outsiders as having a peripheral position in the UK.
It has a population of 1.5m and therefore a small domestic market. Its
economy is poorly integrated with that of the republic and the Irish Sea
separates it from the mainland UK market.
In trying to sell the province to investors, Northern Ireland officials
argue that there are other factors apart from grants and incentives which
make it attractive and offset its remoteness.
Industrial land costs Pounds 40,000 an acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in
the English Midlands and upwards of Pounds 400,000 in London. Construction
costs are much lower. According to European Commission figures an index of
office construction costs puts Northern Ireland at 65 compared with 100 for
Britain and 113 for Belgium. Residential property is cheaper too. A detached
house costs Pounds 57,202 in Northern Ireland compared with an average UK
price of Pounds 94,315.
The workforce is educated: Northern Ireland has excellent schools, with a
higher rate of A-level passes than any other part of the UK. Wages are 16
per cent lower than in mainland Britain.
The province can offer 50 per cent cash grants for buildings - more generous
than either Wales or Scotland. It can also offer cash grants for machinery
and equipment, training and job creation. If a company wants to rent rather
than build a factory there are grants for up to 100 per cent of rental costs
for up to five years. There are also product development grants, marketing
grants, and grants for relief on loans.
Although the province is handicapped in comparison with the Irish republic
by having to levy corporation tax at the UK rate, companies making taxable
profits of less than Pounds 250,000 pay a 25 per cent rate. There are
allowances for depreciation on machinery and equipment and for the
construction costs of industrial buildings.
However, next week's investment conference is likely to be hampered by the
haste with which it has been organised.
An official at the British consul general's office in the US said: 'When we
got the guest list our first reaction was 'Wow] - we haven't got time.' US
companies are drawing up boardroom budgets and preparing for Christmas at
this time of year. We think it is too short notice.'
A guest list of US corporate 'possibles' was sent to the consul general only
in early November by the Industrial Development Board and invitations began
to be sent on November 18.
When the speeches are over, those who have been able to accept the
invitation will be invited to visit factory sites and companies which have
already chosen to set up in Northern Ireland.
They will be bombarded with statistics on why Northern Ireland rather than
the Irish republic, Scotland or Wales is the best place in the British Isles
to invest. And their hosts will be hoping they have done enough to overcome
the problems that peace will bring.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Paisley boycott may deter businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party is to boycott next week's
Northern Ireland investment conference.
His announcement, made during the party's annual conference at Dungannon at
the weekend, comes as little surprise.
Mr Paisley remains implacably opposed to any contact with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing. Once Downing Street had confirmed that Sinn Fein
councillors on the Belfast and Derry economic committees had been invited to
the investment conference, Mr Paisley's reaction was inevitable.
The DUP's absence will nonetheless reinforce Ulster's image as a divided
society, and could make it more difficult for the Northern Ireland Office to
convince business that now is the time to invest in the province's future.
Next week's conference is intended to be a showpiece for foreign investors,
and to provide evidence that Ulster is ready to end its internal strife and
forge a new consensus.
One unionist councillor said: 'It's sad that this could upset the apple
cart. Foreign investors will say 'if the parties can't sit down together,
then why should we put our money here?' '
Yet many unionists are alarmed at the way London is seen to have 'bent over
backwards' under US pressure to accommodate Sinn Fein.
Unionist sensitivities have been aggravated by remarks by Mr Albert
Reynolds, outgoing Irish prime minister, who warned over the weekend that
Sinn Fein should not be treated as a 'second-class political party' in the
peace process. He said: 'That sort of penny-pinching attitude risked sending
the wrong signals to the Sinn Fein leadership.'
His remarks help to reinforce the impression in unionist circles that the
republicans are forcing the pace. 'It's all one way, isn't it. They're
getting everything - we're getting nothing,' said a young Protestant woman
in Belfast selling loyalist memorabilia to raise money for her husband and
other loyalist prisoners. 'The republican prisoners will be out long before
my man,' she said.
In some respects, unionism itself seems to be in crisis. In working class
communities Mr Paisley is no longer seen as offering a lead. His standing
among the grass roots has been eclipsed by politicians such as Mr David
Ervine and Mr Gary McMichael, and others close to the loyalist
paramilitaries. In rural areas, and among middle class protestants, it is Mr
James Molyneaux's Official Unionists who hold the ring.
Mr Paisley's antics have seemed increasingly extreme in recent weeks. At the
party's annual conference over the weekend he threatened to 'wreck' any new
Northern Ireland assembly.
'If there is an election to any assembly here we will be fighting it, we
will give the people of Northern Ireland the right to be represented there
and we will use our position in that assembly to destroy that assembly,' Mr
Paisley said.
Going further, he hinted at moves to challenge the legality of the Downing
Street declaration, signed by London and Dublin last December. The
declaration provides the guidelines for the framework document which the two
governments hope will form the basis for talks between Ulster's principal
parties.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Call for change to accounts degrees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A research report published today by the Association of Certified
Accountants calls for an urgent review of undergraduate accounting courses.
The authors claim that courses 'have merely pandered to students'
expectations of an accounting degree as a preliminary - and thus perceived
necessary - stage of professional accountancy training'.
The report says that it is wrong to allow the curriculum to be dominated by
what it calls 'technicist' views which prepare the students to enter
professional training in one of the Big Six accountancy firms.
'The fact is that opportunities for graduates to enter into professional
accountancy training through the Big Six are rapidly shrinking with those
from the 'new' universities being particularly affected,' say the authors.
They put forward an alternative approach based on accounting studies rooted
in social science - accounting which would look beyond profit and loss to
aspects such as environmental and social impact.
The authors, accountancy academics, also argue that those students equipped
with such a broader accounting education would be better suited to enter the
Big Six. 'Current accounting degrees, the core content of which appears to
be largely watered down versions of the professional syllabus, do not
achieve this,' they say.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Ministers act to defuse row on executive pay increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers are considering ways of promoting tighter shareholder
control over executive salary increases after a Commons row about a 75 per
cent pay rise for the chief executive of British Gas.
Mr David Hunt, the cabinet's chief political troubleshooter, started looking
at ways of defusing the issue after Mr John Major, the prime minister,
condemned 'unjustified' pay increases last month during question time
exchanges with Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.
Mr Hunt met senior ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to explore ways of
reducing the potential for damage to the government.
Cabinet colleagues say that Mr Major and Mr Clarke were 'livid' about Mr
Cedric Brown's pay rise, which followed public concern about substantial
salary increases in the privatised water companies. Some ministers believe
that the row has seriously undermined the case for privatisation by fuelling
Labour claims that it amounts to little more than a chance for public-sector
managers to make a financial killing.
However, Mr Hunt's soundings failed to identify an easy solution to the
salaries problem, which has been referred to the cabinet's standing
committee on industrial and consumer affairs. Ideas include amending company
law to require salary increases to be approved by a weighted majority of
shareholders and giving regulators of privatised industries powers to
investigate salaries as well as prices.
Neither proposal has attracted much support from ministers, who are wary of
appearing to interfere in the salary arrangements of private-sector
companies.
The most likely outcome is a greater effort by ministers to persuade
shareholders to use their existing powers under the companies acts to
control executive pay through resolutions at annual meetings. These powers
are rarely used because few small investors take an active part in company
affairs.
Mr Major used a Commons written answer last week to point out that
institutional investment funds, which control most large public companies,
can influence events 'behind the scenes'.
But senior ministers are privately dismissive of the scope for meaningful
action by managers of institutional funds, who are said to be uninterested
in controlling the salaries of their executive colleagues.
Ministers have also reopened an inquiry launched a year ago by Mr Stephen
Dorrell, the then Treasury financial secretary, into the level of dividends.
The review was shelved after the publication of a letter to Mr Dorrell from
Lord Hanson accusing the minister of 'sounding like a socialist'.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Sea safety review focuses on ferries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two shipping disasters in the past week have lent fresh urgency to a safety
review which starts today at the London-based International Maritime
Organisation.
The maritime safety committee had already planned to focus on roll-on
roll-off (ro-ro) ferry safety after the sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic
in September with the loss of more than 900 lives. Last week's sinking of a
Philippines ferry, with the loss of more than 140 lives, and a fire on the
cruise liner Achille Lauro, which cost two lives and gutted the vessel, have
increased pressure on the committee to tighten up regulations.
The role of the IMO, a United Nations agency, is to improve maritime safety
and prevent pollution from ships. It works through a number of technical
committees and relies on persuading member nations to adopt the treaties
they devise. The maritime safety committee has representatives from most of
the IMO's 150 member countries.
Prompted by the sinking of the Estonia, Mr William O'Neil, IMO general
secretary, has proposed the creation of a panel of safety experts to
recommend action in the hope of shortening the normally lengthy procedures.
Mr O'Neil said: 'We cannot simply refer to what has been done during the
past few years and claim that there is no need for further action. The only
way of reassuring people that ro-ro ferries are safe is by looking at every
aspect of operations and ensuring any problems are remedied.'
Particular attention will be paid to the strength and watertightness of bow
and stern doors, the advisability of fitting internal bulkheads on the
vehicle deck and the need for guidelines on operations in adverse weather
conditions.
The committee is also to consider far-reaching amendments of the
international convention on training standards and seafarers'
qualifications. The IMO proposes a revised treaty, a lot of it mandatory,
with detailed rules for verifying compliance.
A third area of concern for the IMO is the safety of the world fleet of dry
bulk carriers that move cargoes such as coal, aggregates and ores. The IMO
says: 'There have been many incidents in which bulk carriers have suffered
from catastrophic structural failures.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Funds to consider role over salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of leading institutional investors will meet later this week to
consider how to respond to calls from government ministers for shareholders
to have a greater say in deciding executive pay packages.
The investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds will
meet on Friday to discuss executive pay, Mr Geoff Lindey, the committee
chairman said. 'We will be considering whether we should be more involved
(in deciding executive pay levels) and if so, how,' he added.
Two weeks ago Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in the Commons that
shareholders might be given increased powers to curb excessive pay increases
for top company executives.
Mr Clarke revealed that the practical issues involved were under examination
as the government came under renewed pressure to condemn the rise awarded to
the chief executive of British Gas.
Some shareholder groups had urged the Cadbury Committee, when it was
considering a code of conduct for corporate boards of directors, to allow
shareholders final approval over terms of directors' contracts.
However, the association did not back that view, saying it would be
impossible to persuade senior executives to take key posts if the terms of
their contracts could later be vetoed by shareholder groups.
Other issues likely to be discussed by the association will be the role of
pension benefits in total remuneration.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Clothing sales hit by mild weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clothing retailers are waiting anxiously for a spell of cold weather to
boost sales of winter clothing in the crucial Christmas period, after the
exceptionally warm November left them struggling to meet sales forecasts.
The warmest November since records began, coming after a mild October,
prompted consumers to postpone purchases of winter clothes such as coats,
scarves, gloves and knitwear - with a knock-on effect on other purchases.
Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest clothing retailer, said the temperate
weather had made life 'difficult' and it was hoping for some 'nice bright,
very cold weather'.
'When you are in the rag trade and you have your winter catalogue in the
stores, a warm November is not good news,' the company said.
'If you get a nice cold snap, you don't just pick it up on winter lines, you
pick it up on everything. People don't just buy a winter coat.'
The weather has been a persistent theme in the in-house Gazette of the John
Lewis Partnership, which runs 22 department stores across the UK, and the
Waitrose food retailing chain.
As early as November 5 it noted: 'Above average temperatures throughout
October have stood in stark contrast to the colder conditions a year ago,
and for the past four weeks demand for winter-weight clothing and
accessories has fallen short of our expectations.'
It said products such as winter bedding and heating appliances had also been
affected.
Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges and president of London's
Oxford Street Association, said: 'Nobody is selling any coats, scarves or
gloves.'
Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of Bentalls, the department store
group in south-east England, said women's clothing sales since October had
been poor.
'We are still ahead of last year, but we were hoping to be running about 10
to 12 per cent ahead, and in fact we are only 7 to 8 per cent ahead. I think
it has been evident that people are waiting until the last minute to buy the
things they need,' he said.
M&amp;S added: 'We don't really detect a big change from the way people have
always behaved. There is still everything to play for.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Union faces court battle with deposed president: The man who
was elected president of the GPMU print union is to take his executive to
the High Court for declaring the election invalid. Documents in the
possession of the Financial Times chronicle the extraordinary events that
led to his rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Doug Douglas, a member of the GPMU print union's London region and an
outspoken critic of the national leadership, wants the High Court to
overrule the union executive which has deprived him of victory in the
election for the presidency.
He will go to court next week to challenge its decision to invalidate the
election result.
The poll showed Mr Douglas winning by 19,906 to 18,590 on the seventh count
in a single transferable vote ballot over Mr Ray Williams, a leftwinger from
Merseyside.
The government-appointed Commissioner for Trade Union Rights is meeting all
Mr Douglas's legal costs in what is the first action of its kind under the
new labour laws. The union's London region leadership is also backing him
strongly.
The executive's decision to deprive Mr Douglas of the presidency and call
for a fresh election because of alleged breach of union rules follows an
inquiry carried out for the executive by Mrs Anne Hock, general manager of
the independent Unity Security Balloting Services, a subsidiary of Unity
Trust Bank.
Her report concluded that union rules had been breached during the election
by the circulation of branch newsletters and by two articles about the
election that appeared in national newspapers.
However, Mrs Hock had previously certified the conduct of the original
ballot, which she also supervised.
The executive actually endorsed Mr Douglas as president at a union
conference, in the union journal and in a circular sent to all branches.
Mr Tony Dubbins, the union's general secretary, discussed with Mr Douglas
his salary and when he would start work.
However, only four days before he was due to take up the presidency on June
1, Mr Douglas was told his election was invalid and a fresh ballot would
have to be held.
Union leaders were unavailable for comment yesterday. A union spokesman said
the High Court hearings to start on December 13 would provide the
opportunity for the union to explain its case.
The executive's refusal to accept Mr Douglas's election victory is seen by
its critics inside the union as an attempt to prevent a well known opponent
of the leadership gaining access to the upper reaches of the union.
In his election manifesto Mr Douglas criticised what he called 'excessive
pay-offs exceeding Pounds 100,000' provided for former national officers. He
accused the leadership of 'an arrogant attitude towards members' democratic
decisions'.
Mr Douglas promised if elected 'to prevent further ridiculous
extravagancies' under the union rules which provide the president with the
power 'to exercise a general supervision of the affairs of the union'.
In her first report certifying Mr Douglas's victory, Mrs Hock wrote: 'There
are no reasonable grounds for believing there was any contravention of a
requirement imposed by or under an enactment in relation to the ballot.' She
said no security breaches had occurred over production, storage,
distribution, return or handling of the voting papers.
She concluded: 'We have been able to carry out our functions as scrutineer
without interference which would make it unreasonable for any person to call
our independence in relation to the union in question.'
In fact, on the eve of the ballot in late March Mr Dubbins had had to deal
with complaints that Mr Williams's leftwing supporters had been canvassing
in breach of rules. Mr Douglas told the London Evening Standard at the time:
'I am confident justice will be done for all the candidates and the
membership.'
There were also allegations that newsletters had been circulated contrary to
the rules. But then the union executive had decided there were insufficient
grounds to conduct an investigation and decided to let the ballot proceed,
with Mr Williams insisting on no delay.
Mrs Hock's report was endorsed by the executive and Mr Douglas was declared
president at the union's conference on April 18. On April 26 Mr Dubbins
agreed Mr Douglas would take over as president on June 1.
However, by May 3 the executive, while backing Mr Douglas, also decided to
ask Mrs Hock for a second report inquiring into allegations over the conduct
of the election.
On this occasion Mrs Hock found rules had been breached over the very issues
the executive had examined in March. She wrote: 'Any information, statement
or document contained in anything other than the election address or
official journal would be in my opinion a breach of rule.
'Publication of articles in newspapers or journals is obviously a matter
largely outside the control of any union and its members. However in my
opinion commenting on the ballot for quotation in a press article by a
candidate would be clearly a breach of rule.
'In the circumstances, therefore, I believe there is a likelihood the result
of the election may have been influenced by these events, in particular the
press articles and branch newsletters. I recommend the executive should set
aside the ballot and run a fresh election.'
The executive backed the report amid a storm of protest. The London regional
council denounced the executive for 'an unprecedented and unjustified
interference in the democratic process' while Mr Derek Benton, London member
of the executive, resigned, saying the decision 'defied belief'.
However, the union executive remains confident it has not broken the union
rules. Next week in the High Court both sides will present their positions.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Maxwell talks focus on remaining Pounds 45m gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A financial settlement offered to members of pension schemes formerly
controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell is still about Pounds 45m short of
what is needed to meet all liabilities.
This week, Sir Peter Webster, acting as a negotiator on behalf of the
government-backed Maxwell Pensioners Trust, will be meeting institutions
which have offered to contribute to the fund to encourage them to increase
their offers. Also, some which failed to make offers will be encouraged
again to do so.
Those who do not make offers as part of a 'global settlement' are likely to
be the subject of writs from trustees of the various schemes seeking
recovery of assets.
It is expected that Sir Peter will press for final offers to be received by
the end of this week.
For the past three weeks, Sir Peter, a retired High Court judge, has been
acting as a deputy judge, thus diverting him from the negotiations. 'That is
why we have been given three weeks to 'think things over',' one trustee
said.
However, in telephone conversations with trustees, Sir Peter has expressed
'cautious optimism' that a formal agreement can be reached.
A trustee said: 'No one puts their last offer in at the beginning. The offer
we have received is pretty good but it is not good enough.'
The settlement, offered three weeks ago by a group of financial institutions
and advisers, was about Pounds 240m, while trustees to the pension schemes
estimate that about Pounds 285m is needed.
Trustees said that one problem in deciding how low an offer they can accept
is the fact that calculating the exact liabilities of the pension schemes is
difficult. If schemes are required to buy annuities for each member, the sum
which must be offered in the global settlement will have to be higher.
However, if significant numbers of scheme members elect to take a cash
transfer value into another pension scheme or into a personal pension, the
liabilities will be much lower. That is because the method used to calculate
cash transfer values gives rise to lower costs than the purchase of
annuities.
Meanwhile, trustees said that one of the main potential stumbling blocks to
a global settlement appeared to have been removed. Trustees to the Mirror
Group Pension Scheme, the largest of the Maxwell company schemes, had been
seeking a guarantee that the government would not try to claw back payments
it had extended to cover the guaranteed minimum pensions of scheme members.
For all the schemes this sum is about Pounds 115m.
While government officials have not explicitly reassured trustees, 'it has
been implied that there will be no clawback if we accept the settlement',
according to one trustee. For all schemes except the Mirror, this agreement
will benefit scheme members. In the case of the Mirror, it will benefit
shareholders because the sums clawed back would have had to be paid to
pensioners by Mirror Group itself.

FT  05 DEC 94 / BR chairman says rail needs long-term subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will have to make a long-term commitment to subsidise the
railways if the planned privatisation of Railtrack is to succeed, Sir Bob
Reid, chairman of British Rail, said yesterday.
'The Treasury need to commit themselves to the franchisees (train operating
companies) who will then commit themselves to Railtrack,' Sir Bob told BBC
Radio. 'It is the certainty of the revenues that will make Railtrack
saleable.'
He said the government would have to guarantee a full seven years of funding
to a company that took a seven-year franchise to operate a particular train
service. The key to successful privatisation was to remove uncertainty about
future levels of subsidy.
The government announced last month that it planned to sell at least 51 per
cent of Railtrack in the lifetime of the present parliament. Railtrack owns
and maintains the infrastructure of Britain's railways, including 11,000
miles of track and signalling and 2,500 stations. Its main income will come
from access charges paid by the train operators.
Mr Henry McLeish, a transport spokesman for the Labour party, said Sir Bob's
comments confirmed the party's 'worst fears about Railtrack'.
'The company will be an artificial creation in a synthetic market,' Mr
McLeish said. 'It will not be able to survive without long-term financial
agreements with the Treasury.'
Although the government has not specified the timing of the privatisation,
its target is believed to be a flotation in the first half of 1996. City
sources believe the company could be worth about Pounds 4bn.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Machine tool chiefs to meet Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the Machine Tool Technologies Association are to meet officials
from the Treasury on Wednesday to hear why manufacturing industry's plea for
increased capital allowances was rejected in last week's Budget.
Mr Stan Vaughan, association president, will head the delegation which is
likely to express disappointment at the short shrift given by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to the pleas.
The association, which represents Britain's machine tool builders, was one
of seven industrial associations which wrote to Mr Clarke in October asking
for increased allowances to stimulate 'permanently higher levels' of
industrial investment.
But Mr Clarke said in his Budget speech that the argument for higher
allowances had a 'simplistic appeal' and would distort investment decisions.
He restated the government's philosophy of favouring lower overall
corporation tax rather than higher allowances.
Ironically, forecasts released by the association late last week predict
strong growth over the next three years in machine-tool investment in the UK
and substantial increases in exports of machine tools.
According to forecasts for the association by Mr John Walker of Oxford
Economic Forecasting, sales of machine tools in the UK market will grow from
Pounds 280m next year to Pounds 345m in 1996 and Pounds 380m in 1997.
This reflects the significant improvement in company finances and relatively
low interest rates. Also, says the association, the need to invest to
maintain competitiveness will become increasingly important.
The buoyant forecast for investment could be used as an argument against
increased capital allowances, as it suggests that such a stimulus is not
needed because of the upturn in industry's fortunes. But the association and
other associations such as the Engineering Employers Federation have argued
that under-investment is a long-term problem.
The forecasts are derived from market surveys by the association and are
based on a narrower definition of machine tools than that used for regular
Central Statistical Office figures on the industry.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Coopers' effort to delay probe opens in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulators will be watching closely today as a judicial review opens in the
High Court which could have long-term implications for supervision in UK
financial affairs.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's biggest accountancy firm, is seeking to stall a
wide-ranging investigation into its audit of the failed Maxwell business
empire.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's most senior
regulatory body, is seeking to carry out the investigation.
The judicial review, which is set to last three days before Mr Justice Henry
and Mr Justice Kay, begins today and judgment is likely to be deferred.
The action follows a judgment in April this year in favour of Price
Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, over its audit of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International.
That ruling meant that the JDS inquiry would have to wait until criminal and
civil actions involving BCCI were at an end - which is unlikely before the
year 2000.
The ruling in the BCCI case was based on the highly complex and unusual
nature of the bank's collapse.
Coopers' argument is that its JDS case should not go ahead because any
hearings would be prejudicial to civil or criminal actions which might
follow over the Maxwell affair.
The firm will also claim that an adverse JDS ruling could have catastrophic
consequences and place an intolerable burden on its partners and staff.
The scheme, which is operated by the UK's chartered and certified
accountancy bodies, only investigates matters of the most serious public
interest.
If the JDS loses in the High Court there is every reason to believe it will
lodge an appeal to establish a definitive judgment on the issue.
Professional and government regulators will be watching the case carefully
to see if they are to be barred from taking action in cases where civil or
criminal legal action is pending.
And if the JDS were to lose an appeal it is likely a fundamental reform of
accountancy regulation would be considered. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales has already set up a working party on the
future of regulation.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Strike will shut post offices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of post offices will be closed by strike action on December 12 in
protest against alleged 'back-door privatisation' of counter services, the
UCW communications union announced yesterday.
The decision follows last month's ballot decision by some union branches to
strike over the closure of main post offices.
The strike will affect post offices in London, Glasgow, Merseyside,
Cambridge, Bristol, Plymouth, Northampton and parts of Wales. It will not
hit postal deliveries.
The Post Office accused the union of timing the strike for December 12 - the
main benefit day for pensions, child allowances and income support - to hit
the 'most vulnerable members of the community just before Christmas'.

The Inland Revenue yesterday promised to re-examine a tax change announced
in the Budget that may have the side-effect of imposing big tax bills on
many charities.
Tax officials conceded they had not intended to hit charities when drawing
up plans to close a loophole used by foreign companies with subsidiaries in
the UK. They promised to listen to charities' concerns and did not rule out
re-wording clauses planned for next year's finance bill.
The Revenue is worried that some UK subsidiaries are able to avoid
corporation tax by using profits to make interest payments. These have not
previously been taxable. The plan to tax such payments would affect UK
companies only where the company receiving the interest was not paying
corporation tax. But that could include many large charities with trading
subsidiaries.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Conflicting credit figures reported
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures on consumer and business credit for October present conflicting
evidence on the buoyancy of the economic recovery.
Business finance fell sharply in October compared with the previous month
and with October last year, says the Finance and Leasing Association's
monthly report.
The decline suggests that businesses are increasingly cautious about capital
investment in spite of the recovery.
But consumers took out credit worth Pounds 1.46bn, 32 per cent more than in
October last year. A strong performance in retail store credit outweighed a
decline in new-car finance for consumers, the association says. Store-card
finance rose 70 per cent, compared with October last year, to Pounds 462m.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Mercury set for large job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the UK telephone company operated by Cable &amp; Wireless, will today
announce job losses of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of its 11,400
workforce, Clive Cookson writes.
Lord Young, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman, warned last month that 'a substantial
cost and headcount reduction programme' would be required to prepare Mercury
for a more competitive telecommunications market.
Details of the cuts are to be given this morning in briefings to the
workforce, stock market analysts and journalists.
Although unions are prepared for 1,100 jobs to go, some analysts believe the
cuts will eventually exceed 2,000 over a number of years.
Mercury's half-yearly results, released last month, surprised analysts by
showing a Pounds 3m decline in operating profits to Pounds 96m in the six
months to September 30, although turnover rose by 12 per cent to Pounds
797m.
Although Mercury is gaining customers, most of the growth is coming from the
residential sector rather than the more profitable business sector.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Industry supports pro-EU Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of Britain's leading industrial companies - including Glaxo, Grand
Metropolitan and Enterprise Oil - have given financial backing to a new
pro-European pressure group inside the Conservative party.
As Tory Euro-rebels continue to challenge Mr John Major's government over
European Union integration, the new group, called Action Centre for Europe,
is to lead a fight-back by Conservatives committed to British membership of
the EU.
The group was founded by Lord Howe, the former cabinet minister, earlier
this year. Among senior politicians who have joined its advisory council are
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr David Hunt, the chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, and Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's EU commissioners.
A group of banks and business organisations have already pledged about
Pounds 50,000 to set up the organisation, which will argue the pro-European
case within the Tory party in the run up to the EU's inter-governmental
conference in 1996.
The list of sponsors includes Salomon Brothers, the merchant bank. It is
understood that strong interest in the organisation has also been shown by
NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, De La Rue, the bank note printer, Pirelli,
the Italian tyremaker, and the Andersen Consulting group. ICL and General
Utilities have also shown interest.
Representatives of some of these organisations attended a lunch in London
last Friday hosted by Sir Leon Brittan and Lord Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey
National bank.
According to Conservative party sources, the centre will provide information
to MPs and public figures about European issues. It is to launch a series of
high-profile conferences next year outlining how the UK can develop in the
EU.
It aims to counter the role of the European Foundation, an anti-Maastricht
think-tank.
'The anti-Europeans get lots of information and help from the European
Foundation,' said one of the centre's leading figures. 'I would hope that
pro-Europeans would get the same from us.'
The development of the group is being seen by senior Conservatives as
another indication that the pro-European wing of the party is preparing to
wage a tough fight for its principles.
Last week it was reported that the party as a whole had suffered a big fall
in cash gifts from companies. The Labour Research Department, an
organisation funded mainly by unions, said its researchers could find only
168 companies that had made donations in the year to March to the
Conservative party - the lowest such figure its annual survey had ever
found.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Xerox offers to manage facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rank Xerox, the international document company, has joined forces with cost
management consultancy Currie &amp; Brown to launch a new company in the growing
facilities-management market.
The market has grown rapidly over the past few years as companies have cut
costs by concentrating on their core businesses and farmed out more
peripheral services to specialist organisations.
CBX, which is to be launched today, will be capitalised at Pounds 500,000
and be held equally by Rank Xerox, Currie &amp; Brown and the management of CBX.
CBX was formerly the British services division of Rank Xerox.
Traditionally, companies operating in the market have tended to concentrate
on managing one particular aspect of an organisation's operations, such as
property management. However Mr Alan Berry, managing director of CBX, said
the company would integrate the operations of buildings, including property
management, facilities operations and project management.
Facilities management has developed along a number of paths. It is well
entrenched in the computer industry, where companies outsource hardware and
data processing, while in the property sector the concept has centred on the
management of buildings and building services. The public sector has also
moved in this direction, with compulsory competitive tendering,
privatisation and market testing opening up a diverse range of contract
opportunities to private-sector companies.
The expansion of the sector means reliable figures are scarce and it remains
an ill-defined market with huge variations in the estimates of its size.

Nearly 30 per cent of companies have employees who work from home or who

found.
The biggest growth in teleworking is in the media, where a third of
employees spend time working from home, and business consultancy, where 31
per cent do so. Many have started in the past six months.
The survey was carried out by NOP between June and September this year with
2,813 business interviews.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Taiwan's voters opt for stable Chinese relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Voters opted for stability in Taiwanese local elections on Saturday as the
ruling party retained an overall majority despite losing the mayoralty of
the capital Taipei to Mr Chen Shui-bian, a legislator from the leading
opposition party.
Mr James Soong, the incumbent candidate of the governing Kuomintang (KMT),
easily won the polls for the provincial governorship with 56.3 per cent of
votes in what was interpreted as an affirmation of the status quo in the
island's delicate relations with China. The victory for mainland-born Mr
Soong also helped heal ethnic divisions between native Taiwanese and recent
immigrants from China which flared during the campaign.
The poll was the first for provincial governor and the first in three
decades for mayors of the municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, a southern
port city. The KMT retained a majority of seats in the assemblies of
Kaohsiung city and Taiwan province, but lost its majority in the Taipei city
assembly.
The Democratic Progressive party (DPP) appeared to be moving towards the
political centre on winning its first important administrative post since
political reforms began with the lifting of martial law in 1987. Mr Chen,
who had been involved with the dissident movement from the late 1970s,
played down the party's traditional advocacy of Taiwanese independence in
his victory speech.
Mr Chen's election to the mayoral post is doubly significant as he will
participate in cabinet meetings - the first time a DPP member has been able
to do so.
The polls, regarded as an important milestone in Taiwan's democratisation,
went off peacefully despite widespread allegations of vote-buying.
Mr Parris Chang, a DPP legislator, called the result a 'political and
psychological victory' for the leading opposition group. 'The KMT has so
many more resources, organisationally and financially, that there's no way
we can compete with them in the provincial election,' he said, alluding to
the ruling party's strong grassroots political machine.
The outcome had been predicted by pundits and thus had been largely
discounted by financial markets. 'The stock market's reaction should be
generally bullish,' said Mr William McGrath, general manager of the Taiwan
representative office of S G Warburg Securities.
Mr Chen yesterday pledged to gather a group of Taiwanese and foreign experts
to conduct a comprehensive investigation of Taipei's corruption-plagued
urban mass transit system. A 'red paper' detailing the team's findings would
be released to the public.
Prof Hu Fo, a political analyst at National Taiwan University, said these
elections represented little change in the existing balance among the
political parties but legislative elections in late 1995 would be crucial.
'Opposition parties could topple the KMT's absolute majority in parliament,
potentially leading to the appointment of a prime minister from the
opposition and a reduction in the power of the president,' he said.
The reaction of China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory in
rebel hands, is likely to be muted.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Boost for S Korean deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea has launched a sweeping reorganisation of the government,
including the merger of its two main economic agencies, the finance ministry
and the Economic Planning Board.
The measure is seen as an attempt by President Kim Young-sam to revitalise
his programme for economic deregulation, which appears to have lost momentum
recently due to bureaucratic resistance. Pressure is growing on South Korea
to reduce its trade and foreign investment barriers and promote financial
liberalisation as it prepares to join the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development in 1996.
The government reorganisation is expected to be followed by a large-scale
cabinet reshuffle later this month once parliament approves South Korea's
membership in the World Trade Organisation.
The creation of the finance and economic board marks the demise of the EPB,
which symbolised strong state intervention in the economy over the last
three decades.
The EPB was established in 1961 when the military took control of South
Korea. It was the main architect of the country's subsequent rapid growth by
issuing blueprints on economic development. But its role has declined in
recent years following the downfall of the military dictatorship in 1987,
with much of its power being transferred to the finance ministry.
Since then, the EPB has become a supporter of economic deregulation, while
the finance ministry is now regarded as the main centre of resistance to
liberalisation.
The merger of two agencies is considered an attempt by President Kim to
leaven the ranks of the conservative finance ministry with EPB officials
favouring reform.
Mr Kim also hopes to reassert his authority over the bureaucracy by
strengthening the role of the prime minister's office as policy co-ordinator
for government administration.
The ministries have increased in power in recent years following a decision
by Mr Kim's predecessor, President Roh Tae-woo, to decentralise
decision-making in order to promote democracy.
The result, however, has been to give them the ability to hamper the Kim
administration's deregulation proposals which represent a loss of power for
bureaucrats and threatens their jobs.
The prime minister's office will take control of the Fair Trade Commission
(FTC) from the EPB, indicating that Mr Kim will renew efforts to curb the
economic power of the country's leading industrial groups, or chaebol.
Other main features of the government restructuring include the merger of
the transport ministry with the construction ministry. This reflects
government plans to spend Dollars 100bn on infrastructure projects primarily
related to transport over the next eight years.
The environment ministry will also be upgraded to cabinet status, reflecting
concerns about increased pollution.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Burundi extremists refuse to heed example of Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even with the horror of Rwanda at their doorstep, political extremists in
Burundi appear determined to speed up the disintegration of their country
and provoke another ethnic bloodbath.
After months of United Nations-mediated negotiations to forge a government
of national unity, the Tutsi-led opposition party threatened at the weekend
to break its alliance with the majority Front for Democracy in Burundi
(Frodebu) over the election of a Hutu as the speaker of parliament.
Diplomats in the capital Bujumbura believe the collapse of the power-sharing
agreement could make the country ungovernable.
Mr Anatole Kenyenkeko, prime minister, cut short a trip to Europe to deal
with the political deadlock in Burundi. He said on his return to Bujumbura
yesterday that he would try to convince his party, the Union for National
Progress (Uprona), not to leave the government.
Mr Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, the Mauritanian UN representative who has laboured
over the past 11 months to steady tempers in Burundi, believes the problem
lies with a few Tutsi hardliners who refuse to share power with the
country's Hutu majority.
'This time it is not the (Tutsi) army which is fuelling the crisis, it is
civilians,' Mr Abdallah said yesterday. 'If the Uprona hardliners continue
to destabilise the governance of this country through dictat and blackmail,
it is they who will be responsible for another catastrophe on the scale of
Rwanda.'
Burundi has the same ethnic make-up as Rwanda - 85 per cent Hutu, 14 per
cent Tutsi and a small Twa (pigmy) population. But whereas Hutus ruled in
Rwanda until their overthrow by Tutsi guerrillas earlier this year, Tutsis
in Burundi have never relinquished real power. They control the army, civil
service and judiciary, business and the press. Like Rwanda, Burundi is
overpopulated and desperately poor: factors which augment the hatred and
fear between Hutu and Tutsi communities.
Even before the current political crisis, Burundi was struggling to salvage
what remained of its short-lived experiment with democracy. Its first freely
elected president, Mr Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was murdered by renegade
Tutsi army officers in October 1993 after less than 100 days in office. In
the turmoil that followed, 50,000 Burundians were killed. Mr Ndadaye's
successor died in the April air crash which also killed Gen Juvenal
Habyarimana, the Rwandan dictator.
Mr Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Burundi's third Hutu president in a year, has
little power. He is the only surviving Frodebu leader in Burundi. His wife
and six of his colleagues were murdered in the 1993 putsch; another three
members of the party leadership fled into exile.
The president has lost much Hutu support for making too many concessions to
the Tutsi elite: Uprona has taken 40 per cent of the cabinet posts and seven
of the 16 provincial governorships. Disaffected Hutus say the power-sharing
agreement did not solve the fundamental issues for Hutus: who controls the
army and judiciary. They also believe the government of national unity is a
smoke-screen behind which Tutsis are preparing to eliminate Burundi's Hutu
political leadership.
Hutu extremists have allied themselves to the remnants of Rwanda's defeated
Hutu army and declared 'war' on Burundi's new government. Small guerrilla
bands have crossed into northern Burundi and attacked army convoys. The army
has retaliated by burning villages and massacring Hutu peasants.

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rafik Hariri, who has offered his resignation as Lebanon's prime
minister, and his chief antagonist, Mr Nabih Berri, speaker of the
parliament, took their bitter row to Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders
yesterday. Mr Hariri continued to insist before the talks that he could 'no
longer govern' the country.
Some officials from the Hariri camp denied his resignation offer was a
political gambit. The resignation was 'irrevocable' and his differences with
Mr Berri, the former Shi'ite warlord, 'irreconcilable'.
However, others close to Mr Hariri suggested before the talks that the
businessman-turned-premier might be persuaded to stay on if Syria could
broker a cabinet reshuffle which removed individuals seen as blocking Mr
Hariri's plans. Mr Hariri has proved unable alone to command full cabinet
discipline behind his ambitious rebuilding projects, and had offered his
resignation in May after an earlier bout of cabinet infighting.
Mr Hariri stormed out of a Thursday night cabinet meeting saying he had
resigned because his ambitious Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6.7bn) rebuilding plans
for Lebanon were being impeded by several ministers and by Mr Berri in
particular.
The resignation capped one of the sourest weeks of Mr Hariri's two-year
tenure, marked by allegations of scandal and corruption directed by two
parliamentarians at both the son of President Elias Hrawi and Solidere, the
company designed by Mr Hariri to redevelop central Beirut.
Mr Hrawi, who with Mr Hariri and Mr Berri is the third member of the
country's ruling troika, has firmly backed the prime minister he appointed
in 1992, saying he would 'tear up' Mr Hariri's resignation.
The central bank at the weekend announced it had raised overnight rates to
50 per cent to back the Lebanese pound.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Clinton backs Salinas as WTO chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With his battle over Congressional approval of the World Trade Organisation
behind him, President Bill Clinton has issued his first public statement in
support of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas as head of the new WTO.
This signals that the US will press strongly Mr Salinas' candidacy despite
the threat of a divisive fight over the WTO leadership.
The president waited one day after the passage of Gatt in Congress before
issuing a statement noting that 'President Salinas is the only candidate for
director who has served as a head of state. He would bring. . . a wealth of
experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing
country.'
Mr Renato Ruggiero, the former Italian trade minister, has been leading in
the race while Mr Salinas was serving out his presidency - which ended last
week - and Mr Clinton was focused on getting the world trade pact through
Congress. The former Italian trade minister claims the support of African,
Caribbean and Pacific groups, the North Africans and many Middle East
countries.
While there was little controversy about trade liberalisation in the US
debate over the Uruguay Round, the creation of a WTO became the subject of
fear and suspicion. The opposition portrayed it as a supranational body
ready to eviscerate US environmental, health and food safety laws. It was
not the time to press the candidacy of Mr Salinas, who US officials believe
would bring stature to the new trade body.
The next step by the pro-Salinas forces will be to seek an endorsement from
the nations of the western hemisphere at this week's Miami Summit of the
Americas. India will be sounded out for support, and the Asians, now
supporting the third candidate - Mr Kim Chul Su, South Korean trade minister
 -will be urged to back Mr Salinas as a second choice.
There was hope in Geneva, where Mr Ruggiero is popular, that a new leader
could be agreed at a meeting of trade diplomats on Thursday. But now the
whole issue is likely to be remitted to another meeting just before
Christmas. The EU contends that with Mr Ruggiero the clear favourite, Mr
Salinas and Mr Kim should concede defeat and bow out.

The Zambian government yesterday averted a confrontation with western aid
donors and announced the voluntary liquidation of the state-owned airline.
The donors, who provide some Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m a year in support of
President Frederick Chiluba's economic reform programme, had warned that
they might suspend aid if government pressed ahead with a loan to the
heavily indebted Zambia Airways. The government had intended to draw on a
Dollars 30m oil purchase facility provided by a Kuwaiti bank to help pay
some of the airlines creditors, and buy time in which to implement a
cost-cutting plan. Donors maintained this would break an agreement on public
sector borrowing, and suspected that the government was seeking an
alternative to privatising the airline.

China's Olympic Committee expressed 'deep shock and regret' at the weekend
over a finding by the Olympic Committee of Asia that 11 Chinese athletes had
tested positive for performance enhancing drugs at the recent Asian games in
Hiroshima. China announced that it had appointed a committee to investigate
the episode and said those involved would be punished severely under
international rules. The report was carried by People's Daily in its
back-page 'brief news' columns. The OCA finding that a number of its top
athletes, including several members of its all-conquering women's swimming
squad, had failed doping tests is proving a severe embarrassment for China.

<TEXT>
Foreign investment is expected to continue flowing into China at an average
annual rate of Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn) a year to the end of this
century, according to the Development Research Centre of State Council,
China's cabinet. Mr Zhang Xiaoji, the centre's deputy director of foreign
economic relations, said that while this figure would mark a slowdown from
the surge of 1993-95 it was 'still surprisingly high compared with many
other countries'. China is now absorbing about one-third of direct foreign
investment to developing countries worldwide, which reached Dollars 80bn
last year. Direct overseas investment in 1993 of Dollars 26bn accounted for
13 per cent of total investment last year in China's fixed assets. This
compared with an average throughout the 1980's of 2.5 per cent. But the
numbers of new projects were down by 46 per cent to the end of September
compared with last year, and pledged investment dropped by about 32 per cent
to Dollars 57bn. Mr Zhang said indications of a slowdown this year were to
be expected.

<TEXT>
Tens of thousands of supporters of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, took to the streets of Italy's largest cities over the weekend, as
anti-corruption magistrates kept up the pressure on his business associates.
The rallies, co-ordinated by 'clubs' of Forza Italia, the political movement
founded by Mr Berlusconi, were prompted by Milan magistrates' decision two
weeks ago to invite Mr Berlusconi in for questioning about alleged bribery
of tax police by his Fininvest business empire. Yesterday, Mr Jas Gawronski,
the prime minister's spokesman, said Mr Berlusconi would be unable to meet
the magistrates before December 13 because of international commitments.
The rallies came alongside voting yesterday in the second round of mayoral
elections. It appeared last night, according to results reported on state
television, that Forza Italia had been punished for its uncomfortable
alliance with the Northern League, the most volatile partner in the
right-wing government coalition. Centre-left opposition candidates won races
in four out of six big towns. In the most closely watched contest, at
Brescia in the north, Mr Mino Martinazzoli, backed by the Popular party and
ex-communist PDS, won 56.5 per cent of votes against the 43.5 per cent cast
for the League's Mr Vito Gnutti, the industry minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World new car sales will set a record in 1995 for the second year running as
some big markets move firmly into recovery, consultants DRI/McGraw-Hill
forecast in their latest annual report on the world car industry. World
sales this year, at 35m, will be 6 per cent higher than in 1993, when sales
hit a six-year low of 33.1m, the report* predicts. They are projected to
rise by a further 4 per cent in 1995, to 36.45m units.
However the overall figures disguise wide variations between markets, with
Latin America and much of the Asia-Pacific region booming but western Europe
still struggling to pull itself out of recession and no real sign of
recovery in Japan. The report expects sales in western Europe to rise by 5
per cent this year, to 12m units but the rate of growth will slow to around
4 per cent next year before recovering in 1996. In percentage terms, the
most spectacular growth comes from Asia-Pacific countries outside Japan. New
car sales in China are forecast to jump by 28.6 per cent next year, to
758,000, and to top 1m before the end of the decade.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Why Washington ducked a court fight with GM: Both sides save
face in saga of fuel tanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday's settlement between General Motors and the US Department of
Transportation, whereby the government dropped its attempts to recall
allegedly unsafe GM pickup trucks in exchange for GM spending Dollars 51m
(Pounds 32.6m) on road safety, is clearly designed to let both sides off the
hook.
It extricates the transportation secretary, Mr Federico Pena, from a case
which looked increasingly unwinnable in court and saves GM the public
relations disaster of an official hearing.
For the car industry, the deal has broad significance. Between 1973 and
1987, GM sold some 9m large pickups with the fuel tank mounted outside the
main frame, thus allowing a bigger tank and longer range. The trucks passed
the necessary safety tests at the time; but it has since been argued that
they are more likely to catch fire in a side-on collision than trucks by
other makers.
The government started to investigate two years ago. In October, Mr Pena
upped the stakes sharply by moving to recall the trucks. They had caused 150
more deaths than would have been caused by Fords, he said, and statistically
were liable to cause 32 more.
What really alarmed the car industry was the idea that it could be
retrospectively liable for vehicles passed as safe when sold. 'Meeting a
safety standard,' Mr Pena said, 'does not absolve a manufacturer of its
responsibility to produce safe vehicles.' GM had become aware the trucks
were defective, he said, adding that the management 'appeared to have made a
decision favouring sales over safety'. GM hotly disputed the allegations and
still does. 'These trucks are as safe as the comparable Ford or Dodge,' a
spokesman said yesterday, 'and far safer than any passenger car.'
The immediate commercial risk to GM was minor. By US law, vehicles cannot be
recalled more than eight years after sale. The risk was thus restricted to
the 350,000 or so models sold in 1987.
More important, GM faces between 50 and 60 civil suits on behalf of accident
victims. Only seven cases have come to court so far, with GM winning three
and losing three and the seventh due for retrial. The fact that the
government has dropped its case now means, says GM, that none of Mr Pena's
earlier statements are admissible in court.
Politically, Friday's settlement looks an undoubted embarrassment for Mr
Pena. His officials deny he was acting under duress from the White House or
the Department of Justice. Rumours have been rife, however, that President
Bill Clinton disliked the prospect of a battle with GM in which his
administration would appear as the heavy-handed regulator, just as a new
Republican Congress arrives in Washington.
Mr Pena is already under fierce attack from anti-GM lobbyists. The Victims'
Committee to Recall GM Pickups calls the settlement a 'public bribe' and 'a
sentence of death for hundreds more Americans'. The Center for Auto Safety
is going ahead with a parade of burn victims on Capitol Hill today.
But Mr Pena had such a weak hand that the deal could have been worse. His
staff at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had repeatedly
told him the case was not in their view winnable in court because the trucks
did not pose an 'unreasonable risk'.
In addition, NHTSA staff estimated that even if the Transportation
Department did win a recall of the trucks, it would take around five years
of litigation and save only six to nine lives.
The NHTSA estimates that one small part of the money being spent by GM under
the settlement - the purchase of 200,000 car seats for babies to be
distributed free to low income families - will save 50 lives and prevent
around 5,000 injuries.
Mr Stephen Kaplan, a Transportation Department official, said Mr Pena had
made his decision 'in a public interest mindset'. The deal, he said, 'will
save hundreds and hundreds more lives than any other option available to
him'.

FT  05 DEC 94 / White House doubts surface on Japan policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as US officials were basking in the afterglow of the Congress vote on
the global trade pact, a fissure seemed set to open over administration
trade policy towards Japan.
It was revealed in a speech in New York on Friday by Mr Jeffrey Garten, the
Commerce Department under-secretary for international trade. He apparently
surprised his colleagues in the inter-agency trade policy review group by
signalling that the Clinton administration would increasingly rely on
multilateral channels to put pressure on Japan to reduce its trade barriers.
He admitted the US had failed to command international support for its
current confrontational policy through bilateral talks and suggested that
more could be achieved by seeking allies among 'progressive forces of
change' in the new World Trade Organisation, the EU, the Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), and Japan itself. These would include
Japanese consumer groups and companies seeking cheap imports.
The apparent rift in the administration reflects differences in the business
community at large over whether Japan can best be dealt with bilaterally or
multilaterally. The bilateral camp, which includes so-called trade hawks
such as Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department negotiator now
head of the Economic Strategy Institute, has so far prevailed in influencing
US policy.
In his speech Mr Garten said: 'In one of the great ironies of the late 20th
century, Japan - which has rigged its economic systems for over 100 years -
has branded the US as wanting to 'manage trade'. From Seoul to Sydney, from
London to Frankfurt, and even around the US, the image stuck. From a public
relations standpoint we never recovered.'
The administration should not abandon its bilateral tactics towards Japan,
but could employ 'a more strategic' and 'sophisticated' policy, Mr Garten
said. 'What is required is a degree of subtlety and patience that does not
always characterise US policy - in any administration,' he said. 'We could
be more proactive in urging Gatt, the IMF, the OECD, Apec, and others to
focus on Japanese practices that do not conform to world standards.'
Mr Garten said that, though much had been achieved by the current bilateral
policy, 'there is a growing fatigue and weariness among the negotiations on
both sides of the Pacific which makes the future agenda more difficult'.
Mr Garten joined the Clinton administration after officials devised the
current 'results-oriented' policy and began negotiating sectoral deals which
included 'economic indicators to measure progress'.
It has been his assignment to negotiate an opening in the Japanese
automotive market, which accounts for 60 per cent of the US trade deficit
with Japan.
'Frankly, we have little to show for our efforts,' on this front, he said.
But other deals reached bilaterally have been successful. Motorola said US
pressure to open and deregulate Japan's cellular telephone market had led to
a boom of subscribers - from 12,000 to 150,000 in less than a year - on
Motorola's TACS system.
It is unclear how much support Mr Garten has within the administration for a
shift - or what he calls 'an evolution' - towards multilateralism. The
speech drew anger in some quarters although administration officials would
not comment publicly on his views.
Mr Prestowitz, who works closely with the administration, said the US
originally pressed for the Uruguay Round as a means to deal multilaterally
with Japan.
'The theory was that other countries would join us, but it doesn't tend to
work that way,' he said. Other countries - in Asia and the EU - want to
maintain their own invisible barriers.
Mr Jules Katz, former deputy trade representative, favours the multilateral
approach and says many more cases could be brought before dispute settlement
panels of the new World Trade Organisation. 'Why should we be carrying the
ball alone, particularly since the results are always multilateralised?' he
asked.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Financial services still face curbs to market entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intensive bilateral and multilateral negotiations over the past four years
have broken down market barriers to foreign banks and securities firms in
countries around the world. But lack of competitive opportunity for foreign
financial institutions remains 'the rule rather than the exception'.
These are the findings of a new 739-page US Treasury report covering the
last four years.
Bilateral talks between the US and Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan have
'yielded progress in a number of key areas,' according to the report. Japan
has permitted establishment of foreign investment trust management companies
and has expanded the range of securities foreign firms can underwrite and
sell.
The report says China has expanded the number of locations for foreign
branch banking and lets foreign banks buy and sell foreign exchange on
behalf of foreign-invested joint ventures. Korea has formulated a three
stage framework for comprehensive financial sector liberalisation, and
Taiwan has partially lifted a ban on foreign bank branch entry.
Brazil, on the other hand, still prohibits new entry of foreign banks and
has frozen increases in foreign participation in the ownership of existing
institutions. Several countries - including Chile, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand - have bans on the issuance of new domestic banking licenses.
The EU's single market in financial services is being implemented on a
reciprocal basis, but a number of European countries impose capital
requirements on branches of foreign banks which do not apply to EU banks,
according to the report.
Negotiations completed in the Uruguay Round established a framework of
multilateral disciplines under the General Agreement on Trade in Services
(Gats). In these talks - due to conclude six months after the launch of the
World Trade Organisation - the US is seeking binding commitments to reduce
or eliminate a broad range of barriers.
In a statement accompanying the report, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury
secretary, outlined a three-step strategy to press for further financial
liberalisation. First the US will not agree to provide national treatment,
equalising the opportunities for foreign and US banks, unless other
'commercially important countries' commit to further openings.
The US will continue to press openings in bilateral negotiations. It is also
pushing for development and integration of capital markets around the world,
using as enticement technical assistance and loan programmes offered by the
multilateral financial institutions.
The US has been simplifying access to its own markets. Since 1990, a total
of 305 new foreign securities groups have entered the US market.

FT  05 DEC 94 / China attacks US as 'obstacle' to Gatt entry: Irritation
over Washington's trade demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China renewed its trenchant attack on Washington at the weekend citing the
US as the 'main obstacle' to its entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade and accusing it of engaging in a 'political, economic and
psychological game'.
Mr Yu Peiwei of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
accused the US of using Gatt to 'pry open' China's financial, insurance,
telecommunications, transport and other service markets for its own
companies.
'Areas the US wants most from China are those in which American businesses
have the strongest advantage, such as the car and aircraft industries as
well as trade in services,' Mr Yu said in an interview with the official
Business Weekly newspaper.
Mr Yu's remarks, which are similar in tone to an increasingly irritable
Chinese position on the US and Gatt, come on the eve of the resumption of
Geneva talks between Chinese and American negotiators. The Chinese official
claimed that US efforts to stall China's entry to Gatt were motivated by
fear that a 'rapidly growing Chinese economy would enable China to join
hands with developing countries to threaten the US dominant status in the
world economy.'
Beijing has been pressing hard to rejoin the Gatt and thus become a
founder-member of its successor World Trade Organisation which is due to be
inaugurated at the beginning 1995. But continuing argument over tariff
reductions and market access issues is holding up China's application.
US negotiators are pressing China hard to improve its offer of phased tariff
reductions and market access to the agricultural, non-agricultural and
services sectors. China argues that as a developing country it risks
widespread economic disruption if it complies with US demands.
In Geneva last week, Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator, set the end
of this year as the deadline for 'substantive negotiations' on its Gatt
entry. China withdrew from the trading accord in 1950, the year after the
communists came to power.
Mr Long said after talks with Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt secretary general,
that China would not make any new, substantive offers in negotiations on the
Gatt protocol. China would also not 'on its own initiative' seek bilateral
negotiations with Gatt contracting parties and meetings of the working party
after the end-of-year deadline.
The European Union, which has adopted a more conciliatory posture than the
American 'hard line', has suggested that China be accorded 'founder-member'
status of the WTO pending completion of negotiation of its protocol for
entry.

FT  05 DEC 94 / BAT's American tobacco hopes raise a question of
competition: Richard Tomkins reports on the US cigarette market and why the
anti-trust regulator opposes a bid by the British group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1927, the British took over a big chunk of the US cigarette industry when
the UK company now known as BAT Industries bought Brown &amp; Williamson
Tobacco, one of the largest US cigarette manufacturers. Now BAT Industries
is trying to take another slice through a Dollars 1bn takeover of American
Tobacco. Will the US let it happen?
The answer will largely hang on a hearing that begins today in New York, at
the end of which a US federal court will decide whether or not to support
the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block the acquisition.
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, made its
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) cash offer for American Tobacco, the fifth biggest
US cigarette maker, in April. The would-be vendor is American Brands, the
diversified US consumer products group that is American Tobacco's parent.
Both BAT and American Brands are keen to complete the deal. But at the end
of October the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would try to halt
it, saying the takeover would substantially reduce competition in the US
cigarette market and result in anti-competitive pricing.
Over the next two weeks, the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York will consider the FTC's request for an injunction barring the
acquisition. In theory, an injunction would be a temporary measure pending a
full hearing of the FTC's complaint; in practice, the court's decision, or
any appeal against it, is likely to settle the matter.
In many ways, it seems odd that BAT should want to buy American Tobacco at
all. In the US, the proportion of adults who smoke has dwindled to 25 per
cent, and in the last 10 years cigarette sales have been shrinking the rate
of 2-3 per cent a year. Meanwhile, smokers and cigarette makers are under
siege: big increases in cigarette taxes may be on the way, the Clinton
administration is threatening to introduce sweeping curbs on smoking in
public places, and the manufacturers are facing a new wave of product
liability lawsuits from well-heeled plaintiff attorneys.
These factors, however, have driven down the market value of US cigarette
companies, making them more attractive to buyers. And since BAT Industries
already owns Brown &amp; Williamson in the US, it stands to reap big benefits
from the acquisition of American Tobacco because of the cost savings that
would result from merging the two companies' manufacturing and distribution.
The FTC's objection to the takeover rests on the argument that it would
remove a player from a market that is already highly concentrated. American
Tobacco has not followed other companies' price increases, the FTC says, so
the acquisition would eliminate an aggressive competitor. If American
Tobacco went, the chances of collusion between remaining players would
increase, and prices would probably go up.
The FTC's argument is compelling. There are only six cigarette manufacturers
in the US, one of which is already owned by BAT. According to US merger
guidelines, a market is regarded as highly concentrated if it scores more
than 1,800 points on a formula called the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The US
cigarette market scores more than 2,900.
Yet BAT has some strong arguments, too. It points out that the two largest
companies in the US cigarette market, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco,
together account for more than 70 per cent of cigarette sales. BAT's Brown &amp;
Williamson, the third biggest, has only 11 per cent. Even after a merger
with American Tobacco, Brown &amp; Williamson would remain a distant third with
a market share of less than 18 per cent: but a stronger Brown &amp; Williamson
would be better able to compete with the two market giants.
On price, BAT says there is no likelihood of collusion, with or without the
takeover. Competition is becoming more intense as manufacturers fight to
increase sales in a shrinking market. In addition, restrictions on cigarette
advertising have eroded loyalty to all but the most powerful brands, leading
to extremely competitive pricing.
Recently, BAT points out, the downward pressure on prices has grown still
stronger because of the proliferation of cut-price, own-label cigarettes. If
evidence were needed of the increasing competitive pressures, it came last
year on 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris slashed the price of its
leading brand to claw back market share.
The arguments are finely balanced and it would take a brave pundit to
predict the outcome. But BAT does at least start with the advantage that it
has been here before: in 1988 it spend eight months fighting the regulatory
authorities in nine states before succeeding in its Dollars 5.2bn takeover
bid for Farmers, the US insurance group.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Leaders aim to upgrade CSCE role: Bruce Clark on debate
beginning today over a new security order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of more than 50 nations gather in Budapest today for an
ambitious effort to work out a new security order for Europe and the former
Soviet republics, aimed at reducing the danger of further conflicts such as
Bosnia.
The idea of upgrading the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
has some powerful supporters, including US President Bill Clinton, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
While Germany and Russia are long-standing proponents of a stronger CSCE,
the US has weighed in more recently with its own proposals to make the
institution a more effective instrument for preventative diplomacy and arms
control.
The CSCE comprises the US, Canada, and almost every country in Europe and
the former Soviet Union. It was born nearly 20 years as a playing field for
cold war diplomacy, in which the Soviet Union promoted respect for existing
borders, while western countries advanced the principle of human rights and
free speech.
A document circulated two weeks ago by the US calls for the CSCE to 'assume
a central role in the promotion of a common European security space ...' But
a shadow has been cast over the summit by the grave problems that arose last
week in the other international institutions that are supposed to be dealing
with security in Europe: the United Nations, Nato and the 'contact group' on
Bosnia.
With the US, Russia and the main west European powers barely able to conceal
their differences over Bosnia and the future of Nato, diplomats say they
will be hard pressed to bring any real credibility to the more ambitious
project of an upgraded CSCE.
An important product of the CSCE process was the treaty on Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE), a giant exercise in non-nuclear disarmament whose
terms Russia now wants to revise. But the CSCE's commitment to border
security was unable to prevent the disintegration from within of three of
its founder members: the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Czechoslovakia.
The CSCE's human rights inspectorate has worked well in places such as the
Baltic states and Albania which were keen to co-operate because they felt
they were being unfairly accused of ill-treating minorities.
Yet the break-up of the Soviet Union has left the CSCE with a number of
member states - particularly on the southern flank of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a group of 12 former Soviet republics which Russia
increasingly dominates - which make no pretence of observing western norms
on human rights. Moscow would now like the CSCE to become the apex of a new
security system whose twin arms would be Nato and the CIS.
Western countries have balked at any suggestion of downgrading Nato, but the
US has recently spelt out a compromise position: the CSCE should be boosted,
without watering down the Atlantic alliance in any way.
Both the US and Hungary, which is hosting today's meeting, have suggested
going halfway to meet Russian aspirations for a stronger CSCE would help to
blunt Moscow's objections to the enlargement of Nato. However, the tough
position adopted by Russia at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in
Brussels last week suggests that Moscow will not be bought off easily.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, refused at the last moment
to approve a Russia-Nato co-operation programme, in protest at Nato's newly
adopted plans for faster enlargement.
This came after the US, in the hope of assuaging Moscow, had persuaded its
15 allies in Nato to support its proposals for a stronger CSCE.
The US now supports the German idea that CSCE members should refer any
conflicts to the CSCE as a 'halfway house' before resorting to the UN.
Washington also wants the CSCE to develop stronger 'early warning'
mechanisms which could give notice of potential conflicts and help to defuse
them.
A big test of the CSCE will be the fate of its long-standing effort to set
up a peace-keeping force in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave
of Azerbaijan where tens of thousands have died in fighting since 1988.
Moscow wants any peacekeeping force to be mainly Russian, while Azerbaijan
has been pressing, with western support, for a multinational effort.
Russia's insistence on as free as possible a hand for its 'peace-keeping'
activities has fuelled western fears that Moscow simply wants to use the
CSCE to license its military presence in the southern republics of the CIS.
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has postponed his departure for
Budapest because one of the most prominent campaigners for the republic's
independence, Mr Georgy Chanturia, was assassinated over the weekend. His
associates blamed 'imperialist forces'.

Ukraine will formally renounce its nuclear status today, ending a
long-running row over the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and opening the way
for the delayed implementation of superpower arms cuts, Reuter reports from
Budapest.
President Leonid Kuchma said yesterday he had come to the European security
summit in Budapest ready to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
provided he gets the guarantees he wants for Ukraine's protection.
US President Bill Clinton is scheduled to preside over a signing ceremony
with President Kuchma on the margins of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe summit today. The deal opens the way for long-delayed
implementation of old Cold War era superpower arms cuts under the Start-1
treaty.
Of the three other former Soviet republics which inherited nuclear weapons,
Russia remains a nuclear power while Belarus and Kazakhstan have already
given them up.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Budapest mayor savours political spotlight: Europe's
changing cities - Virginia Marsh analyses the transformation of Hungary's
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The only thing Budapest mayor Gabor Demszky was worried about as his city
prepared for today's 53-nation European security summit was the traffic. And
he should know. One of his jobs during the communist era when he was banned
from practising law was a taxi driver in the capital, central Europe's
largest metropolis.
As it happened, main roads were blocked off last night and guarded by
several thousand extra police officers bussed in from the countryside. Two
hundred new Mercedes limousines, ordered for the occasion, were lined up to
whisk heads of governments, foreign ministers and their many attendants into
the city centre.
'We're closing schools and telling everyone to stay at home or to use public
transport,' said Mr Demszky. 'There'll be no problems if there are no
traffic jams,' he said.
A doctor of law, Mr Demszky drove taxis when he was not allowed to practise
as a lawyer because he had a police record for organising a political
demonstration at university in the days of the Soviet domination of eastern
Europe.
Later, as a founder and leader of Hungary's underground publishing movement,
he become one of the country's most prominent - and persecuted - dissidents.
Now consistently rated as one of Hungary's most popular leaders, the
42-year-old mayor looks set to be re-elected for another four years in next
Sunday's local elections. 'I was the organiser behind the underground
movement,' he said. 'The others liked to speak and write but I was the one
responsible for keeping the whole thing moving and alive. This job is the
same.'
He said one of his most difficult tasks was balancing the rapidly changing
and differing needs of the city's more than 2m inhabitants as the country
moved towards a market economy. His electorate includes both the newly rich
entrepreneurial classes who live in mansions perched high above the Danube
in the hills of Buda as well as slum-dwellers living on the other side of
the river in Pest whose flat suburbs stretch for miles towards the puszta,
the Great Plain.
'It's incredible how rich some people have become in the last five years,'
he said. 'You just have to count the cars coming across the bridges from
Buda in the morning. There are more Mercedes 600s in this town than in
Vienna.'
There are also more Trabants. The rattling and spluttering two stroke
vehicles, made in the former East Germany, account for a fifth of the city's
550,000 cars. The mayor, a dedicated environmentalist, plans to change this.
His city council is offering up to three years of bus passes for those
willing to consign their Trabant to a scrap heap. Last year, more than 2,000
Trabant owners obliged.
The collapse of heavy industry in the last five years and a shift to trade
and commerce, Budapest's traditional mainstays, have also helped cut
pollution that has blackened the facades of the capital's otherwise elegant
boulevards.
The mayor estimates the number employed in the financial services sector
will more than double to 200,000 in three years, leaving few employed in
heavy industry.
Many new jobs are being created by multinational companies using Budapest as
a base for expansion into eastern Europe.
'Vienna was the regional base for many companies in the communist-era but
we're the last frontier to eastern markets now,' he says.
Rivalry with Vienna, some 300km up the Danube, is nothing new. Much of the
city was built in Hungary's golden era after the country was freed from
direct Austrian rule in 1867. Hungary's new kings combined the ancient
cities of Obuda, Buda and Pest to form Budapest in 1872 and, in the years up
to the First World War, set about creating a city to rival the Austrian
capital, according to Mr Andras Vegh, historian at the City Museum.
'Many of the city's greatest landmarks - the tower on the Matthias church,
St Stephen's Basilica and the parliament - were built during this time when
a main aim was to be able to compare Budapest with Vienna and compete with
the Austrians,' he said.
These days, however, Mr Demszky prefers to compare modern Budapest with New
York which he chose as the capital's twin city. He said the two cities
shared the same cosmopolitan, fast-moving atmosphere: 'It's not surprising.
New York was built by emigrants from this country and this
(Austro-Hungarian) monarchy,' he said.
'You feel the same central European and Jewish culture and see the same
architecture as you do in Budapest. The city has its own engine, its own
lines of development.
'This will push it forward,' he said, 'regardless of what happens elsewhere
in the country.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Machine tool makers urge subsidy for workers laid off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's machine tool makers want the European Commission to introduce a
scheme that would allow them to keep skilled workers on the payroll in
recessions and re-employ them when recovery starts.
The plea follows the worst recession in the history of Europe's machine tool
industry, which accounts for 41 per cent of world production. Employment in
Europe has dropped from 200,000 in 1990 to 132,000 this year.
At a meeting last week with Mr Alexander Schaub, deputy director of the
commission's industry affairs directorate, the European machine tool
umbrella body Cecimo asked for a scheme similar to one introduced recently
in Japan. Under this, the Japanese government pays up to three-quarters of
the wages of workers when a company is obliged to cease production
temporarily. The subsidy can last for up to one year.
Mr Pierluigi Streparava, president of Brussels-based Cecimo, said in a
recession the industry was forced to shed highly-skilled workers - needed to
develop and sell sophisticated machinery.
'Later, you need them back, but the workers have most probably found a job
elsewhere,' he said. 'So you have to wait two to three years before you can
train someone else to the same level.' The plea is one of a number of
proposals from Cecimo, which has 12 member countries in western Europe. They
complement a recent commission communication on strengthening
competitiveness in the European mechanical engineering industry, which was
presented to industry ministers last month.
Among other proposals from Cecimo are a research and development programme
for manufacturing technology that would combine the relevant projects in the
European Union-backed Esprit and Brite/Euram programmes. Cecimo says this
would be easier for machine tool producers, which are mainly small and
medium-sized enterprises, to enter.
Cecimo described last week's talks as the most positive it had had with the
Commission, which will discuss the communication in January with member
states and the mechanical engineering industry.
Cecimo hopes that, under the French presidency in the first half of next
year, the communication could become a resolution adopted by industry
ministers. Meanwhile, it says production and consumption of machine tools in
Europe has stabilised this year after falls of 19 per cent and 30 per cent
respectively last year, but prices and profitability were still under
pressure.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Swiss back curb on drug dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss citizens yesterday voted massively in support of a law making it
easier to detain immigrant drug dealers who pose as asylum seekers.
Religious and left-wing groups opposed the law's tough sanctions as
infringements of human rights. They also feared it would foment
anti-immigrant sentiment.
But Swiss have been disturbed recently by the sight of misery at Zurich's
open drug scene, rising violent crime and a threat from Lebanese dealers
last August to start a bombing campaign in the city.
Nearly three-quarters of those who voted supported the law. There were
majorities in every canton, big ones everywhere except in Geneva.
The law is aimed at stopping foreign drug dealers from taking advantage of
the asylum law. Typically, these dealers throw their passports away after
entering the country. Then they apply for political asylum and proceed to
deal.
If they are caught, the police can detain them only for 30 days. If their
applications for asylum are still under consideration, they cannot easily be
deported. When they finally do leave, relatives or friends replace them.
The new law allows for detention of any foreigner found without
identification for three months, and for a further nine months if he appeals
against a deportation order. If the person is believed to constitute a
threat to law and order, he can be ordered to keep away from specified
areas.
The new law is one of several measures which has been taken in the past
three months following a radical reversal of Zurich's liberal policy towards
its large drug addict community.

FT  05 DEC 94 / International Press Review: The Reykjavik-Oslo-Vaduz-Berne
axis - Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland is not known for its lively political life.
But in recent years, two issues - European integration and the problems
associated with drug addiction - have achieved an extraordinarily long life.
The referendums in Sweden and Norway on joining the EU sparked a fresh round
of reflection in Switzerland over the country's decision in a referendum in
December 1992 to eschew participating in European integration.
And a national referendum yesterday on a law that would make it easier for
police to detain immigrant drug dealers brought out again the widespread
indignation over Zurich city's open drug scene.
It has come as an unpleasant surprise to the Swiss to discover that they are
so divided over these issues that they are willing to debate them in public.
It has long been a matter of firm belief in this multicultural country that
civil harmony is best achieved through compromises arrived at discreetly
behind closed doors.
The Swiss media are equally steeped in the tradition of seeking a middle way
rather than asserting radical points of view. No mainstream Swiss newspaper
or magazine, for example, can see any alternative to joining the European
Union. The only difference between them is in the degree of wit employed in
condemning their country for what they see as its foolishness.
The decision by Norwegians to stay outside the EU provided considerable
scope. Anti-EU Swiss politicians had wasted no time in asserting that the
decision meant the European Free Trade Association (Efta), with Norway,
Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein as remaining members, could still
have a viable future.
Richard Diethelm in Zurich's Tages Anzeiger responded sardonically: 'An Efta
menu reduced to fondue and fish is too indigestible to have any expectation
of being a permanent part of the Swiss diet.'
Jacques Pilet in Geneva's Nouveau Quotidien was more indignant. 'It is not
serious to claim that a Reykjavik-Oslo-Vaduz-Berne axis will enable us to
defend our interests effectively in the European Union,' he said.
Another element of the European issue has reappeared because last month the
European Commission finally agreed to discuss six issues bilaterally with
Switzerland. In the wake of the anti-EEA vote two years ago, the Swiss set
out to negotiate urgent matters, such as landing rights in EU countries for
Swissair.
The Neue Zurcher Zeitung, which has had more reservations about integration
than most, warned its readers to expect the worst: 'Certainly, there is at
the moment no alternative to bilateralism for Switzerland. But let no one be
deceived. This is not the same as an active, comprehensive integration
policy, but only a damage limitation policy.'
Zurich's drug policy has also divided the Swiss to an extent rarely seen
before. Yesterday's referendum backed increased police powers of search,
arrest and detention when dealing with asylum seekers.
Again, the range of opinion on this issue has been relatively narrow, with
the only unqualified criticism coming from commentators in the
French-speaking part of the country. They resent Switzerland's human rights
record being tarnished because the Zurich city government's experiment with
a liberal drug policy ran out of control.
Jacques-Simon Eggly in the Journal de Geneve wrote last week: 'If it passes,
I hope at least that the judges retain in their minds the troubled
consciences of those who, however attached they are to security and the
struggles against crime and drugs, fought it.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Russian oil quotas spark controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is to carve up the domestic oil market among Russian
oil companies, requiring each to supply a certain percentage of the market.
International financial institutions say the move breaches the spirit of the
agreements between them and the government and jeopardises the future of
crucial negotiations over big loans to stabilise the economy next year.
The decision, communicated at the weekend by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, to his deputy premiers, would allow the Russian companies
freely to export the surplus after fulfilling their domestic quotas.
In literal terms this would lift export quotas, a pledge made by President
Boris Yeltsin in July. However, the replacement of export by domestic quotas
would mean that the oil price would be kept to around its present low level
of 20-30 per cent of world prices. This would in turn preserve a structure
which gives rise to extensive illegal export of oil, with huge profits being
made from the difference in domestic and world prices.
It also reintroduces into a relatively free, if chaotic, domestic market
Soviet-era controls on supply - justified by the strategic importance of the
product.
Both Russian and international financial officials, speaking on terms of
anonymity, expressed disappointment over the decision yesterday. It means
that a Dollars 600m (Pounds 366m) oil rehabilitation loan negotiated with
the World Bank will not now go through. What is more serious, negotiations
between a team of officials from the International Monetary Fund and the
government on loans of up to Dollars 13bn meant to support the 1995 budget
and stabilise the currency in the coming year will restart today under a
cloud. 'If this decision, which does not require a special decree or
agreement from the parliament, cannot go through,' said one official, 'then
what chance is there for real agreement on much more difficult issues which
do require such decisions?'
According to Russian reformers, senior ministers fear that the simple
lifting of export quotas will cause the oil price to shoot up towards world
levels, producing high inflation and social unrest - and that so much oil
will be exported there will be serious shortages in the coming winter. The
reformers believe that a combination of export tariffs and lack of pipeline
capacity would keep a check on prices, though they accept that prices will,
and should, rise significantly.
However, both the international officials and the reformers believe the
government decision was taken because of heavy pressure from the oil lobby,
whose managers benefit hugely from the price differential. A Russian
financier said, 'The system benefits almost everyone involved - except a few
reformers who believe in a free market.'
The decision will also benefit the foreign oil companies which have joint
ventures in Russia. They had been told that, were quotas to end, they would
be replaced by a system in which exports were based on what percentage of
total domestic production their output represented, threatening a huge drop
in their earnings, most of which come from the agreed export of 100 per cent
of production.
Russia produces roughly 300m tonnes of oil a year and exports around 100m
tonnes, - a level which has stayed relatively stable even as production
continues to drop, reflecting lack of investment in new fields.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Germans and British hold similar views on European Union:
One third support local council power - Both countries find US most reliable
ally / Single currency widely opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Euro-enthusiasm rankings, Britain and Germany usually appear at
different ends of the league table. Germany traditionally embodies a
commitment to deepening and widening European integration, while Britain is
well known for its scepticism.
The customary view of the breadth of the Euro-gulf between the two countries
was put baldly by a German minister earlier this year: 'We want a united
Europe. All you (the British) want is a free trade zone.'
In fact, as one of the most comprehensive polls ever undertaken on the
subject shows, the views of the British and German electorates on the future
of Europe are closer than such statements suggest. Although Germans are much
happier with the present position of their country and their regions within
the European Union, they are even more sceptical than the British about
intensifying political and monetary ties with existing EU partners. They
have also grown reluctant about widening the EU towards the east.
There is a similar desire in both countries for decisions to be taken as
much as possible at the local level, in line with the principle of
subsidiarity that the EU has been trying to foster. A third of respondents
in Britain and Germany say decisions affecting ordinary people should be
carried out by local government or councils. However, this wish is much more
difficult to put into practice in Britain because of the weakness of local
and regional governments.
Both countries think the US is more reliable than their European partners,
with two-fifths of respondents naming Washington as their nation's strongest
ally. The Germans view France far more favourably than Britain. More
surprisingly, a relatively large percentage of Britons above the age of 60 -
some 8 per cent - sees Germany as Britain's strongest ally. Eastern Germans
show above-average reliance on the US and are even less inclined than west
Germans to point to Russia as an ally.
In attitudes towards Europe, there are large disparities according to age,
social background and region in both Britain and Germany. Broadly speaking,
in both countries young higher-income males are most in favour of EU
membership, while women take a more sceptical line. Conservative voters in
Germany are more positive about the EU than those on the left, while in
Britain Labour supporters are slightly more inclined to call EU membership
'a good thing'.
Younger British people are much more in favour of increasing powers for the
European parliament and building up EU political ties than are older voters.
The generation gap on such points is less marked in Germany. In Britain many
more older people than younger ones say their region is worse off as a
result of the EU, while in Germany, the opposite is true: older people are
more favourable to membership than those under 30.
Support for the Ecu as a possible name for a future European currency is
strongest among higher-income voters with better educational backgrounds in
both Germany and Britain.
Britons are much more gloomy than Germans on the present economic impact of
the EU. Although support for EU membership has declined significantly in
both countries during the past few years, it has descended in Germany from a
much higher base. In Britain, only one region - Scotland - out of 11
maintains, on balance, that it has benefited from EU membership. By
contrast, in Germany six of the 10 regions say they are 'better off' as the
result of the EU.
In Germany, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Berlin
are most enthusiastic about regional benefits. Overall support for the EU is
only slightly greater in western Germany than in the east, a sign that
increases in Brussels funding for east Germany may be starting to improve
pro-EU sentiment in the east.
Some of the most negative attitudes on the EU's regional impact are found in
areas of high unemployment such as Yorkshire and northern England, and
Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. However, relatively prosperous
southern regions in both countries - London and south-east England, and
Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg - also show negative reactions.
There is a sharp contrast between Britain and Germany over the European
parliament, with half of Britons opposed to giving it new powers to control
the Commission, compared with only 12 per cent in Germany. On fundamental
questions of the EU's future structure, however, the two countries are
closer. Opposition to a single currency, a strong desire for a referendum on
the issue, and lukewarm views on political union are put forward
consistently by all categories of respondents in different regions in the
two countries.
Lowest support for a single currency comes from southern regions of both
Britain and Germany, with eastern Germany more reticent than the west.
Strongest support for a referendum comes from the state of Hesse - the home
of the German Bundesbank.
German eagerness to forge closer links with eastern Europe may be cooling as
a result of economic pressure. East German states are only slightly more
keen on enlarging the EU eastwards than the generally sceptical west
Germans; in previous opinion polls the east Germans had been much more in
favour.
Supporters of the Christian Democratic Union are least enthusiastic about
enlargement. The German states with the strongest desire for enlargement -
Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, close to the French border - are furthest
away from the east. In Britain, Scotland and south-west England are most in
favour of eastward enlargement, with other southern areas much less keen.
When scores are combined on a range of issues linking feelings about the
EU's present impact to views about its future, Rhineland-Palatinate has by
far the highest 'Euro-comfort' index of the two countries. Only one British
region - Scotland - has a positive score, compared with nine in Germany.
The population in the newcomer east German states seems much less ignorant
about the EU than much of Britain. In Brandenburg an above-average 57 per
cent answered correctly that Brussels is the site of the European
Commission.
The east Midlands takes the prize as the worst-informed region, with only 38
per cent of respondents replying correctly. The most knowledgeable areas
seem to be North Rhine-Westphalia and south-west England, where 64 per cent
of respondents correctly identified Brussels.

<TEXT>
Russia's most prominent private businessman accused President Boris
Yeltsin's personal guards at the weekend of being involved in a bizarre raid
on his company's offices on Friday night, John Thornhill writes from Moscow.
A large detachment of heavily armed troops, wearing camouflage uniforms and
balaclavas, surrounded the offices of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky's Most group,
refusing to identify themselves. They took away several Most security guards
and drivers in unmarked cars.
No official reason was given but the Itar-Tass news agency, quoting
'authoritative sources', suggested its aim was to confiscate documents
relating to Most Bank's alleged involvement in the rouble crash of October
11. The president's press secretary said Mr Yeltsin had launched an inquiry
into the raid but would not confirm whether his guards had been involved.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Tory right urges rebels to back PM in VAT vote: Lilley hopes
suspended MPs will soon regain party whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory rebels suspended from the parliamentary party for defying Mr John Major
over Europe were yesterday promised powerful rightwing backing if they
support the government in a crucial vote on value added tax.
In a clear hint of the strength of rightwing support for rapprochement with
the rebels, Mr Peter Lilley, the Eurosceptic social security secretary, said
he hoped they would 'get themselves back on board as soon as possible'.
He told BBC television Mr Major had no option but to withdraw the whip after
the rebels abstained on a vote of confidence. But he said they could 'work
themselves back into the party'.
However, some of the rebels appear determined to remain outside the
parliamentary party until the government bows to their demands for a
referendum on further integration with the European Union.
Ministers remain confident that a Labour procedural motion reopening the
issue of VAT on domestic fuel will be defeated tomorrow in spite of a
threatened rebellion by up to a dozen Tory backbenchers.
But government whips say that the outcome may depend on the loyalty of four
of the eight backbenchers from whom the whip was withdrawn.
The four are Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Michael Carttiss, Mr Nicholas Winterton and
Mr Richard Shepherd. Sir Richard Body, who resigned the whip voluntarily, is
also a potential VAT rebel.
All nine MPs who lost the party whip last week have been warned by the
government whips' office that their prospects of being readmitted to the
parliamentary party would be damaged by a further rebellion.
However, Mr Major is coming under pressure from senior Conservatives to
rehabilitate the rebels quickly to rebuild the government's majority, which
was wiped out by the decision to withdraw the party whip.
Some of the rebels appeared reluctant to respond to overtures from the
government. Mr Marlow said: 'When and whether we have the whip back, one
thing that is certain is that we are not going to take it back in ones and
twos. We are all going to take it back together or not at all.'
Others said their decision to rejoin the parliamentary party might depend on
the government's willingness to bow to pressure for a referendum on further
integration with Europe.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told BBC television that the case
for a referendum was unproven. However, Mr Lilley added to the impression
that the government is moving towards conceding such a vote. 'The case
against a referendum is least strong on a constitutional issue where there
are divisions within parties and there is no clear divide between parties.'

FT  05 DEC 94 / Bid to create third largest Italian bank wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna banking
group, have backed plans for an improved bid by Credito Italiano (Credit),
aimed at creating Italy's third-largest banking group.
The Milan bank, privatised last year, plans to buy 65 per cent of Rolo at
L20,000 a share, a 17 per cent premium to Friday's closing price. Today the
two banks are likely to seek Bank of Italy approval for the deal, which
would value the whole company at more than L4,350bn (Pounds 1.7bn).
If Rolo's shareholders accept the offer it will end six weeks of uncertainty
about the future of one of Italy's strongest regional banks, and show that
further consolidation of the fragmented Italian banking sector can be
achieved only if local interests are respected.
Credit disclosed at the end of October that it planned to bid L19,000 a
share for only 48 per cent of Rolo, to add to the 2 per cent stake it
already owned. Rolo's directors dismissed the proposal as hostile and
inadequate.
At a meeting on Saturday night, the Rolo board was finally won over by
Credit's commitment to pay more for a larger stake and the promise that
Rolo's regional identity and generous dividend policy would be preserved.
The stake will cost the Milan bank more than L2,800bn - about equal to
Credit's own market capitalisation - and the two banks will have combined
assets of nearly L145,000bn and about 1,000 branches across the country.
In a statement, Rolo's board said the new offer would 'respect the interests
of the Rolo group and its shareholders better than (the earlier plan)'. The
decision was backed by all directors, including representatives of Rolo's
largest shareholders, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, the
Italian computer group, and Banque Nationale de Paris.
Rolo's decision is likely to kill off alternative plans for a merger between
Rolo and Caer, the parent company of the neighbouring Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna (Carisbo).
Italian newspapers speculated yesterday that Carisbo might now launch a
counter-bid with the help of Cariplo, the unquoted Milan institution that
claims to be the world's biggest savings bank. However, analysts said the
price paid by Credit was already high, and although Cariplo has been
watching the situation, the savings bank indicated last month that it would
only be interested in a friendly takeover of Rolo.
Credit was controlled by Iri, the Italian state holding company, until
privatisation a year ago. At the end of September, Credit used its new-found
freedom to issue shares and bonds to help pay for acquisitions. With the
exercise of warrants, the two issues should eventually raise more than
L2,600bn.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Rifkind set for talks on peace effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is expected to meet United Nations
military commanders in former Yugoslavia today as pressure mounts for a
rapid withdrawal of UN peacekeepers if renewed peace efforts in Bosnia fail.
Mr Rifkind said yesterday that the increase in fighting between the Bosnian
Serbs and Moslems was making the task of the UN 'infinitely more difficult'.
If Serbs followed up threats to target UN troops, withdrawal would become
inevitable.
His warning came as the foreign ministers of Britain and France met Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in Belgrade to press on him the
urgent need for a ceasefire in the enclave of Bihac and throughout Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said after the talks: 'We don't
feel that we have much time. We don't feel all these matters can be
discussed in a leisurely way.'
The threat of a UN withdrawal - which might pitch Bosnia's warring parties
into a more violent conflict - is one of the few cards the international
community can still play after the failure of last week's meeting of the
five-nation contact group to agree on a joint strategy.
In the wake of the group's failure, Washington at the weekend made direct
contact with the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Charles Redman, a former US special envoy
on Yugoslavia, travelled to their self-declared capital Pale, but talks made
no headway, US officials said.
The western allies appear to be diverging on how to stop the conflict
deteriorating, and Mr Milosevic was last night understood to have been
angered by the approach to the Bosnian Serbs.
Political discord on Bosnia also deepened within the US. Senator Robert
Dole, who will soon be majority leader in the upper house, yesterday
advocated a three-point plan.
It would start with a pull-out of the United Nations peacekeepers, involve a
lifting of the arms embargo, and a 'robust' Nato bombing campaign on Serb
military targets in Bosnia.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, speaking on the same television
programme, portrayed the senator's policy as 'essentially a war strategy'
which in the end would require the commitment of 'hundreds of thousands of
US ground troops'.
Mr Newt Gingrich, the leading House of Representatives Republican, said the
allies should train and arm the Bosnian government - with money and weapons
provided by Islamic countries which he thought would 'gladly pay'.
British officials said talk of a troop withdrawal was not intended as a
threat, but was a realistic assessment of the increasing danger to Britain's
3,300-strong force. Mr Milosevic told Mr Hurd that a UN withdrawal would be
'very bad', said British officials.
Both Mr Hurd and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, praised Mr
Milosevic for accepting a peace plan devised in July, and they stressed that
the warring parties could negotiate swaps of territory, or constitutional
deals, once the basic plan had been accepted.
In a new demand, Mr Milosevic called for all the parties fighting in Bosnia
to be involved in negotiations.

FT  05 DEC 94 / Poll shows wide opposition to single EU currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Support for political and monetary union in Europe is even lower among
Germans than Britons, according to an opinion poll carried out for the
Financial Times.
Nearly two-thirds of adults in each of the two countries want a referendum
on a single European currency.
Only 33 per cent of Britons and 24 per cent of Germans support a single
currency, while 27 per cent of British voters and just 23 per cent of
Germans say they favour closer political links among EU members. Strong
opposition in Germany to a single currency is caused above all by Germans'
anxieties that a future European money might be less stable than the D-Mark.
The poll - the most comprehensive survey ever made of British and German
attitudes to European integration - consulted 1,919 respondents in the UK
and 2,455 in Germany. It was commissioned by the FT, the German news
magazine Der Spiegel, the UK office of the European Commission and the
Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society, and carried out
by MORI in Britain and Emnid in Germany.
In a result that may influence Euro-dissent in the British Conservative
party, a referendum on whether the EU should adopt a single currency is
favoured by 64 per cent of Britons and 65 per cent of Germans.
Commenting on the suggestion, Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime
minister and designated president of the European Commission, said he was
wary of the legal complexity of holding referendums on a single currency. He
pointed out the Maastricht treaty had already been ratified. 'What would
happen if (the people) said No?'
The survey shows that only 24 per cent of ordinary Germans support widening
the EU towards central and eastern Europe - a subject that will be high on
the agenda at this week's EU summit in Essen. By contrast, 42 per cent of
British respondents back the EU's prospective eastern enlargement.
According to the poll, the Germans are much more favourable to their own
country's EU membership than the British. A total of 28 per cent of British
respondents say their region has suffered as a result of EU membership,
against 14 per cent who say it has benefited. The equivalents in Germany are
15 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.
A total of 26 per cent of UK respondents, but only 9 per cent of Germans,
consider EU membership 'a bad thing'.
The poll shows how British and German voters want EU decision-making to be
carried out as much as possible at a regional level. On balance, British
respondents want local government to make the main decisions affecting
ordinary people, but most believe that European Commissioners have more
power over such decisions than either local councils or British ministers.
Commenting on the findings, Mr Geoffrey Martin, head of the European
Commission's office in London, said, 'British ministers should be seen more
openly to be taking responsibility for European-level decisions.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (25): Make money abroad from home
territory - Xenophobia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xenophobia, literally fear or hatred of foreigners, has been making an
unfortunate comeback in unscrupulous political circles around the world, but
continues to look extremely out of place in investment, where global
thinking is considered essential.
But in its wider definition - fear of strange customs - xenophobia could be
taken to mean no more than an aversion to the unfamiliar settlement systems
or currency dealing involved in buying and selling overseas investments.
Creatively treated, this phobia can be used to seek out British-based
companies with a high proportion of sales or earnings abroad. Investors can
then have the convenience of buying foreign earnings from home territory in
sterling, and may be able to secure tax advantages not normally available on
investments in some geographical areas.
For example, investors who want to hold investment trust shares in a
personal eguity plan, out of reach of capital gains and income taxes, have
to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the trust's portfolio is in countries
belonging to the European Union. But there is no similar geographical limit
for investors buying shares in individual industrial or financial companies
to place under a Pep shelter. So although Bunzl derives 63 per cent of its
sales from the US, Fisons 62 per cent and Grand Metropolitan 60 per cent,
all are fully eligible for Peps.
Analysts at BZW track UK companies' geographical sales exposure on a monthly
basis, using historic figures from annual reports and the firm's own
earnings forecasts for the next two years.
Analyst Steve Wright explained that BZW also took into account companies
exposed to the US dollar without necessarily selling anything in the US,
such as BP, Shell and British Airways, all buyers of oil; or
commodity-related stocks such as RTZ.
BZW mid-November figures reveal RTZ as an ideal stock for xenophobes with
investment wanderlust, offering just 1 per cent exposure to the UK market,
against 28 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region.
Zeneca is the next least reliant on Britain, with just 7 per cent exposure
to the UK against 45 per cent to the US and 15 per cent to Asia and the
Pacific. By comparison, Glaxo's UK/US exposure is 9 per cent/45 per cent.
Hanson's much advertised 'over there/over here' turns out to mean 45 per
cent of sales in the US and 43 per cent in Britain.
And there are no Eurosceptics in the building materials sector, judging by
the European exposure of RMC Group (67 per cent), BPB Industries (56 per
cent) and Redland (52 per cent).

FT  03 DEC 94 / (CORRECTED) Food &amp; Drink: Good but not great - Wine,
Burgundy's vintage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 17th December 1994) appended to this article.
The annual auction of the Hospices de Beaune's new wines last month provided
the first opportunity of assessing the quality of the latest vintage. The
results showed the trend in prices, although in the market they tend to
fluctuate less than at the auction where they are influenced by charity and
publicity factors.
For the last four years prices at the sale and the reputation of the wines
have been falling: with total receipts from an unreasonably high FFr29m
(Pounds 3.44m) to a disastrously low FFr10.9m last year. Something had to be
done. So a new cuvier - costing FFr25m - was built in a suburb of Beaune,
with stainless steel vats and an underground cellar that resembled the new
ones in Bordeaux, such as Pichon Lalande's.
No less important, Andrew Porcheret, the wine maker who used to supervise
the vintage, was retrieved after six years at the Domaine de La
Romanee-Conti. He organised this vintage much more strictly, discarding 15
per cent of the grapes and reducing the yield to around 25 hectolitres per
hectare, compared with a normal 35 to 40.
But even Porcheret could not control the weather and, as elsewhere in
France, hopes of a great vintage were blasted by two weeks of rain in
mid-September; but two fine weeks followed.
The Hospices put up for sale only 558 casks (four-fifths red) compared with
759 last year and prices rose by 51.15 per cent for the reds and 40.25 per
cent for the whites, making a sale total of FFr12.2m. The top red wine
price, apart from an hors concours bid of FFr100,000, for a cask of Clos de
la Roche Cuvee Georges Kriter, was FFr50,000 for Clos de la Roche Cuvee
Cyrot Chaudron. For the whites FFr75,000 was paid for the Batard-Montrachet
Cuvee Dames de Flandres.
Overall, the new Hospices wines have good colour, are well-balanced and
fairly light. After a prolonged fermentation, the reds had not undergone the
second malolactic fermention that reduces the acidity, and so were difficult
to assess. The whites were still cloudy with unfermented sugar.
Generally, however, the '94 whites are considered better than the reds,
whereas it was the other way round in 1993. One experienced merchant said
that the '94 whites may turn out almost as well and similar to the
outstanding '92s.
Success for the reds will depend on severe pruning in the winter or pruning
of the bunches in the summer, and strict selection at the vintage. As usual
there has been a good deal of over-production.
An indication of the care taken at the top level of the whites has been
given by the two largest properties in the seven-hectare Montrachet
vineyard: the Baron Thenard/ Remoissenet and the Marquis de La Drouchin
Guiche.
The former made only 24 casks compared with a normal 35, the latter 22
instead of 40.
The good quality of the vintage is demonstrated by a lively market. For the
'93s it barely started before Christmas but this year it began in September
for the '94s, and is already half over. In the lower level white
appellations, including the Cote de Beaune whites and Pouilly Fuisse, almost
all have been sold.
Consumers need not panic as there is no en primeur selling. Currently prices
in the Cote de Beaune (predominantly white) are up 15 per cent, and in the
Cote de Nuits (overwhelmingly red) are up 5-10 per cent.
Fine burgundy cannot be cheap, for relatively there is little of it, but in
constant franc terms the average price per cask has fallen from the 1989
peak of FFr44,475 for reds and FFr94,264 for whites to an estimated
FFr21,151 and FFr28,691 respectively.
Ridiculously, it is impossible now to ascertain demand for burgundy in the
UK, for Brussels issues no separate figures for individual EC countries. The
Comite Interprofessional in Beaune, and other associations elsewhere in
France, are trying to change this.
Meanwhile, the obvious vintages for consumers to buy from merchants who
specialise in burgundies are '92 for whites and, next year, the excellent
'93 reds and '93 whites that will turn out as attractive wines, probably for
early drinking, while the more esteemed years are left to mature. It is
hoped that the Burgundians have learnt the lessons of the recession for, as
a leading Beaune merchant said to me: 'Low prices feed the recovery, high
prices lead to disaster.'
CORRECTION
In my article of December 3, 'A good but not great vintage'
I stated that M Andre Porcheret, wine-maker of the Hospices de Beaune,
had previously been with the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, whereas he had
been at Dom Leroy.

FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods' white knight entered from stage right, strutted on the scene for
less than five hours and promptly exited stage left. Yesterday's
intervention by Ikotek, an unknown subsidiary of an obscure Canadian
company, proved irrelevant: shareholders controlling substantially less than
1 per cent of Attwoods' equity withdrew from initial acceptance of
Browning-Ferris Industries' offer.
Once BFI had raised its offer last month, Attwoods was left defending the
indefensible. From the start, Attwoods' management admitted the powerful
industrial logic behind combining the two businesses. Its only strategy was
to complain about the price. Attwoods insisted shareholders would receive
more if the company were broken up. However, it gave no figure for the
break-up value or names of companies interested in buying a piece. Worse,
there was no guarantee that the scheme would actually be implemented. Given
the choice between a promised break-up in six months and cash today, the
decision by the majority of shareholders to accept BFI's finely priced offer
was not a surprise.
The task before Attwoods' advisers was not easy and they may console
themselves that at least BFI was forced to raise its offer. However, the
combination of SG Warburg and Robert Fleming is clearly an unlucky one. It
is the same that advised Enterprise on its disastrous bid for Lasmo.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Browning-Ferris wins the day over Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods yesterday surrendered to the hostile Pounds 391m cash bid from
Browning-Ferris Industries, after a last-minute diversion which threatened
to throw the US waste giant's offer off course.
Just five hours before BFI's offer closed, an unknown private Canadian
company stepped in with the promise to bid Pounds 433m for the UK waste
group.
The pledge came from Ikotek, a waste recycling subsidiary of Sieber, which
is a private Canadian agricultural group owned by an Austrian-born
businessman.
Ikotek's decision to enter the fray at such a late stage took the market and
the bid protagonists by surprise. Even Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief
executive, described it as an 'unfortunate diversion'.
The shares jumped sharply on the news of a possible white knight, from 117p
to 127p, but fell back by the end of the day to close 3p up at 120p.
In the end, the diversion had little effect on BFI's offer of 120p per
share. Shareholders representing less than 1 per cent of Attwoods withdrew
their acceptances and BFI finished the day with an estimated 60 per cent
stake.
This includes Laidlaw's 29.8 per cent stake which it has agreed to sell to
BFI under the original offer of 109p. Ikotek was forced to withdraw from the
race.
Attwoods yesterday claimed a moral victory, with less than half the
independent shareholders accepting the offer. 'It is nice to know it was not
a landslide victory,' the company said.
The defence is believed to have cost up to Pounds 8m, inclu-ding paying
legal fees in the US and UK and charges for printing.
Attwoods' three advisers, SG Warburg and Robert Fleming of the UK and Smith
Barney of the US, are thought to have agreed to divide a set fee.
BFI is thought to have paid about Pounds 5m in fees. Unusually, BFI retained
just one adviser for its bid, CS First Boston. It is believed to be the
first time a foreign bank has advised on a successful hostile takeover in
the UK.
BFI said yesterday it did not expect to make any changes in the management
team right away. Mr Foreman, who is on a five-year rolling contract, could
be entitled to compensation payments of more than Pounds 500,000. He also
owns just under 1m shares. 'So I suppose you could say I won't go broke,' he
said.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Washington settles dispute with GM on trucks safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government yesterday abandoned its attempts to declare unsafe some 5m
pickup trucks made by General Motors in the 1980s. Instead of recalling the
trucks, at a claimed cost of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), the company
will pay Dollars 51m into a research fund on traffic safety - an apparent
victory for GM in a bitter two-year dispute.
The settlement ends an investigation into pickup trucks with side-mounted
fuel tanks made by GM between 1973 and 1987. The US Department of
Transportation had conceded the trucks conformed to safety standards at the
time, but claimed they were not adequate for today's conditions. GM last
month launched a lawsuit challenging the government's right to impose safety
standards retrospectively.
Mr Federico Pena, secretary of transportation, said the deal was a
commonsense outcome. 'Proceeding with the recall process would have taken
years in court. During all that time the trucks subject to this
investigation would have remained on our highways,' he said. The safety
research funded by GM, he said, would start to save lives immediately.
'The alternatives were to proceed with a recall that would have involved
years of litigation, an uncertain outcome and prevented few, if any deaths;
or I could have closed the case, with no public benefit at all,' he said.
In October, Mr Pena had announced a preliminary finding by the Department of
Transportation that there was a safety defect in GM's C/K trucks, which have
externally mounted fuel tanks that could cause an explosion in a side-on
crash. The department had also scheduled a public hearing on the trucks for
Tuesday, which is now cancelled.
Mr Pena had said about 150 people had died in 'otherwise survivable'
side-impact crashes when their GM trucks caught fire, and had accused GM of
deciding to 'favour 'sales over safety'.
However, his position had been undermined by reports that he had proceeded
against the advice of his own safety officials. The issue had also been
bitterly contested by Detroit, with car company chiefs last month writing a
joint letter to President Bill Clinton claiming their entire industry was
threatened.
GM said the deal did not affect private lawsuits still outstanding.

FT  03 DEC 94 / East hails prize of fast Nato expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former communist nations in central Europe yesterday hailed the prospect of
early incorporation as full members of Nato, despite the strong objections
that Russia has signalled.
Western nations also reaffirmed their plans, mapped out on Thursday, for a
rapid expansion programme, and they hoped misunderstandings with Russia
could be cleared up soon. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister,
told a meeting of the 16 Nato countries and their former adversaries in the
Warsaw pact that there was no reason why anybody should object to Nato's
enlargement.
'Nato is not a war machine, and applying cold war terms to Nato is a
misunderstanding or an expression of bad faith,' the minister said.
Western nations continued to express astonishment yesterday at Russia's
last-minute refusal on Thursday to launch a long-awaited co-operation
programme with Nato. Moscow said its refusal was a gesture of concern over
Nato plans for accelerated expansion.
Western officials suggested yesterday that the dramatic gesture by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was a carefully prepared piece of
theatre. They said the outlines of Nato plans for faster enlargement were
well known to Russia, despite Mr Kozyrev's claim that he had found dubious
elements in the Nato plan 'at first glance'.
However western officials said they were confident that misunderstandings
with Moscow would in due course be cleared up. 'Co-operation between Russia
and Nato is too important to both sides to be allowed to let slip,' said Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary.
East European nations expressed understanding of the west's need to
accommodate Russia and they avoided directly criticising Russia themselves.
But several said privately they viewed Russia's behaviour as a bad omen for
future security arrangements in Europe. US officials said they had been led
to believe at the US-Russia summit in September Moscow would not object to a
'gradual and transparent' enlargement procedure.

<TEXT>
Peoples Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, yesterday warned that China's
high inflation was 'not only harmful but also dangerous'. It called for
efforts to bring price rises under control. The newspaper, commenting on a
four-day 'economic work conference' held in Beijing this week, said China
faced serious economic problems, including an income gap between urban and
rural areas, problems with state enterprises and 'excessive price rises'
which threatened social stability. Consumer prices in China's 35 big cities
rose by 27 per cent in the 12 months to October. This compares with an
inflation target for the year of 10 per cent.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice premier in charge of the economy, told the
conference that China's main economic tasks for the new year were to fight
inflation, deepen state enterprise reform, improve agricultural production,
and improve technological management.

The French Court of Appeal decided yesterday to free Mr Pierre Guichet,
chairman of the telecommunications company Alcatel CIT, from jail after two
weeks of imprisonment without charge. Mr Guichet, 62, was jailed on November
21 by investigating magistrate Judge Jean-Marie d'Huy, who is probing
alleged overbilling of France Telecom for an amount estimated by French
newspapers to be as much as FFr2bn (Pounds 238m). Mr Guichet and Alcatel
have denied the allegations, saying the case arose from misunderstanding of
the company's accounting practice.

<TEXT>
Foreign ministers from the US, its European allies and Russia called last
night for a ceasefire throughout Bosnia but failed to come up with any new
ideas for promoting peace.
The failure came in the wake of another ill-tempered row between Nato and
the UN over Bosnia with the UN unsuccessfully pressing the alliance to scale
down its air activity.
After a longer-than-expected meeting the so-called contact group on Bosnia -
comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - reaffirmed their
existing peace plan which would divide Bosnia 51-49 between a Croat-Moslem
federation and a Serb zone.
They also confirmed the idea that Bosnia must at least continue to exist as
a state within its current borders.
However, ministers failed to bridge the group's internal differences on some
central questions, and failed to spell out any new threats or incentives to
the warring parties.
Mr Andre Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said: 'Of course not as much was
achieved as would have been desirable.' But he welcomed the fact that the US
had joined its partners in ruling out military solutions and supporting the
continued presence of UN forces in Bosnia.
The five ministers failed to bridge their differences on how Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic should be rewarded if he makes further
concessions to the peace process.
The lack of new ideas came as Nato pledged to continue military flights over
Bosnia, in spite of a request from the UN to scale them down, in the latest
in a series of rows between the two international organisations.
The Nato flights, designed to police the skies over Bosnia, highlight the
military alliance's intention to remain active in the region. However, UN
officials have accused Nato of 'cowboy tactics' in the air which have
complicated negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs.
In a bid to salvage the UN mission in Bosnia and secure the release of some
500 detained peacekeepers, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, met
Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale, their stronghold above Sarajevo. He said last
night they had agreed to release the peacekeepers detained after Nato air
strikes two weeks ago.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, was concerned earlier
yesterday about the impact of upgraded Serb anti-aircraft missiles on the
policing flights. He said there could be some 'operational changes'.

The FT-SE 100 index moved a step closer to the 3,000 level yesterday as the
London equity market reacted to economic news from the US. At the end of
another session of low volumes but high anxiety, the Footsie suffered a
further 22.3 decline to close at 3,017.3, a two-day fall of 64.1. The latest
bout of weakness left the index down 16.2 in a week that included what was
perceived by most equity market strategists as a broadly neutral Budget.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Private View: A boy who was bitten by the Eurobug -
Controversial German politician Karl Lamers talks to Christian Tyler about
the origins of his proposals for the fast-track integration of Europe's hard
core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He is the bogeyman of the Eurosceptics. His is the name anti-federalists
utter when they want to frighten the children.
Karl Lamers has an appropriately wolfish look about him, with his craggy
face and mouth full of teeth. But this German politician and thinker is more
bitten than biting. Behind the teeth he is thoroughly civilised, humorous
and human.
Lamers is touring European capitals to defend and explain the controversial
ideas contained in a recent policy paper he co-wrote on the future of the
European Union. Its call for a 'hard core' group of states - Germany, France
and the Benelux countries - to press ahead of the others with political and
monetary union is considered not only pre-emptive, but shocking.
For some British MPs, Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman of the German
Christian Democrats, is a dangerous idealist living a federalist fantasy.
Recently, a Tory MP snapped at him that it was 'ridiculous' to imagine that
a housewife at her ironing-board in Athens would one day be listening to a
Norwegian Eurobudget minister on the radio.
Lamers looked patient. 'If we don't develop the union she might be hearing
something much worse,' he said.
The German MP claims that his views are shared by most mainstream German
politicians. Was he then, I asked, playing stalking horse for the narrowly
re-elected Chancellor, Helmut Kohl?
He gave a lupine grin and changed metaphor: 'I am not some kind of U-boat.
We (the authors of the paper) say very openly what we do and some people in
the government are not very happy about it.'
Are you telling home truths about Europe which governments are unable to
tell?
'Ja, naturlich. If this had been an official government paper I would have
been shocked.'
So, I said, you are a missionary among the uncivilised natives of Europe. An
idealist?
Lamers relapsed into German. 'It is stupid to believe that one can live
without ideas and without ideals. I don't regard it as negative if somebody
thinks I have ideals. But I'd find it dangerous if they thought I only had
ideals.'
What experiences shaped your ideas?
'My father had a big influence even though he was buried on my ninth
birthday. He was the victim of a bombing raid on Dusseldorf in November,
1944. Even so he had awakened in me a very strong interest in history.
'The second strong influence - maybe it's dangerous to mention this in
Britain - was that I went to school with the Jesuits in Bad Godesberg for
nine years. And the fathers really impressed me very much.'
What did they teach you?
'Well, first of all they taught me how to think. Secondly, they taught me
some philosophy. We had a very strict philosophy teacher, much feared, but
outstanding. These fathers were all very European-minded and that made an
impression on me.'
So, of course, did Germany's plight after Hitler led it to defeat. 'I
personally did not suffer from hunger,' Lamers reaclled, 'and we weren't
bombed out. We didn't have to flee. I noticed that I was very lucky compared
to my compatriots and Europe seemed a very natural and obvious continuation
of my experience.
'I was lucky enough to be influenced only by people who felt no enmity. I
think that was the biggest piece of luck. Neither at home nor anywhere else
did people influence me against the British or the French or the Italians.'
Lamers studied law and for many years was director of the Karl Arnold
Foundation, a political academy in Bonn. In 1980, he reached the Bundestag,
representing part of Wesel on the lower Rhine. He is married to a
philosopher-novelist who is writing a book on Nietzsche. He likes gardening
and thinks Schubert the greatest musical genius.
I suggested he might not know the hearts of ordinary Europeans. Were they
not turning against the grand European project?
'That is a problem for all politicians nowadays. Politics has become a
full-time job. Of course I try to have contact with citizens in my
constituency and wherever else I can. If I lack knowledge I try and make up
for it. I try to put myself into the shoes of ordinary people.
'But I've often had the experience that people don't want to be bothered too
much by politics either, that they expect the politicians to do their job
and do it well. They don't want to be asked all the time.' (Lamers deplores
the Swiss enthusiasm for referendums.) 'I am very impressed by Burke: you
can't constantly be going back to the people.'
Lamers comes from a part of Germany, the Rhineland, which was always
cosmopolitan. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, before the rise of the
nation state, the continent had been remarkably unified, he observed.
They didn't have a bureaucracy in the Middle Ages, I said.
'That's true. But bureaucracy is a consequence of our way of life and of our
way of doing business.
'Why do we have a European bureaucracy? Because we have a common European
reality. The internal market didn't create this. It's only the institutional
consequence of the fact that we already have this web of relations, this
reality.'
I asked Lamers why German politicians wanted integration so badly.
The nation state was not the 'aim' of history, he explained - for history
has no aim. Furthermore, it had proved a dangerous institution. 'Every state
claimed to be the ultimate judge of its own affairs; and if the state didn't
get what it thought was its right, it took it by force. Of course, we know
what that led to in Europe.' Nation states might survive, but their
sovereignty was already 'an empty shell'.
Germany, finding itself in the middle of past conflicts, had tried to take
control, with terrible results. Germany was again the strongest nation in
Europe, and, following the collapse of communism, it was once more in the
middle.
So is Germany trying to save itself from itself?
'I know that theory. But no. It's not only a German problem, but a problem
for everybody else as well.'
You have talked about 'disastrous consequences' if the project fails. What
are you talking about - war in Europe again?
'No. At least not within the European Union. But if we are incapable of
contributing to peace in our neighbouring countries, that is a disaster.
'And, of course, such conflicts could arise more often, and could extend
further than, for instance, the Yugoslav conflict.'
Is it a problem if Germany develops what one might call a 'co-prosperity
sphere' in central and eastern Europe?
'Naturally it's a problem. It's a problem already. Half the foreign trade of
our eastern neighbours is with Germany. For Russia that's not a problem, but
for Poland it is. The Poles don't really want to get back into the same sort
of dependency. Especially they don't want to be an 'object' between Germany
and Russia.
'In the end, we always come to the same conclusion. Germany appears to lose
most from European integration, not only in the monetary field but others.
But, in reality, we can gain most. At the same time we believe others will
gain, because the difficulties caused by Germany's being central were also
the difficulties of all its neighbours.'
I said: It sounds an apocalyptic sort of justification for further
developing something which, in historical terms, is already highly
integrated.
'In historical terms, yes. But is it really sufficient for the present and
the future? Compared with the past, of course, we have developed very far,
incredibly far. But I don't think we have gone far enough.'
Despite the outcome of the second world war, do you detect a kind of
inferiority complex in the British and French leaders you talk to?
'If I thought that, then I wouldn't tell you. Because I would only make it
worse. So please understand: I beg you not to make me say that sort of
thing. I'm not saying it.
'What I do say - and I've already said it publicly in France - is that I
want a strong France, a self-determining France. I also want a strong
Britain and I don't want anybody to be afraid of Germany. Everything I do is
determined by the need to destroy that sort of feeling, should it exist.'
Are you afraid of Germany?
'No, no.'
Or of certain developments inside Germany?
'Well, of course, I'm concerned about certain developments. If you're not,
then you're blind.'
Are you referring to racism?
'That, too. But I don't think it is a very big problem. The danger I see is
that Germans will say 'Well, we are in a very comfortable situation, why
should we work on continued European integration?' They don't have the
vision to see the real interests of Germany. They become egoistic, self-ish.
'In Britain there are many who think - so I read in the papers - that we
Germans are afraid of ourselves. But that's not the real reason. I am
convinced that the Germans have learnt something from their history and I
totally agree with my own people.
'I have absolutely no problem in being a German. Quite the contrary.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Bites but no bark in a Vietnamese restaurant: Letter from
Hanoi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quang Vinh's restaurant was the ideal place for the ordeal to come. The
palm-thatched house near the West Lake, on the outskirts of the Vietnamese
capital Hanoi, was far from the accusing eyes of fellow-Englishmen.
It was dark outside. At one table, a Vietnamese couple were contentedly
finishing their meal. At another, a man smoked a bamboo pipe. A television
at the end of the room showed mildly pornographic Chinese videos.
But then came the moment of truth: could an Englishman eat a dog?
Could he do so without his stomach rebelling, without his thoughts turning
to labradors snoozing by Kentish fireplaces, Staffordshire bull terriers
collecting sticks for children, and Pekinese perched on the laps of
grandmothers?
One Englishman could: I ate roast dog, dog liver, barbecued dog with herbs
and a deliciously spicy dog sausage, for it is the custom to dine on a
selection of dog dishes when visiting a dog restaurant. The meat tastes
faintly gamey. It is eaten with noodles, crispy rice-flour pancakes, fresh
ginger, spring onions, apricot leaves and, for cowardly Englishmen, plenty
of beer.
I had been inspired to undergo this traumatic experience - most un-British
unless one is stranded with huskies on a polar ice cap - by a conversation
earlier in the week with Do Duc Dinh, a Vietnamese economist, and Nguyen
Thanh Tam, my official interpreter and guide.
They were much more anxious to tell me about the seven different ways of
cooking a dog, and how unlucky it was to eat dog on the first five days of
the month, than they were to explain Vietnam's economic reforms.
'My favourite,' began Tam, 'is minced intestines roasted in the fire with
green beans and onions.' He remembered proudly how anti-Vietnamese
protesters in Thailand in the 1980s had carried placards saying 'Dog-eaters
go home]'
During the Vietnam war, he said, a famous Vietnamese professor had
discovered that wounded soldiers recovered much more quickly when their
doctors prescribed half a kilogramme of dog meat a day.
Dinh insisted I should eat dog in Hanoi rather than Saigon. 'I went to the
south and ate dog, but they don't know how to cook it like we do in the
north,' he said. I asked where the dogs came from. 'People breed it, then it
becomes the family pet.' And then they eat it? 'Yes,' he said with a laugh.
Something twitched in my brain, and then I remembered: years earlier, I had
been eating roast lamb at a farmhouse in southern England when the farmer
put down his knife and fork, turned to the children and remarked that
Elizabeth was tender and tasty. 'Elizabeth?' I gasped. She was a lamb course
that had been bottle-fed and become a family pet.
In Hanoi I told myself that the urban British, notorious animal-lovers that
they are, recoil particularly at the idea of eating dogs only because most
of them never see the living versions of the pigs, cows, sheep and chickens
that they eat in meat-form every day. And the French, after all, eat horses.
Resolutely unsentimental, we put aside our dog dinner and went to Vinh's
kitchen. Two wire cages were on the floor; there was one large dog in the
first and four small dogs in the second. Two feet away, a cauldron of dog
stew steamed and bubbled.
Vinh told us about his flourishing business. The dogs are transported from
villages in a nearby province. A 10kg dog costs him about 120,000 Vietnamese
dong, or just over Dollars 10. At the end of the month - peak dog-eating
time - his restaurant gets through about 30 dogs a day.
The restaurant, he said, was popular with Vietnamese, Koreans and Japanese.
Squeamish westerners were sometimes tricked into eating dog by their
Vietnamese friends, who would entertain them at the restaurant and tell them
afterwards what it was they had so heartily consumed.
'Groups of British people come here deliberately too,' he volunteered. 'One
time we had four British women.'
Intrigued by this glimpse into the dark, dog-eating side of the British
character, my English companion and I looked around the kitchen. It was a
mistake: a small black dog caught my friend's eye and looked at him
soulfully. He felt guilty. He wanted to rescue the dog, which, he felt sure,
must have smelled that this was a place were dogs were cooked.
My friend is a true Englishman. He has a pet dog and loves dogs more than
cows and pigs: bacon is all right, dog sausage is not. But he must remain
anonymous. I recalled that during the meal he had barely touched the food.
'I am worried,' he said, 'that my friends in Halifax will think I want to
eat their whippets.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: German dullness begins at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few weeks ago a German colleague rang the Berlin office for a fax of an
item in the Berliner Zeitung relating to the thoughts of the finance
minister Theo Waigel on the course of future taxation.
Instead, he got an article which referred to the long-standing relationship
between Waigel, 55, and the skiing star and Olympic silver medallist, Irene
Epple, 37. That was a surprise: although anybody connected with the media
knew of the affair, it was never publicly mentioned.
Then, in October, Waigel divorced his wife of 28 years, Karin, and on
Saturday married his 'companion'. This was all much more interesting than
the normal stuff of German news - political manoeuvrings in Saxony-Anhalt
for example.
But when it comes to German news, German papers are relentlessly boring.
Imagine that a British chancellor of the exchequer had kept a sporting
mistress for some years. Imagine the hullabaloo had he married her.
Yet, newspapers across Germany produced just one picture of the wedding on
an obscure page. It showed 'the happy couple with Chancellor Kohl (left) and
his wife Hannelore (right)'. The youth team of the local ski club made a
bridal arch with their skis.
How much more interesting it would have been in Britain. The secret wedding
date would never have been kept secret. There would have been television
cameras at the home of the ex-wife; stories in the Daily Mail about 'The
minister who wronged me'. Tabloid headline writers would have had a field
day. Thunderous editorials would have accused the prime minister of letting
down the nation, or not as the case may be, had he attended the wedding that
consecrated the illicit relationship.
But maybe there is nothing very interesting in finance ministers getting
mixed up with skiers. Perhaps the British are mad or decadent for allowing
similar concerns to occupy so much newsprint. But even a German would agree
that such matters make for more lively reading than tales of interminable
political manoeuvrings in Saxon wastes.
Germany is dull only in the hands of German journalists. And German
journalists make only Germany dull; when they get their hands on Italy or
Russia they can produce fascinating material. But one learns more about a
nation from what it writes about others than what it writes about itself.
Thus a few days ago there was a rollicking piece in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine about a northern Croatian town called Varazdin. It was by Johann
Georg Reissmuller who, although devoted to his native land, has had a long
affair with Croatia. His story was headlined 'Bourgeois, churchgoing,
German-friendly'. These, by the way, are all meant to be virtues.
The article was one of those patronising pieces which are much admired by a
certain kind of German conservative who believes his eastern neighbours are
longing for the day German hegemony reasserts itself throughout the region.
It told of how a distant town had been civilised by its close connections
with German culture and, as a result, was now made up of diligent craftsmen,
Franciscan churches, baroque organs and heroic defenders of faith and nation
facing up to the Serb menace.
'The Varazdin chamber orchestra plays Bach's violin concerto in E major with
seemingly German devotion,' said the report. A few rosy-cheeked milkmaids
and the picture would have been complete.
Had a French journalist gone to the same town, his or her report would have
been about the resurrection of the Ustashe (Croatian fascists), and
contained interviews with old collaborators and concentration camp guards.
An Italian would have found an Italian family or ruin, a Brit a ski slope.
And so to Norway and its rejection of EU membership. For Germans, Norway is
a kind of Germanic ideal. Thus the old Communist Party paper in Berlin,
Neues Deutschland, said Ibsen was the victor. Like his heroine, Nora,
Norwegians had refused to go back into the prehistory of emancipation or
risk their environmental perfection.
The business daily, Handlesblatt, put a Nordic dream into modern dress in
analysing its isolation: 'Yet Norway survives: oil, natural gas, waterfalls
with power stations, fish in the Atlantic and ships on the oceans take care
of that . . .everything tomorrow will be like yesterday for the people of
the North Atlantic.'
In Bavaria, the Suddeutsche Zeitung comforted itself with the thought that
if Norway had refused, at least Sweden, Finland and Austria had not. 'The
three will bring nobility into the Community from outside and make it, one
hopes, internally more respectable for the citizens.' And put a stop, one
hopes, to those unsavoury and unmentionable entanglements of Bavarian
politicians.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: A vivid metaphor for Russian life - A violent start to
Moscow's theatre season has not affected the quality of the drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARKADY OSTROVSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to find a theatre in Moscow that does not have a currency
exchange office or a night-club in it, and it is no surprise that the new
theatre season in Moscow has started with offstage violence and brutality.
Leonid Kheifits, the artistic director of the Russian Army Theatre, was
severely beaten up by the Mafia after refusing to consider plans to house
cabaret and variety shows in the theatre.
A few days later police threatened to eject the famous director Yuri
Lyubimov from his Taganka Theatre after actor and former minister of
culture, Nikolay Gubenko, won a long lasting trial for the theatre. Once the
most daring and liberal political theatre, the Taganka now maintains its
political fame by means other than theatre productions. As one of the
Russian newspapers reported, Gubenko hoped to rent the theatre out to a bank
and use its stage as a venue for right-wing party gatherings.
Whatever Gubenko's and Lyubimov's ambitions may be, all these quarrels have
nothing to do with the art of theatre; rather, they reflect on the chaos,
disintegration and fledgling market economy in the country. Yet even in the
face of these extraordinary difficulties, some theatres are still able to
produce plays of genuine artistic value; plays which resist the
disintegration of Russian culture.
The Wonderful Fusion, a comedy performed by a group of young actors at the
small GITIS theatre, is one of the best examples of such resistance. Written
in the 1930s style of Soviet socialist realism by Vladimir Kirshon, it was
one of the most popular plays of Stalin's time. It is supposed to show the
spirit and potential of the young communist country, describing how bright
Soviet youths enthusiastically work together to build new aeroplanes - and
fall in love in their spare time.
From the very beginning of the production, the cheerful songs about 'the
radiant future of communism' and 'the country that raises with glory to meet
a new day' evoke not only the fervid atmosphere of the 1930s, but also a
nostalgia for the highly optimistic art of that time. As one of the
actresses said, 'we chose this play because it gives us a chance to feel
happy and light-hearted for a change.'
This new production is not a parody of the socialist realism of the 1930s,
nor does it try to denounce the naivety and enthusiasm of that time. On the
contrary, it is one of the first endeavours in Russian theatre to look at
the 1930s historically, without the loathing that has lately become so
fashionable.
This fashion makes the old director, Vladimir Levertov, explain in
apologetic tones before each performance: 'this is part of our history, part
of the history of our theatre - we should remember it'.
In a way the whole production is an act of remembrance, a tribute to the
generation of people who sincerely believed in the ideas of their time. The
Wonderful Fusion is also the fusion of two generations: Levertov, for whom
the 1930s is a living memory; and young actors for whom the play is removed
far enough in time to be simply a historical drama.
Another historical drama opened recently at the famous Moscow Arts Theatre:
Pushkin's Boris Godunov, directed by Oleg Efremov who also plays the central
role.
Boris Godunov is the most significant Russian national tragedy. It is set in
the beginning of the 17th century during the Time of Troubles, so that
directors have tended to use the play as a commentary on the evils of the
day. But the new production of the Moscow Arts theatre is an exception to
this.
Efremov's production is hardly concerned at all with contemporary politics.
It illustrates only the first part of Pushkin's definition of a tragedy:
'man's fate and the destiny of the people'. Efremov plays a man, rather than
a politician; and maybe that is why the best scene in the production is the
one where Godunov talks to his children - this is a Godunov who is tired of
the constant struggle for power.
Without directly drawing any parallels with the present day, the main theme
of Efremov's performance corresponds to the spirit of modern Russia, a
country exhausted by political struggles, coups, corruption and blood.
While a sense of weariness defines Efremov's Boris Godunov, another
production, The Deadly Trick (performed on the small stage of the Moscow
Arts Theatre), brings energy and freshness into an upcoming theatre season.
Written by actor Oleg Antonov and directed by actor Vladimir Mashkov, The
Deadly Trick is, unsurprisingly, a production about acting. It starts with
one of Fellini's images: a red clown is climbing a rope with one hand and
playing a saxophone with the other. He misses his footing, and the sound of
a crash reverberates round the theatre.
After a second of darkness, four clowns emerge from the dead body and begin
clowning lives of their own. These four clowns seem to be connected by
invisible string and can only exist together. They finally return where they
belong, enabling the red clown once again to climb up the rope and continue
playing the saxophone.
The Deadly Trick takes us back to the very roots of the theatre, to its
magic and conjuring. One clown tries to catch a sunbeam in a mirror and
suddenly hundreds of small sunbeams light up the black walls of the theatre.
The production is filled with magic, producing sighs of rapture rarely heard
in the theatre today. Tired of reality, Russian people want to be conjured
and deceived by theatrical illusion.
Yet the sense of illusion in The Deadly Trick is inseparable from a sense of
fatal danger - which is probably what turns this slightly surreal production
into a vivid metaphor for Russian life.

Which contemporary American playwright wrote the following scene? A man
stalks out of a dingy apartment into the Southern California desert to buy a
bottle of whisky, leaving another man huddled on the floor, shaking
uncontrollably.
A beautiful young woman enters, carrying a pile of clean laundry and a
handbag full of Dollars 20 bills. She drops the laundry on the bed and the
bills into the shaking man's lap. 'You should have told me the Derby is in
May, Mr Carter. Why would you lie about something as simple as that?' she
says. A telephone starts to ring. 'Do you want me to answer that?' asks the
woman. The lights slowly fade as the phone continues ringing.
The answer is not hard to guess: we are in Shepard country, a land of booze,
money, horses; a gritty southwestern setting, with seething tensions and
emotionally fraught relationships between men and women alike. Props and
events waver between gnomic symbolism and actual reference; mysterious
endings go unresolved. All are trademarks of Sam Shepard, the 51-year-old
playwright and actor many consider the leading theatrical voice of his
generation.
The problem is that this scene from Shepard's latest play, Simpatico, now
running at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre in a production
directed by the playwright, is the only one in the lengthy evening that
finds him anywhere close to form - and it is the moment that ends the play.
What has gone before are three dragging hours that are less intriguing than
confusing and dull.
Simpatico is Shepard's first full-length play since A Lie of the Mind, which
earned mixed reviews and had a respectable off-Broadway run in 1985. The
current play has travelled a bumpy road to the Public: there were plans last
year to bring it to Broadway, but producers were unable to raise the
necessary funds for a commercial run.
In retrospect, this is a blessing: Simpatico belongs in an off-Broadway,
non-profit environment. Its primary interest is that it offers the sad
opportunity to reflect on what made Shepard's earlier work great by noting
the shortcomings of this production.
On paper, Simpatico sounds like an involving, if plot-heavy, thriller about
two men bonded together by the legacy of a crime. The action alternates
between Kentucky, the site of a racing scandal orchestrated years ago by
Vinnie (Fred Ward) and Carter (Ed Harris), and California, where the
still-dissolute Vinnie now lives off support cheques from the now-upstanding
career man, Carter.
Vinnie summons Carter to California to help clear up a misunderstanding with
his new girlfriend, Cecilia (Marcia Gay Harden), then heads to Kentucky with
a shoebox of letters and photographs to blackmail Simms (James Gammon), the
man whom they framed in the former scandal. Carter sends Cecilia to Kentucky
to get the incriminating documents back, but she fails, because Vinnie has
taken them to Rosie (Beverly D'Angelo), his ex-wife, who is now married to
Carter.
We end up back in California with Vinnie off in search of whisky, Carter
reduced to a pathetic shaking heap, and Cecilia surveying it all, bemused.
We know better than to expect wholly rational behaviour from Shepard's
characters - his best plays embrace ambiguity and transform the everyday
event into mythic action - but a plot as dense as Simpatico's requires a
production that gives some sense of the characters' motivations, the layers
of guilt, desire, resentment and fear that drive them to act.
However, Shepard's flaccid staging makes Simpatico seem a random
accumulation of events. The slow deconstruction of the set - every time we
return to Vinnie's apartment, another of its walls has disappeared - seems
to imply that the play is moving further away from reality as the scenes
progress, but the on-stage atmosphere remains static.
Scenes drag with too-long pauses, and characters - particularly Carter and
Vinnie - have little relationship to each other. The usually excellent Ward
and Harris seem to be marking time on stage, playing the ideas of their
characters rather than living through their emotions.
It is only when the remarkable Marcia Gay Harden is on stage that the
production becomes riveting: she turns what could be a one-sided dimwit into
an engaging, exasperating, kooky-pathetic lost soul. Beverly D'Angelo,
wearing a plunging silk dressing-gown and an almost palpable air of
dissolution, also livens things up, but her only scene comes late in the
play's second hour and the lift she gives is too little too late.

<TEXT>
The latest offering by Theatre de Complicite - Out of a house walked a man .
. ., a co-production with the National Theatre - is less bleak, less long,
and less hopeless than life actually was in Stalinist Russia; and reflecting
on this fact may be one of the better ways to get through this dreary show.
All the same, as in Stalinist Russia, you are likely to wish you were
elsewhere. I cannot be fair to it, or do it justice; leaving the auditorium
when it is over is like being released from the Bastille. And the worst of
it is that it makes you wonder how good Complicite ever really was, and
resent those people who think that Complicite is the best thing in British
theatre today.
Out of a house . . . has been adapted by Jozef Houbven, Simon McBurney, and
Mark Wheatley from the writings of Danil Kharms (1905-42) - whose work all
of you, unlike me, will know well. 'Oh good,' I thought in advance, 'A new
author, a new world.' But no. Everything onstage reminded me of such
Complicite shows as The Visit, Street of Crocodiles, and The Three Lives of
Lucie Cabrol; and the fact that those works were greatly superior is no
help. Here, again, the oppressive Kafkaesque atmosphere; here is the
indestructible crone; here the inhibited man who has problems with getting
it together with the girl he has met only fleetingly; here the effort of
turning life into art; here the nightmare interior life as opposed to the
bizarre but mundane exterior life; and so on.
And here, again, are all the Complicite tricks and tricksters. The
Complicite house style is a striking and strenuous mix of vaudeville, mime,
and expressionism. One favourite device is the wedge-shaped phalanx of
bogeypersons which materialises in dark corners to confront the protagonist.
Though this has worked well in the past, after Out of a house . . . I hope I
never see it again. It is peculiar how often the actors turn their heads out
front to deliver their words (a technique to which I am generally allergic
anyway), how often the diction is slow and emphatic, and how often the eyes
are glaringly rounded. But have Complicite lines ever before been so often
repeated, so shouted, or so banal?
The indestructible old crone is, of course, Kathryn Hunter: it is, I think,
her metier. Alas, I have watched Hunter three times this year and I have had
enough of the hoarse chestiness of that Exorcist voice, that wizened
tortoise-like face turned up to the light, the watery dark eyes staring
imperturbably beneath their slowly batting lids, the trembling of the
massive lower lip. Just as I was thinking that in Hell we will get to see
her play Juliet, they gave her one of those awful scenes you see in most
ballet versions of the Romeo tomb scene, where the hero does a pas de deux
with her 'corpse'. Hunter plays this like a succubus from beyond the grave.
If you know any necrophiliacs, send them to watch this episode. It should
give them pause.
The finest image is that of the cripple who lividly zoom-drags himself
across the stage at top speed. The best contributions are the fragments of
Shostakovichian musical modernism by Gerard McBurney. The worst contribution
is Marcello Magni's; the way he laboriously and cutely repeats 'Why has she
died in my room?' ranks him as one of the crudest actors in Britain. The
shows lasts two hours; no interval.
Stuck underneath all this farrago is a tale of innocent complicity (yes)
such as Patricia Highsmith tells so brilliantly in The Blunderer. But
Highsmith has suspense, wit, lightness of touch, so that the way she
involves you in apparent or actual guilt is brilliant in its very cool. Out
of a house . . . by contrast, is overwrought, ponderous, and torpid.

Shula has sent Jill packing in new post-natal self-confidence. Jennifer has
braved King's Cross in search of runaway Kate (didn't she realise the danger
exclaimed husband Brian, equating London N1 with Bihac on a Saturday night).
Ellen is plotting to get Julia out of not-so-newly-wed Nigel and Elizabeth's
hair. Pasteboard characters mouthing inert dialogue semaphore every
unco-ordinated spasm of plot to an audience of potential imbeciles.
Country folk with phoney accents mollock in a rusticity that could have been
created only in the heart of Birmingham. Stereotypes in stereo, caricatures
in quadrophonic, reeking of patronising artifice from every pore, The
Archers is the Barbie doll of radio drama: sleek, oddly mid-Atlantic,
lifeless. And did I once see them plain? Twice, actually: once in a play
with a mock village fete in the interval, once on an 'Archers Weekend' in
Worcester - I mean Borchester.
Common to both was a small figure with ferocious gnashers and gleaming
spectacles whose smile exuded an alligator-like glitter: the then producer,
loaded with Archers books on which he presumably earned royalties, hawking
his wares with a vigour that uncannily predated subsequent BBC attitudes.
During an 'any questions' session on our first evening, someone asked
reproachfully why he was going to ITV. 'Would you believe Pounds 30,000?' he
asked, teeth positively crocodilian.
In respectful silence we did.
The Archers (Radio 4) is all things to all men. To urbanites it is rural
(though as a country-reared child I found its yokels a townie joke). It
reassures country people that they are in the mainstream of British life.
'It sums up England,' cried the bachelor park-keeper from Dudley who
revealed that his bedsit was packed with Archers memorabilia. 'There's been
a murder,' he smiled happily. 'Doris was attacked once. It's typically
British.'
Like the glum coach-tour of Archers country the next morning. A nice lady
from the local tourist authority told us she often cheered up convicts by
quoting Housman during prison visits, but failed to elicit a similar
response from us.
Remembering the purpose of the trip, she pointed out the Am (of Ambridge
fame). 'Can't you see Nigel and Elizabeth in a punt?' she ventured
recklessly. We did not dignify this with an answer.
Morning coffee in Felpersham (strangely resembling Evesham) was followed by
lunch at Grey Gables (neither grey nor gabled though pleasantly Georgian)
directed by Eddie Grundy in horned cowboy hat and conveniently placed
body-mike, and tea at Brookfield (a lovely working farm, Jacobean plus
additions, complete with duckpond). Tom Forrest, a stout businessman in a
suit, signed autographs. the jodphur-clad Elizabeth excited a youngish man
in flared hipsters, an Afro hairstyle and Zapata mostache. His girlfriend,
apparently called Poodle, was vociferous in crushed cherry-velvet at the
'any questions'. Of the often referred-to but never heard Shane, the effete
wine-bar assistant, she demanded to know if he was a - a - limpwrist.
The panel thought she said 'linguist' and five minutes of baffling cross
purposes ensued. The Zapata tash reproached the programme for not mentioning
the Andrew-Fergie engagement on the actual day. 'It was like a punch between
the eyes,' he said, broken-hearted.
The Archers fulfils a function, like plastic or muzak or fish-fingers. Its
careful drama-school delivery, laboriously simplistic plotting and
characters that variously epitomise greed, snobbery and parochialism do
indeed sum up much of Britain today. That is the most frightening thing of
all.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: The pride of Lyons - The success of a new house in a
city that decided to back opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Things are going well for the Opera de Lyon. Unlike most European opera
companies, it has been almost immune to the recession, thanks to an
inflation-proof public subsidy. Its controversial new theatre, designed by
Jean Nouvel and inaugurated last year, has overcome most of its teething
problems and been grudgingly accepted by the public. After a period of
consolidation, the company is back on the offensive.
This season includes two world premieres and tours to Frankfurt and San
Francisco. The latest new production, Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust, was
expensively cast and made ambitious use of laser lighting. It has been
recorded - as will Les Contes d'Hoffmann (with Roberto Alagna) and Werther
in coming months. With about half its productions released on video or
compact disc, the Opera has become one of Lyons' most powerful symbols at
home and abroad.
Artistic director Jean-Pierre Brossmann says the key to the company's rapid
development has been political will. Lyons' centre-right city council -
headed by an opera-loving mayor, Michel Noir - actively promotes culture.
Public subsidy accounts for 75 per cent of the Opera's FFr185m (Pounds 22m)
budget.
'Lyons is not a rich city,' says Brossmann. 'It simply made a choice - to
target social and cultural issues, to give people hope through education and
culture. Opera houses are not just places for subsidised entertainment. They
have a formative role to play in society. We have the ideas, but there has
to be agreement between what we do and what the politicians are prepared to
support.'
The company has gone out of its way to make itself accessible. In its
commissioning of new operas, it has tried to find works which are
understandable rather than esoteric. It staged a special children's version
of Die Zauberflote. It also helped pioneer Lyons' passeport culturel, a
low-price ticket enabling students to sample the work of the city's six main
performing arts institutions.
Brossmann wants the scheme extended to the general public. He says opera
companies must beware of tailoring their work to the preferences of regular
opera-goers. 'You have to mix your public, and cast your net as wide as
possible. We try to unite in one building the best of each system - you
could describe it as a bit of Covent Garden, a bit of English National Opera
and a bit of Opera Factory.'
It sounds like a model opera company, but the truth is different. The Opera
has won preferment at the expense of other cultural institutions. The
Orchestre National de Lyon, for example, languishes in an unsuitable hall
and now faces competition from the Opera's high-profile concert series. The
city was forced to axe its Berlioz festival and the equally short-lived
festival of 19th-century French music.
The Opera's new theatre is also far from ideal. You cannot deny Nouvel's
achievement in packing so much into the original neo-classical shell -
double the working space, double the number of performances. But the stage
machinery still creaks, and the pit is irredeemably narrow. Front-of-house
circulation is restricted by narrow escalators, and the unrelenting black
decor makes it hard to see the steps. Even the toilets reek of designer
conceit.
The high-tech appearance of the theatre goes hand-in-hand with the company's
trendy production style, which aims to bring in as young an audience as
possible. The policy is dressed up as 'a fresh look at the classics' - there
is not a single 'traditional' staging in the repertoire - but the result
rarely goes beyond a superficial gloss.
That was certainly true of Louis Erlo's abstract-minimalist treatment of La
Damnation de Faust, the first new production of the season. Erlo's box of
tricks included a frame of green lasers for Faust's study and a wall of
illuminated red studs for the tavern scene. It looked sophisticated, but had
little relevance to the dream-like nature of the work. The opening scenes on
the Hungarian plains were crude and static, and the portrayal of
Mephistopheles as a voice in Faust's psychological make-up robbed the action
of its headlong expressive potential.
At least the music had space to cast its spell - particularly in the choral
scenes, where the warmth of sound bathing the stage was intoxicating (chorus
master Richard Cooke). The orchestra responded keenly to Kent Nagano's
direction, but one searched in vain for the suppleness, spontaneity and
sense of wilful engagement which mark out the true Berlioz conductor.
The cast, in vaguely modern costumes, was headed by the formidable trio of
Thomas Moser, Jose van Dam and Susan Graham. For all his idiomatic
pronunciation, Moser is not a natural French romantic tenor. He lacks the
liquid tone for this music, and tends to look big and clumsy. Van Dam's
Mephistopheles has seen better days. He still colours the words with
exemplary skill, but his top notes have to be carefully managed, and his
characterisation has lost its sting.
Graham's Marguerite, by contrast, was captivating - a picture of fragrant,
unspoilt womanhood. Her exquisite carriage and golden timbre, the sensuous
way she handled her props, the depth of feeling implicit in her singing of
'Et combien je l'aimais]' - it would be hard to imagine a more complete
performance.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: The jury is still out - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To those of us who campaigned to get television cameras into the British
Houses of Parliament it seemed that the battle might last a lifetime, and
still be lost. Debates were held, politicians were told that the cameras
would destroy tradition, seriousness, and reputation, the vote was taken,
and the motion lost. It happened not once but over and over again.
Then, five years ago, MPs voted for an 'experiment', the cameras went in,
and it immediately became obvious that they would never leave. Television
has extended the public gallery into every home in the land. Clearly it can
do the same for our courts, but that battle is still being fought and it is,
if anything, even more difficult since the judges do not have open debates
or public votes on the matter.
However, BBC2 is currently transmitting a five part series which must,
surely, carry the campaign forward. It is still impossible to film inside
courts in England or Wales, but Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope, the
Lord President, allowed cameras into Scottish courts to make The Trial which
is now going out at 9.00 on Friday evenings. Nick Catliff, Ben Gale and
Elizabeth Clough have produced a series which, at the start, put you in mind
of the court coverage we have seen from major cases in the US and elsewhere.
But anyone who watches the entire series will realise that there is much
more to it than that.
This is not just five visits to the courtroom, let alone five big 'sexy'
cases. The first programme did deal with murder, but last week's included
shoplifting and evasion of a taxi fare (or anyway an associated charge of
resisting arrest). Each programme stands up well on its own but watching all
five gives you a fair - albeit sketchy - idea not only of the courts but of
the Scottish system of justice. This does not seem so very different from
England's, even if the Scots do have 'Advocate Deputes', findings of 'not
proven', and judges' robes startlingly covered in big red crosses.
Last night's programme concentrated on the work of defence solicitors, and
the last episode, on December 16, looks especially at the prosecutors from
the Procurator Fiscal's department. So it is not a matter of merely taking
cameras into court. The producers visit prisons, lawyers' chambers, and even
the scenes of crimes, to eavesdrop on the conversations of the chief
protagonists, or to film statements from those involved - though everything
is presented 'verite' with neither reporter nor voice-over. The effect is to
make it more shriekingly obvious than ever that, even when cameras do get
into court, they are still invariably excluded from the place we most want
to be: the jury room.
This is not just a matter of insatiable curiosity, it is a consequence of
watching even the most complex cases edited down to fit into 50 minute
slots. At the end of the first programme, about a murder on a lonely
footpath, a reasonable viewer would surely have said that, however guilty
the defendant appeared to be, however significant his failure to go into the
witness box, and however telling the presence of a watch said to be his
beside the body, the prosecution had clearly not proved the case beyond a
reasonable doubt. Yet a guilty verdict was brought in. The viewer was left
to wonder whether the jurors were stupid or whether their decision would
have seemed reasonable to the rest of us if television had broadcast the
entire case.
The series illustrates what is known to anyone who has regularly attended
court: that the system is imperfect; that juries sometimes bring in the
right verdict despite the evidence; that the guilty occasionally go free
while the innocent are punished; that real people, including lawyers, are
often poor public speakers, hesitating and stumbling and sounding nothing
like the articulate paragons in LA Law.
Some will argue that comments such as these merely prove that cameras in
court bring the law into disrepute, but that is superficial. What we need,
and what we shall surely have in the end, is the right to take cameras into
any court (yes, with judges' rules to avoid misuse) and then enough time on
one of the thousands of digital networks which are already technically
feasible to show not 50 minutes of a case but 50 hours if that seems right.

Crash in an aeroplane. Be chased by dinosaurs. Escape from a computer
laboratory with a deadly virus in your brain. Spend seven hours with Adolf
Hitler. It is wonderful the things you can now do in your own living room.
In the age of video you can also do them at your own whim and in your own
time, not at the dictates of TV schedulers.
I listened to a radio discussion recently about the mental passivity of
screen viewing versus the relative act-ivity of reading. But can we accept
this argument any longer? Because of the outrageous spectacles unfolding
daily in our own homes, and our own role as accomplices with remote controls
and interactive touchpads, are we bidding farewell to the age of the couch
potato?
Jurassic Park (CIC) has now growled onto video, and every child who has seen
it on the large screen will be seeing it again on the small. Why? Because
those children can make now their own movie out of Spielberg's.
Aggressive youngsters will skip the more Disneyish dinosaurs and go straight
for the T. Rexes. Peaceable children will prefer the former, and will linger
over the cuddly whiskers of the Ricardus Attenburgosaurus. And evolution
experts will savour, with sardonic smile, the chaos theory pronouncements of
the boffin character (Jeff Goldblum). In short: whole new rhythms will be
cut by everyone from Master Steven's original print.
Meanwhile adults watching Peter Weir's absorbing Fearless (Warner), the tale
of a plane crash survivor (Jeff Bridges) wandering a nether world of memory
and hallucination, may put the emphasis on the rewind button. This story
needs much working out. Is Bridges actually alive or dead? If fetching
Isabella Rossellini is Bridges' wife, why does he spend so much time with
fellow crash victim Rosie Perez? Is this the real world - or the next?
Unravel the film at home, with a freedom you never had in the cinema.
Contrarily, Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's Hitler (Academy) is a multi-technique
pageant lasting seven hours: so we forgive you if you create your own
'time-lapse' special edition. Whizz along if you wish, at least on second
viewing, with the FF button. Re-form the German director's rich kaleidoscope
of devices and references - puppetry, newsreels, theatre sets, back
projection, opera - into your own, even quirkier rollercoaster ride.
From video as recreation we are moving to video as re-creation. Indeed,
children are already turning from the mild participatory challenge of the
reissued movie into the terrifying combat zone - at least to my generation -
of the interactive video game.
Burn: Cycle is the latest Digital Video mind-scrambler to dive into my CDi
machine. Game scenario: I am Sol Cutter, computer data thief, and I have a
virus in my brain. Using my joystick-equipped touchpad, I must escape
Softech Labs, shooting armed guards on the way, in order to get help. I have
two hours. Can I make it?
Speaking for myself, I can barely make it out of the first room. Confused,
shot to pieces and still at square one, I finally left the game in the hands
of a friend, a major software troubleshooter at a UK computer firm. He is
still trying to work it out. Fine production values, though: the images are
Blade Runner out of 2001.
It is a brave new world, and it has stranger creatures in it still. For
Christmas, if you feel you cannot inflict Burn: Cycle on family or friends,
why not try Human Aquarium Productions? These moving-wallpaper videos allow
you to watch naked human 'fish' (Girlfish, Boyfish, Allfish) swimming for
hour after hour in the corner of your living room. I am not sure, or
hesitate to guess, what interactive idea there is behind this.
Finally, two films for pure, innocent enjoyment. Cool Runnings (Buena Vista)
puts a comedy spin on the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team at the
1988 Olympics. And The Paper (CIC), starring Michael Keaton and Glenn Close,
is a high-energy comedy-melodrama about the newspaper business. Both are
perfect for Christmas.
Stop Press. I have just broken through to the second phase in Burn: Cycle.
Weird things are happening. Watch this space.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Class conflict in Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE

<TEXT>
Munich's art and antiques fair was the first of its kind in Germany. After
more than 30 years, it is arguably still the best, and a new-broom
administration this year has produced the most elegant event to date. Yet it
seems uncertain that Munich will ever establish itself as an international
event.
It is not at all clear what the fair wants to be. The new-style 39th German
Art &amp; Antiques Fair International opens its doors to foreign dealers, but
exhibits rather few of them. Apart from an illustrious group of antiquaires
prominently placed by the entrance, there are only a dozen other non-German
dealers - half the number of the previous year.
Here, world-class objects rub shoulders uncomfortably with the gemutlich.
Some dealers display the likes of a Susini bronze statuette after
Giambologna, a spectacular piece of Augsburg silver, or a Degas drawing.
Others offer rows of Bavarian cherubs neatly repainted in gilt.
This state of affairs is unlikely to change while the fair is organised by
the Association of Bavarian Art &amp; Antique Dealers (there is no national
association in Germany). The majority of its members have nothing to gain,
and potentially a great deal to lose, if international participation is
increased and standards raised.
Local dealers with international businesses such as Konrad Bernheimer, whose
grandfather founded the fair in 1955, Albrecht Neuhaus, and Bruce Livie of
Galerie Arnoldi-Livie, have been arguing for a decade that the fair's future
lay as an international event. Now that the European Fine Art Foundation,
organiser of the highly successful Maastricht fair, has decided on Basel for
the venue for its new event, it may well be that Munich is offering too
little too late.
It will be interesting to see how many dealers, German and foreign, transfer
their allegiance to Basel. Certainly the success of Maastricht has been to
the detriment of the Rhineland fair, which was not hitherto open to the
foreign trade.
Perhaps the organisers at Munich should concentrate on consolidating its
position as the leading German fair. A number of innovations this year bode
well for its future, notably improved presentation, a handsome loan
exhibition, Odiot a Paris, and a lecture programme.
There is still scope, however, for improving the overall quality of the fair
without destroying its Bavarian flavour. Encouraging good, classic, modern
art may be one solution. It is, after all, what people seem to be buying in
Germany at present, and there seems to be a market here. Over the opening
weekend, Galerie Norbert Blaeser of Dusseldorf sold works by Ernst Wilhelm
Nay, Picasso and Alexej von Jawlensky to one private collector, and another
Jawlensky, 'Mystical Head with Brown Eyes' for about DM580,000 (Pounds
237,000).
Munich's trump card is that the Bavarian capital will always be a city that
people like to visit - its hinterland is also conveniently rich. The fair
has the reputation of showing important works of art, and this year is no
exception. It is predominantly an 'objects' rather than a 'pictures' fair,
although one of this year's highlights is an impressive Lucas Cranach of the
'Virgin and Child with a sleeping John the Baptist' (asking price DM2.5m).
On the stand of Neuse of Bremen, you can find a 33-piece Augsburg
silver-gilt travel service of 1745-49 alongside its original fitted leather
case (about DM2m), a choice group of Baroque Wunderkammer items, and
furniture that might almost pass as sculpture.
The Deutsche Kunst- und Antiquitatenmesse International continues until
tomorrow at the Messegelande Theriesen hohe, Munich, 10am-6pm

FT  03 DEC 94 / Forces joined off Piccadilly: Christie's plan to rival New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare enough to see art and antique dealers working together for the
common good - a collaboration between dealers and an auction-house is
unheard of. On Tuesday, the 60 or so dealers, framers, specialist art
bookshops and shippers housed in the square mile of St James's, London, join
forces with Christie's to promote the area as one of the great art centres
of the world and launch 'On View in St James's'.
Rather like the old Cork Street party - but no doubt far more dignified -
the St James's initiative offers 'open house' between 10am and 10pm, and
hospitality after 5pm, to the clients of every participating firm.
Discretion is maintained - no one is asked to divulge a client list - and
costs are minimal. It is seen as a mutually beneficial exercise.
Anyone alarmed by the rarefied atmosphere of dealers' galleries - and who is
not - is encouraged to feel they can go in and browse as they do in the
saleroom. Christie's, in turn, is keen to generate in St James's something
of the bustle and buzz of its New York premises, for at evenings and
weekends St James's is deserted.
Having Christie's down the road is good for the dealers - and dealers are
good for Christie's, too. Given the auction house's substantial property
investment in the area, it is in its interests to preserve and enhance
London's leading community for pre-20th century art and antiques.
Anyone venturing north of Piccadilly will find more frocks than picture
frames in Bond Street these days. We may see further 'On Views' in the
spring and summer.
Tuesday's event launches a high-profile week in St James's. Christie's
auctions outstanding works of art from Houghton Hall on Thursday evening,
the most spectacular offering of its kind for decades. At 13 Duke Street,
Johnny Van Haeften unveils an exceptional winter exhibition of Dutch and
Flemish Old Masters.
Three of the show's best pictures were acquired at auction from Sotheby's in
the summer, and have returned from visits to the restorers after a light
clean. Aelbert Cuyp's 'Orpheus Charming the Animals' was the sensation of
the season, and its most beguiling picture. Orpheus, as Ovid relates, was
such a marvel with his lyre that he could charm trees to move to shade him
from the sun and draw wild beasts to his side.
Cuyp's ambitious canvas shows Orpheus gallantly shaded by an outcrop of
uprooted trees and surrounded by a menagerie of domestic and exotic animals.
Part of the charm of the painting is the awkwardness of the handling of the
latter, from the jaguars, silhouetted against the bright middle ground, and
the spiny pangolin, to the thoughtful dromedary who listens intently. With
the picture priced at Pounds 6.5m, a live menagerie would no doubt be far
less costly.
The Rachel Ruysch is a tour de force of flower painting, and is generally
regarded as her masterpiece. Anyone fortunate enough to hang Osias Beert the
Elder's still life in their dining room would never need to serve real food
again.
One can almost taste the salty tang of the plump oysters resting on a pewter
plate, and the sweet flesh of the roasted chestnuts. Ornate sweetmeats and
sugared almonds are piled into Wanli Kraak porcelain dishes, and boxes of
quince jelly await the spoon. To leave us in no doubt of his virtuosity,
Beert adds a couple of shells and glass goblets to gleam in the candlelight.
The view also coincides with a sumptuous exhibition of Chinese textiles at
the newly refurbished premises of Spink, a wide-ranging show of modern
paintings and drawings at Finarte in Mason's Yard, and Chris Beetles' annual
festive jolly featuring British illustrators and cartoonists.
While few of the dealers have mounted special exhibitions or published
catalogues, most have re-hung their galleries. Peter Nahum at the Leicester
Galleries in Ryder Street, for instance, is showing Pre-Raphaelites and
Symbolists plus enjoyable decorative works for under Pounds 1,000.
Unable to resist presenting one great picture (six noughts this time), he
hangs Burne-Jones's 'Pilgrim at the Gate of Idleness', a picture which,
until 1980, rather implausibly belonged to the Maharajah of Jamnegar.
The canvas, dated 1884, along with its companion, 'The Heart of the Rose',
and the larger 'Love Leading the Pilgrim', now in the Tate, form a
poignantly autobiographical trilogy on the theme of the quest for perfect
love inspired by Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose. Here the pilgrim meets
Idleness personified as a beautiful maiden and shies away.
Any trail, any time, around St James's will reveal a remarkable range and
quality of works of art on offer - from antiquities to silver, sculpture,
furniture, ceramics and clocks - and some of the best free shows in town.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Great art reproduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 732-page, 8lb tome which I lugged round the 1990 Beccafumi show in
Siena, it transpired, represented the good old days. At least the larger
part of that weighty volume was devoted to the works of art on display.
Recent catalogues are no less unwieldly but they are distinctly less
user-friendly. These hybrid art-books-cum-catalogues are characterised by
interminable essays - not always obviously relevant - with minimalist
catalogue entries rather apologetically tacked on to the end.
Take the gargantuan The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990, hands-down
winner of the year's most muddle-headed and unhelpful example of the genre
(Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 36). The catalogue for the show first seen in
Edinburgh, its 500 pages boast no fewer than 47 scholarly essays on subjects
as diverse as, say, Romantic Irony, Landscape and the 'Irony of Nature', and
Irony and the Grotesque. The 283 exhibits are squeezed into a mere 18 pages.
Exhibition catalogues no longer serve the purpose of illuminating individual
works of art.
Thankfully, there still appears to be a place for the serious book. David
Landau and Peter Parshall's seminal The Renaissance Print 1470-1550 (Yale
University Press, Pounds 45) is a revelatory study of an oddly neglected
subject. Prints have always been treated as the poor relation of paintings
and drawings; this is the book to convince the unconverted that prints
deserve equal consideration.
No less refreshing was John Golding's Visions of the Modern (Thames &amp;
Hudson, Pounds 28). Golding is a rare beast, a writer and a distinguished
painter. He brings to his scrutiny of 20th century art a formidable
intelligence and visual sensitivity, and a rigour derived from an
understanding of the art of the past. He is not afraid to convey this in
language the layman can understand.
David Sylvester's more recent Looking at Giacometti (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds
25) must be the most lyrical critical biography of the year. Long in the
making and endlessly revised, it is a thoughtful, highly personal and
genuinely illuminating response to Giacometti's art.
Mondrian: The Art of Destruction (Reaktion Books, Pounds 35) is more
mainstream. Carel Blotkamp steers as clear a course as possible through
Mondrian's theoretical writings, theosophical beliefs and the austere
abstraction he termed Neo-Plasticism.
Despite the exasperating art-speak, Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall's
Tiepolo and the Pictorial Intelligence (Yale University Press, Pounds 35)
offers a fascinatingly cerebral analysis of the masterpiece - the frescoes
in the Residenz of the Prince-Bishop of Wurtzburg - of an artist not usually
celebrated for his intellect.
Benozzo Gozzoli's frescoes of the procession of the Magi for the small
private chapel of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence rank among the
most beguiling of the Renaissance - perhaps because the artist's heart
remains firmly in the enchanted world of the Middle Ages. Cristina
Acidini-Luchinat's sumptuous, 400-page Chapel of the Magi (Thames &amp; Hudson,
Pounds 55) reproduces the entire - recently restored  - narrative cycle and
life-size details opposite blank, black pages in the finest, self-indulgent
Italian style. Little doubt that this will be the season's favourite picture
book.
My favourite is the large-format Michelangelo: The Medici Chapel by James
Beck, Antonio Paolucci and Bruno Santi, illustrated by the mouthwatering and
masterly black and white photographs of the sculptures by Aurelio Amendola
(Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 36).
A particular pleasure too is Paula Rego's Nursery Rhymes (Thames &amp; Hudson,
Pounds 12.95). The nightmarish terrors conjured up in Rego's powerful
Goya-esque fantasies make this a volume best kept out of the reach of tiny
hands.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Business blockbusters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing change and setting strategy are the two big corporate imperatives
of the moment - and there is no escaping them in the bookshops. A rough
search this week unearthed at least 20 current UK business titles with one
or other of these words in the name (and sometimes both): the US scorecard
probably runs to hundreds.
Competing for the Future by Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad (Harvard Business
Press, Pounds 21.95) - in many people's view the business blockbuster of the
year - has neither change nor strategy on its cover but is unambiguously a
book about strategy. Its inspirational approach is calculated to appeal to
business leaders bogged down, bored and frustrated by restructuring and
business process re-engineering. The central message is that if you are
sufficiently imaginative and forward looking there is no limit to what your
company can achieve. The bad news is that it is not an easy read.
Another 'important' book to get good notices this year wasMichael Goold and
Andrew Campbell's Corporate Level Strategy (John Wiley, Pounds 24.95). It
develops their 1987 analysis of the three ways in which parent companies
typically approach their businesses, namely through financial control
(giving individual managers a lot of freedom), strategic planning (meaning
close involvement with the development of future plans) and strategic
control (somewhere between the other two). Its disturbing conclusion is that
most 'multibusiness' companies do not add value to their subsidiaries;
rather they destroy it.
Less widely acclaimed, but nevertheless a candidate for post-Christmas
browsing despite its near 600 pages, is The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook by
Peter Senge and others (Nicholas Brealey Publishing, Pounds 19.95). The lead
author's previous book, The Fifth Discipline, introduced the now rather
overworked idea of the 'learning organisation': his follow up is highly
practical, packed with case studies, cross references and (rather
pretentiously) wide margins for the executive scribbler.
By contrast, Charles Handy's The Empty Raincoat (Century, Pounds 12.99) is
both philosophical and a winner, having topped the best seller lists for
much of 1994. It is still well worth picking up, even if the main themes
seem less provocative than a year ago: those who have missed it thus far may
wish to wait for the paperback version due next spring.
If Handy has achieved the status of Britain's leading management guru, the
man he arguably replaced is as prolific as ever. Sir John Harvey-Jones's All
Together Now (Heinemann, Pounds 15) is his new guide to managing people. It
discusses recruitment and selection, coaching and the daily management of
staff, and attitudes to training technology.
The combination of Harvey-Jones and HR (human resources) is unlikely to
disappoint. Those looking for a more daring gift, notably modern women
married to unreconstructed males, might slip their partner Michael Roper's
Masculinity and the British Organisation Man since 1945 (Oxford University
Press, Pounds 25). Its conclusion that the classic macho manager is under
threat from new technology and corporate restructuring seems bound to
irritate. Carrie Herbert's Eliminating Sexual Harassment at Work (David
Fulton, Pounds 12.99) - a guide aimed mainly at personnel and training
specialists - could prove an equally barbed gesture.
On the lighter side, Snapshots from Hell by Peter Robinson (Nicholas Brealey
Publishing, Pounds 9.99) is a surprisingly readable - and at times highly
entertaining - account of one ex Reagan speechwriter's experience of
business school. One for the MBA or would-be MBA who has everything.
John O'Keefe's Mind Openers for Managers (Harper Collins, Pounds 5.99) -
described as 'magic' by Paul Daniels - is notable for being written by a
Mandarin speaking hockey international who is now regional vice-president of
Procter and Gamble in Europe. If nothing else, its collection of 'mind
opening' riddles, slogans and proverbs is an improvement on what comes out
of the average Christmas cracker. (Example: a young boy had never hugged a
girl in his life. He wanted to learn about hugging so he got out a book
called How to Hug. To his disappointment when he got home he found it was
not about how to hug at all. What had happened? Answer: He had taken out a
volume of an encyclopedia).
At the moment, though, my plan is to relax with Curiosities of Golf by
Jonathan Rice (Pavilion Books, Pounds 12.99), which has a delightful cover
and from which I have so far extracted the important fact that an unnamed
Greek man holed in one at the 135-yard 8th hole on the pitch and putt course
at Edgwarebury, Hertfordshire in 1978 - apparently the only golf shot he
ever struck. Now that sounds like a real business book . . .

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Memoirs of the silver screen - Ghosted
or navel-gazing, Nigel Andrews finds cinema's stars and champions taking up
the pen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pre-Christmas season - nay, the whole year in film book publishing  -
has been dominated by the ghostly autobiography.
We do not mean just 'ghosted' though these too have abounded: led by Marlon
Brando's exhausting navel-gazing feat Songs My Mother Taught Me (Century,
Pounds 17.99). As transcribed by ghoster/co-author Robert Lindsey, the songs
seem to have been sex, ethno-politics and Tahiti, distantly followed by
Marlon's thoughts about acting.
A shyer performer commercially but a far better book is Milos Forman's
Turnaround (Faber, Pounds 17.50), written with Jan Novak. The Czech director
who emigrated to Hollywood to make One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and
Amadeus is honest about his flops (Ragtime, Valmont) and affably surprised
by his successes. He is also a priceless witness to his native country's
disillusionment as the Prague spring that cradled Forman's best films - A
Blonde In Love, A Fireman's Ball - yielded to Soviet winter.
Also prominent on the ghostly movie-memoir shelves is that doppelganger
oddity, the 'X On X' book: in which a famous director confronts himself and
his work in a full-length career reflection.
Woody Allen On Woody Allen (Faber, Pounds 14.99) is the best recent addition
to this sub-genre. The book has a probing, nay prolix, inquisitor in Swedish
film buff Stig Bjorkman - the questions are often longer than the answers -
but Bjorkman does prise open a film-maker usually prone to hermit-crab
responses.
Allen does not discuss l'affaire Mia. But he is game for everything else:
including fascinating scrutinies of recent masterworks like Crimes And
Misdemeanors and Husbands And Wives. Last in the 'all about me' category of
film book, there is autobiography by letter. Actors and directors are not
natural beaux lettristes: much of their scribbling is taken up with
transactional nitty-gritty. It can be like having an AGM report for your
bedside book.
The year's best epistolary memoir, Jean Renoir's Letters (Faber, Pounds 25),
relieves torpor with eye-opening gobbits about individual films. Although
more letters survive about the inferior American period than about La Regle
Du Jeu or La Grande Illusion, Renoir is mischievously enlightening about the
horrors he had to go through to make Swamp Water or This Land Is Mine. And
since the film-maker struck up pen friendships with Henry Miller, Francois
Truffaut and Ingrid Bergman - both sides of the correspondences are included
 -there are sidelights on social-cultural history.
After the swell of self-portraiture, it is a relief to take the 'auto' out
of autobiography. Peter Manso's Brando (Weidenfeld, Pounds 20) is so much
better than Brando's own Brando that you wonder why you read the latter at
all. Nine hundred pages long, Manso's book subpoena'd some 700 witnesses and
tells us everything we could imagine, and several things we could not have,
about the Method superstar.
Manso gives us glimpses of Brando the schoolboy, Brando the womaniser,
Brando the practical joker (terrifying) and Brando the real-life courtroom
tragedian, weeping as he testifies for his murder-charged son. Less
compelling is the eagerly awaited Grace (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 16.99)
by Robert 'Majesty' Lacey. Poor Miss Kelly. First she vanished into royal
gentility in Monaco, after being a beautiful screen meteor for ten years.
Then she vanishes after death into the embalming insipidity of Lacey's
prose. 'How little Grace loved her Daddy' . . . 'She exuded a strange sense
of calm and strength. She was a woman on the cusp . . .' And so on: all in
the perfumed preservative of the hagiography.
From earlier months in the film-book year five tomes stand out. Robert
Evans's autobiography, The Kid Stays In The Picture (Aurum, Pounds 16.95),
is written with rude wit and seeming total recall by the one-time wonder boy
of Paramount. Special subjects: The Godfather, Ali McGraw, drugs, scandal,
recovery.
David Caute's Joseph Losey: A Revenge On Life (Faber, Pounds 20) is a
stunningly thorough biography of the director of The Servant and The
Go-Between; even though we sense that Caute has argued himself out of liking
Losey by the close.
In The Faber Book Of Movie Verse (Pounds 20), Philip French and Ken Wlaschin
scour the verse vaults for material ranging across eighty years and a dozen
styles: from Ezra Pound to Ogden Nash. And in 7 Minutes: The Life And Death
Of The American Cartoon (Verso, Pounds 19.95) Norman M. Klein does an even
more dramatic gathering act, chronicling and adventurously analysing an
entire century of cartoon-making.
As for Ephraim Katz's International Encyclopaedia Of Film (Macmillan, Pounds
30), the best of all doorstopping reference works on cinema is now improved
and enhanced in a new edition. Throw away Halliwell; get the real thing.
Finally, the oddest book of the year. It is World Cinema: Diary Of A Day
(Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 25). Over 400 film people, some celebrated, some
scarce-heard-of, tell us what they were doing all day on June 10 1993. (Why
that date? Why not, asks editor Peter Cowie.)
So the Scorseses, Taverniers, Puttnams, Sean Penns, Roger Moores and Sir
Anthony Hopkinses fill in the blanks in this vast anniversary volume
dedicated to cinema's 100th birthday, due next year.
Somewhere today in every part of the globe, the book proves, film people are
at large eternalising fugitive reality. Cinema has been this century's art
form. Now its champions are making quite clear that it will be the next
century's as well.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: A glimpse of worlds within worlds -
Wise, witty and fantastic fiction for older children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLYN HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest book by Gillian Cross, former winner of the Whitbread Children's
Novel Award, is a tour-de-force. In New World (OUP, Pounds 9.99), two
children, Miriam and Stuart, are given the task of testing out a new
computer game: 'New World', the game, is shrouded in secrecy.
Miriam and Stuart never meet, but play against each other on separate
computer screens, tackling a terrifying electronic world of skeletons,
cowboys, spiders and crocodiles. The intrigue extends beyond the game - a
third child, a code-smasher, is trying to infiltrate the action.
The tension in the novel arises from the race between the children to crack
the puzzle, but each becomes aware of a more sinister side to an apparently
innocent computer game. Eventually the children band together to defeat the
megabuck company which is planning to flood the market with it.
But Cross's book is more than just a thriller. It is a serious indictment of
the addictive hold computer games can have over children. 'Miriam wanted to
stand there gazing, until the doors opened again. Until she could get hack
into the New World where she had been really alive and awake.'
New World explores the children's increasing feelings of alienation, fear
and paranoia as they dig deeper into the game - as a metaphor for drug
addiction it is frightening; as a straight story it is a gripping piece of
writing.
Sylvia Waugh's Mennyms in the Wilderness (Julia MacRae, Pounds 9.99), a
sequel to The Mennyms, is a different type of book altogether. The Mennyms
are human-sized rag dolls who inhabit a house in suburbia.
Since this is an English suburb, they have managed to keep themselves a
secret for years but now their house is threatened by a new motorway and
they must flee or be discovered.
Help arrives in the form of a shy academic named Albert Pond who helps the
Mennyms move to his crumbling ancestral home in the Dales. Putting a city
family (albeit a rag-doll one) into the depths of the countryside allows
Waugh all sorts of fun, but the charm of the book lies in the characters of
the Mennyms - these are warm-hearted and loving, but, nonetheless, they
bicker, fight, feel envy and fear.
This is a wise, witty book, fantastic in a way that will appeal to the
average nine or 10-year-old, but with enough domestic detail to make it
instantly recognisable to a younger child.
Necessary Parties by Barbara Dana (Oxford, Pounds 9.99) tells a story about
divorcing parents and unhappy children. When his parents split up, Chris
Mills, using as his guide the book The Rights of Young People, decides to
take his parents to court on the grounds that they are irresponsibly
wrecking the life of his younger sister, Jenny.
He finds an eccentric young lawyer who charges a dollar for his services
and, with the help of his lonely granddad and a car-owning friend, proceeds
to build up the case against his parents.
Necessary Parties has a happy ending which may make it a dangerous book to
give to children whose families have irretrievably broken down, but it gives
a forceful and much needed boost to the idea that children can be active
participants in family life, and to the notion that divorce is not always
the only answer.
The most ambitious and inventive children's novel published this year must
be Ian McEwan's The Daydreamer (Cape Pounds 8.99), in which Peter, an
11-year-old boy teetering on the edge of adolescence, inhabits a magical
world of ideas and inventions.
Like a domestic Attila the Hun, Peter's imagination runs riot amid the
debris of family life: a pot of vanishing cream discovered in a drawer
enables him to make his family disappear; a peculiarly horrible, balding,
one-legged doll becomes a Jimmy Knapp-like presence in the nursery demanding
better living conditions; and, one cold winter's day, envious of William's
ability to sleep all day on a radiator, Peter swaps spirits with the family
cat, feeling 'his whiskers springing out from the sides of his face . . .
his tail curling behind him . . . and his fur . . . like the most
comfortable of old woollen jumpers . . .'
As a cat, Peter is an heroic figure, but when he gets inside the skin of
Kenneth the baby, he becomes a victim of circumstance: 'He was just drawing
breath to fill his lungs and bawl out his sorrow when something powerful
clamped under his armpits and he shot fifty feet into the air.
'His mouth hung open, he was dribbling in his amazement. He was staring into
his Aunt Laura's face which was as sheer and colossal as a cliff . . .'
Peter, as Kenneth, is overwhelmed by sensation; the explosive taste of egg,
the beauty of shadow patterns on a wall. Even Baa Baa Black Sheep seems
suddenly interesting. This is the infant version of the Martian's postcard
home, and a telling prelude to Peter's last metamorphosis - into a grown-up,
sitting stolidly on a deckchair while his friends play on the beach below,
having his first taste of coffee: 'It tasted foul, as if burnt cardboard had
been mashed up and boiled in bathwater.'
The Daydreamer is illustrated with eerie black and white drawings by Anthony
Browne (who also reviews picture books for the Financial Times - see above).
Browne makes a further appearance this winter in a large format picture
edition of King Kong (Julia MacRae, Pounds 12.99).
Gorillas have always figured strongly in his work, but Browne's version of
the story by Edgar Wallace and Merian Cooper in which a giant, time-warped
gorilla is pursued and captured by greedy entrepreneurs, takes the simian
world to new heights of sophistication.
Traumatic illustrations showing the agony of the captured King Kong, and his
chilly depiction of an old New York crowded with sharp ladies and men
wearing Homburg hats, make Browne's King Kong a classic in its own right.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: From Nietzsche to Fred Ott - This year,
children's non-fiction books really tested the ingenuity of publishers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLYN HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This Christmas you can furnish your child with a pyramid, a dinosaur and a
glimpse inside a mummy case and all without venturing on to the information
superhighway.
This is the result of publishers' ingenuity in tackling the brave new word
of computer graphics and virtual reality in an attempt to make children's
non-fiction more interesting.
Start with The Secrets of Sculpture (Kingfisher, Pounds 12.99), a collection
of facts, figures, pictures and graphics, ringbound and printed on glossy
laminated paper, exploring sculpture in all its forms from the
24,000-year-old ivory head found in France to Jean Tinguely's contemporary
mechanised sculptures made from junk.
The exuberance of this book - it pulls out, folds up and can be torn apart -
will go a long way to persuade children that books are just as much fun as
computers.
Additional sweeteners include an index - a rare commodity in children's
hooks - a few organic odds and ends attached to the pages and a folder of
stickers at the back. Highly recommended for all ages.
In the same series, Kingfisher also does The Living Forests and From the Big
Bang to Electricity.
Interactive seems to be the festive season's buzzword. Dorling Kindersley's
Action Pack Pyramid (Pounds 12.99) takes the idea even further.
This is a book in a box which includes a model pyramid you can make, a
poster of Ancient Egypt, the Great Tomb Robbery board game, a hieroglyph
decoder and a gruesome mummified corpse.
This series also includes Night Sky and Dinosaur, which comes with a
press-out scale model of a pleasant-looking stegosaurus.
Dorling Kindersley's Incredible Cross Sections series continues with Castle
(Pounds 12.99) by Richard Platt and Stephen Biesty, a detailed look at the
inside of a 14th century fortress.
Biesty's illustrations are teeming with medieval life - old ladies
quarrelling over bags of grain, a young nobleman being knighted, someone
being tortured, a chilly looking guard who has lost all his clothes in a
game of dice - and are accompanied by plenty of facts and figures (did you
know that owners of battlemented houses had to have a licence to
crenellate?) and a 'Where's Wally'-like competition to find an enemy spy.
Maintaining a dignified reserve when it comes to fold-ups and pull-outs,
Oxford expands its children's reference series this winter with the
Children's Book of Famous People (Pounds 20).
If your child is old enough to read this book, he would probably prefer to
be given Pounds 20 worth of Power Rangers. But for parents this will be your
offspring's ideal Christmas present - a thick book full of school-quiz
answers.
Interesting snippets of information about the likes of Charlemagne, WG
Grace, stout Cortes, Nietzsche and Isaac Newton (even some women creep in:
Martha Graham, dance queen; Madonna and, rather bizarrely, Margaret Mahy,
the New Zealand writer). The whole thing is beautifully produced and stuffed
with colour illustrations.
If you have spawned an embryonic film buff, search out Robin Cross's Movie
Magic (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 10.99), a fast-talking, richly illustrated
guide to everything to do with movies.
Starting with the first film ever made, the explosive Fred Ott's Sneeze, in
which Thomas Edison filmed one of his assistants harrumphing into his
hankie, Cross tracks across movie history up to the 1990s, when movie moguls
make their money out of post-production spin-offs.
What today's marketing men would have made of Fred Ott's legendary sneeze is
too horrible to contemplate.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Picture magic - The power of
make-believe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BROWNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Christmas day, when computer games bore, the board game ends in tears,
the sweets induce nausea and grown-ups snore in front of the television,
what could be more enjoyable than discovering other worlds inside a new
picture book?
Badger's Bring-Something Party, written by Hiawyn Oram and illustrated by
Susan Varley (Andersen Press, Pounds 8.99), is a brilliant combination of
pictures and words.
Mole has nothing to take to badger's bring-something party - except himself.
When the other animals belittle him, Mole is ridden with guilt and shame,
but finally wins them over just by being himself. One is inevitably reminded
of EH Shepard by Susan Varley's gentle line and wash illustrations which
perfectly complement Hiawyn Oram's wonderfully subtle text.
The standard of illustration in children's picture books is high, but it is
almost impossible to find picture book texts that come anywhere near that
standard.
Too often they read like short stories, or are self-consciously poetic,
excruciatingly cosy, or just bland. Of all the picture books published this
year this is one of the very few in which the text is at least on a par with
the pictures. And they work perfectly together.
Rosalee and the Great Fire of London, written and illustrated by Catherine
Brighton (Jonathan Cape, Pounds 8.99), tells the strange and exciting story
of how Rosalee and her pet pig, Roger Bacon, escape the clutches of a
mysterious, evil man who inadvertently starts the Great Fire. The stunning
watercolour paintings are the stars of this book as we follow the heroine's
flight against magnificent backdrops of 17th century London in flames. The
text is perhaps a little over-written, sometimes telling us what we can see
in the pictures. But what pictures . . .
Doing Christmas by Sarah Garland (Bodley Head, Pounds 7.99), shows a
frazzled single parent family's preparations for Christmas, and the arrival
of an exuberant granny. The text is minimal, and the downbeat understated
illustrations carry most of the story with sly and subtle humour. Both
parents and children will see much that they can identify with in this
deceptively simple book.
The Shop of Ghosts adapted from an original story by GK Chesterton and
illustrated by Tony Ross (Andersen Press, Pounds 8.99) is a superbly
illustrated version of an unfamiliar Christmas tale. Grandad tells the story
of a Christmas long ago when he was a boy and found a magical toy shop.
Inside was a sad Father Christmas who told the boy that he was dying.
Visitors from the past, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, Robin Hood and King
Charles II, entered the shop and all recalled that in their day he had been
dying, too. Tony Ross brings this rather odd, touching story vibrantly alive
with brilliant use of colour and design. The pictures achieve a sense of
modernity combined with a nostalgic atmosphere that owes nothing to
pastiche.
The Happy Prince, from the fairy tale by Oscar Wilde and illustrated by Jane
Ray (Orchard Books Pounds 8.99), is another re-telling of the well-known
story of a friendship between the statue of the Happy Prince and the swallow
on his way to Egypt for the winter.
What makes this version special are Jane Ray's magnificently sumptuous,
jewel-like paintings. I would have preferred rather more contrast between
rich and poor, warm and cold (perhaps less gold ink on some spreads?) but
this is quibbling: the book is a very beautiful object.
The Big Big Sea written by Martin Waddell and illustrated by Jennifer Eachus
(Walker Books, Pounds 7.99) is the brief glimpse of a magical moment - a
mother and daughter's moonlit walk by the sea.
This idea steers dangerously near the self-consciously precious but Martin
Waddell clearly understands how picture books work and his simple text in
combination with the delicate photographic drawings make an exquisite visual
poem.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: A rich, heady brew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthologies, like Christmas parties, are great fun, but exhausting,
over-crowded, and leave you with a morning-after sense of having indulged
too greatly.
Oxford has made a corner in this kind of publishing. Pride of place among
its offerings this year is John Gross's The Oxford Book of Comic Verse
(Pounds 17.99).
Gross scattered invitation cards across several centuries, from Anon and
Chaucer in the Middle Ages to Victoria Wood and Vikram Seth in our own time
and he received 100 per cent acceptances to make an hilarious event.
Comic verse he defines as 'verse which is designed to amuse' and that
includes an awful lot of verse; but it stops short, in Gross's eyes, at
full-blooded satire.
Pope and Swift are there, sure enough, but not fulminating. They are in
lighter vein alongside some people we do not normally think of as poets at
all, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Knox, CS Lewis, John Updike, Cyril Connolly. Nor
has Gross neglected verse designed initially to be sung including WS
Gilbert, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Michael Flanders. All in
all, Gross has done an excellent job.
So has DJ Enright in tackling a subject of equally formidable scope in The
Oxford Book of The Supernatural (Pounds 17.99). His method is to break the
supernatural up into a dozen or more categories that include such vast areas
as 'Loving Revenants', 'Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and Other Monsters',
'Miracles and Prognostications' 'Art and Intellect' and 'Dreams,
Coincidences, Telepathy'. Familiar passages and highly abstruse ones lie
cheek by jowl as in 'Animal Spirits' where the disappearance of Hamlet's
father's ghost - 'It faded on the crowing of a cock . . .' - precedes a
passage from AE Waite's The Occult Sciences that cites many instances of the
belief that a crowing cock acted as a curfew for visitors from the other
world.
I am not really qualified to pronounce on Patricia Craig's The Oxford Book
of Modern Women's Stories (Pounds 17.99), but let me say that it contains 40
stories chosen by a compiler who has worked tirelessly for the recognition
of popular fiction.
The Impossible Art of Golf: An Anthology of Golf Writing (OUP, Pounds 16.99)
is selected by Alec Morrison, captain of Rye Golf Club in 1990. In this
instance I can personally vouch for the impossibility. (I currently play off
24 or, if I am lucky, the grass). Here are such veterans as Bernard Darwin
and Henry Longhurst, Alistair Cooke, the American sports journalist Herbert
Warren Wind and PG Wodehouse. Ian Fleming is in - Bond's round with
Goldfinger is here in toto - and so is Julian Barnes but not, surprisingly,
Patrick Hamilton nor Morrison's fellow member at Rye, Henry James, whose few
comments on the game are worth heeding.

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: A vintage crop in a golden age -
Biography / JDF Jones with the distinguished - and often exciting - works of
the past 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a wonderful year for biography, a difficult craft which is
surely going through a golden age. Fiction this year has been problematical
(see the Booker Prize]) but there has been a flow of excellent biographies
whose subjects have been drawn more often from literature than from
politics.
Not a week passes when there is not a biography to top the books pages. This
year has brought weighty (in both senses) and readable lives of Hardy,
Virginia Woolf, Richard Hughes, Charlotte Bronte, Balzac, Stendhal, James
Baldwin, Kipling, Shakespeare, Brecht and Greene.
From my own reading, I would want to highlight another half-dozen. First and
foremost, a brilliant trio of literary biographies: on DH Lawrence (The
Married Man, by Brenda Maddox, Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20); on The
Brontes by Juliet Barker (Weidenfeld, Pounds 25); and on Evelyn Waugh by
Selina Hastings (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20). These three are contesting
the various awards - and there is no point in asking why so many of the best
literary biographers are women.
The Lawrence book is unashamedly sympathetic to the man and to his German
wife, Frieda: Brenda Maddox likes Lawrence, and persuades us that he was a
good and lovable as well as a great man. The Barker book - following hard on
the heels of an excellent biography of Charlotte Bronte earlier in the year
by Lyndall Gordon (Chatto, Pounds 17.99) - is dramatically revisionist
stuff, from a former curator of the Haworth museum, stripping out the
stereotypes, murdering the myths - 1,000 pages but impossible to miss for
any devotee of that extraordinary family. As for Evelyn Waugh, you might
reckon that he deserves a rest, but Selina Hastings has produced a splendid
read emphasising his early years.
Historical biography is led by another distinguished book from Claire
Tomalin, a brilliant summoning of the life of Dora Jordan, top actress,
mistress of the future William IV, mother of a dozen of his children, who
was cast aside for reasons of state (Mrs Jordan's Profession, Viking Pounds
18). Add to the history list important new biographies of William Tyndale by
David Daniell (Yale, Pounds 19.95), Curzon by David Gilmour (John Murray,
Pounds 25) and Chamberlain by Peter T. Marsh (Yale, Pounds 30).
I got more simple fun from the stories of two colonial figures, early and
late - Livingstone (hardly a new subject but well revived in Journey to
Livingstone by Timothy Holmes (Canongate Press, Pounds 17.99) and the nutty
Francis Younghusband, invader of Tibet and a hippy ahead of his time
(Younghusband, the Last Great Imperial Adventurer by Patrick French,
HarperCollins Pounds 20). Best of all, for the late-Victorian period, was
Fiona MacCarthy's end-year life of William Morris (Faber, Pounds 25), which
brings together the radical politics with the medievally-inspired crafts.
But the lives of writers seem to be more attractive to publishers than those
of politicians, with the exception of old stalwarts like Churchill: there
was a new and controversial biography by Clive Ponting (Sinclair-Stevenson,
Pounds 20) and a rather odd collection, Eminent Churchillians, by Andrew
Roberts (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20).
Scott Fitzgerald, for instance, collected another biography, from the
prolific Jeffrey Meyers (Macmillan, Pounds 17.99), and another American
drunk, John Steinbeck, was rather luckier at the hands of Jay Parini
(Heineman, Pounds 20). There was a batch of books about Graham Greene, but
reserve judgment until the final volume of Norman Sherry's trilogy.
Oh, there was also a biography of the Prince of Wales . . .

FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Talking books shake off Cinderella image
 -The fastest-growing sector of contemporary publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Too busy to sit down and actually read The Bible? Never mind. Now you can
listen to it as you drive around the M25, south-east England's latter-day
version of Dante's hellish circles. For Pounds 199, Isis Audio Books
delivers an uncut version, 66 cassettes, requiring 85 hours of listening.
For lesser sums you can have smaller segments.
It is a great effort by the publishers but by no means 1994's most important
development in the talking book market, which is the fastest-growing sector
of contemporary publishing, expanding by an estimated 10 per cent annually.
There are about 50 publishers of audio books in the UK. Much of the output
is, sadly, inferior. There are notable exceptions, with some publishers -
such as Cover To Cover, Chivers, the BBC and Penguin - producing exceptional
recordings.
But the 1994 Golden Microphone Award - if it existed - would unquestionably
go to Naxos, the classical music specialist which has built a solid
reputation for producing premium-quality CDs at budget prices.
That such a carefully-managed label thinks this field, snobbishly
disregarded by many chattering class members, worth entering, is the best
indication that audio books are no longer publishing's poor relation.
The Naxos label, which also offers some recordings on tape, is worth
considering for several reasons. First, Naxos has gone straight into CDs -
meaning superior production qualities - while other publishers are still
locked into the antiquated cassette market.
Second, price is a factor; a two-CD Naxos recording will cost you Pounds
6.99, while most other publishers charge Pounds 7.99 for a two-cassette
book.
Naxos also selects and produces its voices with great care; of the 20-plus
Naxos books now available, all are read - performed is more accurate - by
superb voices.
And, while all Naxos books are abridged, a controversial matter, cutting has
been handled sensitively. Thus, in the Naxos recording of Joyce's Ulysses
(four CDs, Pounds 10.99, 4hrs 49mins), the accompanying leaflet explains
what has been cut and why.
At last a publisher is alive to the full range of audio possibilities. Naxos
uses its vast catalogue of classical recordings to supplement its talking
books with appropriate musical extracts, highlighting and complementing the
mood of the spoken word.
For example, for its version of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (read by
Michael Sheen, three CDs, Pounds 8.99, 3hrs 43mins), Rachmaninov's 'The Isle
of the Dead' is a fine choice for the text.
Opting for a reliable brand name is generally - but not always - sensible.
Choosing an unabridged audio book by the two best companies in the market,
Cover to Cover and Chivers, is probably the wisest course.
There are now so many versions of the same text available that selection can
be a problem. For example, there are three new accounts of Middlemarch:
Penguin's (abridged, four cassettes, Pounds 9.99) read by Harriet Walter;
the BBC's (also abridged, four cassettes and Pounds 9.99) read by Ronald
Pickup; and, by far the best, Cover to Cover's unabridged version (24
cassettes, Pounds 69.99) read by Maureen O'Brien.
Walter is either unable or unwilling to use her voice to distinguish between
characters. Ronald Pickup at least varies accent and rhythm but, if you can
afford it, the best by far is O'Brien's version, which skillfully varies
accent, intonation and pace.
Abridgement continues to cause controversy but sometimes it is a positive
merit.
A good example is Terry Waite's Taken on Trust, his memoir of incarceration
in Beirut. Chivers has brought out an uncut version, read by Waite, costing
almost Pounds 50 for 12 cassettes. Waite's plodding delivery of his own
ponderous text rapidly palls; on the page the dullness can be skipped. This
is not so easy on cassette - which is why you may opt for Hodder Headline
Audiobooks version, under Pounds 10 for two cassettes, also read by Waite.
If you have the money and time for an unabridged story, particularly by
classic authors who have powerful narrative skills on the page, then there
really is no other publisher to go for than Cover to Cover, which this year
has brought out some wonderful recordings.
Miriam Margolyes brilliantly delivers Oliver Twist (12 cassettes, Pounds
34.99), as does Timothy West with Barchester Towers (14 cassettes, Pounds
39.99) and the popular Martin Jarvis gives a splendid performance in Great
Expectations (12 cassettes, Pounds 34.99).
Chivers also has an enviable, often highly entertaining, range of
recordings. Gems this year include Olivia Manning's Friends and Heroes, the
final volume of the Balkan Trilogy (10 cassettes, Pounds 37.95), two
Flashman novels (Flashman and Flashman at the Charge, both eight cassettes
and Pounds 31.95) read by Timothy West. Jeffrey Archer's Not a Penny More,
Not a Penny Less (splendidly read by Archer sound-alike Alex Jennings, eight
cassettes, Pounds 31.95) is good for a long car journey .
The relaunched Argo label, which has reverted to Polygram, has re-released
some excellent material this year, including I, Claudius read by Derek
Jacobi (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), and Three Men in a Boat, vivaciously
handled by Jeremy Nicholas (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99).
Laurie Lee reads Cider With Rosie (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99): one instance
where the writer also proves to be an excellent reader.
Other publishers fare less well, regarding the growth in audio book sales as
little more than a chance to squeeze some extra cash from back lists. In
this market, price and reader name is no guide to quality.
The BBC generally never puts a foot wrong, and Alan Bennett reading his own
Diaries 1980-1990 (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99) or William Hurt reading Paul
Theroux's The Great Railway Bazaar (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99) are two fine
examples of compelling texts matched with the very best readers.
One slight disappointment is Kenneth Branagh's reading of Laurie Lee's As I
Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99). His voice is
too sterile, too contemporary, for the subject matter.
From its much-hyped launch a year ago, Penguin has proved hit-and-miss.
Perhaps the problem is over-production - more than 80 titles - combined with
what appears to be a determination to go for well-known faces rather than
the most appropriate voices. While Timothy Spall gives an hysterically funny
reading of William Boyd's A Good Man In Africa (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99),
Fiona Shaw's reading of another Boyd novel, Brazzaville Beach, is comatose.
For unintentional hysteria, try Roger Moore's rendition of Jack Higgins'
Thunderpoint (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), where Moore does as fine a
version of ham Nazi as you could wish for. Or borrow - for goodness' sake do
not purchase - Kuki Gallmann's I Dreamed of Africa (two cassettes, Pounds
7.99), read by Isabella Rossellini. Famous film star she may be; but here
she betrays not the slightest understanding of the English language.

Top of my list is Claire Tomalin's Mrs Jordan's Profession (Viking, Pounds
18), the haunting tale of the great actress who lived with King William 1V,
bore him 10 children and was then ditched in favour of a wealthy royal wife.
Tomalin's reflection on public and private lives, on royalty, on theatre and
society, have a blazing contemporary interest. Her backcloth of 18th-century
good living shading into 19th century morality is spirited cultural history
seen through the prism of a passionate, fragile woman. A book glowing with
both ideas and warmth.
David Cannadine's Aspects of Aristocracy (Yale, Pounds 19.95) is a hugely
enjoyable portrait of the upper classes at play and at work, in debt and in
love, on the way up and on the way down. It is the perfect history book for
the non-historian. Ample in scope but full of human detail, accessible and
graceful in its scholarship, witty and opinionated in style.
Most beautiful book of the year must be the exhibition catalogue The Glory
of Venice (Yale, Pounds 22.50) - a celebration of familiar masterpieces and
an introduction to exquisite drawings, prints and book illustrations by
artists such as Canaletto, Guardi, Piazzetta and Tiepolo.

If fiction is passion, non-fiction is more like obsession. A sufferer of the
latter sort, I found total release in Eric Hobsbawm's Age of Extremes
(Michael Joseph, Pounds 20), a brilliant history of our own century by one
of its foremost Marxist intellects. One can disagree with Hobsbawm's
judgment that the 75-year struggle between communism and capitalism will be
seen as less important than the worldwide technological revolution. One can
reject his pessimism. But one cannot escape the shudders of recognition as
Hobsbawm describes us, as if he were looking back at us from 200 years away.
A millennial milestone.
For description more heady than any novel, I choose Under My Skin
(HarperCollins, Pounds 20), the first volume of Doris Lessing's
autobiography. Her account of childhood - in other hands so often tedious -
is objective, subjective and magic. It is as if the child herself were
writing with the old woman's pen.
A quite different sort of pleasure was Martin Gilbert's In Search of
Churchill (HarperCollins, Pounds 20), where the world record-holding
biographer takes a day off, as it were, shows us round the factory giving us
a colourful sketch of Sir Winston and a quick peep at himself.

The novel is not dead, nor even in trouble, despite what the rubbish-heads
say. A highlight of my fictional year was Melanie Rae Thon's Iona Moon
(Penguin, Pounds 5.99), about a farmer's girl in White Falls, Idaho, who
smells of the byre and is generous with her favours, coming to terms with
small-town life and its unforgiving righteousness. Thon's talent is
reminiscent of Peter Carey's: distinctive, sharply lyrical and based on
masterly characterisation.
Also very good: Masai Dreaming, by Justin Cartwright (Picador, Pounds 5.99),
a stunningly well-realised tale of a would-be movie scriptwriter researching
the story of a young Frenchwoman, Claudia, who lived among the Masai before
being sent from Paris, days before its liberation, to Auschwitz. Complex,
sad, poetic. 'Whatever happens to me,' writes Claudia to the Masai in her
last, unbearable message, 'I wish that you may have many cattle and
plentiful green grass. And wherever God takes me I will dream of you.'
Honourable near-miss, but memorable and enjoyable: Thomas Keneally's
too-ambitious Jacko The Great Intruder (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 15.99), a
tale of TV folk (monsters, all). This is Keneally's 22nd novel, and has
enough material (New York, Sydney, the Northern Territory, fall of the
Berlin Wall) to have succoured his 23rd and 24th ones as well. Here's to his
25th.

Those few who have particular interest in the composer Peter Warlock must
read the centenary biography by Barry Smith (OUP, Pounds 25.00). A
substantial extension of earlier lives and memoirs, it occasionally seems so
burdened by research and worthiness that Warlock the man is difficult to
find, some aspects of his private life underplayed and sometimes altogether
neglected, some mistresses omitted, his homosexual escapades unchronicled.
Even so, as a portrait of a man largely dislikeable, if not despicable,
whose small talent was not sustained and was in any case far too English to
be of international interest, the book is important as it is likely to be
the last and only serious work on a guttering candle in the mean and
dreadful gloom of English music in the 1920s.
The Rape of Europa, by Lynn Nicholas (Macmillan, Pounds 20.00), is almost,
but not quite, a rollicking tale of the rape and plunder of works of art
under the Nazis - the subject too melancholy, the permanent losses from
museums, galleries and private collections too tragic. Half a century on,
and with the growth of so many new museums devoted to detritus and waste
body products, we have forgotten the appalling damage done to the whole
European heritage by the greed of Gauleiters and other minions as well as of
the grandees of the Third Reich. In so much research, the author lost sight
of simple things, - a biographical note on Hans Frank, Governor of Poland,
for example, would have been helpful - but of the broad sweep of wanton
confiscation and its consequences, both human and cultural, she has full
control and tells her story well.
Much consolation and amusement for those who hold the political
correctitudes in contempt is to be found in Women's Life in Greece and Rome,
by Mary Lefkowitz and Maureen Fant (Duckworth, Pounds 14.99), a source book
of ancient texts with neat introductions, neatly organised, and not a trace
of feminism or American vulgarities. The authors demonstrate that women in
the antique world were not so hard done by and despised - that they could
both sit at Plato's knee as pupils and discuss among themselves the merits
of a dildo maker and his tools, that the education of women was supported in
Rome at a time when St Paul the bigot was condemning it, and that their
status and rights to property were supported by many laws. There are, of
course, occasional examples of prejudice against them - I like particularly
the poet Menander's comment that 'A man who teaches a woman to write should
recognise that he is providing poison to an asp.'

Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 25) is not only far
and away my book of the year; it is also one of the best books on the
subject ever written. When I reviewed it in May, I suggested that anybody
serious should have read it by Christmas. There is still time left. Note
especially Kissinger's critical comments on British foreign policy between
the two world wars.
I also liked Bob Woodward's The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House
(Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 14.99). Not everyone will enjoy the style: very
insiderish without giving sources. Yet it goes a long way to explaining how
President Clinton reached his present predicament.
Lord Howe's autobiography Conflict of Loyalty (Macmillan, Pounds 25) is
written in the quiet tone that he uses in speech. Possibly that is why it
has been under-rated by some reviewers. In fact, it is well organised and
full of material, especially on Europe and foreign policy. It should survive
long after some other memoirs of the Thatcher period, and before, have been
forgotten.

My idea of heaven may not be the gloriously coloured and earthy Africa of
Abdulrasak Gurnah (Paradise, Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 14.99), but Mr Gurnah
certainly does write like an angel. Where others would have been content to
have their novels glisten with the charm of the 'native', Gurnah's novel
throbs with the passion of a visionary. His style is reminiscent of VS
Naipaul - perhaps not as comical as the early Naipaul, but not as bitter as
the current writings, either.
In the non-fiction stakes: Tony Benn's Diaries 1940-1962 (Hutchinson, Pounds
25) reveal another visionary, one whose devotion to the people and
commitment to public duty reduces one to exhaustion and to feeling one-inch
tall. Harold Wilson once said of Benn that 'he immatures with age'. What was
meant as a put-down turns out to be the key to Benn's continuing hold on the
nation's emotional imagination: he brings youthful energy and enthusiasm to
the arduous and often unrewarding task of standing popular convictions on
their heads. A truly humbling man.
Hubris rather than humility stalks the corridors of Westminster providing
Auberon Waugh with much of his inspiration for the columns collected in Way
of the World (Century, Pounds 15.99). What a hoot]

I have read nothing so entertaining and intellectually stimulating this year
as Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (Allen Lane, Pounds 20). He sets
out to demonstrate that language is not a cultural invention but a
neurological mechanism, and along the way offers up many witty and
fascinating reflections on anthropology, Darwinism, cultural snobbery, as
well as an elegant defence of 'hopefully' as a sentence adverb.
In Craig Raine's long poem History: The Home Movie (Penguin, Pounds 9.99)
language is wrought into a kind of mental jewellery; imagery of clarity and
fabulous invention shines on every page. The minutiae of the private life
and the great upheavals of this century are given equal weight to create a
history of intense emotional reality.
When modern warfare engulfs a literary mind the result is usually
interesting enough in itself, but Tobias Wolff's memoir of his time in
Vietnam, In Pharaoh's Army (Bloomsbury, Pounds 14.99), has an irresistible
flow. He is a lucid, self-honest spirit with a gift for narrative. I read
him at a sitting, and was sad to run out of pages.

Mark Morris, by Joan Acocella (Farrar Strauss Giroux, Dollars 27.50), is not
merely a lively and highly intelligent account of this acclaimed
choreographer, and not merely the best book-length critical study yet
written of any dance artist. It achieves the rare feat of reading the
artist's mind while locating his work within the modern cultural context:
all achieved with absorbing vigour and fluency and without ever becoming
difficult or arcane. I am impatient to re-read it.
The Complete Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Pavilion, Pounds 25) is an intoxicating
plunge into the wit of the Jazz Age. Some of the lesser-known lyrics are so
funny that I, reading, had to rush straight to the phone to read them aloud
to friends ('It's never too late to Mendelssohn . . . We hope they'll
Lohengrin and bear it').
But the best delight is to pore at leisure over familiar lyrics: I'm bidin'
my time, Cause that's the kind of guy I'm; Little wow, tell me now, How long
has this been going on?. Women and head waiters fawned on me. Like Hamlet,
Ira Gershwin's lyrics are made up of quotations; and the quotations are now
part of this century's lifeblood.
On a less exalted level, Les Gussow's Conversations with Pinter (Nick Hern
Books, Pounds 12.99) simply gives us Pinter talking relaxedly about himself
and his work. There are no astonishing illuminations here; but I have found
the book a refreshing companion during a year in which Pinter's plays have
become, for me, more than ever before an absorbing pleasure.

Age of Extremes (Michael Joseph, Pounds 20) by Eric Hobsbawn is an
extraordinary book. Based largely on Hobsbawm's personal experience and
observation, it provides the most stunning review of the 20th century. It is
written in vivid, witty and incisive prose, displaying an incredible breadth
of knowledge and understanding. A great read.
Another favourite was Sally Belfrage's UnAmerican Activities (Andre Deutsch,
Pounds 14.99). This is a remarkable account of the author's exotic
background as a child of British journalists who made their home in the US.
Their politics singled them out for special attention during the McCarthy
period. The phone was tapped from the minute Sally Belfrage could talk on
it, and the FBI had been at the door since whe was tall enough to turn the
knob. It is biography at its best but also a brilliant account of a shameful
part of America's past.
I also loved Marina Warner's book of fairy tales, From the Beast to the
Blonde (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 20). I always suspected those seven dwarfs
were up to no damn good, but it is Warner's scholarship which impresses.
Salman Rushdie's short stories East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99) are delightful
and reveal a benign quality amidst the sharp wit and wisdom.

East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99), home in neither, but poised somewhere in
between - Salman Rushdie's volume of short stories on this theme is deft,
inventive, entertaining. Reading it, I stumbled late also on his Haroun and
the Sea of Stories (Granta Pounds 12.99 hbk, Penguin Pounds 4.50 pbk), a
fable for children of all ages that will delight generations to come.
Iain Bank's Complicity (Abacus, Pounds 6.99) is a cocktail of sex,
skulduggery and hi-tech mystery, set most convincingly in a Caledonian
newsroom. The Glasgow Herald of my staid youth would never have employed
Complicity's fall-guy protagonist, but I shall now read everything Banks has
written.
From high up the current US best-seller list, a nightmarish trifle:
Politically Correct Bedtime Stories (Souvenir Press, Pounds 6.99) modern
tales for our life and times. The author James Finn Garner is presumably
pulling our leg. It isn't really necessary to go to such lengths to avoid
offence across the pond? Is it? Perhaps it is, and may be here also one day.
Laugh while you can.

Biography and autobiography usually bring their subjects before us in
striking dress, to prompt our curiosity the more. But if you would meet them
naked, inspect their personal mail. Pirandello's Love Letters to Marta Abba
(Princeton, Pounds 24.95) reveal to us the Italian playwright in the last
decade of his life, passionately in love with a young actress, baring to her
the feebleness, frailty, cupidity and egoism that underlie creative life.
They also give us oblique and sometimes shocking glimpses of a world sliding
into madness.
Nicolaas Rupke's biography of Richard Owen - the man who coined the term
'dinosaur', meaning 'terrible lizard', and who was second only to Darwin
among nineteenth century naturalists - is riveting (Yale University Press,
Pounds 35). In relating bitter Victorian debates Rupke shows how science
affected great social and religious questions still urgently relevant today.
One of the year's most original and outstanding books is Theodore Zeldin's
An Intimate History of Humanity (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20). In each of
a variety of personal stories Zeldin finds the ends of threads that lead him
into fascinating labyrinths of history and human experience, which he
perceptively, insructively and absorbingly explores. This is a read to
relish.

Value for money this year has to be Italo Calvino's Italian Folk Tales
(Penguin, Pounds 12.99). Purchased for my seven year old son last Christmas,
this collection of ancient tales brilliantly re-told by Calvino in his spare
but lucid style has provided pleasure and nourishment for parent and child
alike night after night after night, and nearly a year on is still not
finished.
For inspiration my choice this year has to be Will Self's Grey Area and
Other Stories (Bloomsbury, Pounds 9.99), a beautiful collection of Nathaniel
West-ish tales which manage to combine the quirky stylistic devices which we
know and love from The Quantity Theory of Insanity (characters from one
story reappearing in another, for instance) with a chilling moral diagnosis
of all that is wrong with our society.
Finally, for pleasure, it has to be Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped
(Everyman Library, Pounds 9.99). I live in Enniskillen but I work in Belfast
and I do my reading shuttling on the bus between the two. I hate that
journey, but with Kidnapped in my hands I forgot entirely where I was
because emotionally and imaginatively I was in Scotland. Some of the scenes
had me in tears, while others made me laugh out loud. Thank God for
Stevenson - fully rounded characters, and a story which touches the reader's
heart.

I recommend May the Lord in his Mercy be Kind to Belfast by Tony Parker
(HarperCollins Pounds 7.99), and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by
John Berendt (Chatto, Pounds 10.99).
Tony Parker's book is a collection of interviews with people on every side
of the political, religious, and economic divide. He has a sorcerer's skill
at charming remarkable self-confessions, without ever making his presence
felt. The book is apparently artless, but is beautifully edited and shaped,
and is the most comprehensive and profound document that I have ever read
about Northern Ireland.
John Berendt's book is set in Savannah. It is a documentary account of a
murder that took place in a small, insulated Southern community. It is a
beguiling mixture of wit, mystery, satire and compelling narrative, seasoned
with some voodoo and jazz.

In Mosaic - published in New York by Farrar Strauss at Dollars 25 but surely
meriting distribution here - Lincoln Kirstein has embarked upon his memoirs.
Here is the first quarter-century of his life, from 1907 until 1933, when he
brought George Balanchine to America and embarked upon the greatest
enterprise of a life full of great enterprises.
In Kirstein, intellect and action have marvellously combined, and this first
volume is a story of a precociously brilliant youth who matures into an
extraordinary man of thought and deed. The style is powerful: descriptions -
of Gurdjieff; of Harvard and Boston society; of teachers and friends - are
grandly evocative.
It is a tremendous book about a tremendous life. It is also a reminder of
the values in telling the story of a life, in a year when my other two
nominations are in the 'Biography from Hell' category: Peter Watson's
Nureyev (Hodder, Pounds 20) and Christopher Ogden's study of Pamela
Harriman, The Life of the Party (Little, Brown, Pounds 10.99). Books to
fling across the room.

Two of my three books focus on England. Adam Sisman's AJP Taylor, A
Biography (Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 18.99) is all that the biography of a
historian ought to be. As a controversialist Taylor offended nearly as many
people as he delighted, and that in itself gave him pleasure. Sisman sets
out to explain not only what Taylor did but what made him do it. Evelyn
Waugh, the subject of another excellent biography, presented Taylor with a
copy of his Sword of Honour trilogy. What could be more English than that?
Arthur Jacobs in his Henry Wood, Maker of the Proms (Methuen, Pounds 20)
reveals far more about Wood than Wood ever did; and while nothing could be
more English either than the last night of the Proms (even with an intrepid
Welshman singing 'Land of Hope and Glory') Wood was a pioneer in introducing
thoroughly non-English composers like Mahler and Schoenberg.
Iain Banks, choosing a topical and universal word for his title, Complicity
(Abacus, Pounds 6.99 pbk), brilliantly and terrifyingly uncovers all the
raw, rough violent strands in contemporary British (not just English)
society. As a novelist he writes superbly, taking as many risks as did
Taylor as a historian. No one would present him with a sword of honour, but
he deserves an accolade.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Beware investment nomads - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications giant BT started the UK privatisation crusade ten years
ago today. And as our popular shares table shows, investors in BT and most
of the other privatisations have done very nicely out of the share sales.
But privatisation has generally had a greater effect on the companies
involved than on the attitude of private individuals to the stock market.
People who happily bought shares in some or all of the big privatisations,
have not gone on to buy other shares through the secondary market. The
proportion of UK shares held by individuals is still falling.
This is partly because many people still find the stockmarket daunting and
expensive, partly because no one tries to sell 'second hand' shares to the
public in the same way that they sell privatisation issues and unit trusts.
Most major investment houses and many major companies prefer having large
investment funds as shareholders. Small shareholders are seen as
'expensive', particularly when they insist on holding shares in their own
name rather than through nominees.
Such dismissive attitudes are understandable - but a touch short-sighted.
Professional investors tend to be far more fickle than personal investors.
Investment managers looking for new markets or new types of investment can
be as lethal as tourists pillaging an unspoilt holiday spot. (The recent
collapse in the silver price provides a good example of what can happen to a
small market when the tourists lose interest.) But investment tourism is
here to stay.
Figures published this week showed that foreign ownership of UK shares had
risen to 16 per cent in 1993, compared with less than four per cent at the
start of the 1980s. Over the same period share ownership by private
individuals has fallen steadily from over 28 to under 18 per cent - despite
the privatisation programme.
The most important investment tourists are US fund managers. For a long time
they had remained relatively parochial, but US pension fund managers have
belatedly woken up to the charms of geographical diversification.
For private investors the question is not whether the trend is a good thing
but how to adapt to the changing investment environment.
US investors have clear preferences: what they like are large companies in
which they can buy - and sell - substantial holdings easily. That tends to
mean the largest companies: those in the FT-SE 100 index and the top of the
250 index.
Usually such companies can absorb substantial foreign buying without their
shares prices responding excessively. This is good both for the buyers and
for other investors in the companies.
But if American interest is particularly strong it can send the share price
of even a large company soaring, which is fine until American interest
wanes.
In the first few months of 1987, for instance, strong American buying was
the main factor behind a doubling in the share price of drugs group Glaxo.
When the October crash came, and investors round the world put foreign
holdings at the top of their 'sell' list, the Americans sold Glaxo as hard
as they had earlier bought it. And the Glaxo share price lost virtually all
its earlier gains overnight.
The year 1987 was an unusual one. And it is rare for shares in a large
company to be affected so severely by the changing attitude of international
investors.
But if American buying were to move further down the size scale, such roller
coaster share price movements could become more prevalent.
Some UK fund managers are now being given authority to take their American
clients into medium-sized and even smaller companies.
Private individuals have two possible ways of dealing with these outside
influences on UK share prices.
They can either try to 'make the trend their friend', hoping to make short
term profits from the tourists; or they can take a really long term view,
and view short term gyrations with Olympian detachment.
The former approach is tempting - but can be expensive.

Business
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke promised sharp cuts in future government spending
and borrowing in a workmanlike Budget designed to put the long-term jobless
back to work and help small businesses.
The government had its paper majority in the House of Commons wiped out as
the price of crushing a Tory rebellion against higher British contributions
to the European Union.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, Britain's senior competition regulator, is to step down
as director-general of fair trading next May, three years into his five-year
term.
Norway rejected membership of the European Union, for the second time. It
last rejected membership in 1972.
Skilled workers are less confident about the economy and job security than
any other social group, according to the latest FT/MFS Mood of the Nation
Index. The overall index has recovered from a two-month decline triggered by
the rise in interest rates.
The government imposed the toughest financial settlement on local
authorities since the 1970s, with a cash cut in the funding they will
receive from central government. Council tax is projected to rise at double
the rate of inflation.
Durlacher &amp; Co, the stockbroking house, has been fined Pounds 25,000 by the
Securities and Futures Authority, for breaches of regulations.
Fresh evidence of the sluggishness of the mortgage market came as it emerged
that new home loans by banks fell more than 10 per cent in October, compared
with September.
Customs and Excise announced it is to shed more than 4,000 jobs over the
next five years.
Barclays Bank Pension Fund, one of the UK's largest, is faced with a special
assessment by the Inland Revenue. The move will be a test case on whether
pension scheme profits earned by underwriting new share deals ought to be
taxed.
Corporate investment in Lloyd's of London is to increase by more than Pounds
300m next year following a last-minute announcement of the launch of a new
company, backed by two US institutional funds, which plans to invest Pounds
88m.
Complaints about term assurance and permanent health insurance are likely to
be transferred to the ombudsman scheme linked to the Personal Investment
Authority (PIA), the watchdog to protect the private investor, even though
these policies are outside its scope.
Markets
The London stock market was virtually unaltered throughout the chancellor's
speech, and closed higher on the day. However, renewed fears over interest
rates led to heavy selling on Thursday.
Sterling traded steadily on the foreign exchanges after the Budget lived up
to market expectations. It lost some ground on Friday against a strong US
dollar.
Foreign ownership of shares in British companies rose significantly last
year, for the fourth successive year, official figures showed.
Silver plunged below the psychologically-important Dollars 5 a troy ounce
level on Thursday, giving a salutary warning about what can happen when
investment funds, having driven metal prices up with a buying spree, decide
to quit the market.
South Korean financial institutions cashed in as overseas investors
responded to the raising of foreign shareholding ceilings by buying on
Thursday their highest one-day total of shares in the country's leading
blue-chip companies.
China banned its pension schemes from investing in the country's volatile
stock markets, insisting that funds go into approved government securities.
Companies
British Petroleum is to promote a new chairman and chief executive from
within its ranks in the first big reshuffle since the boardroom coup of
1992. Chairman, Lord Ashburton, will be succeeded by David Simon, the
current chief executive. He in turn will be succeeded by John Browne, head
of the company's exploration arm.
Williams Holdings signalled a slowdown in its hectic acquisition campaign as
it announced plans to purchase the fire protection arm of BBA Group, the
automotive components company, for Pounds 80m, including assumed debt.
Browning-Ferris won its Pounds 391m takeover bid for Attwoods with believed
acceptances of nearly 60 per cent at the end of yesterday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 532m
in the year to September 30.
The 75 per cent salary increase awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, the chief
executive of British Gas, still leaves him underpaid compared with many
executives holding similar jobs in British industry, according to Mr Richard
Giordano, the company's chairman.
T&amp;N, formerly one of the UK's largest asbestos suppliers, announced a
surprise Pounds 100m provision against future asbestos-related claims, just
three months after a US court ruling that indicated a declining trend in
claims. T&amp;N's share price fell sharply on the news.
3i, the recently floated venture capital group concentrating on investment
in small and medium-sized companies, reported a 6.7 per cent increase in net
asset value per share to 334p in the six months to September 30.
Chemical Banking, the fourth-biggest US banking group, announced a range of
cost-cutting and other measures, including 3,700 job losses, in an attempt
to lift its profitability closer to the levels of more successful rivals.
Hanson saw an accelerating improvement in operating profits in the year to
September 30.
BTR, the industrial conglomerate whose shares have fallen by more than a
quarter in the past three months, issued a trading statement which failed to
restore City confidence.
An increase in beer sales volumes in spite of a fall in the overall market
helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based regional brewer, to
lift interim profits by 6.5 per cent.
Best Travel, the UK's seventh-largest tour operator, went into liquidation.
It was the travel industry's biggest collapse since 1991.
Hasbro bought Waddington's games division for Pounds 50m in cash, giving the
biggest US toy and games group a monopoly on Monopoly, the world's
best-selling board game.
A downbeat trading statement sent shares in Argyll, the grocery retailer,
down 17p to 255p on Wednesday - the biggest fall of the day among FT-SE 100
stocks - in spite of a 4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits.
The Advertising Standards Authority is to censure Procter &amp; Gamble over
advertising claims in its 'soap wars' with Unilever, according to a leaked
draft of an ASA adjudication.
Bayer, the German chemicals multinational, is to re-focus its
pharmaceuticals research away from crowded market sectors and step up
spending on the hunt for treatments for allergies, rheumatic ailments and
Alzheimer's disease.
A row erupted between Eurotunnel and Klesch &amp; Company, the London-based bank
debt trader, over a report issued by Klesch called 'Eurotunnel Interim
Results - Disaster Ahead'.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Sport: Olympic legacies - Winter Sport / How venues fare
after the Games have gone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SAMUEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the eve of the 1984 Sarajevo Games, ice skaters Jayne Torvill and
Christopher Dean were preparing their 'Bolero' routine in the Zetra stadium.
Involuntarily, the British contingent assembled - skiers, bobbers,
journalists - all determined to view the UK's one world-class entry.
When they arrived, the pair virtually ignored each other. They pumped around
that empty, echoing stadium, first forward, then reverse, with the
metronomic concentration of athletes working every muscle in their body.
This was what world-class athleticism meant.
Detail followed. Who did what, where and when. Temperament flared. Small
battles over line and movement were briefly disputed then dropped, the
maternal Betty Calloway sometimes intervening, sometimes not. It was voyeur
stuff for us onlookers: an old, slightly battered 'married' relationship
going through important motions.
'We've seen what makes champions,' said Elspeth Crossley-Cooke, the British
ski team chief, and we agreed.
But today, UN armoured personnel carriers are parked where the ice-skating
rink once was. The Zetra stadium is in ruins from Serbian bombardment and
next to the ruins is a training ground that has been converted into a
cemetery.
Also ruined are the cobbled-together multi-storey flats in which the press
corps stayed. And the ski areas of Bjelasnica where Bill Johnson won the
US's first men's downhill gold, or Jahorina, the women's centre, are gun
sites used to maintain the siege of Sarajevo, with the ski lodges housing
Bosnian Serb troops.
Early this year, the Bosnian Serbs staged races in a cynical attempt at an
anniversary but no one was fooled.
Sarajevo's Olympics did present us with sporting experiences we will not
forget, but the summing-up of Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee - 'the best organised Games in history' -
was clearly far-fetched.
Since then, Lillehammer in Norway (this year), Albertville in France (1992),
and Calgary in Canada (1988) have found their amenities much expanded by the
wheeling and dealing of a successful bid - mostly due to television revenue,
particularly American TV proceeds.
Calgary's Dollars 309m deal with ABC for North American rights was a
watershed. The Dollars 226m share for the organisation committee - the rest
went to the IOC - was essential lubrication for start-up and running costs
for the 16-day Games. The city's acknowledged profit was Dollars 32m with
new or updated sports and civic facilities worth Dollars 400m.
The permanent additions included a new ski area based on artificial snow at
Nakiska, 90 and 70-metre ski jumps, an indoor speed skating rink, bob and
luge runs and much updated city amenities. Nakiska, however, was one of the
lesser successes. Its icy slopes, cut rather too narrowly through trees,
brought accidents.
The ABC Calgary deal, Dollars 79m more than Los Angeles received for the
1984 summer games, and Dollars 100m more than Seoul, was exceptional. The
IOC permitted the programme to be bumped up to three weekends and the number
of events was boosted from 90 to 128 with the help of three demonstration
sports - freestyle skiing, curling and short-course speed skating.
Albertville and Lillehammer retained freestyle and short-course skating,
much to British pleasure. At Lillehammer, Richard Cobbing in the skiing and
Wilf O'Reilly and Nicky Gooch in the skating, represented a challenge,
though only Gooch got as far as a medal, a bronze.
Each Winter Olympic Games organising committee must make its report at the
following event, and for Albertville its president, Jean-Claude Killy, was
pleased to report at Lillehammer a loss of only FFr280m (Pounds 35m) in a
budget of FFr3.9bn, against a huge update of Savoie facilities. New roads
and rail links, and new snow and ice amenities, benefited an area of 1,600
sq kms and 13 centres.
The athletes disliked it for its lack of Olympic feel. So did journalists,
reduced to watching most of it on television at satellite press centres. But
after early squabbles, with one resort fighting another for events and
primacy, Courchevel, Meribel, Val d'Isere, Tignes and the rest confessed it
a good thing.
Killy was at pains to point out at Lillehammer that unlike Grenoble in 1968,
which had the backing of the Gaullist government, the Savoie was a
regionally inspired Games and there would be no white elephants. After 1968,
Alpe d'Huez restored one of its sunnier ski slopes by knocking down the
bobsleigh course, while the ski jump at St Nizier was left to rot, and a
speed skating track at Grenoble closed for lack of support. The Chamrousse
ski area where Killy won his three gold medals has remained a backwater.
Albertville, in spite of Killy's word, is still not in the clear. The small
village of Brides-les-Bain, built specifically for the Games, was still
FFr200m in debt last season and local taxes have doubled.
And Val d'Isere's steep and costly downhill run on the north-east face of
Bellevarde was roundly criticised by Patrick Ortlieb, the Austrian who won
it. Built for the Olympic TV cameras, it is unlikely to be used for a major
downhill ever again. Similarly, La Plagne's FFr270m bobsleigh run serves
fewer than 200 French bobbers, and casual use can never cover its running
costs.
Lillehammer Development has the task of ensuring that the facilities
lavished on it and the neighbouring town of Hamar are now properly
exploited. 'Albertville's goal was better infrastructure. Ours concentrated
on future tourism opportunities,' said the organising committee.
Most Norwegians deemed the Games a huge success but an outlay of Pounds
750m, mostly funded by the state, has to be justified.
The skiing venues of Kvitfjell and Hafjell have newly built chalet sites
hopeful of attracting double the number of visitors by 1997. The runs are as
good as any in Norway - the Kvitfjell downhill course was rated one of the
best and fairest of recent times - and its links with Oslo should be a
travelling bonus.
Tour operator Crystal has this season introduced the resorts of Geilo and
Hemsedal, on the railway line between Oslo and Bergen, into its brochure.
Will Lillehammer be next?
John Samuel has reported on nine of the 18 Winter Olympic Games.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Sport: One for the future - Tennis / John Barrett admires
the young Russian, Yevgeny Kafelnikov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was one of those working breakfasts. I had arranged to meet the Russian
Davis Cup captain Vadim Borisov, who was staying at the same hotel during
last January's Australian Open.
I was keen to discover Vadim's opinion of his 19-year-old countryman,
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who I had first seen two weeks earlier in Adelaide when
he had beaten Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter and fellow Russian Alexander Volkov,
to win his first open tournament.
In Melbourne the previous day, the youngster had come within two points of
beating the world No 1, Pete Sampras. Sampras, taken to five sets, had been
in no doubt about the potential of his adversary.
'He's young, has some of the best ground strokes I've ever played against
and returned my serve as well as anyone ever has. In my prediction he's
going to be top 20 or better in a couple of years.'
Sampras could hardly have guessed how quickly his prophecy would be
fulfilled. After a season which has included three wins over Michael Stich
and successes against Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Goran Ivanisevic, young
Kafelnikov, now a rangy 20-year-old, has won two tournaments and lifted
himself to No 11 on the ATP computer rankings.
Borisov will not be surprised. He had told me that day in Melbourne how
ambitious Kafelnikov was. But he did have reservations. 'It will all depend
upon the quality of his work. He must get stronger and learn to volley. He
grew up with Andrei (Medvedev) but never worked as hard on his game as
Andrei did. He can be moody, too, but there is no question, at times he can
be quite brilliant.'
The world will be able to enjoy that brilliance this weekend when history
will be made in Moscow. For the first time since 1900, when the Harvard
student Dwight Davis presented a handsome silver punch bowl, worth Dollars
1,000, for annual competition between the tennis playing nations of the
world, a Russian team has reached the final of the Davis Cup.
Their opponents are the four-time champions, Sweden, led by Stefan Edberg
who is playing in his 30th tie and his 6th final. He is the only member of
his team who has experienced the highly-charged atmosphere of a Davis Cup
final which can play havoc with the nerves.
The tie is being played in the 12,000 seat Olympic Stadium where President
Boris Yeltsin, himself a keen tennis player, is expected to lead the cheers
for his unseeded countrymen. This was not the final the world expected.
The semi-finals produced two of the most extraordinary upsets in the history
of the competition. In Gothenburg Sweden beat the top-seeded US after losing
the first two rubbers - something that has never happened before in a Davis
Cup semi-final.
In Hamburg, on a fast hard court laid specially over their traditional clay
to suit Stich, the defending champions lost the first three rubbers to
Russia, their first defeat on home soil since the 1985 final loss to Sweden.
Although Sweden have won both their previous encounters against Russia, the
odds are even this year.
Kafelnikov is still improving while Edberg, who will be 29 next month, is
probably past his peak. Furthermore, Thursday's draw gave Edberg an opening
match against the No 2 Russian, Alexander Volkov, who has always been a
thorn in his side.
Volkov reached his highest-ever ranking of 14 in August last year and is
brilliant but unpredictable, just the sort of man all the top players hate
to face.
Stich was on the receiving end of that brilliance in the semi-final and in
the first round this year Volkov had sealed the fate of Australia by beating
their rising star, Patrick Rafter, in the tie-winning fourth rubber.
The draw for the second rubber pitted Kafelnikov against Larsson, a man who
had beaten him 7-6 7-6 in the final of Germany's new pre-Wimbledon grass
court tournament in Halle. Larsson had been the hero of Sweden's thrilling
win against the Americans at the end of September. Having won the doubles,
Sweden had drawn level when Sampras, one set down in his match against
Edberg, had been forced to retire with an injured hamstring.
In the deciding rubber Larsson had played the match of his life to win in
four sets against the No 2 American, Todd Martin, whose nerve failed him.
Strong nerves will be needed by the Swedish pair in today's doubles match,
so often the rubber which decides Davis Cup ties.
Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman could not have been better prepared. They
arrived in Moscow on Monday as the newly crowned ATP Tour World Doubles
champions. Their five-set final in Jakarta last Sunday against Australia's
'Woodies' - Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde - was one of the most
exciting matches I have seen for years.
At 5-4 in the fourth set Woodbridge served for the title and the same player
was serving at 5/4 in the fourth set tie-break. At those crucial moments the
Swedes were superb, returning serve with great skill to turn the match their
way.
It had been the same in Gothenburg in the Davis Cup semi-final against the
Americans. Their crucial tie-saving victory against Jared Palmer and
Jonathan Stark nearly blew the roof off the Scandinavium as the home fans
went wild.
However, as they will discover, a Davis Cup final on foreign soil will pose
different problems.
Tomorrow's meeting between Kafelnikov and Edberg is the match I am looking
forward to. When they last met in Stockholm, five weeks ago on a carpet
court, the Russian won 7-6 6-2. Will Edberg's greater experience of these
occasions be enough to counter the growing expertise of this future
champion?
Personally I doubt it. Whatever the outcome this weekend, the unparalleled
excitement this event has caused in Moscow proves once again the eternal
appeal of international contests at the highest level.
Since the Davis Cup became sponsored by NEC in 1981, the number of entries
for this largest annual team competition in world sport has more than
doubled to its present 109 nations. Next year a record 115 countries will
take part.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): Handy for a fixed sum on a
fixed date - Zero-dividend preference shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zero-dividend preference shares (popularly known as 'zeros') promise
repayment of a specified sum after a set number of years, to the extent that
the company - typically an investment trust - has the assets to meet this
preferentially-ranked debt. As the name indicates, there are no pay-outs of
income on zero-dividend shares.
Investors try to strike what they feel is a reasonable balance between the
gross yield to redemption and what is known as the 'fulcrum point' - a
calculation of the growth in assets needed, or shrinkage acceptable, in the
time between the present and the redemption date.
For example, the TR Technology investment trust issued zero-dividend shares
at 100p in April 1988, due for redemption at 313.2p in April 1998. An
investor who bought at the recent market price of 227p would receive a
capital repayment in 1998 equivalent to a gross yield of 9.88 per cent a
year, even if TR Technology's assets fell by 7.5 per cent annually for the
next four years. This compares with a gross redemption yield of 8.49 per
cent on a gilt-edged (government fixed-interest) stock with the same number
of years to redemption.
In contrast, M&amp;G Recovery will need to produce asset growth of 1.7 per cent
a year in order to meet the April 2002 repayment target of 150p per share on
the zeros it issued at 45p in April 1992. At the recent price of 69p, the
gross yield to redemption on these shares was 11.16 per cent, against 8.93
per cent on an equivalent gilt.
Demand for zero-dividend shares is usually strongest when interest rates are
perceived as falling, since investors buy as a way of locking in a return
over the remaining life of the shares. If investors continue buying as the
share price rises and the redemption yield falls, cover on the zeros can
rise to levels that could absorb regular catastrophic crashes.
River Plate &amp; General, for example, could see its assets drop by 40 per cent
in each of the next two years, and still redeem its zeros at 100p. The gross
redemption yield on these shares is currently just 7.68 per cent.
John Korwin-Szymanowski, of SG Warburg Securities, says investors simply do
not need that amount of cover, suggesting that a sufficiently safe choice
would be among shares relying on not more than 1 per cent annual growth to
reach redemption level.
Regarded as low-risk investments, zero-dividend shares adapt well to
financial planning, since any return - either on sale in the market or
redemption - is a capital gain that can be offset against the annual
exemption (Pounds 5,800, and scheduled to rise to Pounds 6,000).

Robin Lane Fox has no time for the leave-it brigade

The painter Constable used to say that he had never seen an ugly thing in
his life. Perhaps things were easier on the eye in the 18th century: for a
start, there were not so many dwarf conifers and no one had learnt how to
make flowerpots out of tyres and sell them on the garage forecourt.
But there was always winter: not an unusual winter like this one, in which
roses are flowering for the third time and even the trailing lobelia is
having a second deep-blue childhood, but normal winter - and I have to say
that even Constable would have difficulty finding beauty in the sight of a
flowerbed that has been hit by frost and then drenched by heavy rain.
In the warmth of summer, when anything seems plausible, I listened to a
well-known gardening expert explaining that beauty does exist in winter, but
that most gardeners shut their eyes to it.
From November, we were told, gardens entered their fourth season, alive with
the concordant beauty of glowing stems and leaves, sedge greens, chocolate
browns and the play of light on fresh cobwebs.
Because seeing is believing, we were shown slides to make the point. Under
ice-blue skies, a friendly frost had powdered the stems of tall fennel;
light filtered artistically through gossamer and the flat heads of the
sedums contrasted with yellowing leaves, making all of us feel vandals who
hurry to cut down our gardens at this time of year.
I like to think I see beauty when it is there, but in early winter, I am one
of those who likes to cut the borders flat. Have I been throwing three
months of beauty on to bonfires for the past 40 years?
Non-cutters have been gaining ground in the past decade. They leave the
border standing until March and tell the rest of us what we miss by being
too tidy too quickly.
Some of the non-cutters speak with conviction, others feel relief at not
having to cut down sodden delphiniums on wet weekends between now and
Christmas. Is there not a Post-Modernist beauty in doing nothing? The
non-cutters are the ones in tune with our over-stretched age.
This month, I promised myself that I would give the non-cutters a chance to
prove their point and try harder to find beauty in what I see from my window
during the winter, but sadly this is a far cry from the slides of hoar-frost
on faded salvias under blue skies.
Rime is no reason. In real life the rain drips in a thick fog on borders
that are full of blackened herbaceous plants.
Come off it, Constable; there is real ugliness in the dead growth on tree
peonies, tall helianthus and the heavy black leaves on clematis
heracleifolia.
You may be lucky with the cobwebs, and a few plants do look fetching when
they have died and are standing straight in a rare bout of clear winter
weather. But for most of the winter, peonies, defunct lupins and blackened
thistly echinops look less like an essay in still life and more like an
eyesore, much of which does not even make proper compost.
The missionary non-cutters, usually flower-arrangers who are looking at
gardens for vase-potential, like to see through plants, focusing on a
backdrop of sky behind the dead stems of Verbena bonariensis. They gaze
upwards, not outwards, like medieval observers who looked skywards into
their multi-layered heaven. They are picturing bits of the garden in the
hall or in church and they ignore the rest, which is for the most part an
ugly blot.
I think the reason I do not like to see the garden untended goes deep into
my past. I see beauty in an expanse of bare, keen earth, freshly dug and
waiting for the frost that will break it up. It looks orderly, monochrome
and all the better for human effort.
This goes deep into the bedrock of my youth. When I first started to garden,
I remember reading a story in which bare, clean earth represented salvation.
The story was about the owners of a garden, who lived on the edge of a wood.
They had fallen on hard times - even without being members of Lloyd's. The
husband had lost his job; the wife used to take in washing, but a laundry
had opened nearby and she too had lost her source of income. The couple were
left only with their garden and their earnest, 10-year-old son.
One evening he solemnly went out and cleared off what nowadays would be
considered a flower-arranger's unappreciated Eden of dead growth. He dug the
ground from end to end all night and when his parents looked out in the
morning, they began to quarrel over his achievement.
Father thought the son's exercise had been pointless, because the family
could certainly not afford fertiliser, let alone stock for the newly-dug
land.
The mother, however, thought the boy deserved credit because he had, after
all, turned up such a lovely clean expanse of brown soil.
I identified strongly with a digger of my own age and instincts and, a few
pages later in the story, he had raised enough cabbage and sprouts from
seeds to keep the family until the crisis passed and the father, I suppose,
could once again bear to look at his Financial Times.
You can tell me that there is beauty in an uncut garden this weekend, but
actually, I will think that you are being lazy. It takes more than Constable
to change the general perception and to persuade me that there is not a
greater beauty in the rescuing act of digging, cleaning and turning the
ground.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Act now to avoid zero inflation - Motoring /
Investment in a good set of tyres before the bad weather sets in could be a
lifesaver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hands up if you know what tyres you have on your own or your company car.
Just as I thought. Only about one in 10 of you.
Do you have any idea of their correct inflation pressure? Have you checked
them in the past three months? And what about the depth of tread pattern: is
it nearing the legal minimum of 1.6mm? Do you know if they are wearing
evenly? Have you examined the side-walls for damage?
I can guess the answer and your conscience should be pricking just a little.
At the mention of tyres, most motorists' eyes glaze over. They find them
boring and unreliable, liable to let the driver down at awkward times and
unreasonably expensive to replace.
Today's high-performance cars demand so much from their tyres that, for
safety's sake, an insignificant-looking hole can mean a tyre has to be
scrapped.
The industry says that, ideally, new tyres should be acquired four at a
time, but if a pair is bought, they should always go on the rear wheels
because, although people worry about sudden front-tyre deflations or skids,
rear ones are much more likely to cause a loss of control.
Oddly, when you ask how much new tyres for a typical family car will cost,
dealers usually start with the cheapest. There are good deals to be had,
providing you do not insist on the most familiar brand names.
Some tyres factory-fitted to new cars in Europe and Japan have names you may
never have heard before, but there is nothing wrong with them, so buy them.
Tyres are not always the ultimate distress purchase. They have become a
fashion item, and image-conscious motorists re-equip their cars with new
wheels and ultra-low profile tyres only 40 per cent as high in cross-section
as they are wide.
These are reckoned to make a sporty car look irresistibly sexy, but this is
a matter of opinion. What is not in doubt is that they can ruin ride
comfort, affect handling, and make a car unstable in rain and undriveable on
snow.
You can, however, improve a car with a sensible change of tyres - say, a set
of all-season tyres such as Goodyear's Vectra. These are patterned boldly
with a tread made from a rubber compound that grips even in very low
temperatures. They make winter driving easier, but work as well as normal
tyres on dry roads.
The drive, braking and steering of a car all depend on the tread of the four
tyres. In extreme conditions, their grip can make the difference between
life and death.
For years, the industry has been trying to persuade us to treat our tyres
with more respect. A little care, it says, can make our motoring much safer,
especially in wet and slippery winter months.
Care translates into a monthly pressure-check with a gauge (kicking the
side-wall really will not do) and a quick look round. But far too few of us
do it.
When you see a driver changing a wheel on a motorway hard shoulder, do not
be too sympathetic. The tyre that suddenly went flat at 70mph could have
been losing pressure for days and had probably been topped-up once or twice
when the driver stopped for fuel.
Tyres do not go down on their own. Something small and sharp in the tread
makes a tubeless tyre lose air slowly. If undetected, the tyre may heat and
fail suddenly on a motorway.
Prevention is better than cure. So, if you suspect tyre trouble, go to the
nearest specialist outlet. National chains such as Kwik-Fit and ATS and
hundreds of smaller independents provide drive-in tyre service and are
always happy to run a safety and slow-puncture check.
Recreational 4x4s are usually sold with tyres more suitable for on-road than
off-road use because that is where most of them spend their working lives.
But if you do spend a lot of time off-road, going up one size and choosing a
pattern with chunky shoulders will give more grip to keep you on the move
when the going is really rough.
Equally, a small increase in tyre width gives any car sharper steering
response without making the ride unacceptably hard. But always consult the
car or tyre manufacturer before making any radical change.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: The bear necessities - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. They are now in Aspen, Colorado on the last leg of
their odyssey.
Could a careless streak have crept into the FT's ski expedition as we reach
the home straight? For the first time in 327 consecutive skiing days, I
forgot my battered ski boots. Then I lost my lift ticket.
But no matter - we were in Beaver Creek, Colorado's answer to Deer Valley,
Utah, where skiers are cosseted like royalty.
New boots were swiftly upon my feet and a replacement lift ticket was
ordered by radio from our chair, shared with Mike Beckley, the Mountain
Manager, a thoroughly decent chap with a British mother.
Beckley is about 6ft 4ins and approaching 50, but skis more like an antelope
than an ox. Being with the Mountain Manager was useful - he plunged under a
rope and led us down Rip Saw, a wonderfully steep run with a foot or so of
fresh powder. We helped ourselves to fresh tracks three times before he
finally let hoi polloi share the run with us.
Beaver Creek, Vail's sister resort, is soon to be part of 'Operation
Interconnect', an attempt to create European-style linked resorts. The idea
is to link it with Arrowhead and Bachelor Gulch, where new villages are
planned.
Unfortunately, this may mean moving one of Colorado's most exclusive and
up-market hostelries, Trappers' Cabin.
Trappers' is an epicureans' hideaway in the boondocks, where staff prepare a
sumptuous meal and then leave you to spend the night on the mountain without
the intrusion of telephone or television.
One of the joys of waking up at Trappers' is to put on snow-shoes before
breakfast (which is served by the staff, now happily returned) and tramp
around in the wilderness. Attempting to do so with a high-speed 'Interbahn'
quad chair roaring up towards you from Bachelor Gulch would simply not be
the same. 'Nimbys' (not in my back yarders) who purchased property at
Arrowhead when it was still known as Vail's private address, may still have
the last word, but we are making plans to spend a night at Trappers' just in
case it is moved to who knows where.
The only alternative is lunch at the yurt (a tent-style construction) at
Arrowhead. But this might have to be shared with the local wildlife. They
are still repairing the damage caused by a bear which last summer ripped its
way through the side of the club-house and tore open the fridge to help
itself to the contents.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A relationship on the rocks - Skiing / Why
Switzerland needs to modernise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British love affair with Switzerland is almost all-forgiving. Almost,
but not quite.
Switzerland has unsurpassed mountain scenery with some of the best skiing
and mountain restaurants in Europe, but in some resorts the infrastructure
is falling behind the times.
The French have faster and more modern lifts; Austria is rapidly getting rid
of its old-fashioned T-bars; Italy is usually a lot cheaper; and the lively
'gemutlichkeit' of Austria seems to go down better with British skiers than
the more reserved Swiss equivalent (one reason why British skiers seem so
loyal to Soll, Mayrhofen and Niederau).
The very discreet, old-fashioned and tasteful Swiss quaintness that has for
so long attracted British skiers is now in danger of sending the special
Anglo-Swiss relationship into neutral or, even worse, reverse.
Switzerland needs to find a balance between rustic charm and modern-day
realism - if only they ran their ski resorts like their trains.
Where to Ski, a lively new guide to resorts around the world pulls few
punches on the subject of Swiss skiing: 'For a fast, efficient, queue-free
lift network, Swiss resorts rarely come up to French standards - and the
worst are positively abysmal.' It adds: 'Swiss resorts have a reputation for
efficiently relieving you of your money. The reputation is well earned.'
Verbier in particular receives short shrift.
While admitting the resort has 'a large, challenging ski area and very
lively night life' Where to Ski claims there are 'bad queues, over-crowded
pistes, very poor piste maintenance, lack of grooming, marking, safety
measures, very little artificial snow-making, and Europe's most expensive
lift pass'. The Consumers Association's Good Skiing Guide mentions the
'shamefully antiquated lift system' and 'unacceptable queuing'.
Verbier, superb natural ski arena that it is, clearly has problems. Like a
brilliant but wayward child, it seems to need some kind of course
correction. While I would dispute Where to Ski's comments about piste
maintenance, grooming and safety, there can be no doubt that Verbier's
popularity and range of skiing means that it does have a problem moving
skiers around the mountain.
This winter, the resort is setting great store by the installation of its
Funitel 'jumbo' gondola to Attelas which has finally replaced one of
Verbier's most antiquated telecabins. Its 15 cabins, each big enough for 30
people, can transport up to 2,000 skiers an hour, but it remains to be seen
whether this will have a significant effect on the queues.
Switzerland, it has to be said, is waking up to the need to modernise its
out-dated lifts. Flims-Laax has spent millions of francs in recent years on
new lifts but no resort can do everything at once.
Similarly, the gondola at Startgels, the so-called 'tumble-dryer', is still
bumping and jostling passengers but its days are numbered.
Saas-Fee, too, is gradually overhauling its lift system. This winter, the
upper section of the Alpin Express gondola will start operating and the
resort will replace the traditional Fee-Chatz (snow cat) service, taking
skiers from Langfluh to Felskinn, with a truly state-of-the-art lift.
This is designed to cope with the problems of transporting skiers along a
glacier which has no rocks on which to anchor lift towers. The ice here
moves up to 20cm a day, but a lift has been designed with towers that can be
moved back into place instead of drifting along with the ice.
All this is expensive. And the longer you delay, the more you have to spend
at once.
Switzerland is paying the price for being the first on the scene in the
world of winter sports. France, which only really emerged as an important
ski nation in the 1960s, was able to start with more advanced technology and
is still out in front.
The Swiss National Tourist Office recently celebrated the centenary of its
establishment in London, and it is well over a century since Edward Whymper
first scaled the Matterhorn. These events helped to forge a bond between the
two countries.
Today, British skiers who can afford it still make their annual pilgrimage
to the Swiss Alps because of the high quality to be found in traditional
Swiss hotels and restaurants. No other resort in the Alps, for example, can
match the range and quality of cuisine in Zermatt's mountain huts, but
Zermatt - which, in many ways, has sacrificed its old-fashioned charm on the
altar of new technology - has also been battling with lift queue problems.
British skiers have been immensely loyal to Switzerland. But the big modern
French resorts, often accused of being unattractive, provide skiers with
what most of them want: fast lifts, good snow and easy access to the slopes.
Just as factory farming has sadly eclipsed the more wholesome free-range
option, it is now possible that high-tech skiing at a good price may start
to eclipse the tradition of the 'good old days' inherited from Sir Arnold
Lunn.
Charm, scenery and luxury hotels may, in the end, not be enough.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (26): Income high? Keep an eye on
the capital - Yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yield is the annual rate of income on a share or bond which an investor
would earn from the security at the current price. It is usually expressed
as a percentage.
Investors calculate yields on gilt-edged stock and other fixed interest
securities in two different ways: the interest yield, or current yield, only
takes account of the actual income you get; the redemption yield, or yield
to maturity, also takes account of any capital gain or loss over the
remaining life of the bond. If the market price of a bond falls, its yield
rises and vice versa.
The interest rate the bond pays - called the 'coupon' - relates to its
nominal value: for example, Treasury 7pc 2001 will pay Pounds 7 for every
Pounds 100 nominal of stock every year until it is repaid in the year 2001.
In the middle of this week, the price of this gilt was Pounds 92 13/32 , and
the current yield was 7.58 per cent. But the redemption yield was higher -
8.47 per cent, because anyone holding it until it is repaid will make a
capital profit of over Pounds 7, and this is added to the annual income over
that period to calculate the redemption yield.
But what investors actually get from a bond may be reduced because they have
to pay tax on the income. The yield after deducting the tax due is called
the net yield.
It is comparatively easy to calculate net current yields. But calculating
net redemption yields is complicated, because any capital profit will not be
subject to tax whereas the interest will be.
This means that gilts which deliver a higher proportion of their total
return in the form of a capital gain tend to be more attractive for
higher-rate taxpayers. High-coupon gilts, which often look attractive if you
consider gross redemption yields (that is, without taking account of any tax
liability) , tend to be good value only for people who do not pay tax. The
FT prints a list of gilts which are good value for different types of
taxpayer every week.
Yields on shares are based on the annual dividend the company pays: hence
the term 'dividend yield'. Since dividend payments can rise or fall, and
since shares do not normally have a fixed repayment date, there is no
equivalent of a redemption yield. Dividend yields can be historic (that is,
based on what a company has actually paid recently) or prospective (based on
what it is expected to pay).
Unit and investment trusts that target income-oriented investors are prone
to use various devices to get as high a yield as possible. Many of these
devices are likely to hamper capital growth or actually eat into the
investor's capital. They include charging management costs against capital,
rather than income; investing in shares whose high yield is a sign of their
poor growth prospects; and using derivatives to enhance the yield.
If you are thinking of buying a share or trust offering an abnormally high
yield, always check how it manages to get that yield before investing.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Travel: Bowls of yak stew on the lost horizon - Anything
seemed possible when Mark Hodson decided to walk to the Chinese border from
northern Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the radiator hose blew, we abandoned the car and started to walk to the
Chinese border. Beside the road, sheer granite cliffs rose to a cloudless
sky.
On the other side of the gorge were vast scree slopes and, beyond those,
jagged, snow-capped peaks. We took giant strides, sucking in the sharp
mountain air. It felt good to stretch our legs after driving for two long
days up the Karakoram Highway into the remote highlands of northern
Pakistan.
Below, the River Indus roared. On the facing bank, high above the water
line, a rough track had been partly obliterated by rock falls: the original
Silk Road.
'How far is it to China?' I asked my guide Mr Altaf.
'About 150 miles,' he replied.
A brightly-painted transit van thundered past, a dozen men clinging to the
roof and rear door.
'Think we'll make it?' I asked. 'No problem,' he smiled.
We would not have been the first. Long before the Highway was laid in the
1960s and 1970s, opening the region to trucks and tour buses, Chinese
pilgrims came this way to visit Buddhist sites in the Lower Indus Valley.
The journey, by foot, would have taken months, even years. That morning at
Chilas, we had seen rock carvings made by pilgrims 1,800 years earlier.
Chilas is in wild country. The people there are strict Sunni Moslems who
have been fighting bloody family feuds for more than 500 years. Some have
forgotten the original cause of the disputes, yet still they live in houses
without windows in case an enemy creeps up at night to shoot them in their
sleep.
The Chilasis kill at the slightest provocation, and government troops had to
move in a few years back when local tribesmen bumped off some Chinese road
workers merely for eating lunch during Ramadan.
As we drove past, the men glared with cold, dark eyes and tucked their bushy
beards into upturned collars. Their faces were not unlike the terrain:
rugged, hard, unforgiving. Changing tack, I smiled and waved at the next
group and each saluted me with a broad grin.
In summer, when the snow melts on the peaks of the Karakorams, the water
level of the Indus rises by as much as 40ft. In winter, it falls to reveal
banks of fine, white sand that is scattered by the wind to form perfect
rippled dunes beside the road and even up the sides of hills. The effect is
startling, like a desert at 4,000ft.
Fertile plateaus along the valley were embroidered with fields of wheat and
corn. Shepherds kept goats and cattle and criss-crossed the river on shaky
suspension bridges. We passed hot sulphur springs and a bleak village called
Gunar Farm where men stood around in thick jackets and flat woollen caps as
if waiting for something to happen. On the edge of town was a police
garrison built like a fortress and, on the main street, a bright red pillar
box.
The skyline was dominated by Nanga Parbat. It is 26,660ft, the ninth highest
peak in the world and is getting bigger. It is rising by a  1/4 in a year
because of the confluence of the Earth's plates. Climbers call it Killer
Mountain and at least 62 have died on its slopes. Four great mountain ranges
 -the Himalayas, Karakoram, Hindu Kush and Pamir  - converge in Pakistan to
form a formidable pile of statistics: the world's second highest mountain
(K2), the longest glaciers outside the polar regions, the most peaks above
25,00ft and so on. I might venture one more: most spectacular scenery
visible from the back seat of a Honda Civic.
By midday, we reached the regional capital, Gilgit, a den of smugglers, gem
dealers and shoe salesmen. The bazaar crackled with the sounds of Tajiks,
Ismailis, Pathans and Kashmiris haggling over Afghan cigarettes, secondhand
jackets and Chinese digital watches. Anything seemed possible there,
including a Mk1 Ford Cortina with furry steering wheel and curtains in the
back window.
A crowd jostled around a medicine man from Peshawar who waved his arms and
promised herbal remedies for every disease. Eyes glanced up as a Chinese
woman, conspicuous without a veil, sauntered past in a black trouser suit
and slippers.
Local tensions between Sunni and Shia Moslems sometimes explode on to the
streets of Gilgit and the town was crawling with police and soldiers. It was
not a place to hang around unless you had a room at the Aga Khan's opulent
Serena Hotel. After a stodgy lunch at the Tajikistan Inn, we followed the
Karakoram Highway into the Hunza Valley, which was where the car broke down
and we started to walk.
After two or three miles we stopped at a break in a dry stone wall and
beyond it saw a garden of Eden. Beneath apricot trees and mulberry bushes
lay a terraced lawn so perfectly trimmed that you could have played croquet.
There were willows and walnuts, a single apple tree and a young woman
washing clothes under a waterfall.
The village was called Rahimabad, just a dot on the map with a headcount in
the hundreds, yet it was worth a thousand dusty cities. Marigolds and
weeping willows had been planted along the main road where five or six shops
sold apples, almonds and dried apricots.
As I stood there, jotting superlatives in a notebook, the storekeepers
appeared to eye me with sadness and suspicion, as if I were some government
inspector come to abolish all this perfection.
There was a food joint there, the 'Hassan Shan Hotal and Restourent', where
we had tea and shook hands with everyone while we waited for the car to be
fixed. 'You think this place is nice?' said Mr Altaf. 'Wait and see what
comes next.' We were on our way to Shangri-la.
The Hunza Valley got prettier at every turn: snowy peaks, fruit drying on
the flat roofs of stone cottages, magpies swooping between the juniper trees
and patchwork fields perched on top of sheer cliffs.
Rock slides were a persistent nuisance and several times we had to swerve
around huge boulders, as if the mountains were trying to reclaim the road.
By the time we reached our stopover at Karimabad, it was dark and cold and
the electricity was down.
Sunrise revealed the town's heart-stopping location, notched into the side
of a rock face and surrounded by four towering peaks, all over 24,500ft. The
slopes were terraced with stone walls and planted with corn, vegetables and
fruit trees. There were wild flowers and children laughing and the leaves of
the poplars were starting to turn red. Even cynics could believe that this
was the inspiration for the Shangri-la of James Hilton's novel Lost Horizon.
Many in Karimabad originate in central Asia and have pale skin and blue
eyes. They smiled easily, wished me good morning and offered directions. I
was heading for the Ultar Glacier, a fierce climb that I eventually
abandoned after three hours. It was an odd experience standing in a steep
gorge with the sun beating down and snowflakes falling, not knowing whether
to feel hot or cold, or whether to keep going or turn back. I was told later
that the glacier leads up to two peaks, neither of which has been climbed.
The route north became increasingly desolate and, in a sense, more
beautiful. Wide glaciers reached down to the roadside like rivers of molten
candle wax. All around, the mountains seemed to be closing in. The last real
town was Sust at 9,750ft where we stopped at a truckers' diner and ate bowls
of yak stew which tasted quite good, like beef but with more fat.
As we stepped out, in the bright sunlight, we came face to face with a yak
tethered to a rock. It was looking at us with sad, accusing eyes. 'You know,
at the top of the mountains they eat all the beautiful flowers,' said Mr
Altaf, which made me feel a lot better.
After Sust, we were waved through half a dozen checkpoints, then crossed
into the Khunjerab National Park where a game warden looked over the car for
hunting rifles. On the roof of his windowless hut were the horned skulls of
an ibex and the endangered Marco Polo sheep.
From there on, the road narrowed again and threatened to disappear
altogether in an assault course of potholes and deep craters. Army engineers
were trying to keep it open using bulldozers and shovels, but winter was
advancing and it was a battle they could never win.
The final stretch sliced through a deep valley then up, past the snow line,
around a series of hairpin bends and on to the Khunjerab Pass. The road
there is said to be the world's highest at 16,000ft and a chill wind blew
across from China making the air unspeakably cold.
There was little to acknowledge our achievement, just a single barrier, a
sentry box and a lone border guard, the last man in Pakistan, who stood in
silence clapping his gloved hands and stamping his boots.
Arrival should have warranted some sense of elation but my head throbbed, I
felt giddy and breathless and my eyes blinked icy tears. After a couple of
minutes I returned to the car and we turned around to head home. On the way
down, Mr Altaf pointed to a herd of 50 or 60 yaks grazing beneath a
marble-white glacier. 'You see, there are no beautiful flowers left,' he
said, and I realised I was beginning to feel hungry again.
Mark Hodson was a guest of Pakistan International Airlines (071-734 5544)
and Cox &amp; Kings (071-873 5000). Its next 16-day tour of northern Pakistan
goes out on April 13 1995. It includes overnight stops at Chilas, Gilgit and
the Hunza Valley, and costs Pounds 1,745.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): An hour with a lawyer, or do
it yourself - Wills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Victorian times, will-writing was one of the great pleasures of old age.
Merely the threat of leaving a child, grandchild, nephew or niece out of
one's will was enough to guarantee devoted attention - at least temporarily.
Sadly, the art of creative will-writing seems largely to have died out. Now,
only a third of Britons has a valid will, but with the spread of home
ownership and complicated family relationships, this can cause trouble.
Wills these days do not have to be gothic structures designed to reward or
punish relatives for their actions during your lifetime. They can be simple
affairs, involving an hour or so in a lawyer's office, to make sure that
your property is passed on to those family members who need it most, and
that no unnecessary tax is due.
A will also allows you to make guardianship arrangements for your children
if both parents should die, appoint executors of your estate, specify any
gifts of small items, and say what kind of funeral you want.
Making a will is a good idea for everyone, but it is particularly important
for certain groups of people:
Unmarried couples - under current laws, an unmarried partner has no right to
inherit anything.
Parents with children from more than one marriage, or stepchildren to whom
they would like to leave something.
Owners of investments and property (including their home) worth more than
the current inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 154,000.
Anyone with dependants who have special needs, such as incapacitated elderly
parents or handicapped children: particular provision must be made for them.
A will should be reviewed regularly every few years, but particularly if you
have recently married, separated, divorced, acquired children or
grandchildren, or experienced a significant change in your financial
circumstances.
Making a will is not expensive - but dying without one can be. A simple will
should cost about Pounds 50; expect to pay more if you need trust
arrangements or other more complicated services.
Who should write it for you? The obvious choice is a solicitor - most local
firms will have drawn up hundreds of wills and can deal with most requests.
Ask family and friends for recommendations if you do not have a solicitor.
There are many will-writing services which offer to draw up a will for less
than a solicitor would charge. However, no qualifications are necessary to
run this kind of service, and training is sometimes rudimentary - so using a
qualified lawyer is generally safer. Do-it-yourself forms from stationers
are the cheapest method, but cannot cope with anything but the simplest
circumstances. And it is only too easy to make mistakes which may not be
discovered until after your death.
Banks, building societies and insurance companies sometimes also offer
will-writing services, but these can be accompanied by a hard sell for life
assurance, or pressure to name the bank as executor of the will, which can
prove extremely expensive.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (23): Take a stake in unlisted
companies - Venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you don't want to start a business yourself, there are at least four ways
to take a stake in a private or unlisted company.
The least direct way is to buy shares in an investment trust which invests
in unquoted companies. The largest is 3i, the development capital group that
floated in June and is now an FT-SE 100 stock and the country's biggest
investment trust. Invested in more than 3,400 UK companies, 3i has a
portfolio that represents a cross-section of the smaller-company sector. But
there are 21 other investment trusts, including Candover, the longest
established, although liquidity in these shares is considerably less than in
3i.
Venture capital investment trusts. After a year of consultation, the
chancellor has just announced details of this new vehicle. The extent of the
tax advantages has pleasantly surprised the venture capital industry. The
new trusts will be similar to personal equity plans in tax treatment -
capital gains and dividends will be free of tax. But the front-end relief is
what has excited most intermediaries. Investors will receive a 20 per cent
income tax relief on the purchase of the trust shares. But they will also be
able to defer capital gains tax liability (a maximum rate of 40 per cent) on
the sale of almost any class of assets, bringing the total break to a
maximum of 60 per cent.
Existing venture capital companies are likely to emerge as the main sponsors
of the new VCITs. 3i, which currently has the largest network of regional
offices, is considering launching one.
The VCITs cannot invest more than Pounds 1m in any one investment, and
private investors will be limited to a Pounds 100,000 investment in VCITs in
any year.
Moving further up the scale of risk is investment through an Enterprise
Investment Scheme. Last December, this replaced the discredited Business
Expansion Scheme, which had been hijacked by sponsors pushing secure
assured-tenancy property-based schemes.
The new EIS scheme is much closer to early BES schemes, except that the tax
breaks are smaller. Investors receive 20 per cent up-front relief on their
investment - compared with marginal relief of 40 per cent in the last days
of the BES. And the investments must be in trading - not property-based -
companies.
Because of the relatively low front-end tax relief, sponsors have brought
few schemes to the investing public. Almost none of those they have launched
have raised the targeted amount.
Private investors who are more interested in the underlying business than in
tax breaks are, however, slowly increasing their use of the scheme,
intermediaries say.
The EIS scheme is unlikely to be widely used by business angels. They will
tend to structure their investments with as much redeemable loan stock as
possible and as little pure equity.
Investors can also avail themselves of the latest changes in capital gains
tax roll-over relief, introduced in the November 1993 budget. This allows
investors to shelter capital gains made on almost any class of asset if
those gains - not the original capital - are invested in private trading
companies. Unlike the EIS and VCIT schemes, investors can shelter an
unlimited amount of gains in this way, effectively securing an interest-free
loan from the Inland Revenue. In the 1994 budget, the Chancellor extended
the roll-over relief to investments made in EIS schemes.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Travel: Tranquillity and calm in an old imperial city - The
shores of Lake Constance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not unusual to find a bible by your bedside in a hotel bedroom, but at
the Rega Park Hotel, in Constance in southern Germany, there was a little
paperback book.
'Dear Reader,' writes hotel manager Karl Heinz Reinheimer in the preface, 'a
hotel is more than just a place to spend the night - it is also a cultural
setting. This claim is one we feel obliged to honour.' And he does it with
this little book of short stories in German and English which he says, in a
PS, he would be happy for us to keep as a souvenir of our stay.
I could not find Herr Reinheimer to congratulate him on his original idea as
well as on his tranquilly furnished and calm hotel, where the only sounds
from my bedroom were the birds in the garden below, a stone's throw from the
shores of Lake Constance.
There cannot be many lakes in the world from which you can safely drink the
water, but this is one of them. In the 1960s a journalist decried its
polluted state and everyone woke up to the fact that something had to be
done. It was. DM2m were spent cleaning it and now the water is not only
drinkable, but home to 35 different types of fish.
Bordered by Switzerland and Austria, the lake is the largest in Germany. The
Rhine flows into the south-east corner (where Switzerland and Austria meet),
and old Imperial cities, castles and monasteries cluster around its shores,
the Swiss Alps glittering in the distance. There are wine and fish
festivals, a Nightgown Carnival where children process through the streets
in nightcaps and long gowns, and at Bregenz, on the eastern tip, opera is
produced on the largest lake-stage in the world.
The biggest town on the lake and the only German one on the south shore is
Constance, a city with medieval buildings, a 19th century lakeside
promenade, and statues depicting the city's legends in just about every
corner. Cyclists have their own lanes and 300,000 a year travel the route
around the lake.
In the early 15th century the historic Council of Constance was held here
and made it the only town in Germany to have elected a pope. In the second
world war, it escaped allied bombing by keeping its lights on at night so
that British and American pilots could not tell if they were flying over
Switzerland or Germany.
Ralf Seuffert, a city guide, told me there were 55,000 registered boats on
the lake - people buy boats instead of cars, he said. Today, there is a
conflict of interests between environmentalists and motor yacht owners, and
as everything has to be discussed between three countries agreement is hard
to reach.
The people of Constance seem to have a relaxed attitude to life, but their
dialect is one even North Germans have difficulty understanding. 'At first
you may think they're not very gentle, maybe angry,' said Ralf. 'In fact
they're just shy and when they open themselves up they're very cordial. They
like to sit by the lake, chat a little, be comfortable and take life
easily.'
The city's history is illustrated in the cloisters of the Steigenberg
Inselhotel, a former Dominican monastery. Here, wall paintings show how the
town was ruled in turn by bishops and merchants, became part of Austria, was
stripped of its privileges by the Austrian Emperor for wanting to be part of
Switzerland and then, thanks to Napoleon, became a Baden town. Count
Zeppelin was born here in 1838, but made his airships in Friedrichshafen on
the other side of the lake.
A controversial memorial to the Count stands by the harbour - its critics
claiming it was not martial enough. Another statue, commissioned last year
by the State Railway, has been equally controversial and officials kept it
secret before putting it up one dark night at the harbour's edge.
It is a revolving, well-endowed lady with a pope in one hand, a king in the
other, and commemorates the 700 prostitutes employed during the Council of
Constance to keep visitors happy.
Just over a mile from the Austrian border, in the south-east corner of the
lake, is the pretty island town of Lindau, linked to the mainland by a
210-yard causeway. A Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th
century, it is a bustling holiday resort with tiny specialist shops;
narrow-fronted (there was a tax on the width of a building), pastel-coloured
half-timbered houses, boats chugging in and out of the harbour, a 15th
century town hall with exuberant frescoes, markets, cafes, and flowers
everywhere.
A puzzling thing about the lake-side town of Meersburg is that, according to
the local tourist board, 1.5m tourists a year pour in for a day, but few
stay the night although there are 2,000 beds to choose from.
It is strange because it is a delightful place, built on a steeply wooded
hill. Its immaculate cream-walled, dark red-timbered houses are perfectly
preserved. There is an upper and lower town, cafes along the water's edge,
dancing on the lakeside terrace of Strandhotel Wilder Mann, and the oldest
inhabited castle in Germany.
The 18th century pink and white palace, with a resplendent Hall of Mirrors
and wrought iron staircase, houses a Dornier aircraft museum, one of nine
museums in the town. One of them, a wine museum, was the home of Dr Franz
Mesmer, pioneer of hypnotism (mesmerism), who lived here in the early 19th
century.
The two islands on the lake are a celebration of flowers and vegetables.
Car-free Mainau, four miles from Constance and linked by a causeway to the
shore, was originally owned by 13th century Teutonic knights.
In this century it was given by Prince Wilhelm of Sweden to his son Count
Lennart Bernadotte, now 84, who has transformed it from the wilderness it
had fallen into, to a place of exotic beauty where you can see banana and
citrus trees in a greenhouse which is dismantled in summer, a Palm House
with 1,200 orchids, animal flower statues, and in 16 different gardens,
millions of tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, rhododendrons and roses.
Although the island of Reichenau, three miles long and also linked by a
causeway, was once a religious and cultural centre, it is now known as The
Vegetable Island. On a summer day more than 1,000 sprinklers turn it into an
island of fountains. It produces 18,000 tons of vegetables a year, including
8m cucumbers.
Information: I was a guest of the German Tourist Board, Lufthansa and German
Rail. You can fly to Frankfurt and take the train to Constance or the
nearest airport is Zurich, in Switzerland, 40 miles away.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Travel: Getting lost in Gotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS EALES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedes go to Gotland to get lost. Although the ancient Baltic island belongs
to Sweden, Gotland is as Swedish as Wales is English. Stone-agers founded
the limestone outcrop 7,000 years ago and mainlanders have been turning up
there ever since.
Visby, the only city on the island, has an airport but I got there by ferry,
five hours south-east of the Stockholm archipelago.
High stone walls and towers built by wealthy merchants 600 years ago when
Gotland was an independent republic ring the city centre. Once there were
monasteries but a greedy Royal, King Valdemart Atterdag of Denmark torched
them in the 14th century when he plundered the city. Legend says a virgin
let him in the city gates. Afterwards locals buried her alive in one of the
city walls where, apparently, she is still heard wailing.
Visby is hardly a dead place, however. This is Sweden's wild side and they
act out Atterdag's conquest every August during a week of medieval revelry.
The tourist board put me up for a night in the Wisby Hotel which is the
place to stay if you have loads of money and don't mind bumping into an
American or a pillar.
I toured Gotland in a hired car with Robert, a local journalist and film
maker. He did not want to hang around in Visby and suggested we leave the
island.
The northern-most region of Gotland is a separate island, Faro - and Faro
means sheep. Driving off the car ferry I saw a desolate landscape of low
winding walls marking feudal boundaries. Among the heather are tiny stone
huts with wooded roofs in which to store wool and hay.
The sheep on Faro do not live alone. Their neighbours include vital military
secrets. Tread carefully. Army patrols check passports. Foreigners who step
out of line and into prohibited zones risk heavy fines and prison sentences.
You could be deported.
Travelling vaguely north on hot, narrow, empty roads, a red dot appeared in
the distance. It was a three-wheeled moped and its driver, John Ollson, a
local carpenter, was going to work. As well as Swedish, John spoke an
ancient Gotland dialect, similar to Icelandic. We sat and chatted on a
nearby beach among dramatic towers of limestone. These rocks have been
naturally sculpted into peculiar shapes and can be found on many beaches.
We left Faro for Katthanmaarsvik, a former fishing village on the east tip
of Gotland where international fashion magazines photograph their models and
dress up locals as fishermen.
Admiral Bodisco led an earlier invasion, in 1808, by a Russian fleet. Four
of Bodisco's sailors liked the place so much they deserted there. One hid in
a cupboard above a blacksmith's oven. Days later Bodisco discovered him,
cooked to death.
The oven is part of an ancient restoration at the Kalkpatronsgarden Borgvik
Pensionat and Restaurant by owner Bjorn Hakansson. Happily, it is not the
same oven Bjorn uses to cook dinner for his guests.
We found our place to get lost in Burs, a parish in south west Gotland, some
40 minutes drive from Visby. Among forests and meadows we came across Iwona
Hrynclenko, an artist who weaves tapestries. Many artists and craftspeople
live and work on Gotland. We helped a film student construct her home for
the summer. A farmer let her cut down 15 pines as poles for her tepee.
Swedish law allows you to pitch your tent or tepee on any public land.
Outside the tepee we ate a superb feast of pickled herring with new
potatoes, chives, sour cream and strawberries. We drank schnapps until a
pink sky sank into the sea, beyond our shiny new hired car.
My trip to Gotland was arranged by the Swedish Travel and Tourism Council,
73 Welbeck Street, London W1 8AN. Tel: 071-487 3135/6.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): A new Aim for the small
company - Unlisted Securities Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Unlisted Securities Market is scheduled to be put to rest at the end of
1996, and from the end of this year no new companies will be listed on it.
So what is an investor in smaller companies to do?
The USM was launched in 1981, largely in response to growing interest in
so-called over-the-counter stocks which were too small or too new to meet
the requirements of the London Stock Exchange's official list. And while it
enjoyed a surge of popularity in the mid- and late 1980s, trading trickled
to a virtual standstill as the recession began to eat its way through the
fortunes of smaller companies.
The decision to close the USM reflects the near-abandonment of the market by
both investors and listees, although, quite clearly, investors still want a
place where they can buy the shares of the smallest companies.
The current debate about what should replace the USM centres on two key
considerations. First, what is the desired level of investor protection
necessary to ensure a healthy market in small-company shares? And second,
what sort of exchange is most likely to stimulate investor interest in this
sector through good times and bad?
The London Stock Exchange thinks it has the answer. First, it has already
made several key changes to its official list, to make it easier for
biotechnology and healthcare companies to join. And second, it has proposed
an Alternative Investment Market (AIM), to list the shares of companies that
are either too small or whose shares are not traded widely enough to qualify
for the official list.
Whether the AIM will satisfy those who want to buy small-company shares
remains to be seen. For one thing, it is not clear that the tax advantages
available to those who have bought USM-listed shares - their inheritance tax
liability is reduced by 50 per cent - will be available.
Also, it would be up to investors to assess their own comfort with looser
regulation. The Stock Exchange has proposed that looser listing requirements
shall apply to this category of company; and no minimum threshold is
envisaged for length-of-trading record, market capitalisation or the
percentage of shares in public hands.
Moreover, it proposes that companies seeking a listing on the AIM shall not
be required to have a sponsor, charged with ensuring that due diligence has
been taken in preparing documentation for listing.
Mr David Jones, chairman of Sharelink, a share-dealing service for private
clients, argues that, as long as investors are fully aware of the risks they
are taking, they do not need excessive protection. 'What private investors
like is clarity,' he says. 'The proposition that you need lots of regulation
to encourage them is untested.'
However, others argue that investor protection is crucial to encourage
private investors to buy small-company shares, and that, moreover, such
shares need an exchange specifically devoted to promoting interest in the
sector. To this end, a group of European venture capitalists, the Paris
Bourse and the US-based Nasdaq stock market have announced plans for a new
pan-European market for small-company shares.
The market, intended to begin operation by late 1995, will allow investors
to buy shares in small companies across Europe. Regulation will be much
closer to that prevailing on Nasdaq; and companies will be required to have
an investment-banking sponsor and to report market-sensitive information
regularly.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (21): When family money needs
protection - Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do people set up trusts? The reasons are as varied as people, but the
three most common reasons are:
To ensure that the family wealth continues to be properly managed after the
individual's death: The people to whom you may wish to leave your wealth may
not be best able to manage it. They may be financially immature, financially
illiterate - or you just don't trust them to leave enough for the next
generation.
A trust set up by your will, to take effect on your death, can appoint
people in whom you have confidence as your trustees to manage your money
after your death, and preserve your wealth for the benefit of those whom you
wish to inherit your money.
To ensure that the family wealth does not find its way into the wrong hands:
It is not uncommon for a family to include children from previous marriages.
If you die and leave your wealth to your spouse, unless you leave it in
trust you cannot be sure that she will leave your money for your children.
Even if you do not have children from previous marriages, if you die young
your wife may have further children from subsequent marriages whom you may
not wish to benefit.
Again, you may be tempted to set up a trust in your will, to ensure that
your wealth is directed where you want it to go. A will is not the only time
when people make a trust to ensure that the family wealth does not find its
way into the wrong hands. Parents sometimes wish to provide for their
children before their death, but do not wish to give them the money
outright. They may not want their children to have too much money too soon.
A trust is a good way of putting restrictions on the wealth you wish to give
to your children.
For tax reasons: Even though you and your spouse are the trustees of a
trust, and the trust money is in your name, the trust fund will not be taxed
as your money. It is taxed as the trust's money. The rate at which the trust
money is taxed depends on the type of trust and the relationship between you
(the settlor) and the beneficiaries. As a rule of thumb, if you wish to be a
beneficiary of your own trust (and you do not fall within the special class
of non UK domiciliaries) the trust has no tax advantages whatsoever. For
this reason, tax planning is only for the rich - that is, for those who can
afford to give it away.
Assuming you are within this category, tax mitigation is possible, through
the use of trusts for all the three main direct taxes - that is, income tax,
capital gains tax and inheritance tax. For example, a trust set up for your
children can pay CGT at a rate of 25 per cent, rather than your rate of 40
per cent. Further, if you live seven years after funding the trust, no
inheritance tax is payable on the trust assets on your death.
A trust for your children is not, however, very effective in mitigating
income tax while your children are under the age of 18. This is not true of
trusts set up for grandchildren, in which case income tax can be saved as
well as capital gains tax and inheritance tax.
It should be mentioned, however, that the advantageous position of trusts in
estate planning may not continue if we have a change of government.
Therefore, if you can afford to set up trusts for your children or
grandchildren and have not done so, it may be wise to do so while the tax
legislation remains favourable.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (20): Increases are still running
ahead of RPI - School-fee planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
Planning for school fees can be like shooting at a moving target. Despite
the traditions of many British public schools, none seems yet to have found
a way of capping its costs. Fees inflation has dipped slightly in recent
years, but still runs ahead of retail price inflation.
Various analyses of independent schools in recent years have made it clear
that you get what you pay for. Some of the most expensive boarding schools
still fared well in the FT's 'value-for-money' index of independent schools,
published last month, which compared schools' fees with their exam results,
with Eton finishing fifth. Eton is one of several boarding schools to have
raised its annual fees above Pounds 12,000 for the first time this year.
Multiply this figure by five, for the number of years your child will be at
secondary school, inflate it by around 10 per cent a year, take into account
any pre-prep and prep schools you may be thinking of, and the sum you will
require is at least comparable to the price of a house.
So how can the costs best be met? A recent rather drastic strategy saw the
actor Clive Francis selling his collection of the novelist Graham Greene's
first editions to help pay for his children's education. Greene was a friend
of the actor, and this was a considerable sacrifice.
Similar sacrifices may well be necessary for others, particularly if their
sights are set on a boarding school (day schools tend, on average, to be
only a third the price).
The financial services industry, spotting a growing market, now offers a
range of products specifically tied to school fees. Most of these are just
well-packaged ways of selling standard investment vehicles, such as
with-profits endowment policies or personal equity plans.
However, a few products are tied specifically to school fees, and offer
opportunities which would not be available in other financial plans.
These include educational trusts, offered by life offices, in which funds
can be invested tax-free, provided they are used to pay school fees - no
specific school or pupil need be named. Pay a fixed lump sum, and then the
trust guarantees a certain level of fees through a series of annuities
commencing at a certain point. But this can be expensive, as the guarantees
are costly to fund.
The trusts are tax-efficient to an extent, but advisers suggest they should
only be used for part of fees, and should be restricted to 40 per cent
taxpayers who have used up both their personal income tax allowances and
their annual capital gains tax allowance.
Loans, arranged by the Independent Schools Information Service *, also offer
a better deal than you can find elsewhere. Loans via either the Halifax
Building Society or Citibank are offered under the scheme, and can be drawn
down as and when you need to pay the fees - you do not need to take all the
money up front, as with a mortgage. No stipulations are made over how to
repay, so you are not tied to any particular investment vehicle. This should
also make for more efficient financial planning.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Food fit for the 90s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly three centuries ago a German art historian called Karl Friedrich von
Rumohr launched an attack on the elaborate cooking styles of the French
court.
He proposed that we return to the simplicity of the ancient Greeks and take
a keen look at the way food is prepared in Italy. Today we are all Rumohrs.
We talk of healthy eating or the Mediterranean diet. We have become so used
to talking about the latter that we are now convinced that such a thing
actually exists. There are now even Frenchmen north of the Loire who spurn
butter, cream and eggs and who cook their meals in a style more reminiscent
of Alice Waters than Escoffier.
A much-simplified view of Italy provides the new model. All those fiercely
independent regions are run together to create the ideal diet of the 1990s.
Much of Italy refuses to conform to the picture at all, but there is one
region which fits it exactly: Apulia.
Apulia deserves to be better known, and not just for the food. The only
visitors who come in bulk are members of the Club Mediterranee. I suspect
they are little driven by dietary considerations, nor do they stray far from
their forbidding-looking camps on the coast.
They miss out on the lovely old cities of Ostuni and Lecce with their
baroque churches, and the curious beehive dwellings around the towns of
Alberobello and Locorotondo.
Food is in the purest modern idiom: bunches of wrinkled tomatoes are
suspended from the rafters, drying, not so much in the sun as from the heat
of the kitchen; chillies add their fire to the pot; then there is garlic and
oregano, basil and rocket, and olive oil with simply everything. On the
coast you subsist on fish. Meat is scarce. Local pasta omits eggs while
vegetables assume a role all of their own: mostly aubergines, courgettes and
bell peppers generally dressed up with plenty of tomatoes.
How to handle these ingredients and to transform them into the sunny dishes
of Apulia is the message behind Susanna Gelmetti's Apulian Cookery Weeks.
These take place in May, June and September. In July and August it is simply
too hot and Susanna and her team move north to her other school in Umbria.
In Apulia she is assisted by Tonino Punzi, joint owner of the Borgo Antico
restaurant in the magnificent whitewashed-walled city of Ostuni.
The courses take place a few miles away from Ostuni in a lovely old
masseria, a noble farmhouse surrounded by venerable olive trees often many
centuries old.
The participants are lodged in two-room apartments created out of the fabric
of the old building while the courses are held in a temple-like building at
the end of a formal garden.
In the course of a week we learnt more than a dozen local dishes and one or
two that were not. A tiella di verdure al forno was a sort of layer cake of
southern vegetables bound together with gooey cheese and pancetta. A dish of
stuffed vegetables produced a different stuffing for each in order to
highlight the various flavours.
Mashed potatoes were transformed with chopped basil and olive oil. Broad
beans and wild rocket were blended into a rich emulsion with the consistency
of hummus. The similarity is hardly surprising with Greece just across the
Adriatic.
One of my favourites was stuffed mussels. We made the filling from soft
bread and Parmesan and garlic and baked them in the oven. We made pasta and
stuffed it with fish; rolled involtini from swordfish and veal. The latter
was stuffed with raisins and pine nuts: a recipe which derived something
from the North African coast, a few miles to the south.
We made a sort of Apulian cottage pie with lamb, potatoes and Parmesan
cheese and made plenty of cakes which went down well with the local passito
wines, and the sweet Primitivos, made from a close cousin of the Californian
Zinfandel.
Cookery weeks are also holidays and there was plenty to do besides cooking.
The coast is 10 minutes away, and mercifully untrammelled by sinister
holiday camps. Ostuni was 10 minutes in the opposite direction and little
excursions took us to both Lecce and Alberobello.
Nor did we feel cut off in the masseria. The house becomes a restaurant at
weekends and many important local functions are held there. After midnight
in particular, the place seems to spring to life as a host of curious
characters emerges and takes up positions around the tempietto.
Pietro the balladeer took a particular interest in Australian women (Devo
pizzicare Matilda]). Lilo, the night watchman, liked to mix himself a
midnight snack of acqua sala a mixture of dry bread, red onions, olive oil
and sea water, and just as nasty as it sounds.
The local carabinieri were also regular attendants at these nocturnal revels
along with a bevy of lesser players. I have not had such an enjoyable week
in years.
Information. Details are available from Susanna Gelmetti on 081-208 0112.
The price is Pounds 995 for the week inclusive of flights and full board and
lodging. Extras are Pounds 12 travel insurance and the price of a cheap meal
in Ostuni or Lecce.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Goldilocks and the coffee shop - An essential
part of south-east Asia street culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They called him Goldilocks, even though his head had not a hair on it and
shone like a newly-peeled onion. Goldilocks was the barman at the Vatican, a
corner coffee shop in Kuala Lumpur. Indians would come in and park their
ample backsides on the small wooden bar stools. 'Hey, Goldilocks,' they
would shout, heads wobbling and arms flailing the air. 'Give me a Johnny
Walker Black Label, on the rocks. Roger, over and out.'
Goldilocks, dressed always in a pair of baggy blue shorts and a white
singlet, would spring into action. His clogs would slap, slap, slap across
the greasy floor. He would pour the whisky while taking the top off a bottle
of beer and straining coffee through what looked like a bull's scrotum.
He would launch into a window-breaking shout for an order of chicken rice
from his brother at the far end of the room. He would reach up to pull down
a tin on a pulley and string, stuffing notes in, taking change out.
The Chinese-run corner coffee shop is a central part of south-east Asia
street culture. Those without taste and the nouveau riche might rendezvous
in hotel lobbies - but real people meet, do business, drink and eat at the
coffee shop.
The traditional lay-out is simple enough. At the entrance, on the left-hand
side, is a battered old desk with jars of pickled ginger and sweets on it.
Behind it sits the towkay, or boss man of the establishment.
He, like everyone there, has a singlet and blue shorts. He might be scraping
the soles of his feet or cleaning his ear with what looks like a miniature
chimney brush. He watches every move in the place.
Occasionally, he launches into a demonstrative clearing of his passages,
making expert use of a nearby spittoon. Every so often, he opens a drawer
and counts through wads of banknotes, his abacus clicking away.
You go to a table. These are marble, with bentwood chairs ranged round them.
Immediately, someone takes your order. It is never written down but shouted,
at a fearsome pitch, across the room. Those new to the experience have been
known to fall off their chairs in shock.
A number of stalls are littered round the place. On one side, a lady with
weight-lifter legs works at a giant, flaming wok, turning out plate after
plate of noodles. One order is finished. The wok is scrubbed with a bamboo
brush and water. Oil is heated, garlic and spices thrown in. The noodles
follow, an egg is cracked and, all in one lyrical movement, the shell lands
expertly in a far-away slops bucket.
The Americans might think they invented fast food. The Chinese have been
doing it for hundreds of years.
At the other side a small man, with slicked-down hair and a cigarette
dangling from his lip, lifts a cooked chicken from a hook. The Chinese
cannot understand the western predilection for carving meat off the bone.
A cleaver chops down the bird, from backside to neck. Each side is split
again. Then, while taking three orders and carrying on a conversation with a
friend about last weekend's horse racing, the cleaver jumps at lightning
speed, cutting portions which are swept on to plates, along with a helping
of chilli, for chicken rice.
A separate waiter takes orders for drinks. Home-made barley water is a
favourite - served hot to balance what is going on internally with the
steamy outside temperature. Coffee is served in thick, chipped cups. The
aficionado pours the contents into the saucer to let it cool, then slurps
away like a contented cat.
Pause to listen and the sound is devastating. The hiss of noodles being
sucked into a hundred mouths. Kids screaming, food orders being fired off
like machine-gun bullets, trucks and buses hooting past outside.
The toilet is out at the back, through the kitchen area. You notice grandma
sitting in a corner, taking the roots off a bucketful of bean sprouts while
rocking a baby swinging from the ceiling in a sling. Sons and daughters
crouch over basins full of washing up. An old man is mending the chain on
his bicycle.
Corner coffee shops might be rough and ready - but they are cheap. A decent
lunch costs about Dollars 1.50.
South-east Asia is developing faster than any other region in the world. The
hammer of progress is flattening many of the older coffee shops, turning
them into multi-storey car parks or shopping complexes.
Coffee shops in Singapore have been refurbished and air-conditioned.
Cleanliness has replaced character. No old men in shorts and singlets there.
To appreciate real coffee-shop culture and food, go to Penang in Malaysia or
small towns like Ipoh, about three hours drive north of Kuala Lumpur. The
Kedai Kopi Kong Heng in Ipoh is one of the oldest such establishments in the
country, and one of the noisiest. People come from miles around to taste its
hor fan - a rice noodle served with thinly-sliced prawn and chicken.
The Vatican - no one knows how it came by its name - is still on the corner
in central Kuala Lumpur but Goldilocks is no more. He is probably serving
Black Label at the great coffee shop in the sky and listening to a voice
saying 'Roger, over and out.'
The Vatican: on the corner of Lebuh Pasar Besar and Jalan Hang Kasuri, Kuala
Lumpur; Kedai Kopi Kong Heng: on the corner of Jalan Leech and Jalan
Station, Ipoh.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More evidence, if it were needed, of supermarket power comes this week from
J. Sainsbury which is muscling in on the specialist cookery equipment and
delicatessen trade with new product ranges at keen prices.
Its new cookshops will sell everything from meat thermometers (Pounds 7.99)
and souffle dishes (6in Pounds 7.95) to saucepans (from Pounds 29.95) and
steamers (Pounds 19.95).
Kitchen equipment names include Le Creuset saucepans, Emile Henry ovenware
and Apilco white porcelain. Sainsbury is selling its own range of textiles
including aprons, tea towels and oven gloves.
Brochures giving the product range are available in the cookshops which have
opened in 11 stores, mostly in and around London. There are plans for
further expansion in the new year.
In its Special Selection foodstuffs range selected stores will be stocking
goods including: chilli and garlic olive oil (350 ml, Pounds 6.50), truffle
oil (250ml, Pounds 6.75), aged balsamic vinegar (Pounds 14.95), Cipriani
pasta (egg tagliolini is delicious at Pounds 2.50 for 250 grams), carnaroli
rice (500g, Pounds 1.50), and dried fruits ranging from blueberries (125g,
Pounds 2.45) to Medjool dates (125g, Pounds 2.75).
If Sainsbury has found the right combination of price and quality your
friendly, corner shop deli has serious cause for concern.
Visitors to the Geffrye Museum in east London from December 8-10 will be
able to sample wartime food treats at a Christmas party set in the 1940s.
The museum, which specialises in the history of the English domestic
interior, welcomes guests with mulled wine and, after a candlelit tour of
the period rooms, invites them to join in a celebration set in the final
months of the second world war.
Period morsels will include carrot cookies, potato floddies, prune roly
(sic) and sticky gingerbread. Tickets (Pounds 23, in advance only) from The
Geffrye Museum, Kingsland Road, London E2. Tel: 071-739 9893.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The signature of a 'film star' chef - Giles
MacDonogh meets Sirio Maccioni, a cook who has remained true to his Tuscan
origins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chefs will not sit still in their kitchens any more. Every month some
luminary of the profession flies in, while another flies out. Often they do
more harm to their reputations than good: it takes a while to get used to a
strange kitchen, a different brigade and the products of a different market.
Occasionally their appearances have a fraudulent side, such as the visit by
an Austrian chef who went home after the press preview leaving a monolingual
skivvy to cope with a kitchen full of Pakistani chefs.
Last week it was the turn of Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque, New York's
most chi-chi restaurant, to visit London.
He did not come alone. He brought Sylvain Portay, his chef, Sottha Khunn,
his Cambodian chef de cuisine who has been described as the restaurant's
'secret weapon', and the pastry chef Jacques Torres. Anything they lacked in
the way of culinary muscle was provided by Paul Gayler and his team at the
Lanesborough hotel, on Hyde Park Corner.
For a week, diners there could enjoy some of the three-star restaurant's
signature dishes, such as the delicious, if simple, paupiette of sea bass
wrapped in thin slices of potato and served on a reduction of Barolo wine;
or the ostentatious (very New York) ravioli of foie gras thickly scattered
with bite-size pieces of truffle; or the amazing desserts, one of which
takes the form of an edible kitchen stove; or the creme brulee, which now
figures on the menu of Paul Bocuse's restaurant in Lyon.
Possibly even more delightful than the food was Sirio Maccioni, a man who
has travelled a long way from his origins in the Tuscan spa town of
Montecatini. Montecatini was useful to Maccioni in two ways: firstly, it was
at the height of its reputation as a spa when he was a child, and the great
and good were often to be seen taking the waters there; secondly it was also
the birthplace of one Ivo Livi, a man who was rather better known under his
nom de guerre: Yves Montand.
Maccioni tells an amusing story of how Montand gained his French name. As a
child the young Ivo, or Yves, went to live in Marseille.
His grandmother, anxious that the boy should learn something of the language
of his new land, used to summon him upstairs with a cry of 'Yves, Montes]'
Montand, therefore became his name as he rose to pre-eminence as a French
singer and actor.
Montand was already a famous singer when Maccioni decided to leave home and
try his luck in the kitchens of Paris. Montand had told him to use his name
in his application to the Plaza Athenee Hotel, but Maccioni did not know
that his friend was not called Livi in France and was struck by the
indifference of the hotel manager at his interview. He was told he could
come back when he spoke French.
The ever-watchful Montand found him a job as a stage hand at the Folies
Bergeres where he met Edith Piaf and a bevy of dancing girls. Two weeks
later he returned in triumph to the Plaza Athenee.
French food was in its post-war doldrums when Maccioni started at the Plaza
Athenee. He remembers how the chef used to cook by the book: 'This sauce is
a little runny. Put some flour in it.'
From the Plaza Athenee Maccioni moved to Germany, then returned to Paris and
Maxim. He was waiting for the chance to work in Britain. A restaurant in
Fleet Street had offered him the job of maitre d'hotel but the position was
not ready. Instead he went to New York and became maitre d'hotel at the
Colony, then the smartest restaurant in Manhattan.
Life magazine commented curtly: 'The new maitre d'hotel would be very good
if he could speak English.' Montecatini helped him once again: as he
surveyed the tables under his charge many of the faces were already familiar
to him from the spa. All his customers fought for the possession of the best
table. He put cards in his pocket: 'yes', 'no' to indicate to the likes of
Frank Sinatra, Onassis or Niarchos whether they were in luck that day.
Niarchos believed in getting his own way by the liberal distribution of
Dollars 100 bills. Occasionally even baffled members of the public were
tipped as he sailed out of the restaurant after a heavy lunch.
Frank Sinatra became a family friend. When Maccioni's first son was born,
Sinatra was at the hospital with a silver cup for the boy engraved with the
legend 'To Mario from Francis'.
In 1974 he opened Le Cirque, and has had the rare pleasure of seeing his New
York restaurant remain at the top of the fashionable tree for two decades.
Everyone wants Maccioni to be their friend. King Juan Carlos of Spain had
always told him: 'When you are in Spain give me a ring.' Once, when he
wanted tickets to the World Cup, he took him up on it. He was staying with
chef Roger Verge at the time, another friend from Paris days: 'There's
someone on the telephone for you. He says he's the King of Spain.'
Another old friend is Ronald Reagan. When he was elected president he rang
Maccioni: 'Here's Ron, are you coming to my inauguration?' Maccioni was
temporarily nonplussed: 'Yes, I come to your coronation.' There wasn't a
hotel room to be had, but Maccioni got a room and a driver, even if he
managed to sleep through breakfast at the White House.
In spite of his film-star status in the US, Maccioni has few illusions about
America. He throws up his hands at the squeamish way Americans respond to
fish or chicken heads, rabbits and other, unfamiliar foodstuffs. 'Make it
fashionable and they'll eat it,' he says.
He will not be swayed. On Tuesdays, diners are offered tripe, on Thursdays
bollito misto, on Fridays Italian fish soup. He remains resolutely European
and true to his origins in Montecatini. Asked why he employed no American
chefs, he replied: 'I didn't know there were any.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Tempting terrine - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I rather fancy the idea of giving foie gras terrine as a Christmas present
to a dozen special friends. Not sending one to each - you would need a big
win on the National Lottery to do that - but inviting them all to come and
share it under my roof.
At this alternative Christmas feast I would happily skip the turkey. The
terrine is luscious enough.
There would be salads and cheeses to follow, and fruits, nuts, sweetmeats
and mince pies for those with stamina.
And maybe the party would end by offering guests just before they depart
cups of steaming, intensively savoury consomme.
This used to be the practice in the early days of the motor car - a soothing
and admirably sensible 'one for the road'.
The recipe which follows comes from Shaun Hill's Gidleigh Park Cookery Book
(Century Pounds 15.99), one of my favourite books by a chef.
Hill left Gidleigh Park last summer and is now in the final stages of
putting together his own restaurant with rooms. The Merchant House, Lower
Corve Street, Ludlow, Shropshire SY8 1DU (tel and fax: 0584-875438) should
open its doors in time to celebrate the New Year.
As Hill points out, success in this dish depends on careful preparation: the
cooking is easy.
It will concentrate the mind wonderfully, he suggests, if you keep the
receipts for the ingredients in front of you as you work. Carelessness will
prove extremely expensive.
TERRINE OF DUCK FOIE GRAS (serves 12 - very generously I would say)
Three duck foie gras (total weight about 4lb); 5 fl oz port; 2 1/2 fl oz
Armagnac; 10 fl oz chicken consomme; salt, pepper and nutmeg.
As soon as you take the livers out of the fridge cut each one horizontally
into three or four slices. These livers have a high fat content, and become
very soft when not refrigerated. Leave them for about half an hour to warm
slowly to room temperature.
When soft, carefully pick out all nerves and veins, a messy job. Use your
fingertips to lift up the veins from the liver, and a sharp knife or
scissors to cut. Do not forget to take off the outer membrane and do not
hurry. This is a very important stage of the recipe. The more care you
exercise in cleaning the livers the better the terrine will be.
If the livers become so soft that they begin to collapse and are difficult
to de-vein easily, refrigerate them again briefly to firm them up a little
before completing the cleaning process.
Season each prepared slice liberally on both sides with salt, pepper and
nutmeg, and arrange them in layers in a terrine. A Le Creuset terrine
measuring 12in x 3in is ideal.
After each layer sprinkle with the Armagnac and port. Use decent port - a
10-year-old tawny is fine. Words like ruby or vintage character on the label
often mean nasty and coarse, and represent a false economy when you consider
the cost of the foie gras over which you are pouring it.
Cover and refrigerate the terrine for 6-8 hours or overnight. The livers
will absorb most of the port and brandy and become firm again.
Place the covered terrine in a roasting dish half-filled with cold water and
cook in the middle of an oven preheated to 300`F (150`C) gas mark 2 for 20
minutes. The liver will not look cooked at the end of this time, but it is.
If you cook it any longer you will end up with half the quantity of terrine
and pints of butter-like fat.
When it emerges from the oven, take the terrine out of the water bath and
spoon off any fat. Lay a plastic card or a couple of spatulas along the top
of the terrine and then weight with three 2oz weights. Put the terrine in a
cool larder and leave until completely cold and set firm.
At this stage the terrine can be unmoulded (save the spoonful or two of
juices that have collected in the dish). Wrap the terrine in food film and
foil and refrigerate it. It will keep for up to five days.
Several hours before you plan to serve the terrine, add the reserved juices
to the chicken consomme and boil until reduced by half. (Add a sheet of
gelatine if you are nervous that your consomme may not set to a firm jelly.)
Unwrap the terrine and return it to the container. Pour the reduced warm
consomme over it and chill until set. The liquid will jellify as it sets,
filling the gaps in the terrine and making it much easier to slice.
Turn out the terrine or serve it from the dish, slicing it with a sharp
knife that has been heated in boiling water then wiped dry. Serve with
toasted brioche.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The Lebanese wine might be interesting, sir -
Trends in restaurant wine lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If I were to venture an opinion on a future direction for the naming of
restaurants it would be this - that they will be called after their
enterprising sommelier or personable head wine waiter.
What, I hear you say, but we have just got used to meeting, eating and
drinking at Nico's, Marco's, Alastair Little's or Paul Heathcoate's.
I understand. But have you checked the bill when you've walked out of one of
these famous chef's establishments? Well you should - not to see whether it
has been added up correctly, but to see who has taken the most money off you
in your pursuit of gastronomic pleasure - the renowned chef or the anonymous
sommelier.
The answer, confirmed by a clutch of my own bills, is more than likely to be
the latter. This signifies a major shift over the past few years in the
relationship between, and relative importance, of the sommelier and the
chef.
The initial cause of this change was the recession. When it began to bite,
all sensible restaurants introduced fixed-price menus and adjusted downwards
the individual prices of their menu items. Yet, in spite of recession,
restaurants continued to open, competition increased and menu prices have
barely changed over the past three years.
This caused a sharp difference between food and wine prices, accentuated by
the fact that, as we have become more knowledgeable about wine, many find it
easier to impress with the wine list than the menu.
The expensive ingredients on any menu - truffles, oysters, caviar - are an
acquired taste. Many people do not not eat them because they do not like
them, an attitude that would not change even if someone else were paying.
But any lover of Chardonnay, used to drinking a restaurant's Pounds 15
offering from California or Australia, would not say no to an offer of a
bottle of white Burgundy from Coche-Dury or Niellon, at Pounds 50 to Pounds
60 a bottle.
And a top sommelier and an expensive bottle of red bordeaux, burgundy or
rhone bring with it their own theatre. Over the past decade chefs have
purposely, but short-sightedly, removed this element from the dining room by
plating all the food in the kitchen. But any order for a red wine that needs
decanting will turn the heads of other diners.
Over the past decade restaurants and wine bars have played an influential
role in the growing popularity of wine drinking: selling wines by the glass
to the neophyte wine drinker; popularising such dessert wines as Muscat de
Beaumes de Venise and converting people to the pleasures of wines from
California, New Zealand and Australia.
As well as adding glamour, the listing of several of the world's finest
wines on the list brings some financial security - a scarce commodity in the
restaurant world. Almost all a kitchen's ingredients need to be freshly
cooked. But fine wine appreciates in the bottle. The point is clearly made
by Barry Philips, proprietor of The White Horse, Chilgrove, West Sussex
(024-359219).
He says: 'As the top wines continue to escalate in value (due primarily to
Robert Parker and The Wine Spectator in America) it is easy to justify their
listing to the bank. They can be sold at auction or to the brokers at ever
higher prices. The cost of listing is purely the interest on the capital and
this is more than covered by their added value.'
Restaurants have become large customers for several wine merchants who have
seen their private customer business decline. Some merchants offer a service
to restaurant customers that includes not just the wines but assistance with
the writing of the list and staff training. To discover which wines
restaurants have been selling and what restaurateurs think we will be
drinking in 1995, I trawled five of the UK's finest wine lists:
Penhelig Arms, Aberdovey, Gwynedd, Wales. (0654-767215).
This seemed the logical place to start. A wine list created by the sheer
enthusiasm of its proprietor, Robert Hughes, in a hotel that has no business
accounts and where personal money is carefully spent. Hence, house champagne
at Pounds 3 a glass - a price not seen in London for some time.
Australia, especially Bailey's 1988 Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Rhone,
particularly wines from Seguret and Sablet, provided Hughes' customers with
their best value in 1994.
From Spain the white Murrieta and the red Contino were very popular. At a
recent tasting of red burgundy there was not much enjoyment among the guests
until it reached a cost price of Pounds 15 per bottle.
Petit chateaux clarets from 1989 and 1990 have been well received but this
is the place for claret lovers in 1995. Hughes will be listing several wines
of the lovely 1982 vintage - Malescot, Vieux Chateau Certan and Cissac -
from his own cellars.
The White Horse, Chilgrove, Sussex.
The 1995 Good Food Guide advises you to: 'Think of a wine, decide which
vintage, then ask for it. There is no need to look in the wine list, it is
almost bound to be there . . .'
Best selling wines are a Sauvignon de Touraine from France and a dry Blanc
de Noir from South Africa. Port and dessert wines by the glass are very
popular but the kitchen uses more liqueurs than are sold to customers. The
trend to New World wines continues with New Zealand whites, and Australian
and Chilean reds, the favourites.
Read's, Painter's Forstal, Near Faversham, Kent. 0795-535344.
A catholic range of wines has been in vogue this year: anything in half
bottle; champagne and port by the glass; New Zealand's Cloudy Bay Sauvignon
Blanc, which proprietor David Pitchford cannot buy enough of and Chateau
Musar 1981 from the Lebanon. Surprisingly popular have been Hamilton
Russell's Pinot Noir and Louisville Farms Chardonnay from South Africa.
In 1995 the Pitchfords - David cooks his wife Rona serves - will be looking
for good value wines from Chile, Argentina and southern France, convinced
that the French are waking up to competition at the lower end of the market.
Normandie, Elbut Lane, Birtle, Bury BL9 6LT. 061-764 3869.
A list, that proprietor Max Moussa explains, has no truck with wines 'in
vogue'. Max, and his sister Joanna who form the wine team, get great
pleasure from suggesting relatively unknown wines
. These include two Italians, a 1988 Turriga from Sardinia and Anselmi's
1991 single vineyard Soave, and the Ata Rangi Pinot Noir from Martinborough
in New Zealand.
Moussa finds predictions difficult to make but hopes that Australia's
production difficulties, caused by a shortage of good quality grapes, will
not lead to a huge rise in prices.
The Fifth Floor, Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1. 071-235 5250.
A monster list made especially inviting on Monday evenings by the company's
policy of charging shop prices - ie no mark-up. Among white wines, New
Zealand, the Loire and Burgundy have been the most popular sources but the
surprise of 1994 has been that more Harvey Nichols customers are drinking
red.
Thierry Dumont, head sommelier, believes this is due either to health
factors or the kitchen's increased use of Middle Eastern and spicy recipes.
Red Burgundy, Italian red wines and claret, have been popular but red wines
from Australia and California less so. Dumont believes that 1995 will be the
year for South African wines to emerge.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (19): Quicker deals will help to
reduce risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brokers used to do it at the end of every two or three weeks. Since the
summer, they have needed to do it after spells of 10 days. In a few months
they will be required to do it every five days.
They now are governed by rolling settlement on the stock market. It began in
July, and means that shares have to he delivered and paid for 10 days after
the original deal is struck.
This is the first phase of London's part in an international drive for the
reduction of settlement times, and therefore risk, in equity markets. Its
next move, in June, will be to a five-day settlement period. This will prove
far more of a leap than the 10-day move from the old account system, and is
already viewed with some caution in the market.
Ten-day settlement replaces two- and three-week trading accounts with
settlement taking place seven days after the end of those accounts. On a
typical two-week account, if a deal was struck on the first day of the
account, there would be three weeks before settlement had to be made.
Conversely, if a deal was struck on the last day of the account, then there
would be just a week until settlement. The Stock Exchange says that the
10-day stage was chosen as a mean average of the possibilities under the
previous accounts.
Rolling settlement means that every day is a settlement day for someone in
the market, unlike the old system of 24 days on which everyone made their
settlements.
Some investors have found that the generally speedier execution - and
penalties incurred from late action - has increased the attractions of
conducting investments via nominee accounts held at stockbrokers. In such
accounts, shares are registered in the name of the broker's nominee company
rather than the investor, thus enabling faster transactions.
Under 10-day settlement, it is not too difficult for a client to post share
certificates to his broker for delivery. It will not be as easy to do this
under five-day settlement. A five-day time-frame, however, runs hard up
against three-day cheque-clearance periods and possible postal delays.
Rolling settlement may now be well on course to roll faster, but it is not
unavoidable. As with anything in the market, investors can call their own
tunes if they are prepared to pay. At present, settlement may be made later
than 10 days, but the marketmakers do widen their price spreads to reflect
increased risk, and later settlement is a more costly exercise.
Risk reduction was one of the prime reasons for the introduction of rolling
settlement, with the possibility of failed trades lessened by a shorter
transaction time. The other main impetus was the internationalisation of
securities dealing.
The UK agreed in 1989 to introducerolling settlement, and so put in place a
similar framework to that in other leading financial centres. It was
responding to a call for swifter settlement in equity trading by the G30,
the Washington-based study group. Although the mechanics of settlement vary
between countries, the US operates rolling settlement on a five-day basis;
Japan on three days; France on three days; and Germany on two days.
The UK is aiming eventually for three-day settlement, but that is dependent
on the operation of paperless share-trading, which is some way off.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): How to spot a troubled company
 -Quick ratio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'quick ratio', or 'acid-test ratio', is commonly seen as cutting to the
very heart of a business's viability, for it simply measures its ability to
pay its creditors in the short term.
Calculation of the ratio is straight-forward and requires the current assets
(minus the stock) to be divided by the current liabilities.
Ratios of less than 1.0 do not necessarily spell misery. A supermarket, for
example, because it sells goods for cash before paying for them, will often
operate with quick ratios well below one. In this sector 0.2 is common.
Therefore quick ratios should always be seen in relation to others in the
same sector and of the same type.
A declining trend in a quick ratio may signal trouble ahead. Underlying such
a trend might be a rising overdraft; and some sort of statement should
therefore be sought out in the annual accounts.
It is worth noting that, for this test, creditors falling due within one
year should be considered to be current liabilities, although under the
requirements of the Companies Act this is not always easy to work out.
A drawback to the quick ratio is that it was designed to examine the cash
flow of a company at a time when that was often obscured and the information
was not in the balance sheet or the profit-and-loss account.
Since the publication of Financial Reporting Standard 1, in 1992, companies
have been required to include a cash-flow statement, which replaces the much
discredited funds flow statement. Now, the information which the quick ratio
sought to illuminate is readily available.
The real problem with the quick ratio is that implied by its name.
Single-ratio appraisals of a company's worth are now frowned upon by the
regulators and standard setters unless they are used properly - and never in
isolation.
Allister Wilson, partner with Ernst and Young, accountants, and one of the
authors of the monumental UK GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
Principals), says the quick ratio is potentially dangerous and should be
used with care.
Anyone tempted should ask themselves: where is the cash, and where are the
creditors? Cross-border problems could undermine liquidity. And the problem
with current assets is that, although stock is taken out, other long-term
debits can creep in, such as that from a pension fund.
Mr Wilson prefers, in this particular case, to use the cash flow over the
total debt as a measure of liquidity - with the total debt including
off-balance sheet items like lease liabilities. But the warning is clear:
'One ratio means absolutely nothing.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Property: Ugly maze encircles elegant avenues - Flats in
Paris tend to be elusive and expensive. Andrew Jack explains why vendors are
so reluctant to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those with fistfuls of francs to fritter away, there is always some
intriguing property or other coming up on the Paris market. For most,
France's capital remains one of the more frustrating places to seek
accommodation to rent or buy.
Take the magnificent hotel particulier called the Hotel de Cavoye, on rue
des Saints Peres in the fashionable seventh arrondissement, not far from the
house of the late Serge Gainsbourg and the headquarters of the Ecole
Nationale d'Administration, the most prestigious training college for the
country's elite.
For potential buyers of the more ambitious kind, the property will probably
come up for sale this month, thanks to the indisposition of its current
owner, Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician.
The sale depends on Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned
bank to which he owes more than FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m) winning the latest in
a series of court battles to seize Tapie's assets in its search for payment.
The only snag is the price: FFr100m-FFr160m, according to one estimate.
The incident highlights two of the more curious and frustrating things about
the Paris property market: accommodation appears and disappears in the most
peculiar ways, and the properties on offer are often phenomenally expensive.
'It's very easy to find yourself holding instructions for properties which
have prices with too many noughts on the end,' says Richard Crosthwaite, a
partner with Knight Frank Rutley, the chartered surveyors.
As in the UK, both the residential and commercial markets sharply declined
during the economic recession. This was borne out by the heavy losses
reported by French banks and insurance companies.
Nevertheless, agents are now beginning to spot signs of recovery in the
Parisian market. Crosthwaite says: 'Prices rose quickly in the 1980s and
have now fallen back dramatically. The market took a bigger hit than in
London. Now it's coming out of the doldrums slowly. But it's difficult to
call.'
'Prices are now reaching more realistic levels,' says Donelle Higbee, the
representative for Sotheby's International Realty in Paris. 'Things have
become more stable.'
Three or four years ago, she says, the asking price for property ranged from
FFr80,000 to FFr100,000 a square metre - the obsessive use of dimensions as
a selling point being one of the characteristics of the local market. Now,
she says, FFr30,000-FFr40,000 is more likely.
The exceptions come in the most popular areas. These have additional cachet
and a correspondingly substantial premium. They include Avenue Gabriel,
Avenue Montaigne and Quai d'Orsay.
'All my customers are essentially looking for the same thing: 17th and 18th
century buildings with high ceilings and a view - absolutely a view,' says
Higbee. 'It is extremely difficult to locate these and when I find them
there are always lots of people who are interested.'
Generally, Parisians seem reluctant to sell - hence the custom of putting
their property on the market at unrealistically high levels. Unless divorce
or death duties demand a more rapid sale, this habit seems to have held the
market in check.
Among the reasons for this inertia are the disincentives to sell: fees and
duties are often more than 10 per cent. From the buyer's perspective, there
are also tortuous legal hurdles, including a cumbersome process to prove
title. But Higbee says she is now beginning to see some change. 'Owners are
becoming more realistic,' she says.
One reason may be economic circumstances. 'They can see that nothing is
going to happen to prices for two or four years,' she says. 'Banks are more
reluctant to lend money. So if they have financial needs they are having to
sell.'
A number of aspects make the Parisian market starkly different to London and
other cities. Most fundamental is the low level of supply. Paris is a
relatively small city, but also one in which - as in many other countries in
continental Europe - the culture of home ownership is far less dominant than
in the UK. Most people rent instead.
Another issue is the very different infrastructure for selling property,
which can make the hunt extremely frustrating. There is a tight network of
agencies, most of which have nothing like the network of some other
countries nor the tradition of sharing listings and splitting the fees.
'It's every agency for itself,' says Higbee. 'They are very particular who
they share information with.'
'There is a gap in the market for the sophisticated level of international
marketing,' says Crosthwaite.
'There are no magazines with listings, and just a handful of agents and
architects with the knowledge of what's for sale. It's all done on the
cocktail and dinner-party circuit and is a question of who you know.'
For those with more money to spare, Paris does offer a variety of relocation
agencies and specialists willing to do much of the legwork and hunt for
available property. The same applies to the rented sector.
For those with more modest means, the search is rather different. There are
property agents with shopfronts advertising their wares, although generally
with far less extensive networks than the chains found in some other
countries.
The French often seek property through the columns of Le Figaro, the daily
paper, which has an especially comprehensive property section on Tuesdays,
and De Particulier a particulier, a weekly listings magazine.
Similar listings, regularly updated, are available on Minitel, the computer
information network easily available to any French telephone subscriber.
Very often, a housing agent will occupy in a flat for a series of fixed
hours in order to play host to dozens of prospective buyers. Those who are
interested need to act fast to get over the bureaucratic hurdles before the
others who are viewing at the same time.
Finding the property is only a small part of the battle. The first shock is
the presentation of the flats. 'Unfurnished' means just that. Very often
little is left in place except the electric sockets - if you are lucky.
The second is the scale of charges. On top of the standard monthly rental, a
monthly fee is normally charged for the communal areas and sometimes pays
for a concierge. In addition, factors such as the provision of electric or
centrally-controlled heating can make a substantial difference to the final
costs.
Finally, there is the paperwork. Landlords often demand two months' rent in
advance, possibly some financial guarantee, and a detailed series of
references. They may have other demands, such as asking your employer to
provide verification of your salary.
On the other hand, the French legal system does offer good protection for
tenants once they move in. There is one consolation. To protect people from
the bitter winters, by law no one can be evicted between October and March.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): Good impressions -
The art market is picking up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the auctions held at Sotheby's and Christie's in London this
week, the market for expensive Impressionist and modern art is continuing
its slow recovery. Demand disappeared almost entirely four years ago when
speculators, mainly Japanese, were caught out by the recession, holding
pictures that had often halved in value. Any improvement since has been
fitful.
At Christie's on Monday night, though, major paintings and sculptures sold
for Pounds 15.1m, with 29 of the 41 lots finding buyers. More to the point,
there was strong demand for the best works - in terms of value, the auction
was 85 per cent sold.
On Tuesday at Sotheby's, a solid but unsensational auction brought in Pounds
11.37m, with 46 of the 61 lots selling, 79 per cent by value.
After many false dawns, what makes it more likely that the stronger demand
will take hold this time is the character of the auctions: they were very
different affairs from similar occasions five, or 10, years ago.
Anyone cramming into the Great Rooms in King Street, St James's, or in Bond
Street, was confronted with great banks of telephones manned by exquisite
creatures, male and female, arrayed in smartest black. They were in contact
with foreign buyers. And they were kept busy.
At Christie's, 18 of the lots sold went via the telephone. Indeed, at one
time, there were 16 telephones competing for the same painting. At
Sotheby's, there were 71 telephone bids, far exceeding the activists in the
room and proving that demand for expensive art is international, secret, and
concentrated among private buyers.
The packed audiences at both Sotheby's and Christie's were mainly
spectators. London's largest dealer, Richard Green, left after just a few
lots at Christie's. Dealers generally, with plenty of unsold stock and aware
that they can hardly squeeze much profit from pictures sold publicly, sat on
their hands. There were few bids from the floor.
The second distinctive feature of the Christie's sale was the stronger
demand for the earlier lots - the decorative works of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries - than for the more challenging later works. This
suggests new buyers, with new money, are coming in.
These tyros start, invariably, by collecting accessible paintings to furnish
their homes. Over time, some become serious collectors and want more
creatively challenging art.
The most expensive picture in the Christie's sale, a landscape by Klimt
showing a garden sparkling with flowers, went to a buyer in the room - but
she turned out to be a Christie's representative bidding for an anonymous
client. Against minimal competition, she took the picture for Pounds 3.74m,
at the bottom of the pre-sale estimate.
Another major lot, a large, late, Miro, was actually below target. It sold
for Pounds 1.32m, suggesting that Christie's had been successful in
persuading sellers to keep their reserves low in what is still a selective
buyers' market. But the Pounds 2.1m paid for a large Picasso, 'Tete de
Femme', was above estimate.
By chance, these two works offer a good insight into the state of the
market: in 1990, the Miro sold at Christie's in New York for Dollars 7.15m
(Pounds 3.6m) and the Picasso, part of the collection of movie director
Billy Wilder, made Dollars 4.8m (Pounds 2.7m) in 1989. The vendors took
losses this week, but at least they sold.
Unless forced by the three great Ds - death, divorce and debt - few owners
of major art works are likely to risk them on today's convalescent market.
This accounts for the shortage of masterpieces on offer in London. It could
also suggest that New York is finally taking over as the centre of the
international art market: the modern art auctions there last month did not
contain many great works but they brought in much more money than London.
Sotheby's had no knock-out lot in Bond Street but the remnants from the
great collection of Alfred Richet did well. All but one of the 20 lots were
sold, for around Pounds 3m in total. In the main auction, a decorative
Picasso watercolour of a gypsy girl from the Moulin Rouge burst its forecast
at Pounds 1.8m.
The lower prices, and the lower reserves, are attracting back the serious
buyers of Impressionist and modern art who were frightened away by the price
spiral of the late 1980s - which culminated in the summer of 1990 when a van
Gogh sold for Dollars 82.5m. Together with the new rich, demand is stronger
 -but only for the finest works, priced reasonably. Speculation is quite
absent. We are back, in fact, to the art market of a decade or more ago, but
with many new players.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): 10 years' work but
no pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On leaving the armed services in October 1945, I joined a large US company
where I worked for 10 years. The pension scheme was non-contributory; as a
result, no pension is being paid for the first decade of my working life.
This seems unfair.
The fact of the scheme being non-contributory should not of itself mean that
no pension is payable - it would simply indicate that no contribution was
due from you, the employee.
We cannot tell from your letter why no pension is due but, for instance, it
could be because the scheme provided death benefits only. (Reply by Andrew
White of Gordon Leighton &amp; Co. who also provided the answer, 'Two incomes,
two pensions', which appeared in Briefcase on November 19).
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): Funeral wishes
ignored - Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We are a small firm of funeral directors. Some time ago, we were instructed
by a man who made quite clear that he wanted no service at either church or
crematorium, and his ashes to be buried with his brother. He died soon
after.
The closest relatives were two nephews, who were also executors. They
changed his wishes and had a church service, although we disagreed. Do
executors have a legal right to do this?
I believe this is more a moral than a legal problem although, clearly, the
executors should not alter the wishes of the deceased. I suggest you get
advice from a local solicitor. If the legal view is in accordance with the
above, then you could decline to act in future if you found an executor
wished to act against the wishes of the deceased. (Reply by Barry Stillerman
of accountant Stoy Hayward).

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): No fantasy for the
man from Dallas - William Hall meets a small investor who has beaten the
professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention Jayesh Manek and most City fund managers look blank. But this could
be about to change as Manek, a 38-year-old pharmacist from Ruislip,
Middlesex, has done what many small investors dream about and proved it is
possible to beat the professionals at their own game.
The Sunday Times is expected to announce this weekend that Manek has won the
Pounds 100,000 first prize in its Fantasy Fund Manager competition. Every
week since May, he has been pitting his wits against 40,000 other
contestants - including a fair sprinkling of investment professionals - to
see how much he could make from a hypothetical Pounds 10m invested in a
range of 250 genuine shares.
Despite operating during a period when the stock market has fallen, Manek's
wheeling and dealing means that his Pounds 10m JP Income fund is now worth
more than Pounds 500m. Altogether, he entered 28 separate funds, and eight
of the top 12 in the competition belong to him.
Admittedly, he has taken very big bets on very small shares and, in some
cases, has invested several times more than the market capitalisation of the
stock in question. In real life, that would have been impossible - and, when
it was possible, the share price would have run away long before he could
have invested a fraction of his money. But Manek's consistency in winning,
and his ability to spot small stocks that are just about to move, is due to
more than luck.
He emigrated to Britain from Uganda in 1971 and owes his early success to
his late uncle, BJ Manek, who is reckoned to have been the Financial Times'
first reader in Nairobi, Kenya, and also encouraged his nephew to read the
newspaper when not studying for his pharmacy exams in Sussex.
Soon, Manek had caught the stock market bug. He added the Investors
Chronicle to his reading list and started to play the traded options market.
Although Manek took delivery recently of a Reuter terminal, and has moved on
from reading Jim Slater's The Zulu Principle ('very good') to John Train's
The Money Masters and The New Money Masters ('very useful'), he remains
convinced that diligent reading of the IC and FT is enough to give the
private investor an edge when investing in stocks with a market
capitalisation of under Pounds 100m.
Most of the information on his biggest coups - such as Orb Estates,
Middlesex Holdings, United Breweries, Virtuality, Bullers, Anglo United and
CRP Leisure - has been gleaned from these sources. 'You are learning all the
time,' he says.
Manek, who monitors both the fundamentals and the charts, does not believe a
company warrants investment just because 'old so and so' has gone on the
board, but he always wants to see how a share price reacts to a boardroom
change. Share price movements can often send out the wrong signal but, for
Manek, they are the best indicator he has got.
Now that he has a Reuter screen, it is easier to monitor changes in
directors' shareholdings and volume figures. But that is not enough. 'The
biggest challenge is to know when to take a profit,' says Manek - and,
judging by his record in the Fantasy competition, this is where his real
skill lies, rather than in individual stock-picking.
He has a warning, though. With vivid memories of what happened when he once
fell in love with Glaxo options, he stresses: 'Never get emotionally
involved with a particular stock.'
Manek is the first to admit that he could do nowhere near as well if he was
investing his own money rather than the fantasy funds of the Sunday Times.
As for whether any City fund manager would want to hire him, he says he has
yet to be approached.
Foreign &amp; Colonial's Michael Hart, who admits he has never heard of Manek,
refuses to believe anyone can turn in such a consistent performance year
after year. Legal &amp; General's David Manning says that if Manek did have a
future in the City, it would be in a highly-geared hedge fund prepared to
take big bets.
Not that it matters, as Manek is not looking for a highly-paid spot in the
City. His job is helping his brother run the family's chain of Dallas
chemist shops, which he finds just as challenging intellectually as the
stock market. They started the business in 1980 and now have eight stores,
including a rather glitzy affair in London's Charing Cross station.
Indeed, when it comes to this specialist sector, Manek probably knows just
as much, if not more, than the big guns at Boots, Lloyds Chemists, Unichem
and AAH Holdings. As a businessman who likes playing the market in the UK
and India, it would be surprising if the Fantasy Fund Manager competition is
the last we hear of the man from Dallas.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (17): Don't invest solely for the
tax saving - Personal equity plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A personal equity plan is best regarded as an annual tax-free allowance,
rather than a product.
Peps began in 1987 as a result of the government's desire to encourage wider
and deeper share ownership. The encouragement is in the form of generous tax
breaks, albeit accompanied by rules which have become unnecessarily
complicated.
You can hold Pounds 6,000 of equities in a 'general' plan and a further
Pounds 3,000 in a single-company plan each year. Income and gains are all
tax-free.
From April 6, you will also be allowed to hold corporate bonds, convertibles
and preference shares in UK and EU companies, as a result of the Budget.
These are all fixed-interest instruments, which will appeal to those seeking
a high income.
Since Peps are more flexible than other tax-efficient investments (such as
pensions, the benefits of which can only be tapped on retirement), they form
an essential part of any long-term planning strategy.
However, those who are averse to equity investment should think very
carefully before buying an equity-based Pep solely for the tax benefits.
Peps must be administered by a manager, who will charge for doing so. The
exception is unit trusts, where it usually costs no more to hold the unit
trust in a Pep than outside one; but buying a unit trust incurs charges,
usually of about 5.25-6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually.
Investment trusts charge extra for administering a Pep, and if you want a
direct holding of equities, the plan manager will charge for handing the
portfolio. It costs more to have a 'advisory' Pep where the manager chooses
the investments for you than a 'self-select' Pep where you make the
investment decisions.
If you want the latter, choose a plan manager whose charging structure best
suits your needs: some plan managers do not charge an annual fee but charge
for reclaiming tax on dividends; others have a relatively low dealing charge
but charge an annual fee.
There are some investment restrictions on Peps. Unit and investment trusts
only qualify for the full Pep allowance if at least 50 per cent of their
investment is held in UK or EU companies. The rest can be in gilts or held
in companies outside the EU. You can only put Pounds 1,500 into wholly
'non-qualifying' trusts.
The single-company Pep can only be used for the shares of one company (which
cannot be an investment trust) but you can switch between companies. It is
rarely a good idea to put too much money into a single company's shares,
unless you already have a well-diversified holding of shares, because of the
risk. However, the single-company Pep is useful as a tax shelter for
transferring shares from an employee share option scheme or for investors
who have already used up their general Pep limit for the year.
If you are unhappy with your plan manager or want to change from one type of
fund to another, you can transfer to another plan manager. There will be
switching charges and the process may take several months. Do not cash in
your existing Pep - it will lose its tax-free status. Instead, contact the
manager to whom you wish to transfer who will explain the administration.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Treat them the same as other
shares - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year has seen investors deluged with prospectuses from companies
floating on the stock market. Not since the mid-1980s has the new-issue
market been so active.
Yet there is an important difference this time. Ten years ago, new issues
were an easy way to make money. Many were hugely underpriced, leading to a
flood of applications and big premiums over the offer price when the shares
started trading. For the so-called 'stags', who applied for shares only to
sell them as soon as possible, there were good profits to be made.
By contrast, most investors in new issues in 1994 have suffered paper
losses. New issues are priced in relation to the general level of shares, so
if the market as a whole falls, as it has done since February, so will
shares in recent new issues. Overall, new issues have performed no worse
than the market as a whole.
Yet the expectation would have been for them to perform slightly better,
because new issues are priced to give a reasonable premium over the offer
price when they start trading in the market.
The problem has been a few disastrous flotations, where the shares have
fallen sharply not long afterwards. While these flops have scared many
private investors off, new issues do still have some attractions.
The first is simply convenience. The Stock Exchange requires that the
largest flotations must be conducted through a public offer for sale. Under
an offer, anyone can apply for shares, and the process involves no more than
filling in a form printed in the newspapers and sending it off with a
cheque.
(In smaller flotations, shares are sold via placings or intermediaries'
offers, and are only available to private investors if they happen to be
clients of the particular stockbrokers involved.)
Another advantage of buying shares when a company floats is that there is no
commission to pay. If the shares are priced at Pounds 1 each, Pounds 1 is
what you pay.
In theory, a more valuable saving is that the shares are priced so that they
go to a premium in the market. But in the volatile conditions seen during
most of 1994 this has not always happened.
One of the biggest claimed selling points for new issues is that it is the
least risky time in a company's life at which to invest. In preparation for
flotation, a company's business and finances will have been scrutinised by
its merchant bank, stockbroker and accountants. They put their names to the
prospectus, and will be severely embarrassed if anything goes wrong shortly
after flotation.
But recent experience shows that this is very far from a guarantee. There is
even an argument that flotation is a positively bad time at which to invest,
because the shares are unlikely to be seriously undervalued. Those looking
for bargains might be better advised to consider shares of neglected or
unfashionable companies already trading on the stock market.
The best policy for investors is to treat new issues no differently from
other shares, and to judge them on the same basis.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): No tax - and less risk than
you feared - Offshore funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN LODGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax evasion, exotic, dodgy: for many investors these will be images conjured
up by offshore investment funds. Yes, all can be true. But offshore funds
don't have to be any more risky than unit and investment trusts, their
UK-based cousins.
Being offshore means a fund is based, for regulation and tax purposes,
outside mainland UK. The rules that such funds live under and how they are
taxed are different - sometimes better, sometimes worse - than onshore
trusts.
Offshore funds pay their income gross, which is handy for non-taxpayers. UK
taxpayers, although they are expected to declare the income to the Inland
Revenue, can benefit from the improved cashflow. Investors who expect to
enter a lower tax bracket - say, when they retire or if they move abroad -
can benefit from 'roll-up' funds.
Putting your mind at rest on the regulatory front should involve the
following steps:
Look for names of investment firms you know. The bigger, blue-chip names
have bigger reputations to protect. They are also more likely to have a UK
contact point. If you deal through a UK-authorised arm of the offshore fund
manager, you leave open the possibility of compensation for negligence under
UK rules if the fund should, for example, go bankrupt.
Buy through a UK-authorised financial adviser: again, you have the potential
for making a claim of negligence against that adviser if something goes
wrong with the fund.
A fund that is recognised by the Securities and Investments Board (Sib) has
been given the go-ahead to market to UK investors by one of the UK's senior
financial regulators. Sib is saying that the regulatory framework of the
fund is equivalent to that in the UK. Ucits status means the fund and its
regulation conform to a European Union standard. Funds that carry neither
are not necessarily to be avoided; but do check that the fund is authorised
in its home territory. One advantage of an Sib-recognised fund is that the
managers are required to say which watchdog you should complain to if
something goes wrong.
Favour funds from the bigger, less exotic offshore centres. The UK
regulators say that Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda have
investor protection - including compensation schemes - at least as good as
in mainland UK. But it is possible for a fund from one of these centres to
be subject to lesser regulation and compensation arrangements - so this test
is not failsafe. Dublin and Luxembourg are both important fund centres with
good regulatory reputations. But they don't have compensation schemes.
Do not take the quoted charges at face value. Annual costs can amount to
nearly 10 per cent of a fund's value, even though the quoted annual
management charge is just 1.5 per cent; and that can prove a huge drag on
investment performance. Uncovering these hidden charges is not easy, though:
new guides from London-based Fitzrovia International are one of the very few
user-friendly sources.
Read the fund's marketing material or prospectus thoroughly. Know how your
money will be invested, the pedigree of the managers and what you will pay
(including, for example, performance fees) for that management.

FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: If you must buy shirts, at least buy silk -
Carefully chosen gifts mean men will not have to feign surprise and joy on
Christmas morning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK FOULKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let us call it the Thyssen Principle.
At the end of a television film on the luxurious life of Heini
Thyssen-Bornemisza and his then wife Fiona Campbell Walter, the Baron let
slip that he was thinking of giving his wife a gift. What sort of a gift? A
bauble from Cartier perhaps? Or a sable coat?
No. He had his eye on a Monet.
In this, Heini showed he truly understood the art of giving: the best
presents are what one would not buy for oneself, prove delightful and appeal
to the imagination.
However, even for a man whose art collection was said to rival that of the
Queen of England, a Monet is pretty steep.
The rest of us must apply the Thyssen Principle in more modest ways. Yet in
buying Christmas presents for men, it is well to keep the Baron's approach
in mind.
It can become wearing for a man to have to pretend spontaneous joy while
tearing the wrapping paper off yet another blue shirt, especially when you
stipulated the maker, collar size and sleeve length.
Nor do most men want anything 'useful'. Those men longing to own a Bosch
hammer drill will already have bought one.
No, it is far better to mix a hint of luxury with a little imagination and a
dash of surprise. If you must buy handkerchiefs, at least make them Hermes
pochettes and combine them with a velvet smoking waistcoat, complete with
frogging and braid, at Pounds 175 from Hackett.
Instead of the year-long practicality of the power tool, why not opt instead
for the one-off hedonism of a large tin of caviar? A 500g tin of Beluga at
Pounds 600 should make a good impression.
And for a shade over 10 per cent of that price, it is possible to pick up a
perfectly respectable 125g tin of Sevruga. Iranian caviar is this season's
favourite.
It is also a good Christmas to buy cashmere, as prices are set to climb in
the new year. For cardigans try Hackett where they cost about Pounds 290.
Pringle has chunky cashmere sweaters starting at Pounds 265, while Herbert
Johnson has a cashmere dressing gown for Pounds 950.00. And, although it is
hardly an economy, the Sulka shawl collar, eight-ply cashmere cardigan at
Pounds 1,050 makes a memorable gift.
Sulka also has some rather ingenious spectacle cases in silk that can be
placed in the top pocket where they resemble a handkerchief. The non-myopic
can use them for sunglasses, and non-millionaires can afford the Pounds 25
price tag.
Just as vain men hate people to see their reading glasses, real men hate to
wear pyjamas. But few could resist, for example, the Batiste cotton pyjamas
from Budd on London's Piccadilly Arcade, in striking coral or 'men's pink',
with mother of pearl buttons and a button under the revers to fasten against
the cold. At Pounds 95, these pyjamas are a very covetable gift.
If you must buy a man a shirt, make it a silk one. Silk prices are coming
down and there are big reductions on last year's prices: at Budd, the king
of dress shirts - silk, pleated and able to take studs - is Pounds 145,
Pounds 20 less than last year.
Socks, like shirts can be a monotonous choice, but Budd have unearthed some
rather fancy two tone ones in fine French cotton Lisle from Boileau at
Pounds 13.50.
At the other end of the scale the thickest socks you are ever likely to wear
can be found on the shores of Loch Fyne at Alexander MacIntyre in Inverary.
Hand-knitted on the Western Isles they cost Pounds 7.75.
Writing instruments tend to feature as Christmas presents but if you cannot
afford to give a vintage Parker Duofold, why not think about a pen case.
Penfriend has smart pen cases in calf starting at Pounds 18, rising through
Buffalo to the highly desirable crocodile at Pounds 55. It might also be an
idea to choose a notebook from Smythson in a matching or contrasting shade,
from Pounds 5.95.
Another accessory holder to look out for is the leather watch case. Made in
Italy and available at the Watch Gallery, this is the ultimate riposte to
the female's jewellery case. However the prices (from Pounds 175 to almost
Pounds 4,000) are only worth paying if the man you are buying for can afford
to collect marques such as Breitling, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and
Vacheron Constantin.
The action man might appreciate the Land Rover Experience, a day course in
how to handle Range Rover, Defender and Discovery vehicles, for Pounds
152.75.
Alternatively, send him out on the information superhighway by putting him
on the Internet. The Internet starter kit is Pounds 27.98 from Micro Anvika,
while the service is available from such organisations as Demon (081-349
0063) for a Pounds 12.50 joining fee and Pounds 10 a month thereafter (both
prices exclude VAT).
Those in search of something a little less tangible might enjoy a Feng Shui
consultation. This practice is incredibly popular in Hong Kong and benefits
are believed to include enhanced career prospects, greater wealth and
improved relationships.
For Pounds 100 an hour, Jan Cisek (tel: 0956-288574), a Feng Shui
consultant, will reorganise an office, drawing-room, bedroom or study
according to ancient principles which should produce a more harmonious
environment.
But a boy's Christmas just would not be festive without a gadget and the
oenophile on the run will certainly want the collapsible pocket corkscrew
from Swaine Adeney Brigg (Pounds 45, plus Pounds 2 p+p), which resembles a
bulky silver bullet when not in use.
There will, however, be those for whom a corkscrew is simply not complex
enough. A catalogue published by 'Q, Purveyors of International Gadgetry'
includes everything from a pair of 'maritime glasses' for yachting at Pounds
27.50, through a solid gold miniature camera - which can, of course, be
crested - and a selection of night scopes to the personal submarine. Kaspia

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investment and Saving): A shock before buying
 -Bids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries, confident of winning its hostile Pounds 391m bid
for Attwoods of the UK, received a rude shock yesterday morning. Just five
hours before its bid closed, a white knight entered the fray with the
promise of a higher offer.
Ikotek, a subsidiary of an unknown private Canadian group, Sieber, pledged
to pay shareholders 130p in cash, plus the 3.25p final dividend, if BFI's
bid failed. The new offer valued Attwoods at about Pounds 433m.
The details and certainty of the bid were unclear, however. Ikotek's was not
a firm offer and, according to the company's own advisers, it could walk
away at any time. As a result, most shareholders opted to back the bid on
the table and BFI held about 55 per cent when the offer closed at 1pm,
London time.
Fewer than 10 shareholders, representing significantly less than 1 per cent
of Attwoods, withdrew their acceptance of BFI's bid.
British Aerospace and GEC took a breather in their battle for VSEL. Neither
side changed its offer or tried to buy VSEL shares in the market-place and
all eyes are now on Michael Heseltine, the Trade Secretary, who is due to
announce by December 7 if either bid will be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Arbitrageurs, however, were busy buying VSEL shares in the expectation of an
increased offer by GEC.
As neither bid is expected to be referred, BAe and GEC will have to slug it
out in the market. GEC has until December 17 to make a final offer.
Emerson Electric's agreed 525p-a-share bid for Powys-based Control
Techniques was hardly a surprise since the two companies announced early
last month they were involved in negotiations.
Nevertheless the bid, which values the electronic drives specialist at
Pounds 204m, offers Control's shareholders a reasonable deal. The offer
price represents a premium of more than 36 per cent over the share price
immediately before the announcement of take-over talks, as well as an
historic multiple of 26.6 and about 18 times prospective earnings.
Emerson, a US group which already held a 29.4 per cent stake in Control,
picked up a further 3.07m shares in the market on Thursday. Including
irrevocable acceptances, the US group either holds or has agreed to buy a
total of 20.4m shares, representing 52.5 per cent of the company.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investment and Saving): New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Wiltshire-based regional brewer this week became the latest victim of the
bruised new issues market, writes David Blackwell. Ushers, a product of the
government's anti-monopoly ruling, intended to raise around Pounds 50m to
clear debt through a placing and open offer, but the issue was pulled on
Thursday - the very day the issue price was due to be announced.
Institutions were willing to put up only three-quarters of the necessary
money and the group felt that, unless the shares were placed fully ahead of
the public offer, it would risk a bad after-market.
That seems wise following the surreal events at United Carriers which, on
Monday, issued its second profits warning since flotation in February. The
first cited a lack of parcels; the second, an excess. The shares fell 79p to
almost half the flotation price.
RAP Group, a rubber and plastics distributor, yesterday curbed its ambition
to raise Pounds 4.6m from a placing, settling instead for Pounds 3.55m. The
shares were priced at 142p, giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 15.08m.
Meanwhile, investors thinking of going for shares in BSkyB should be aware
of this week's report from Henderson Crosthwaite suggesting the flotation
greatly over-values the satellite television venture.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investment and Saving): Directors' dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional circumstances always surround some selling by directors. A case
in point is the recent set of transactions at Lincat, a group which makes
commercial catering equipment.
Martin Craddock, the elderly non-executive president, sold as soon as the
directors were in a position to deal following the negotiations surrounding
their acquisition of Imperial Machine Company.
Craddock is now almost retired from the board and his sale was made in
answer to institutional pressure for more stock.
Selling at Psion, the portable computer company well-known for its hand-held
personal organisers, was also due to demand by the institutions. In the
latest deals, five members of the board including David Potter, the chairman
and chief executive, disposed of stock.
Logica is also in the business of computers. The sale there was made by Len
Taylor, a non-executive director. He has seen the share price outperform the
market by a generous margin over the past year but, even after the deal,
retains more than 970,000.
A considerable amount of buying has been monitored at Dewhirst Group over
the past 12 months.
The company is in the textile industry where it supplies Marks and Spencer,
the UK's leading retailer, with many of its garments, and the consensus
forecast for the coming year is good.
The sale by Barry Albon, an executive director, still leaves him with 10,000
shares.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (13): Take your time - things are
changing - Life assurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the bad old days, when there were fewer controls on the way life
insurance was sold, it was easier for a sales agent to influence a customer
who sounded interested but wanted to postpone the decision.
One way of injecting urgency into proceedings might be to invite a potential
client to consider his family's circumstances if, without having bought a
policy, he were to die immediately after the sales agent's departure.
The case for people with dependants to have cover remains powerful. But the
life insurance industry is in such a state of uncertainty at the moment that
there may well be a case for delaying any decisions that can reasonably be
left for a while.
One important change in the industry is the new requirement that life
company sales agents and advisers volunteer to their customers more
information about the policies they sell and the charges that the customer
will be required to pay. This rule comes into effect from January 1.
In response, many life companies have either already launched new ranges of
products, or will do so before the end of the year.
The new disclosure regime highlights not only the charges attached to a
policy but also the amount that customers will receive if they give up a
long-term plan in the first few years. So life companies are working hard to
cut their costs. This should mean that customers get better value, because,
out of premiums paid, more is invested and less is taken out in charges.
While cost-cutting is common across just about all life companies, some life
insurers are also increasing the surrender values in the early years.
Standard Life, for example, will be offering a better deal to customers who
need to surrender a policy prematurely, though in some cases this will mean
a small reduction in what they would receive were the policy to run its full
term.
Other companies are rationalising their product ranges by deciding not to
sell policies that are not popular or which are too inflexible. Norwich
Union, for example, is hastening the disappearance of its conventional
with-profits policies in favour of unitised with-profits policies.
While, in terms of what the customer receives, there may seem to be little
difference between the two, unitised policies allow the insurer to introduce
flexible commission arrangements, which give independent advisers and their
customers more choice about how the charges are made.
Further changes seek to make products more straightforward. These can
include 'unbundling' - the separation into two distinct, but complementary,
products of the protection and investment elements that make up packaged
life insurance products.
For example, the TSB group said that, from the start of last month, it would
consider customers' life insurance requirements separately from savings, and
that its range of products, such as term (or pure protection) insurance,
would be an average 20 per cent cheaper than before.
Overall, the changes to products should give better value for money: so if a
decision can be delayed until the new year, it may well be worth waiting.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): Two decisions as tax relief
matters less - Mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mortgage is no longer as tax-efficient as it used to be. Tax relief is
only available on the first Pounds 30,000 of the loan, and from next April
the rate of relief will drop to 15 per cent from the current 20 per cent.
So paying off the mortgage is one of the most sensible investment decisions
you can make, but if you need a mortgage do not be put off by the seemingly
endless choice. There are basically two main decisions: whether to repay the
loan with a repayment or an interest-only mortgage; and whether to take a
fixed or variable rate.
Repayment or interest-only?
Any mortgage is made up of the capital sum borrowed and the interest
payments. With a repayment mortgage, the homeowner's monthly payments
comprise both, so that the whole debt is paid off at the end of the mortgage
term - usually 25 years. You should take out term assurance - basic life
insurance - to cover the mortgage in the event of your death.
The main disadvantage of the repayment mortgage is that, by repaying the
capital, you are handing over money which might work harder for you
elsewhere.
The alternative is an interest-only loan. You only pay interest to the
lender, but save up separately to pay off the capital sum at the end of the
mortgage term. The most common savings plan is an endowment policy, where an
insurance company invests the monthly premium you pay and gives you some
life assurance. However, endowments are relatively inflexible, and you are
likely to be penalised heavily if you redeem within the first five years.
You should consider other methods, such as linking an interest-only mortgage
to your pension, so that part of the tax-free lump sum paid on retirement is
used to repay the capital sum. The disadvantage here is that less will be
left over to invest for your retirement. A pension mortgage is not suitable
for young people, who may find themselves making interest payments for more
than 25 years, which can wipe out the tax advantages.
Mortgages linked to personal equity plans (Peps) are also tax-efficient,
because you are not liable for income or capital gains tax; and, since you
can stop payments without penalty, they are very flexible. The main drawback
is that you are at the mercy of stock market fluctuations, and need to take
great care in choosing a good provider.
Fixed or variable?
A fixed mortgage rate offers certainty, and avoids the shock of a sudden
increase in interest rates. Since interest rates look as if they are on the
way up, you also hope to pay less interest with a fixed rate than one which
is variable. However, this depends on finding a competitive fixed rate.
At the moment, most of these are concentrated on the shorter term (two to
three years), but you may save more with a discounted variable rate (unless
rates rise significantly over this period). In general, discounted rates,
which offer a reduction of a set proportion for a fixed period on the
variable rate, are better value than cashback offers.
Some very lengthy fixed rates may seem historically low, but commit yourself
only if you are sure that you will remain in the UK and do not want to
reduce the capital sum within the fixed-rate period. Be aware that
'portable' fixed rates may not be as portable as you would like - you will
usually have to buy and sell within a relatively short period to avoid
redemption penalties.
These are onerous on long-term fixes; while some short-term fixes carry a
redemption penalty beyond the fixed-rate period. Lenders will charge a fee
of about Pounds 100-Pounds 300, determined by the length of the fix. Avoid
fixed rates tied to the sale of insurance-related products, because you can
probably find cheaper insurance elsewhere.

The Richmond Fellowship for Community Mental Health now has its headquarters
at 8 Addison Road, London W14, and this provides an added incentive for
visiting its annual Christmas Craft Fair. For many readers, the fair has
become part of the ritual of Christmas - it gives them the chance to buy
craftwork from a range of workers (everything from pottery to needlework,
jewellery, toys, glass and lithographs), see over a fine Edwardian house and
know that most of the proceeds goes to aid the fellowship's work with people
who have mental health problems. The house, for those who have not seen it,
was built in 1906 by Harlsey Ricardo for Sir Ernest Debnham and it has tiles
by William de Morgan, a mosaic dome designed by Gaetano Meo as well as,
according to John Betjeman, 'mouldings and proportions everywhere (that)
make it one of the most distinguished and cheerful and thoughtfully coloured
interiors in England'.
The fair is open today and tomorrow from 11am to 5pm, admission is Pounds
2.50 for adults, Pounds 1.50 for children, unwaged and OAPs. The address is
The Peacock House, 8 Addison Road, London W14 8DL.
You hate shopping, you are busy, busy, busy and you are still wondering
exactly what to give to whom? Panic not, the Good Present Guide by Michael
Dickson will come to the rescue. Not that you will like everything he
suggests, but it is a useful starting point and I defy anyone to leaf
through the pages without finding something unexpected, useful, original
even. For just Pounds 4.99 the book offers suggestions for every age and
interest group. Published by Pan Books, it is now available in paperback.
Those who live in London or who are thinking of coming to London for
Christmas shopping might like to look in on two exhibitions where works of
art can be bought at very reasonable prices. At the Hyde Park Gallery, 16
Craven Terrace, London W2 there is now an exhibition of Works on Paper, a
selection of etchings, screenprints, lithographs, monoprints and drawings at
prices that start at about Pounds 20 and go on up to Pounds 200. Styles
range from the experimental and abstract to more traditional,
representational works. Look out for some charming small black-and-white
etchings by Barbara Webb. The exhibition is on until December 10.
The Art Collection at 3-5 Elystan Street, London SW3, which started as a
small gallery selling primarily decorative prints and other works of art, is
sadly closing down. From now until the end of December, it will be selling
all its stock at marked-down prices.
For admirers of craft work, the Hackney Contemporaries, a group of talented
designer-makers, all of whom live in the borough of Hackney, are opening
their studios to the public on the weekend of December 10 and 11.
It is a unique chance to see what goes on behind the scenes, to get to know
the craftspeople and either to buy or to commission a special piece. You
could spend as little as Pounds 15 on a one-off individually made piece of
pottery or glass or as much as Pounds 2,000 on something truly special.
There are ceramics, glass, hand-made rugs, furniture, textiles.
As with the Richmond Fellowship, there is more to do than just buy crafts.
Free buses will be running every hour between 12am and 4pm along a
designated route, starting at the Geffrye Museum in Kingsland Road, London
E2 and taking in the open studios, Burberry's factory shop on Chatham Place,
Sutton House and on to Stoke Newington. Maps of the route and the bus
timetable as well as other information can be had from the Hackney Tourist
Information Centre, Hackney Museum, Central Hall, Mare Street, London E8.

FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Strong scents of occasion - Lucia van der
Post carries a flame for a sweet-smelling home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I first became interested in sweet smells for the house when my son kept
hamsters, and even though the creatures were banished to the cellar (animal
rights activists can relax, these were the days when he was small and I knew
no better), an aroma began to waft around the house that was, shall we say.
. . musty.
Most of us have less urgent reasons for perfuming the house. We simply find
a sweet-smelling home as essential to our sense of well-being as comfortable
sofas and fresh coffee. And candles are a quick and cheap way of adding
magic to any room.
The success of Wax Lyrical, a small niche-chain of 21 shops selling nothing
but candles, is proof that once people have discovered the charm of candles,
they become addicted.
Marjorie Bannister and Mark Chessel started the business on a hunch. While
on a trip to Iceland, they were enchanted by the way candles were used in
Icelandic homes and became convinced that the British would take to using
them if only they were made more accessible. Their initial research revealed
that 95 per cent of British people only ever used candles at Christmas.
Since Bannister and Chessel opened their first specialist candle-only shop
in Richmond, the market in the UK has grown by leaps and bounds.
Some of the cheapest and most seductive scents are aromatherapy candles,
which are infused with essential oils. These come in little stone pots, and
cost Pounds 4.95, the most popular scents being sandalwood and ylang-ylang.
Minimalists who would never use anything but plain cream will find classic
ivory church candles in all sizes and prices. For more baroque tastes, there
is an opulent Russian range. Matt-gold, rose-shaped candles floating over a
bed of glass nuggets, gold orbs, or taper candles with rich fluted glass
candle-holders and crystal grapes would cater perfectly for romantics.
Anybody who remembers dear old Price's candles will be amazed at what the
company is up to now - wax-filled tin buckets and mugs, diamond tea-lights,
hanging lanterns, as well as a wide range of candles scented with citronella
essence, which will not only suffuse the house with a tangy, lemony scent
but will also keep midges away. And for the purists, the firm still sells
its classic range.
Annick Goutal (stocked by Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, The Conran
Shop and Liberty as well as selected out-of-London shops) offers natural
stones impregnated with essences. These sit on a diffuser placed over a
light bulb and give off a subtle but delicious scent. They cost Pounds 39.50
and the scents are Fleur Blanche, Eau d'Hadrien, Rose Absolue, Passion and
Sables.
A specialist shop for all things fragrant is L'Artisan Parfumeur, 17 Cale
Street, London SW3 (071-352 4196).
The fragrance Ambre comes as a burning oil costing Pounds 21.95 for an
applicator top and two pressed ceramic rings. It also comes as a room spray
at Pounds 18.95, and for musty cars there is L'Eau de l'Auto Ambre at Pounds
16.50. However, most luxurious of all are the terracotta pomanders, filled
with ambergris, which provide a wonderful perfume in a wardrobe or chest of
drawers.
Tisserand is another name to look out for. It specialises in essential oils
and has a vast range of candles scented with everything from jasmine to
orange-blossom or sandalwood.
For occasions when use of a flame would be dangerous, it stocks two electric
devices. The first, the Aromastone (Pounds 23.90), comes in a little round
pot that gives off the scent of sandalwood, frankincense and other
fragrances from a range. The second, the Aromastream, which comes in a
little white unit (Pounds 23.90), looks boring but it dispenses cooler
fragrances, such as citrus.
My own personal preferences run to house-scents that veer towards the subtle
and understated and it is hard to beat the classics such as Rigaud's Cypres,
which costs Pounds 49.95 at The Conran Shop, and Czech &amp; Speake's plain
frosted-glass containers filled with candles perfumed with frankincense and
myrrh, rose and mimosa and costing Pounds 25 each.
Anybody who has ever been to Florence may have paid a visit to the Farmacia
Santa Maria Novella, which claims to be the oldest pharmacy in the world. A
branch has now opened at 117 Walton Street, selling the same delectably
perfumed lotions and potions. In particular, look out for Armeneia paper,
which is burnt to scent the air, perfumed drawer-lining paper and a
refreshing mint soap that repels insects.
Another little shop, La Bougie, has been open only two months at 5
Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge, London SW7 and specialises in nothing but
candles and candle appurtenances. It is modelled on the Paris shop of the
same name and is the place to look for strong and dramatic candelabra
(Pounds 80), wrought-iron candle-stands for floating candles (Pounds 11.80),
or a wrought-iron stand over 2ft high with a glass bowl for floating candles
(Pounds 95). And if by now you are tired of candles, you can restore your
flagging spirits with a glass of champagne and some seafood in the champagne
and oyster bar in the basement.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Heady brew for Scottish - The
Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY/WEDNESDAY: Two brewers' results this week will exemplify the
industry's trends and investors' intentions. Scottish &amp; Newcastle (Monday)
has outperformed Bass (Wednesday) in both beer and stock markets. The main
factors behind the rise in S&amp;N's interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds
145m (Pounds 109m) are the acquisition of the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain and
expansion of its Center Parcs holiday villages. Bass is expected to report a
more modest rise in pre-tax profits for the year ended September to about
Pounds 540m from Pounds 508m.
MONDAY/TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY/FRIDAY: The regional electricity companies' interim results season
gets into full swing with the City expecting high dividend increases
following the 21 per cent rise announced on Thursday by Seeboard. Midlands
(Tuesday), Swalec (Wednesday) and Norweb (Friday) are all expected to raise
payments to shareholders by at least 15 per cent, and possibly considerably
more. Profit growth will also be healthy. Northern Ireland Electricity
(Monday) is expected to raise dividends by about 15 per cent, while Scottish
Hydro-Electric (Thursday) probably will be less generous, with a rise of 8
to 12 per cent expected.
TUESDAY: Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, is
expected to report interim profits of about Pounds 117m (Pounds 94.2m) and a
dividend roughly 10 per cent ahead to just over 4p. The company's recovery
in the US has been a key attraction for investors.
TUESDAY: NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, is expected to
announce full-year profits for the year to September of around Pounds 110m
before tax and exceptional items, compared with Pounds 95m. Attention will
be focused firmly on news of an appointment of a new chief executive
following the company's fall-out with Peter Sherlock in August.
WEDNESDAY: Pre-tax profits at Carlton Communications, the television and TV
services group, are expected to jump from Pounds 126.1m to between Pounds
169m and Pounds 180m for the year to the end of September. It is likely the
company will come in at the top end of the range, boosted by the first
profits from Central TV.
THURSDAY: Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retailing, financial
services and property group, is expected to announce an 8 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 213.2m to about Pounds 230m.
Attention will again focus on the secretive group's Pounds 1.5bn cash pile,
with last month's share buy-back by Boots having rekindled speculation that
GUS might make a similar move.
FRIDAY: Analysts expect profits at GEC for the half-year to September 30 to
rise by Pounds 10m to Pounds 370m with the interim dividend up to 2.95p from
2.81p. The power systems division may have done well but the medical
equipment business in the US has been struggling.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (12): Make sure everything's on the
record - Know your adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the widespread concern over the quality of financial advice offered
by insurance companies and independent advisers, the regulators' rules on
pre-sale client interviews are very vague.
According to the Personal Investments Authority, the new regulator for
financial services, independent advisers and company representatives 'must
record the personal financial information necessary to make a
recommendation' and ensure that the suitability of the product is assessed
'in the light of the information provided'.
In the absence of clear ground-rules, it is important to know what details
an adviser needs in order to select the right products for you. IFA
Promotions, a trade organisation sponsored by 15,000 independent financial
advisers and 45 insurance companies, publishes a detailed 'fact find'
questionnaire which covers three important areas:
What are your financial goals? For example, are you seeking advice on
family-protection insurances, retirement planning, investing for income or
capital growth, or tax planning?
What is your attitude to risk? Do you have any professional or business
experience of investments? Do you have strong views on where your money is
invested?
What are your current financial commitments - for example mortgages,
overdrafts, other loans, credit-card balance and hire-purchase liabilities?
You will also be asked detailed questions about your family and personal
financial circumstances. Joanne Hindle, chief executive officer at IFAP,
said: 'Some investors may regard this as an invasion of privacy, but it is
important to remember that the suitability of the adviser's recommendations
can only be as accurate as the information on which he based his decision.'
Getting good financial advice is a two-way process, so don't let your
adviser do all the talking. Ideally, you should interview several firms
before appointing your adviser, and ask the following questions:
How long has the firm been trading? New firms should be investigated
thoroughly.
What areas of specialist advice does the firm offer? Does it appear to have
the resources to cover these in depth?
What are the qualifications of the staff, and how senior is the adviser you
will deal with?
How many clients does it have? Can you get any references?
What research resources does it have? Advisers must have access to a
comprehensive database that can rank investment and insurance products
according to performance, product flexibility and charges.
If the adviser is fee-based, how much will the advice cost per hour/case? If
commission-based, how much will the adviser receive? Will non-commission
products (eg, National Savings) still be recommended?
You should also check with the Securities and Investments Board central
register that the firm is authorised and registered with the appropriate
regulator.
Further information: For a list of fee-based advisers in your area, phone
the Money Management Register on 0117-9 769444, and give your home and work
address. IFA Promotions offers a free factsheet, 'Look at how your IFA is
Paid', a list of key questions to ask, and the names of three advisers near
your home or work address (phone 01483 461 461). To contact the SIB central
register, phone 0171 929 3652.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Gilt issues - best value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to higher
rate taxpayers.

FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Take the silk road to oriental success -
Avril Groom finds this season's Eastern styling full of promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oriental exoticism which spices this year's Christmas dressing has
fascinated Westerners for thousands of years. Alexander the Great's men
brought richly-glinting textiles from Persia to Europe, and the Silk Road to
China was already long-established when Marco Polo returned to Venice in
1295 with fabrics and fables from the court of Kublai Khan.
Over the next 500 years, the West made full use of luscious embroideries and
brocades from India and China, but the most far-flung destination of all,
Japan, remained a closed book until the middle of last century. Then, a
young draper's manager named Arthur Liberty became enthralled by the first
display of Japanese artefacts in Britain  - at the International Exhibition
of 1862 - and resolved to open an oriental shop.
Japanese fabrics had already caught the imagination of the Pre-Raphaelite
artists, and Liberty set out to supply them. So, by the time he opened his
shop in 1875, its distinctive character - a heady mix of the Orient and the
latest in contemporary design, then personified by the Arts and Crafts
movement - had already and quite naturally come into being.
Other exotic crazes followed, but over the past 100 years the yen for ethnic
fashion has periodically led Western designers to turn eastwards for
inspiration.
Many designers have this season explored oriental themes. By inventive new
cutting and experimenting with hi-tech fabrics respectively, Yohji Yamamoto
and Issey Miyake constantly rework the kimonos and Haori coats which are
their heritage. Jean-Paul Gaultier has switched his ethnic attentions to the
padded silk and fur trims of Mongolia.
But the special mix of delicate period detail and bold modernity belongs to
one man - the British Designer of the Year, John Galliano, profiled on page
4 - whose tiny collection of 18 outfits has altered the image of
evening-wear from designer stores to the High Street.
Galliano's girl is at first sight a porcelain-fragile geisha, or a portrait
of the bejewelled captive Chinese concubine, whose life-story forms the
extraordinary early chapters of Jung Chang's Wild Swans. Yet other elements
 -high-heeled shoes and seamed stockings, a tailored jacket or a
body-caressing bias-cut skirt - make her firmly a creature of the 1990s.
This clever mix of ancient oriental and modern European strikes a chord with
today's woman, who reserves her right to be, and look, both strong and
vulnerable.
To mix successfully Eastern mystery with up-front modernity, soft-pedal the
oriental. Rather than look like a stray from the chorus of Madam Butterfly
you want to suggest a mood through detail. Galliano does it to perfection -
a black satin jacket has straight, upturned, kimono-style lapels and
trumpet-shaped, contrast-lined sleeves, yet it is still traditionally
tailored and double-breasted. His precision-cut designs (available at
Liberty, Brown's and Joseph) are highly priced, but even the beautiful
embroidered silk obis (sashes) that go with them would, at Pounds 140, be
enough to capture the spirit if worn with a plain black, fluted or bias-cut
dress.
Oriental colour schemes, so often based on red or gold, add seasonal
brightness with an unusual slant to the eternal sea of evening black. Plain
velvet trousers leap to life when teamed with an frog-fastened silk jacket
from Monsoon that has a subtle, fitted, rather than boxy Chinese, cut.
A long skirt, based by Yohji Yamamoto on traditional Japanese fabric wraps
and richly printed on fiery red, its texture derived from old kimono silk,
needs nothing more than a matt-black T-shirt to balance its drama.
Issey Miyake inimitably modernises ancient shapes: his sunset-orange jacket
has a hint of the kimono in its print and slanted edges, while its pleats
mould flatteringly to the body in contemporary style. It looks topically
hard-edged with lacquer-shiny PVC jeans (Top Shop's at Pounds 29.99, are a
good version of this one-season buy). Whistles gets in the mood with a
chinoiserie print on satin but it makes it up in voguishly nostalgic, and
very European, bias-cut shapes.
Liberty is still the happy hunting ground of orientalists. The store has a
tradition of buying oriental jewellery and accessories. This time it is the
influence, rather than the letter, of oriental style that is appropriate,
such as the little tassled brocade bag illustrated.
Fenwick is also a good source of period-style glass-bead jewellery,
carefully made and reasonably priced, from Erickson Beamon and Robert Rose.
Long strings of jet-look beads start from Pounds 24.95. Evening scarves
include a fringed black-velvet style, lined in red satin and embroidered in
gold (Mondi, Pounds 95) while crocheted, beaded drawstring bags are Pounds
21.95.
Natasha Barrault's fragile, beaded organza bags (from Pounds 200, at
Browns), Colette Maluf's tiny diamante-spangled hairpins and slides (from
Pounds 22 at Space NK, WC2), Wonderful Wraps' tassled and padded, velvet and
satin stoles, and Herbert Johnson's nostalgic half-hats and headbands all
have just the right mood of delicately louche Eastern promise.
Special pieces, such as Yamamoto's sarong or Galliano's obi, have the making
of modern heirlooms. But if you have time and energy, searching for antique
originals is rewarding. The Gallery of Antique Costumes and Textiles, Church
Street, London NW8, Cornucupia, Tachbrook Street, SW1 and antique markets
often have a little vintage chinoiserie. Even jumble sales can come up
trumps.
Years ago at one I unearthed a large fringed scarf in black Chinese silk,
traditionally embroidered in white. It has elicited more comment than any of
the little black designer dresses it has been worn with.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Such rank ingratitude - Gilts /
Reaction to the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke must feel slightly disappointed by the government bond
market's grudging reaction to this week's Budget. After all, the rosy
picture painted by the chancellor of an economy growing strongly, with low
inflation and healthy public finances, should be exactly what any sensible
bond investor wants to hear.
Yet, gilt prices tumbled while he was speaking and have since recovered only
slowly.
The trouble is that most of his good news had been heard before: he simply
confirmed what investors knew. Thus, the gilt market largely ignored it and
sagged after hearing of a borrowing requirement for the present financial
year of Pounds 34 1/2 bn (the City was looking for a figure closer to Pounds
30bn), plus the lack of more concrete proposals for an open repurchase (or
'repo') market for gilts.
Another disappointment was the Budget's failure to extend the coverage of
personal equity plans (Peps) to include gilts.
One welcome surprise, however, was the extension of Peps to include
corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares.
Although details are still unclear, the prices of those corporate bonds most
likely to be included rose significantly to outperform gilts as the week
progressed.
Michael Dyson, of securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says: 'It
provides the opportunity for people who invest for income purposes to obtain
a higher income from their Peps without buying high-yielding shares.'
And Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, estimates that corporate bond
Peps could attract between Pounds 400m and Pounds 800m a year.
The Budget contained a few other surprises that may provide solace for gilt
investors in the longer term. One was the chancellor's prediction of a
current account deficit down from Pounds 10 1/2 bn last year to only Pounds
4bn this year - and falling even lower in 1995.
If this is right, then the UK's dependency on inflows of foreign finance is
declining gradually, along with its vulnerability to shifts in international
investor sentiment. This is a boost following a year in which countries with
the largest current account deficits have been hit hardest by the global
shake-out in bond markets.
A further surprise was what Clarke's economic forecasts implied about the
future path of UK interest rates.
His prediction of strong growth combined with subdued inflation has led many
City analysts to advance their forecasts of when the next batch of rate
rises will take place.
Economists at BZW now think rates, at present 5 3/4 per cent, will rise to 7
per cent by the middle of next year. Before the Budget, they were not
expecting them to hit that level before the end of 1995.
The first rate rises could come soon. On Wednesday, Clarke and Eddie George,
the governor of the Bank of England, meet to discuss the situation. And
while most analysts expect them to wait until January, the eventual increase
is likely to be welcomed by investors and spur the gilt market.
Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Budget was Clarke's talk of future
tax reductions.
His remark that the Tories 'are tax-cutters by instinct' will have served
only to remind gilt investors of past pre-election give-aways.
Indeed, if this Budget was remarkable for anything, it was in marking a
policy shift away from the fiscal restraint of its predecessors in recent
years towards what is likely to be a tax-cutting Budget next time.
But cuts, just at a time in the economic cycle when the output gap is
closing and inflationary pressures are really beginning to bite, are hardly
a comforting prospect for gilt investors even if interest rates do rise
quickly.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Better than a slow handclap -
London / The Budget's effect in the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Kenneth Clarke was expecting the markets to give his second Budget the
same rapturous reception as his first he will have been disappointed. After
a yawn the City quickly picked up where it left off.
For the share market this meant worrying about Wall Street and interest
rates.
London shares started the week in a more cheerful mood, in line with New
York, but following the muted reaction to the Budget started to fret about
rates again. In the US, there were fears that the Federal Reserve may
increase rates again before Christmas. Back home Clarke did nothing to help
by using the threat of higher rates as a whip to corral potential Tory
strays.
Short sterling contracts, which reflect the immediate interest rate outlook,
fell steadily through the week with some traders predicting a rate rise
following Wednesday's meeting between Clarke and the governor of the Bank of
England. The consensus is that Clarke will want to wait, at least until
January.
In the gilts market short-dated issues weakened slightly but at the long end
prices firmed on the grounds that the tone of the Budget improved the
longer-term outlook for rates.
Sceptics suggested Clarke was being less tough than he looked, and predicted
he would cut and run when the election loomed. But even they had to admit
the sharply falling budget deficit presents a bright background for gilts.
On the chancellor's forecasts, he will have to sell around Pounds 18bn of
gilts next financial year and less than Pounds 10bn the year after.
With UK institutions' appetite for gilts increasing they should continue to
outperform other bond markets, pulling equities along in their wake.
But shares found little excitement in the Budget apart from Clarke's
decision not to cut advance corporation tax further - yet.
The impact on particular stock market sectors was also undramatic although
Clarke could not resist the temptation to introduce another new tax. This
time it was a proposed levy on all waste going into landfill sites. Due to
be introduced in 1996 it seems bound to hit the profits of companies such as
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the shares of which fell 5p to 85p over the week.
The hard-pressed construction sector also felt aggrieved with a sharp cut in
the government road building budget to add to its woes. But the changes to
amusement machine duty will hardly be noticed by market leaders such as
Bass.
Last year, a popular Budget (at least with the markets) was marred by a
string of disappointing results from leading companies. This time the
picture was reversed. Among the welcome corporate news the UK's two leading
conglomerates, Hanson and BTR, both issued reassuring trading statements,
though in BTR's case it did not have quite the desired effect.
A year ago Hanson failed to accompany its final results with an increased
dividend for the first time in its history. While the company blamed the
dull short-term earnings outlook the move renewed concerns about flagging
long-term prospects. But six months later Hanson stepped up the rate of its
quarterly dividend, as its highly cyclical businesses started to turn, and
this week it was brimming with optimism.
Over at BTR the City's main worry has been the pressure on its high margins
from rising raw materials costs. The shares tumbled in September when it
disclosed a small decline in margins in the first half. In this week's
trading statement it said that margins had improved in the second half
thanks to successful purchasing policies (that is, sharing the pain with its
suppliers) and some price increases. But the statement failed to prop the
shares which were further unsettled by news that it had appointed an
outsider as chief executive at Australian subsidiary Nylex.
Seeboard got the electricity reporting season off to a cracking start with a
21 per cent increase in its interim dividend and a Pounds 22m package of
rebates for customers. It also promised customers some of the benefits of
next year's Pounds 4bn flotation of the National Grid.
Electricity stocks had already been boosted by Clarke's decision not to
crack-down on tax efficient share buy-backs.
One of the companies that disappointed last year did so again this time.
Shares in Argyll fell 17p to 255p after it revealed that its Safeway chain
had seen a 0.8 per cent fall in underlying sales in the past six weeks in
spite of an aggressive marketing campaign. The City decided this was a
reflection of Safeway's particular circumstances rather than a warning
signal for the other leading supermarkets.
The week's nastiest shock was delivered by T &amp; N on Budget day (always a bad
sign). Once a leading supplier of asbestos T &amp; N announced a Pounds 100m
provision against future asbestos-related legal actions, just three months
after a US court ruling that indicated a declining trend in claims. The
shares took it very badly, falling by more than a quarter to 159p over the
week.
One of the clouds hanging over London equities is the threat that US mutual
funds will be forced to sell UK shares to meet a flood of redemptions from
unit-holders.
On Thursday, Emerson Electric of the US agreed a Pounds 204m takeover of
Powys-based electronic drives group Control Techniques. The terms
represented a 36 per cent premium to the market price before takeover
discussions were announced.
Yesterday, US waste group Browning-Ferris won control of Attwoods in spite
of a bizarre last-minute intervention by an obscure Canadian rival.
For Attwoods the white knight arrived too late. For Tory back-benchers
Clarke refused to play the part at all and might have expected slightly more
applause from the City in return.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): First, identify the right tiger . .
. - In the Pink / How investors should approach Asia
</HEADLINE>

David Roche, an expert on the emerging markets of south-east Asia, is
president of Independent Strategy, a new investment research boutique
The Asian boom is now a cliche. It is such a well-worn story that it will
not drive financial markets. What matters now is how Asia handles the many
hurdles to the next stage of development. How will these economies handle
the flood of capital that is coming their way?
Many suffer from the vice of excess virtue. As foreign money hits them,
their domestic liquidity rockets. To control liquidity, they could raise
interest rates. If they do, more foreign capital flows in. If rates are
lowered, the inflows turn into unsustainable levels of demand. The answer is
to let their currencies appreciate.
Can the new Asian tigers dismantle the many domestic structural impediments
to growth? Many have crassly inefficient domestic service sectors,
particularly in finance, agriculture and utilities. Some, like China, have
such poor banking systems and warped mandatory savings schemes that it is a
moot point whether high domestic savings (35 per cent of GDP) can be matched
with investment opportunities.
Asia is rather like a train being driven from the front by the hi-tech
economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, and from the rear by the
super-cheap producers of basic commodities like China, India and Vietnam.
Asian economies now do over 40 per cent of their external trade with each
other, which means they act as catalysts to each others' development. What
Thailand was competitive at producing last year, China is better at this
year. So Thai exports of textiles, shoes and toys fall while China's rocket,
and Thailand must move along the train to a new carriage that produces more
high-tech products.
The right way to shift economic gear from basic to high-tech products is to
let the currency rise. The alternative, and more damaging, choice is to let
domestic inflation price countries out of making traditional products. Most
Asian governments have yet to choose. Only Singapore has done the right
thing convincingly.
Asia is reaching its limits to growth. Published inflation figures do not
provide a good measure of over-heating in the region because many
governments control many prices (hardly a measure of a commitment to free
market economics) and then doctor the index. Nevertheless, inflation is
creeping towards the upper limit in most countries.
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia are virtually out of labour. Thailand, too, is
short of skills. Hong Kong and urban Malaysian property prices are just
another financial bubble driven by excess liquidity and silly low interest
rates.
The biggest challenge comes from the increasing 'sameness' of the growth
models in the region. The old model of Asian growth is over. The Korean and
Taiwanese economic model was based on fear and reality of war. The
over-riding economic principle was self-sufficiency. Japan's post-war leap
was based similarly, but without the external threat.
Economic strength was built with the bricks of huge trade surpluses, massive
domestic savings rates, and making sure they grew enough food, irrespective
of cost. Today, the result is a tangle of protectionist practices, internal
as well as external.
The old tigers' growth was often at the expense of world growth because the
trade and capital surpluses were kept in their domestic economies and not
recycled through imports or outward investment. At present, Japan acts as a
global vacuum cleaner of the world's money pile, accumulating current and
capital account surpluses, flogging the dollars it takes in, and keeping the
capital at home as excess savings. But the new tigers such as Malaysia,
Thailand and Indonesia have a completely different growth model.
Their economies are far more open to the world and they invest more than
they save; inward international investment can be as high as 6 per cent of
GDP. International trade accounts for a quarter of Korea's GDP and only a
tenth of Japan's, but it makes up three-quarters of Malaysia's. The result:
their internal growth adds to world growth rather than detracts from it.
China's model is more like the new tigers than the old. Its leaders will
squeeze every last drop of juice from the fruit of growth straight into the
glass of its 1.2bn consumers - because they know that, otherwise, their rule
will end.
Asia will be the particle accelerator of world trade, too. Within two years,
I think the biggest trade deficits for both the US and Europe will be with
China and not, as today, with Japan. That is as it should be. But the rich
countries will not allow China such a big slice of their prosperity for
nothing.
China and the rest of Asia will have to harmonise their economic models and
liberalise for reasons of trade and efficiency. That will make for many
losers among cosy government contractors, over-blown banks, and overstaffed
public utilities and food companies.
The major winners will be those countries that make the leap to high-tech
from low value-added products and stocks connected with this process. The
electronic stocks of Taiwan, Singapore and Korea are examples.
Indonesia should do well as a supplier of commodities and as a country with
labour costs below southern China. I would focus on infrastructure
development and forest products out there. Selected China B (Shanghai)
shares are cheap. They are in for a rough ride from currency depreciation
and Deng's eventual demise, but I would still put them away in my retirement
portfolio.
In the shorter term I think Japanese blue chip industrials will see their
profits boom as the yen declines and the productivity gains of moving plant
to Asia come through. They would be my big blue chip bet for next year.
India and Pakistan are just a bit too fashionable for my liking.
Those countries that fail to take the right steps will lose, and lose big.
The investment challenge will be to identify which Asian economies can adapt
best and move up the production train. That is the story that will make
investors more money than the Asian growth cliche.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Haunting glimpse of a future
imperfect - Wall Street / Bonds can see the light but the stock market omens
are gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In normal times, evidence of a strengthening economy is bad news for the
bond market and good news for the stock market. There are sensible reasons
for this: typically, economic growth feeds inflation. This undermines the
value of bonds but, at the same time, bolsters corporate earnings, which
boosts the value of company's share prices.
These, however, are anything but normal times. Take yesterday. The US
government released one of the most encouraging monthly employment reports
in recent years. The statistics showed that an impressive 350,000 people
were added to non-farm payrolls in November (analysts had predicted an
increase of about 250,000). Also, the national unemployment rate last month
fell from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent, an unexpected decline which took the
jobless rate to its lowest since August 1990.
Yet, contrary to traditional behaviour, the November jobs data prompted a
surge in bonds and a decline in stocks. By mid-morning yesterday, the
30-year bond price was up more than three-quarters of a point and its yield
back below 8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had retreated
from early gains and was below 3,700 for the first time since early July.
What was going on?
In a word: 'decoupling'. Ever since the Dow plunged more than 90 points on
November 22, Wall Street has been talking about the decoupling of the stock
and bond market. Although share prices have not crashed to the extent of
bond prices, stocks have been following the Treasury market's lead for the
best part of this year.
Investors in bonds feared rising inflation and rising interest rates -
worries that were shared by investors in stocks. They curbed their demand
for equities even though the inflation data remained reassuring and rising
interest rates appeared to be having little impact upon economic or
corporate earnings growth.
Now, however, the paths of the two markets appear to have diverged. In the
past 10 days, the Dow has fallen 3.7 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index, a broader measure of stock market performance, has slipped 2.6 per
cent. Bond prices, however, have risen over that period, lowering the yield
on the long bond from 8.1 to 7.9 per cent.
The gains in bonds have been all the more remarkable because recent data has
showed few signs of any impending slow-down in the economy. Just the
opposite, in fact. This week alone, figures on third-quarter gross domestic
product (revised upwards), consumer confidence (at a four-year high), retail
sales (strong), manufacturers' purchases (at high levels) and employment
(robust) all pointed to continued growth in economic activity.
The bond market's rally in the face of such seemingly-negative data reflects
an important shift in opinion among investors. Confident in the belief that
the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy (six interest
rate increases in the past 10 months) will slow growth significantly next
year and subdue any inflationary pressures in the economy, investors are now
impervious to bad (ie, good) news on the economy. After a dark and dismal 10
months, the bond market can see light at the end of the tunnel.
For the stock market, however, that light represents an oncoming train
which, in the form of an economic contraction (or, quite possibly, a
full-blown recession) is going to smash into corporate profits, equity
valuations and investor sentiment. In anticipation of that collision, some
investors are already taking flight. This week, fund managers reported that,
for the the first time in a long while, investors have begun to take more
money out of stock mutual funds than they have been putting in.
Much of those cash outflows are heading into more money-market funds or bank
certificates of deposit which offer investors a combination of security and
increasingly attractive comparable yields. Although it is too early to tell
if this trend will be sustained, the sight of money flowing out of mutual
funds is a troubling portent for a market that has feasted on huge demand
from equity funds for the best part of four years.
To make matters worse, foreign investors also are shying away from the stock
market because of concerns about the outlook for earnings and share prices.
In the second quarter (the latest period for which data is available),
foreign investors sold a net Dollars 2.2bn of US stocks. It was the first
time since mid-1992 that institutions and individuals overseas had sold more
US stocks than they had bought.
When the foreign investors' sales, the outflows of cash from stock mutual
funds, and the string of recent circulars from Wall Street broking houses
recommending clients to cut their holdings of equities are all put together,
the omens for the market are not good.
In a week when the latest musical version of Charles Dickens' Christmas
Carol opened on Broadway, the stock market got a glimpse of its future. It
was a haunting sight.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): Candour is always the best
policy - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I is for insurance. . . It's also for injustice, something which people can
feel a great sense of when an insurance claim is scaled down or rejected
altogether.
As a general rule it is is worth arguing the toss when an insurance company
says no. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that those who don't ask
don't get.
Claims can, however, be turned down for legitimate reasons. The two best
ways to avoid disappointment are to be honest with the insurance company,
and to know what a policy covers. Unfortunately, neither is easy.
The onus is on the person taking out insurance to disclose anything that may
be relevant to the insurer's decision on whether to take on - or continue
underwriting - a risk, and how much premium to charge. You should not wait
to be asked questions which would elicit the relevant information.
In practice, it is easy to forget crucial information or to answer a
question wrongly. Visits to the doctor over apparently small ailments, minor
thefts you did not report to the police, and modifications to a car could
all affect different types of insurance. A claim can be rejected (and a
policy invalidated) even though the claim has nothing to do with the
information you fail to disclose.
It is always worth reading an insurance policy when you get it, and
preferably before you buy, to find out what is covered. A house contents
insurance policy, for example, will only pay out on the items covered up to
the value covered.
It will only pay out for certain 'perils', and then there are likely to be
exclusions, limits, especially for valuables, and excesses. There may also
be extra conditions which, for instance, stipulate that you must effect
specific security precautions.
The point about taking time to examine a policy is that you will be able to
go back to the broker or insurance company and see whether there is a policy
with extra cover of the sort that you need.
In practice, you are likely to need a broker if you want anything other than
standard insurance. If you have a work of art, a cellar full of vintage
wine, fine furniture or a classic car, a specialist can help track down the
best deal.
One source of information used by professionals is The Insurance Buyer's
Guide from Kluwer. It has details on a huge range of both commercial and
personal areas where insurance is available, including: juggling, multiple
births, kidnapping, sheep-worrying, gymkhanas, houseboats, property abroad,
thatched roofs, personalised number plates and so on.
Bookshops can order The Insurance Buyer's Guide. Alternatively, write to
Kluwer Publishing Ltd, Croner House, London House, Kingston upon Thames,
Surrey KT2 6SR. It costs Pounds 33 plus Pounds 1.10 postage and packing.
That can be a small price to pay if you have valuable items which should be
properly insured. The next edition of this annual publication is due out in
March.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (11): Back smaller companies and be
patient - Japanese markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan seemed the place to be for many investors early this year. After falls
in other stock markets around the world this spring, Tokyo was the only
place where optimism seemed justified.
The market there was still at less than half its peak level. Deregulation
and restructuring of the Japanese economy and industry seemed to promise new
opportunities for growth, and economic recovery looked set to take off. For
a while, it seemed that the stock market would follow suit - but its
performance has been disappointing.
While foreign fund managers poured money into the market in the first half
of the year, Japanese individuals and institutions kept their hands in their
pockets and their money on deposit. The main Nikkei index is no higher than
it was for most of 1993, and in late November it slipped below 19,000 for
the first time in nine months.
The over-the-counter market (OTC) in smaller companies fell just as
dramatically as the main index in 1990, only to rise again, then fall yet
further by mid-1992. It has since bounced back a little, with the first
signs of a recovery. Overall, the OTC market has outperformed the main
Nikkei index substantially over the last five years.
Some investors have taken advantage of this trend by putting their money
into unit and investment trusts specialising in Japanese smaller companies.
It is no surprise that three of the five top-performing Japanese unit trusts
over a five-year period are specialists in smaller companies - two trusts
managed by Schroders and one by Dunedin. Of course, outperformance by
smaller companies tends to be cyclical.
In the late 1980s, Tokyo was briefly the world's biggest stock market. It is
now back in second place, behind New York, but still deserves a place in
every serious investor's portfolio. The main choice for private investors is
between general Japan funds (there is a broad choice of both unit and
investment trusts) and those concentrating on smaller companies. Or, if you
prefer to spread your bets a little, you could pick a fund that invests in
the whole of the Far East including Japan.
More obsure areas, such as warrants or corporate bonds, can be exciting, but
are rarely accessible to individuals with modest amounts of money to invest.
Buying individual Japanese stocks is not recommended for private
individuals.
The Japanese stock market often moves in a different direction from the rest
of the world, so it can be seen as a useful way of lowering risk and
diversifying your portfolio. However, currency fluctuations can complicate
matters: the strong yen has worked in favour of British investors recently,
but the situation could well be reversed in future.
Although Tokyo has been a disappointment so far this year, many analysts say
that the good times have only been postponed, not cancelled. The recovery
has been a little slower than expected, but Tokyo may still be a good home
for a little of your savings if you can afford to wait a few years for your
rewards.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Fashion: Madly modern among tapestries and marble - Me and
My Wardrobe / One woman's sartorial schizophrenia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If I buy so much as one more handkerchief, I'll have to move house]' says
Jill Ritblat, wife of John Ritblat, chairman of property company British
Land.
And so last month she gave her wardrobe to The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.
More than 100 outfits spanning three decades - Ungaro, Courreges, Mary
Quant, Saint Laurent, Comme des Garcons - are destined for the museum's
storerooms in what is the biggest single donation since it acquired the
Cecil Beaton collection.
She originally offered the V &amp; A just a few of what she thought were her
most interesting clothes, but to her amazement they wanted everything, even
hairpins and fluorescent socks. 'I had no idea,' she says, 'that what I
owned amounted to 'a collection'.'
So what does a woman wear when she has gone in for such a dramatic overhaul?
'I don't like to play the fashion game,' she declares dressed in pared down
Shirin Guild, while she unfolds her high-tech Issey Miyake pleats to admire
'the perfection of technique and technology'.
Her second husband, whom she married in 1986, is a traditionalist who
'doesn't like the avant garde in style or fashion'. He prefers his wife with
her hair back off her face and dressed in proper yet cute, mid-calf length
or short Valentino suits, high-heeled shoes and skin-toned fine stockings.
But his wife, a devotee of modern art, has different ideas: 'I like the
shock of the new. My husband sees me in a completely different way to how I
see myself . . . I don't like my face enough to shove all my hair back and
what makes me most uncomfortable is to be over-dressed. I prefer to err on
the side of being less dressed-up than I should be.'
Her solution is sartorial schizophrenia. Two wardrobes, one to please him
and one to please her. Ritblat's skill is in reducing her wardrobe to the
bare minimum, or 'systems' as she describes it.
'Both my husbands have wanted me to dress in a certain way. In 1966, aged
23, I married Elie Zilkha and wore a Dior wedding dress and a Dior haute
couture going-away outfit.' The honeymoon was in St Tropez.
'I woke up the next day and put on a pair of white jeans and a fisherman's
sweater, which I thought was very suitable and trendy but he took one look
and said it wouldn't do. I was taken to Mic Mac, Gunther Sachs' boutique,
and put in black crepe palazzo trousers and a yellow voile shirt. Obviously
you can't resent anyone making you do anything as delectable as buying
better clothes,' she says unconvincingly, 'but I had to go along with it. It
made him happy.'
She got the message. 'I had to shape up but I decided to do it in my own
way.' Her way was avant-garde - whether in sharp-edged Courreges, huge felt
cones by Zandra Rhodes or multi-patterned layers by Tuffin &amp; Foale worn
under a dramatic St Laurent highwayman's cape. There was often 'a most
hostile silence when I walked into a dinner party full of ladylike wives in
Geneva. I never imagined something so completely wonderful could provoke
such a reaction.'
But looks are not everything - Ritblat always has an eye for the dry
cleaning bills.
'On the first day of a trip to the US, a waiter spilt raspberry coulis down
my Miyake top. I put the sleeves in the sink and the sauce just floated
away. I was amazed, I didn't even have to use soap. That's good design.'
By day (or night, if she is alone) you will find her in dramatic sculptural
shapes, in innovative materials such as her shiny, tar-black Issey Miyake
with a ridged back 'that looks like a dinosaur', opaque tights and flat
Philippe Model elasticated shoes, with a massive Hermes bag.
She puts her love of systems down to the fact that at heart she is happiest
in a uniform, a look that is well suited to her petite frame.
'When I was young, my mother was always putting me in the latest fashions -
candy stripe cottons with frills - which I thought were revolting. I much
preferred tomboy to doll.
'That's why I was so happy in my school uniform and later, when I trained
for the bar, in my black suits and white shirts. One of my favourite pieces
was a black Mao jacket that I bought off the back of a waiter in Los
Angeles. It was my ideal garment - practical, well-designed and easy.'
Ritblat felt most at ease with her look during the seven years when she was
officially without a man and enrolled at London University to read history
of art.
She felt no compulsion to wear sexy clothes to try to hook another man.
During those years she dressed in Margaret Howell jumpers and fun clothes
from Kenzo.
Marriage to John required a change. 'In order to please him I wear Valentino
and Ungaro in the evening. To me, Ungaro is bimbo dressing, although some of
the fabrics are quite beautiful. For 'thinking crumpet' one's better in
Comme des Garcons or Miyake, Romeo Gigli's shirts or my new find, easy like
a school uniform, Shirin Guild.
'And I used to love Victor Edelstein, who came somewhere between bimbo and
thinking crumpet. I respected him enormously.'
If she were 18 again what would she wear, I wondered. 'Oh, I haven't looked
at an 18-year-old for at least a week,' she retorts, registering her
impression that fashion moves that fast now. 'I suppose I'd cut my hair very
short and wear those wonderful clumpy shoes and a pelmet (short skirt) . . .
and I suppose leather. But I hate to see young people in expensive clothes -
they don't need to waste the money.'
And her definition of real chic? 'When you're not sure whether it goes
together or not, that element of surprise.'
Ritblat's sense of modernity is played out in her public role as
contemporary art benefactor. She is on the board of the New Contemporaries
and is currently curating a show in Switzerland with Damien Hirst, the
controversial conceptual artist.
At gallery openings she dresses for the part in avant garde
conversation-stoppers almost invariably in urban black, or in a
well-thought-out statement, such as a 1969 Ungaro pop art dress for the Pop
Art opening at the Royal Academy, three years ago.
It is strange talking to madly modern and minimalist Ritblat, sitting in her
husband's tapestried, ormolued and marbled drawing-room. The conflicting
styles seem to jar.
But as I leave she shows me her favourite room, the kitchen. It is a temple
of machine-age modernism. Clean, sharp lines speak of time-saving,
efficiency. That's better - a room that suits the psyche.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Tax threat - Life assurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON and ANGUS JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: New rules to be introduced in May 1996 may tax the regular
'income' withdrawals from certain life assurance policies, writes Debbie
Harrison.
WHAT IT MEANS: The proposed change could take the gloss off these products
for higher-rate taxpayers.
Under certain life assurance savings plans, the fund, not the individual,
pays tax that is broadly equivalent to the basic rate on both income and
capital gains. Investors can withdraw up to 5 per cent of the value of the
original capital each year. For those on the basic tax rate, there is no
extra to pay, while higher-rate taxpayers can defer any further liability
until the plan matures.
Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private client
banking and asset management group, says: 'If these withdrawals are taxed in
the hands of the individual, the tax advantages will disappear for
higher-ratepayers.'
Angus Jones, account manager with stockbroker Capel Cure Myers, adds: 'These
policies have been oversold by insurance companies, which have told
prospective clients (including basic-rate taxpayers) that there is a 5 per
cent per annum tax-free withdrawal facility. 'This is blatantly not true
because the fund has already been taxed internally at 25 per cent.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A flexible friend when you
retire - Annuities / But strict regulatory controls are needed to avoid
abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: Flexible annuities, which allow you to draw a regular income
from your pension fund while keeping the rest invested fully, will be
available by mid-1995.
WHAT IT MEANS: If you have a personal pension, retirement annuity or
executive plan, you can now take about 25 per cent of your fund at
retirement as tax-free cash and must use the rest to buy an annuity from a
life office which guarantees to pay a regular (taxed) income for life.
The annuity rate - that is, the guaranteed income you secure with your
investment - is determined by your age (the older you are, the better the
rates); sex (women tend to out-live men, so their rates are lower to reflect
this); and prevailing annuity rates, which are determined largely by yields
on long-term gilts.
As gilt prices fluctuate, so also do annuity rates. In January, these were
up to 40 per cent lower than in May 1990. Moreover, once you hand over your
money you cannot change anything and, in most cases, the whole fund is
forfeited on death.
The flexible version, if used wisely, will help you avoid the annuity
troughs and allow you to defer the annuity purchase until rates improve, or
by age-75 at the latest.
Brian Hurl, marketing director of independent adviser Lexis, explains: 'At
retirement, you can still take your tax-free cash. The rest of the fund acts
like a bank account, from which you draw your taxed income. You can invest
the remainder in a range of insurance company pension funds which allow you
to spread the risk according to your circumstances.'
During the deferment period, any growth in the fund will continue to build
up tax-free. Simon Philip, director of personal finance with chartered
accountant Binder Hamlyn, says: 'The investment of the fund must be geared
to provide the right amount of income at the right time. Pensioners hoping
to lock in to annuity rates when these improve should keep the fund in
relatively low-risk assets to avoid the impact of stock market volatility at
the time they want to buy their annuity.' Sophisticated investors should be
able to run their own portfolio or appoint a stockbroker for this function
under a 'self-invested' flexible annuity.
The amount of income you can withdraw will be based on what you could get
under a conventional annuity. The Revenue will check the income level every
three years to make sure you have sufficient assets to cover your later
retirement years. But if you are to retire shortly and want to consider a
flexible annuity, you might have to fall back on savings to cover income
requirements between now and next summer.
On paper, the flexible annuity looks good. In practice there are several
important cautions. First, conventional annuities offer a rock-solid
guarantee. Once you move away from this, you enter a risk zone.
Second, when you buy a conventional annuity, you pay a one-off charge to
cover all its costs. But the annual administration and investment charges
associated with running a flexible annuity will be much higher in the long
term. As a result, it will be a viable option only for those with a minimum
of Pounds 100,000 in their fund at retirement.
Third, this product represents a lucrative new market for advisers and life
office salesmen. Instead of losing clients at retirement, there is a chance
to keep them on their books for another 10 to 15 years.
Moreover, the flexibility appears to apply only to personal pensions. So,
there might be a temptation to switch clients out of occupational schemes
and into personal pensions just before retirement. The Securities and
Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator, is now dealing with thousands
of cases where personal pensions were sold wrongly to those with company
scheme benefits.
The message is clear: strict regulatory controls over sales procedures for
flexible annuities are essential to prevent another pensions scandal.
High earners
The ceiling on pension contributions and benefits for some high earners will
rise in line with price inflation for the 1995-96 tax year to Pounds 78,600
(Pounds 76,800 in 1994-95). The earnings 'cap' affects company pension
schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and those who joined a scheme after
June 1 1989.
For the 1995-96 tax year, the maximum contribution for capped employees will
be Pounds 52,400, while the maximum tax-free cash will be Pounds 117,900.
The contribution limits (but not the benefit limits) apply to personal
pensions.
High earners planning a change of job should examine the pension
implications. Even if they are not caught by the cap now, the act of leaving
an old scheme and entering a new one will trigger the earnings cap rules.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Now you can pay in more -
Friendly societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: The maximum payments to life assurance savings plans sold by
friendly societies increase from Pounds 200 to Pounds 270 a year and from
Pounds 18 to Pounds 25 a month, writes Debbie Harrison. The proceeds on
plans cashed in early, now limited to a return of premiums, will be
improved. Both changes take effect from when the Finance Bill gets royal
assent in May.
WHAT IT MEANS: For historic reasons, friendly societies have been allowed to
run very tax-efficient savings plans for small savers. Under their
qualifying life assurance policies, the fund grows free of tax and the
proceeds at maturity are tax-free. The great problem has been the smallness
of the amount you can pay in.
The increase to Pounds 270 a year will certainly make these policies more
attractive, particularly as existing policyholders can also take advantage
of the improved terms. The only point to watch with friendly societies is
the level of charges, which can be high compared with the level of
contributions.
From January, these charges must be disclosed before you sign up - so do
shop around. Bear in mind that the maximum applies to the individual. You
cannot exceed the limit by taking out several policies with different
friendly societies.
The improvement to early surrender terms is very welcome. Now, if you cash
in a qualifying friendly society endowment policy within the first 7 1/2
years, or a whole-life policy within the first 10, it will lose its
tax-exempt status. The most you will get back is the premiums you paid in.
This restriction will be removed.
Lindsay Firth McGuckin, head of marketing at the Liverpool Victoria, says:
'We are pleased we can improve terms for early surrenders, although we will
continue to stress that this is a long-term savings contract.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): Yields are high, but tread
warily - Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a difficult year for the UK government bond market. Its
reputation as a 'safe' choice for private investors has taken a battering as
bond prices have plummeted by more than 16 per cent since January, and gilt
yields have risen by more than 2.4 percentage points to 8.6 per cent
currently.
However, there are now some encouraging signs of a recovery in the
gilt-edged market, and some fund managers and financial advisers are
recommending a return to gilts. Buying bonds at such low prices may be too
good a chance to miss. And with yields of more than 8 1/2 per cent on the
10-year gilt, the returns for the long-term investor can be extremely
attractive. However, the private investor should continue to tread warily.
After 1993's bull market, investor confidence suddenly vanished at the
beginning of 1994. The watershed was the rise in US interest rates on
February 4, which sent shockwaves through the world's bond markets. Prices
fell on the fear that economic recovery in the US and Europe would be
inflationary and lead to sharply higher interest rates worldwide.
The gilts market was particularly badly hit by these fears, partly because
its recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow European
countries, and partly because of the UK authorities' poor record in
controlling inflation. The UK did not help its cause by making a badly-timed
cut in base rates just four days after the Fed's first increase. The size of
the UK government budget deficit also weighed heavily on the gilts market.
Almost 10 months later, however, the fundamentals are looking increasingly
favourable for gilts. Inflation remains subdued, and Britain's finances are
looking a lot healthier than those of other European countries. UK
short-term interest rates have risen, from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent,
but this increase was generally welcomed as well-timed step to head off
future inflation.
'The gilt market's bad year is now over,' said Mr David Kauders, a portfolio
manager based in the West of England with about Pounds 22m under management
for private clients. He expects the bull market to resume within the next
six months as investors realise that inflation and interest rates are set to
remain low.
He says there are 'some big hints out there for the personal investor' -
yields of 8 1/2 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent gross yield on
equities, and the likelihood of legislation forcing pension funds to hold
more gilts. His advice is: buy medium-dated gilts at par and sit tight.
Mr Robert McHenry, an investment director at Lombard Odier, which has
Dollars 4.5bn under management in fixed interest, is currently favouring
two-year gilts. 'We remain cautious about gilts, but there is a lot of bad
news already priced into the market, particularly in the two-year area of
the yield curve. There is room for improvement there,' he said. He also
thinks the yields, of around 3.9 per cent, currently available on
index-linked gilts are quite generous.
Many City analysts agree that the revival in gilts is likely to continue, at
least until early next year. In the longer term, however, many analysts
think that growing inflationary pressures will once again undermine bond
prices. It will take some time yet for the gilt-edged market to rescue its
tarnished reputation.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (9): Free of the old routine? Not
quite - Home-working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Homework was what teachers expected you to devote your evenings to, and the
reason why parents implored you to switch off Top of The Pops.
But homeworking may be altogether more palatable. It means earning your
living from home, with flexibility over working hours, no commuting and
freedom from memos, meetings and office politics.
Many homeworkers will be self-employed. Others will be employees, also known
as teleworkers, wired up through computers and fax machines to the companies
they work for. Working from home has many attractions, but take care of all
financial aspects. Advice is available from books, banks and professional or
trade bodies. Here we touch on some of the common pitfalls.
Insurance: Inform the company that insures your home and contents that you
are working from home. It might require you to install extra security
devices.
There may also be a problem getting cover for business equipment, such as
computers. You could be asked to pay an extra premium, or may need to go to
a broker to buy a specialist policy.
Likewise, tell your insurer if you are using your car for work.
Replacing an employer's benefits: Sick pay, life insurance and pension
schemes are a part of a typical employment package. If you are a
self-employed homeworker, consider taking out permanent health insurance,
which pays out when you are too ill to work.
Private medical insurance, to pay for hospital bills, is also an option. If
a health problem hinders your ability to work, long NHS waiting lists could
damage the long-term viability of your business.
Adequate life insurance is important for anyone with dependants. And a
personal pension plan is an essential part of the financial planning
armoury, not least because the self-employed do not belong to the state-run
Serps pension scheme. You normally need to make sizeable contributions to
achieve a decent pension.
Tax: If you are an employee working from home, you could incur a tax
liability on equipment supplied by your employer if you ever use it for
private purposes. But if you are self-employed you can claim capital
allowances for equipment that you buy.
Employees can claim some expenses, including a proportion of heating,
lighting and phone bills against income tax if it is a condition of their
employment that they work from home. The self-employed may be able to claim
many more expenses.
Good record-keeping is important, and investing in the services of an
accountant could pay for itself, if only for the first year or two until you
are confident enough to sort out tax (and National Insurance) yourself.
Vat: You may have to register and pay value-added tax if your turnover
exceeds Pounds 46,000 a year. And it is sometimes worth registering for Vat
on lower turnovers, if the amount of Vat on goods and services you buy
exceeds what you would pay.
Capital gains tax: If you use part of your home exclusively for work, you
could lose a proportion of the CGT exemption on your main home. Check with
your tax office.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (7): Why what you see is not what
you get - Forward pricing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin MacConnol
Nobody enjoys buying goods 'sight unseen' - which explains why some aspiring
investors are deterred by the forward-pricing system most unit trust funds
now adopt.
Forward pricing means that what you see is not what you get. If you are
buying or selling units today, you will not receive the price listed in the
current FT for forward-priced units (denoted by an 'F' in the listings).
Instead, the price you will receive is determined by the next valuation of
the fund after you place your order (most unit trusts value their units once
a day).
All this has the immediate look of a system which probably helps the fund
manager but not the investor. For instance, if you spot a rising market and
wish to buy into it, your money will get you less than you might have hoped
for - since you will only receive units at the rate of the next valuation.
Similarly, if your units are going through the floor, they will have sunk
even further by the time you sell - because, again, their worth is
determined at the next valuation.
So why do most unit trusts use forward pricing, rather than the alternative
'What you see is what you get' historic system (denoted by an 'H' in the FT
listings)?
Forward pricing gives existing investors more security. On any one day, only
a small minority of people are likely to be either buying or selling units
in a particular unit trust. Most will still have their money in the pot, and
it is their interests the fund manager is thinking about first and foremost.
With historic pricing, the assumption is that, on any given day, the fund
manager should be able to buy or sell units at the price listed in that
day's paper - ie, at yesterday's price. But prices move, and if the fund
manager is committed to historic pricing it could cost the overall fund to
pay yesterday's value for units.
Fund managers are confident that forward pricing is the more realistic way
of valuing units. You can even insist on having units forward priced by
those funds which still use the historic system.
For some people, forward pricing simply contributes to the confusion that
surrounds unit trusts; and much is being done to make them more
comprehensible to the ordinary investor.
Newspapers are no longer required to publish the cancellation price (the
lowest price at which the fund will buy back your units). Also, the prices
at which you can buy and sell units are now listed clearly as 'buying' and
'selling' prices in the FT, instead of under the old-fashioned and oblique
'bid/offer' titles. Next year, even this refinement is likely to be
superseded. It is expected that unit trusts will be given a single price
that refers to both buying and selling, in a further attempt to make them
easier to understand.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Fashion: Costume to wear on the world's stage - John
Galliano's theatrical designs can make anyone feel like a dramatic heroine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion world, like any other competitive milieu, can be an uncomradely
place to work. The pattern of its days is a rollercoaster of triumph and
disaster, and the price of success is often someone else's misfortune. The
rewards for success can be spectacular, but failure can also be very public
 -and a source of joy to rivals.
So although fashion people may appear to be extravagantly affectionate after
the manner of the theatre, they are often malicious, even, dare we say it,
bitchy. No name or reputation is safe from calumny.
But there are a handful of designers whose talent is so extraordinary that
even the most envious of competitors still their tongues, aware that a world
that lacks giants is dull indeed.
Among these heroes are Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto, Jean-Paul Gaultier,
Vivienne Westwood and, now, John Galliano.
Galliano was born in Gibraltar, where he was christened Juan Carlos Antonio.
He came to Britain with his parents and two sisters in 1966, when he was six
years old, and the family lived in Battersea, London, where John's father
worked as a plumber. The boy survived Wilson's Grammar School and went on to
study fashion design at St Martin's College of Art, where his graduation
collection caused the kind of sensation of which legends are made.
He called it Les Incroyables and based his designs on the clothing of
dandies during the French Revolution. Joan Burstein of Brown's in South
Molton Street, bought the whole collection, put it in her window, sold out
and came back to reorder.
Galliano, who had been all set to take a job as an illustrator in America,
decided to risk a career as a designer, and stayed in London. With a bunch
of friends - John is always surrounded by eager, admiring and adoring
friends - he made the second order on his mother's kitchen table.
In the ensuing decade, John Galliano has suffered his share of triumph,
disaster and calumny but, at present, no one has an unkind word to say. Karl
Lagerfeld has described his talent as 'a genius'. The fashion writers who
once found him and his work 'weird' are lavish in their accolades. The
stores that once wondered whether he would ever deliver are placing huge
orders and boasting that they 'have him'.
Galliano's new backer, John Bult, glows with entirely justified confidence
and gives him the space and support he needs. The supermodels adore him and
would show his clothes for free. They know that they will never look more
beautiful than they do in Galliano and they know they will rarely have quite
so much fun on the catwalk.
For at the heart of Galliano's clothes there is always a story, a romance,
or a heroine with a history. The women who model his clothes, who are so
often asked by other designers to slouch along slowly, wearing an
unflickeringly morose expression or a glazed, disengaged stare, are given a
chance to act - or, in the opinion of at least one person in the audience at
last October's Paris show, to over-act. 'To be someone,' is how the
supermodel Kate Moss expressed it.
When it comes to clothes, our modern pragmatism dictates that we need to
look clean, tidy, smartish, and fashion-aware, if not fashionable. We also
like to look affluent, possibly sexy and perhaps authoritative.
These are fairly simple demands to make of our clothes and they are fairly
simply answered. But, according to the historians and semioticians of dress,
all that is only part of the purpose of clothes.
Much more important is the magic element. Clothes speak a symbolic language
that everyone can interpret.
A character in a portrait, a play or a film is described by his or her
clothes. Beyond that simple description lie layers of associations, placing
the character in time and social milieu. Mere clothes can summon up for us
the smells, tastes, passions and preoccupations of the period in which the
character is supposed to have lived.
Those who design for the stage or for film are skilled at the business of
imparting huge amounts of information through shape, colour, texture and
detail, which the audience will absorb in a glance.
While the theatre designer, however, is working to a brief, to realise a
director's vision, Galliano, the fashion designer, is creating his own
mise-en-scene, his own heroine, and dressing her. For the 1995 spring
collection, this heroine is the haughty bohemian, opium-smoking poets' muse
called Misia. She is his well-researched starting point and the well-spring
of his creativity. But he is not merely costuming her, he is creating from
her life and wardrobe a collection of clothes that are both intensely
romantic, and emotive and also absolutely right for now.
The problem of how clothes can be simultaneously archaic and modern
perplexes those not used to the complexity of what makes fashion.
We use our clothes to tell those we encounter about ourselves and, more
importantly, to tell ourselves about ourselves. Dress is often,
surprisingly, not about its effect on an observer; it can be a very intimate
exercise in self-discovery. Put simply, fashion can be therapeutic.
The self-discovery element is a clue to why fashion (or very distinctive
minority styles of dress) is so important to the young and progressively
less important to us as we grow older.
While we are finding out who we are, we need to try on many roles for size.
We need to express aspects of our personalities that are hard to express in
any other way. The supermodels may be enviable, but they are young women
whose lives are full of hard work, discomfort and life-disrupting travel.
They have rather ordinary boyfriends, suffer from meretricious hangers-on,
go to banally wild parties and are fair game for exploiters of every sort.
So when they are told to play Galliano's muse, Misia, defined by Cocteau as
'one of those warm-blooded and deep women who live in the shadows of great
men and who, from the margins of artistic creation have a mysterious effect
merely by generating ring-like waves more beautiful than necklaces', they go
for it.
There may not be a Misia deep inside every woman, but she is an aspect
buried in most of us, and life offers her few outings.
Galliano has a partner in his search for heroines. She is Amanda Grieve, now
Lady Harlech, who lives a fairly rural life nowadays in Wales with her
husband and three children. She and Galliano met when he designed the
clothes for a Malcolm McLaren album photograph that she was styling.
Beautiful, intelligent and hugely stylish in a richly eccentric way, Amanda
is the original Galliano heroine, her clothes the outward expression of a
resourceful imagination and a non-self-indulgent romanticism which allows
for some humour.
John himself constructs his own appearance from disparate elements. The aim
of the stylistically cacophonous overall effect has always seemed to be more
about high comedy than high camp. His outward persona is lighthearted, even
giggly. He is a terrible flirt. But he is more often quiet and watchful than
rowdy. Serious, even intense, about his work, he is driven, as the truly
creative usually are, by the joy that comes from the conception of his
vision and the perfect execution of it.
But all this would not be enough to attract the genius label if it were not
for the fact that Galliano's vision of his heroines is always beautiful,
often breathtakingly so, and he is technically skilled.
Galliano would never design anything that would perplex succeeding
generations. In him vision and skills are in perfect balance.
So much so that, as the crowd straggled away from the showing of his
collectiion in October, one hardened veteran of several thousand fashion
shows gulped hard and announced, 'It was so perfect, I want to cry. I can't
bear to wait to wear it. I can't wait to be it.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Interest aid is axed -
Mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: Borrowers taking out new mortgages after October 1 1995 will
not be able to claim income support to cover interest payments for the first
nine months of unemployment, redundancy and incapacity.
Existing borrowers will receive nothing for the first two months and only 50
per cent of mortgage interest for the next four months. From April 1995,
income support will not cover amounts borrowed above Pounds 100,000.
WHAT IT MEANS: The two largest high street mortgage lenders, the Halifax and
Abbey National, both confirmed they did not intend to make mortgage payment
insurance a condition of lending. But if smaller lenders move in this
direction, the cost of mortgages for new borrowers after October 1995 could
rise by more than Pounds 20 a month for a typical Pounds 50,000 endowment
mortgage.
Jill Mayman, spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders says: 'Borrowers
considered a high risk because they are self-employed, on a low income or
disabled may be refused cover and could be forced out of the owner-occupier
sector.'
At present, income support covers 50 per cent of mortgage interest payments
for the first 16 weeks of a claim and 100 per cent thereafter, subject to a
cap on the mortgage of Pounds 125,000.
The number of claims has risen greatly in recent years, from 300,000 in 1988
at a cost of Pounds 286m to 548,000 in 1994 costing Pounds 1.082bn. The
government's plans will shift part of this burden to the private insurance
market.
Derek Roberts, chief executive of the Yorkshire Building Society, which has
150,000 borrowers, says: 'We will consider whether this insurance should be
compulsory. One-third of our new borrowers already have cover.'
According to the Halifax, the biggest lender with 1.8m mortgage accounts,
only 10 per cent of its borrowers have mortgage payment insurance at present
and spokesman Mark Hemingway says: 'We have no plans at present to make this
type of insurance compulsory. But we are concerned that borrowers who are
not covered could see their homes repossessed if they become unemployed and
cannot afford the interest payments.' Under the Halifax scheme, the monthly
cost is Pounds 6.90 for every Pounds 100 of cover while Abbey National's
version costs Pounds 6.95 for every Pounds 100. For a Pounds 50,000
endowment mortgage with monthly repayments of Pounds 297, this would cost
Pounds 21 a month.
Ian Darby, marketing director with independent mortgage adviser John
Charcol, adds: 'To date, most people who have asked for this insurance have
had some concern about their job security. As a result, claims have been
high, which has led to complex underwriting procedures with lots of
exclusions.' Darby urges lenders to take out block re-insurance to cover
mortgage liabilities. 'Alternatively, borrowers could pay a single premium
to cover the first year of unemployment, after which time they could claim
income support.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A second bite of the cherry
 -Tax-exempt special savings accounts / The higher initial limit for those
with maturing Tessas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: When their Tessas mature, savers will be allowed to invest
Pounds 9,000 in the first year of a new one.
WHAT IT MEANS: Tax-exempt special savings accounts became available in
January 1991. They were introduced by John Major when he was chancellor as a
way of encouraging people to save. Whether this is what actually happened is
debatable - a lot of existing building society money went straight into
these accounts to benefit from the tax break.
You could put up to Pounds 9,000 over five years into a Tessa and, as long
as the capital remained untouched, the interest earned would be tax-free.
The maximum investment in the first year was Pounds 3,000 and the annual
maximum after that was Pounds 1,800, to the overall Pounds 9,000 limit.
Under the new Budget rules, savers will be able to take out a new Tessa when
their first one matures and will be able to invest Pounds 9,000 in the first
year. This must be done within six months of the maturity of the old Tessa.
The overall limit of Pounds 9,000 is unchanged, and people who invest less
than Pounds 9,000 in the first year will be able to save over the next four
years to the usual annual Pounds 1,800 limit. You are allowed to hold only
one Tessa.
Those who have never had a Tessa, however, or who have less than Pounds
3,000 in one, will not be able to take advantage of the new rules. They will
be able to deposit a maximum of only Pounds 3,000 in the first year.
The main reason for the increase to Pounds 9,000 in the first year is due to
competition between building societies and their tax-free equity
counterparts, the personal equity plan providers. By setting the first year
maximum investment at Pounds 9,000, the chancellor has put Tessas on an
equal investment footing with Peps.
Investors can put Pounds 6,000 a year in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 more
in a single company plan. Banks and societies were concerned that if the
first-year Pounds 3,000 Tessa limit was not extended, they would see a
sudden outflow of the Pounds 15bn of Tessas due to mature in the first
quarter of 1996.
Moves intended to harmonise banking conditions in Europe mean you are not
confined to a UK bank for a Tessa. European Authorised Institutions  -
credit companies incorporated in other EU member states - can offer them and
some do, mainly from the Irish Republic.
Under the second banking directive, which came into force at the beginning
of last year, banks authorised to do business in an EU country are allowed
to set up branches in another EU country without needing to get permission
from that country's supervising authority.
Some savers may be concerned about compensation should the 'foreign' bank go
bust. Under new arrangements, the level of compensation to which a saver is
entitled is the same as the compensation arrangements in the country in
which the bank is operating.
So if you open an account with a French bank which is operating in the UK,
you will receive the same level of compensation as for a UK bank - 75 per
cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
This also means that if you move abroad and open an account with a UK bank,
your compensation will be at the level of the deposit protection scheme
operating in that country, not the UK's where protection for building
societies is 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000.
Base rates were high - 14 per cent - when Tessas were introduced. But since
they are now only 5.75 per cent, savers may prefer to consider an
alternative investment or use the money to reduce a mortgage. The most
competitive Tessa rates can be found in our Best Rates table on page 8.
If you are an investor in an offshore growth fund, do not be surprised if
you no longer receive cheques for small sums of money.
Distributor funds are obliged to pay out 85 per cent of their income as
dividends in order to satisfy Inland Revenue requirements which
differentiate them from roll-up funds that do not pay out income.
But distributor funds which have an annual gross income of only 1 per cent
or less will no longer have to distribute it.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Go on and figure it out -
Self-assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Self-assessment, the new tax system which comes on stream in 1996-97, will
affect about 8m taxpayers.
Most of the system is already in place and indeed, for some businesses
started this year, it is already working. Not since the introduction of Paye
half a century ago has there been such a large reform of the tax system. How
will it work ?
Does self-assessment affect me?
If you already make a personal tax return, it almost certainly will. The tax
affects the self-employed, business partners, company directors, some
employees, and some pensioners.
What happens if I already make a return via my accountant?
You can carry on as before.
What is the biggest difference about the new system?
Unlike the present system, your tax liability will be based on figures you
provide.
So I just have to fill in a form?
In essence, yes. Once you have completed the form you will be able to
calculate your tax liability as well. If you want to leave this job to the
Inland Revenue, you will have to file your form earlier.
What else is new about the tax?
The new system is based on 'current year assessment' which means that your
tax bill for any year relates to your income in that same year.
Why are the Inland Revenue doing this?
The new system brings together all income and capital gains, to be taxed at
one time. The Revenue say it will be simpler, quicker and more accurate.
When does the new tax start?
The main changes to the tax system will come on stream in the year 1996-7.
The first self assessment tax returns will be issued in April 1997 and will
need to be sent back by January 31 1998.
So the new tax form has to be filed in January?
Yes, by January 31 after the end of the tax year it covers.
If you have decided to let the Revenue calculate your liability the form has
to be in by the previous September 30.
Is the form easy to fill in?
That is debatable. It is not one form but several. The Revenue is going to
great lengths to design it so it is easy to follow. It will contain
checklists to help you collect the right information and also includes
explanatory notes.
What do I have to put on the form?
A good example is the form on employment. The draft schedule suggests that
to fill this in you will need documents like your P60, a P11D, a P9D, and
receipts for the allowable expenditure you have incurred. And you must fill
in an employment schedule for each job you do.
Do I have to get this information on my own?
No. Employers also have to help and the Budget gave details about their
duties which many observers think are quite strict. Crucially, employers are
going to have to give you a lot of detail about benefits in kind.
Will I get a whole set of the new forms?
No. The Revenue will only send you the forms they think are relevant. For
example, you might get the forms on pensions, investments, and capital
gains. You can always ask for help if you are one of the four million
taxpayers who do file returns without the help of an expert.
How do I pay?
You pay twice a year. Your previous year's income is used to calculate two
payments on account - half on January 31 and half on July 31. The first
payment also contains either a top up or a refund, to bring the previous
year's payments into line with the actual tax liability.
Any penalties for late filing?
Failing to submit a return will cost Pounds 100 and a further Pounds 100
after six months.
Any penalties for late payment?
A five per cent surcharge is suggested for tax unpaid 28 days after January
31 and a further five per cent if still unpaid after six months. Interest
will be charged on late payments.
Will the Revenue accept my figures?
Initially, apart from obvious errors, your self assessment form will be
processed before it is checked. So the tax the Revenue expects from you will
normally be based on your return. But they will check the form later and if
the Revenue wants more information or think something is wrong they will get
in touch. The Revenue will also check a sample of returns to monitor the
system and keep it fair. In most cases the Revenue has 12 months from the
filing of your form to tell you they intend to make inquiries.
What will the Revenue inquiry involve?
The Revenue can ask questions but you have the right to go to an independent
appeal commissioner. In the end you might need to amend your original
return, or the Revenue will do it for you.
If I need help now where can I go?
Any tax inquiry office or tax office will help (in the telephone book under
Inland Revenue). There is a whole raft of informative leaflets available.
You can, of course, always ask your accountant or tax adviser.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Effect on households
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, writes:
Families of all types will lose out from tax changes this year, although
these are mostly the ones announced in 1993. Their effects, together with
those of the new ones, are shown in the graphic for different family types.
Clearly, the new measures in the Budget will have only tiny effects compared
with the ones we have known about for a year or more.
Some types of household will do better than others, though. Pensioners will
actually lose less money on average than others. This is partly because of
the increases in pensioner tax allowances announced on Tuesday; partly
because the VAT compensation package is much more generous to pensioners
than others; and partly because pensioners are less affected by tax
increases like the restriction of mortgage interest tax relief. Other
groups, such as working families, will be hit much harder.
This chart was omitted from Wednesday's Budget section.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Small savers are hit - SAYE
</HEADLINE>

   THE MEASURE: Save as you earn (SAYE) 'ordinary' schemes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
available at building societies - have been abolished. National Savings is
to withdraw its Yearly Plan from February 1 1995.
WHAT IT MEANS: These two measures have squeezed out small, regular savers.
The popular, government-operated SAYE scheme was available at building
societies and the Abbey National bank. It was a monthly savings plan with a
minimum of Pounds 1 and a maximum of Pounds 20. At the end of five years,
the investor would receive tax-free interest equivalent to an annual 8.3 per
cent.
'We are very disappointed,' says Abbey National, which has 250,000 SAYE
accounts. 'It was one of the few accounts allowing the man in the street to
take advantage of tax-free opportunities.'
According to the government, SAYE was abolished to simplify tax-incentive
savings schemes and because it had been superseded by tax-exempt special
savings accounts. Unlike Tessas, however, the terms and conditions of SAYE
were the same from every provider.
Existing SAYE schemes are not affected.
National Savings will be dropping its Yearly Plan in 1995. This was designed
to help those who want to buy a National Savings certificate, Monthly
payments of between Pounds 20 and Pounds 400 are made by standing order for
12 months to buy a four-year Yearly Plan certificate.
The tax-free return after five years is 5.85 per cent a year compound.
Customers with existing Yearly Plan agreements can complete their payments
to get their next certificate.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): Why pay for what you don't
need? - Execution-only
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two completely different types of stock market investor have one thing in
common: the same sort of stockbroking service will suit their needs. It is
known in the business as an 'execution-only service', though dealing-only
would be a more readily understandable description.
At one end of the investor spectrum is the holder of a handful of
privatisation issues with only a modest overall value. At the other end is
the active private investor who closely follows the fortunes of different
companies. He decides what to buy and sell and when to buy and sell.
The second sort of investor does not need the advice which the traditional
private-client broker offers and, more important, does not want to pay for
it.
The first sort of investor probably would appreciate a bit of hand-holding,
but may find the cost of advice disproportionate to the value of his
share-holding.
The prime appeal of execution-only brokers is the value they can offer to
cost-conscious investors. The traditional broker may charge up to 1.85 per
cent for each deal, with minimum charges of up to Pounds 50. By contrast,
some execution-only services set the minimum as low Pounds 10 with a
percentage charge nearer the 1 per cent mark.
The idea of cheap broking came from the US, where the more
marketing-conscious Americans call it discount broking. Two of big US
discount brokers, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, run stockbroking operations
on this side of the Atlantic.
But it is the home-grown broker Sharelink which has made much of the running
in uncovering the big demand for cheap, no-frills share-dealing services.
Sharelink has even advertised itself on prime-time television.
High-profile promotion of this sort by a stockbroker would have been
unimaginable a decade or so ago. Other players have entered the same market,
including the Share Centre and, more recently, CityDeal.
Despite the onward march of execution-only services, many established
brokers have been happy to stick to familiar ground, offering advice on what
to buy and sell to the many stock market investors who require it. They also
provide portfolio management, taking all the decisions for people who do not
want to be involved in managing their capital.
But some of the traditionalists have responded to the new competition by
running separate, branded, dealing-only services. Thus Investorlink is run
by Walker, Crips, Weddle, Beck. The Sharemarket is part of Gall &amp; Eke.
Stocktrade is owned by Brewin Dolphin.
The most basic of execution-only services simply involves carrying out
orders to buy and sell. But there are often extras, such as the provision of
information on companies and the various investment ratios, as well as
things like Pep and nominee services.
Price differentials can still be significant, and the cheapest broker may
depend on the size of the deal. That is one reason why canny investors will
use several different brokers, depending on the exact nature of the deal
they want carried out.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (5): Port gains value if you are
patient - Drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MACCONNOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in drink is an old idea, and while investors tend to focus mainly
on fine wines, leading auction houses are encouraging shrewd connoisseurs to
take a closer look at vintage port.
Port prices have remained low in recent years - largely due to the drink
having fallen out of fashion. However, great interest in vintage port is now
being shown in the US, and this is expected to contribute to an overall
increase in its value.
Serena Sutcliffe, head of Sotheby's international wine department, said:
'Basically the advice is to buy young vintage port because it is still
undervalued.'
Vintage port is made from the growth of one year's harvest, and not every
year is deemed good enough to be declared a vintage by the growers. Of
recent years, Ms Sutcliffe and her counterpart at Christie's, Mr Paul
Bowker, agree that two vintages - 1983 and 1985 - are likely to stand out.
Taylor, Graham, Fonseca and Warre are the port houses particularly worth
buying. A case of 1983 Taylor at auction today should cost between Pounds
140 and Pounds 180. A case of Taylor 1985 should cost between Pounds 130 and
Pounds 160. In the long run, the 1985 is likely to prove a better vintage
and to outstrip 1983 in value - making it particularly attractive for
today's buyer.
Those looking to make a swift profit should not invest in port. You will not
see a huge return on your investment overnight. Port increases in value only
as the vintage matures and comes to be drunk. When some has been drunk, the
surviving cases naturally become more highly prized. As an indication of
what might happen to the value of 1985 port, Paul Bowker looks for
comparison to the 1963 vintage - one of the finest post war years to date.
In 1974, a case of Taylor 1963 was worth Pounds 58 at auction. Today it is
worth Pounds 600 (or the equivalent of Pounds 113.85 at 1974 prices).
You do not have to own a cellar to invest in port - professional storage
companies can ensure that your bottles are kept in the slightly damp
conditions which are vital. Also, while it is possible to buy 1985 and 1983
port from some wine merchants, you are more likely to pick up a case or two
at a bargain price by bidding at some of the regular auctions held by the
leading auction houses.
It pays to persevere with auctions - which you don't even have to attend if
you put in a commissioned bid. If you set yourself a reasonable price for a
lot, you may be outbid several times in a row, but eventually you are likely
to get the case of port you want at the price you are willing to pay.

FT  03 DEC 94 / After the deluge: Andrew Hill watches the clean-up in
flood-ravaged Piedmont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for culprits began before the rain stopped. The civil protection
agency, hydroelectric companies, politicians, crooked engineers and cowboy
builders all came under suspicion.
But the Piedmontese know where responsibility lies for the devastating
floods early last month. They can even name names: Tanaro, Belbo, Borbore,
and many more - the tributaries of the river Po and the tributaries'
tributaries, which during the weekend of November 5-6 swelled and burst,
leaving more than 60 people dead, thousands homeless, and many of the
region's thriving small businesses under a metre of mud.
Visiting the Tanaro valley this week, it was difficult to find the smallest
watercourses. They have all returned to the innocent-looking culverts and
gullies out of which they broke a month ago. Even the wide Tanaro hides
itself under swathes of fog for most of the morning.
But if you take the road from Asti to Alba (you have to drive: the railway
alongside the road is still a flood-buckled wreck), you get an idea of the
damage wrought by the river that joins the two towns. Although the valley is
miles inland, it is like following the course of an estuary at low tide.
Four weeks on, with the help of government grants, the army, and volunteers
from as far away as Venice and Sardinia, Piedmont is picking itself up. The
worst-hit factories are still not admitting visitors, and it was only on
Thursday that Ferrero, the Alba-based confectionery company, officially
recognised that the worst of the crisis was over with a ceremony of thanks
to the municipality and the soldiers who helped clean up the chocolate
factory.
In other Italian regions, still struggling with the aftermath of recession,
cynics now claim that the flood will prove a perverse boon for an already
wealthy region, with insurance companies and emergency subsidies paying for
new machinery.
That is not how they see things at Sacla, one of Italy's best-known small
producers of vegetable preserves, pickles and pasta sauces. At 3am on the
morning of Sunday, November 6, the few staff present at the Asti
headquarters were anxiously watching the torrential Borbore, a tributary of
the Tanaro, when the Tanaro itself came in through the back door and
submerged the factory's storage tanks, computers, archives and 550 tonnes of
produce.
'Everything that was touched by the water - even if it was already packed
and hermetically sealed - was thrown out,' says the cigar-toting Lorenzo
Ercole, managing director and son of the company's founder.
Unlike many smaller companies, Sacla was insured. But the total damage could
cost L5bn (Pounds 2m), compared with annual turnover of about L120bn, and
Ercole is not sure all that can be recovered. However, from the beginning,
he has insisted that Sacla should not 'play the victim', as he puts it, if
only because he feared clients, particularly Italian stores, would switch to
other suppliers if they thought Sacla was suffering.
In fact, Ercole claims that only one full day of production was lost and the
most important part of the factory - the bottling department - was
unaffected. The workforce rallied round immediately, and by Sunday
afternoon, was already beginning sgomberare the factory, to use the resonant
Italian term for cleaning up.
The same story is told by other companies across Piedmont. At Ferrero in
Alba, more than 1,000 workers pitched in to save the Christmas sales of the
famous pralines, such as Ferrero Rocher and Mon Cheri.
Across the hills in Canelli, centre of the spumante sparkling wine district,
employees of Gancia, the oldest spumante manufacturer in Italy, turned out
to salvage the company's grape-pressing equipment at nearby San Stefano
Belbo.
Franco Ferrero, who normally works in the Gancia export department, says
that when he arrived in the afternoon, the stainless steel equipment,
installed only five years ago, was invisible beneath a metre of muddy water.
Gancia was lucky. Shortly after the floods, Vittorio Gancia, the patriarch
of the 145-year-old family-run company, was able to reassure customers that
'Gancia spumante will, as always, grace Italians' Christmas dinner tables'.
But the town of Canelli, royally overlooked by the Gancia family castello,
has only just cleared the layer of mud from the central square.
Max Gancia, export director of the company, estimates that about 80 per cent
of the town's shops and offices were affected. It took a week for
electricity, gas and fresh water to be restored to some areas.
It may be true that Piedmont's medium-sized companies, often cited as the
power behind the Italian economy, will not lose much from the crisis.
Compared with small-time farmers, they are mostly reasonably well-insured or
have sufficient cash flow to pay for the clean-up.
But if nothing else, these modern entrepreneurs have relearned a lesson that
their more down-to-earth grandparents and great-grandparents knew well: you
may be able to count on export and profit growth, but you should never take
the gurgling stream next door for granted.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Easing the pain of a prostate: A dramatic new technique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having your prostate 'cooked' by microwaves might not seem the most pleasant
way to spend a Tuesday afternoon but it does appear to offer a
revolutionary, cost-saving way to treat one of the most common medical
disorders afflicting middle-aged and older men.
One in three over 50 has difficulty urinating, mainly because the prostate
gland - which sits below the bladder, with the urethra passing through it -
enlarges with age. This constricts the urethra, slowing urine flow and
making it impossible to empty the bladder completely.
In only a small proportion of cases - about one in 27 - is cancer involved.
For most, the swelling is benign. But it becomes dangerous over time if
retained urine becomes infected, or affects the working of the bladder, or
backs up into kidneys where it can cause stones or permanent damage.
The conventional treatment is a prostate operation - rather similar to
coring an apple - to make the hole through the middle of the gland larger.
It entails between four and 10 days in hospital, carries risks from general
anaesthesia and bleeding - the prostate has an abundant blood supply - a
long recovery, and an outside chance of post-operative impotence.
The new treatment uses microwaves to heat up the gland to around 70`C and
'cook' it. The microwaves are emitted by a specially-designed
radio-frequency antenna inserted along the urethra.
To keep its effect localised within the prostate, iced water circulates
through the catheter carrying the antenna. A balloon thermometer in the
rectum - right next to the prostate - monitors temperature and switches off
the machine if things get too hot.
No general anaesthetic is needed - just a 'local' for the urethra, plus an
injection of pain-killers and sedatives into a vein if discomfort becomes
too great during the 90-minute procedure.
What happens is that a third-degree burn is inflicted, killing cells and
nerves. The dead cells are absorbed naturally by the body over the next 10
weeks or so. The results are proving similar or better than having a
conventional operation.
It sounds unpleasant and - as someone who had the procedure performed one
Tuesday afternoon in August - I can assure you it is. But you go home within
hours of treatment, usually the same day.
A catheter remains inserted until the initial swelling caused by the
treatment dies down, but it is removed at the hospital a few days later.
After that, nature takes its course. In many cases, patients have been back
at work within two weeks and well on the way to full recovery after six.
The treatment was invented by Urologix Inc, a Minneapolis company backed by
Dollars 15m of US venture capital. Chief executive Jack Meyer says the
average conventional prostate operation in the US costs between Dollars
8,000 and Dollars 10,000. The microwave technique will cut these costs by at
least half and release hospital beds for other cases.
Complications have been infrequent, although I developed an infection and
prostatic ulcers which took six weeks to heal. But, as a result, Urologix
says it can re-design its special catheter and cooling system to minimise
the risk to other patients in the future.
So far, more than 150 men have been treated at five centres. Two are in the
UK - the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the East Surrey Hospital at
Redhill - while the others are the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona; the
Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis; and the University of Manitoba
Hospital in Winnipeg, Canada.
The US Food and Drugs Administration has now approved the treatment for use
at six other hospitals there and it will be introduced into a German and a
French hospital in the new year.
The attraction to British politicians and health service administrators is
the potential saving. Keith Parsons, a Royal Liverpool consultant urologist
who is in charge of the new technique, does 300 conventional prostate
operations a year with his team. There is a 12-month waiting list, not least
because they consume more than 1,200 bed-days a year.
Theoretically, 10 patients a week could be microwaved with no need for a
hospital stay, but three single-day visits are required to ensure patients
are suitable for treatment and make preparations.
Theoretically, too, the treatment could be given in a health centre, or at a
group practice of general practitioners, or in a urologist's consulting
rooms. But Parsons always prefers to do it in hospital where support is at
hand immediately if anything goes wrong.
Parsons' own role is crucial to proving the new technique because, of all
the hospitals involved, the Royal Liverpool is collecting the most detailed
scientific data on every patient. This will be presented to conferences of
US and British urologists in about six months.
The benefits, however, go well beyond what might be expected from solving
what is basically a plumbing problem. For, once the kidneys are again being
flushed properly, general health blooms and the risk of kidney stones -
which have put me in hospital as an emergency case twice in the past three
years - diminish.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): New unit trusts will
qualify for Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oeics - open-ended investment companies - the new type of unit trusts
scheduled to materialise in the UK next summer, will be able to qualify for
Peps on the same terms as authorised unit trusts, writes Scheherazade
Daneshkhu.
Regulations will also be brought in to allow some European institutions to
market Peps in the UK. Under the EU's Investment Services Directive, due to
come into force in 1996, brokers in an EU country will have access to the
markets of other member countries.
Oeics will issue shares instead of units and will have a single pricing
structure instead of the unit trust dual system of bid and offer prices
(buying and selling prices). Their formation will enable UK-based fund
management companies to market their funds in Europe. Rules will also be
made allowing existing unit trusts to convert into an Oeic.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Clarke is aiming to lure
new money - Personal equity plans / The options for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: The range of eligible investments into a general personal
equity plan (Pep) has been widened to include corporate bonds and
convertibles of UK non-financial companies, and preference shares in UK and
European Union companies from April 6 1995.
WHAT IT MEANS: As their name suggests, Peps were designed to encourage
equity investment. But, from next year, certain types of fixed-rate
investments will, for the first time, also qualify for the full Pounds 6,000
general Pep allowance. Single company Peps, into which investors can put a
further Pounds 3,000 a year, are not affected.
The idea is to encourage the development of new sources of finance for
companies, which is one reason why gilts - bonds issued by the government -
have been excluded.
The Pep industry has long lobbied for the inclusion of gilts and bonds into
Peps, arguing that these would provide deposit-based savers with a bridge
between the building society and equities.
Paul Killik, of stockbroker Killik &amp; Co, says: 'The measure will bring
another class of investor into Peps such as the elderly, who like the idea
of a high and regular income but felt that Peps were not appropriate for
them.'
The reason is that bonds are often regarded as 'lower-risk' investments than
equities. They are IOUs, where the borrower agrees to pay you a fixed rate
of interest each year in exchange for a capital lump sum and returns your
capital at the maturity date.
Bonds issued by companies (corporate bonds) tend to offer a higher yield
than gilts because of the higher risk involved; the government, after all,
is regarded as better security than a company. But bonds, like equities, are
risky investments if they are used speculatively to make capital gains.
Since they can be traded, their market price is variable, so there is a risk
of capital loss.
'I only occasionally recommend buying bonds for capital gain,' says Michael
Dyson of BZW, the securities house owned by Barclays bank. 'They are best
used for financial planning, since they pay a fixed rate of interest and
have a fixed repayment date and price.'
What are the characteristics of these types of fixed-interest investments?
Corporate bonds. The new rules specify that corporate bonds eligible for a
qualifying Pep can be ones issued only by UK non-financial companies. They
must have a minimum term of five years to maturity and a fixed rate of
interest. These bonds normally pay interest twice a year, with yields at
present of 9 per cent gross and above. They are free of capital gains tax.
The detailed rules have yet to be settled but the Inland Revenue says that
Eurobonds (those structured to give them European-wide investor appeal) will
not be allowed because they are in bearer form - the share certificates are
like cash. The holder of the bond is assumed to be the owner but his name is
not registered. The Revenue says that, under Pep rules, a registration
facility must be available.
Investments such as permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) do not qualify,
either, since they are issued by building societies - which are 'financial'
companies.
Convertibles. These are bonds or shares which pay a fixed rate of interest.
They differ from other fixed-interest investments by giving the holder the
right, at a specified date, to convert them into the company's ordinary
shares. The yield (normally quoted net of basic-rate tax) is usually less
than that on bonds but more than ordinary shares. Once again, the
convertibles must be in UK non-financial companies. Many convertibles are
also preference shares.
Preference shares. These company shares give the holder a better claim on
its assets than ordinary shareholders (if the company is wound-up,
preference shareholders must be paid before ordinary shareholders) but not
the same participation in its growth. They pay a fixed dividend instead of a
variable rate, linked to the profit the company makes. Yields are about 10.5
per cent gross for good-quality shares. The Pep rules allow the preference
shares to be in UK and EU companies.
All these investments must be in quoted companies if you intend to hold them
directly. But if you hold them through a qualifying unit or investment
trust, they can be in quoted or unquoted companies. Qualifying trusts are
those which hold at least half their assets in UK or EU companies to qualify
for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep limit.
The number of collective funds holding these types of investments is
relatively limited now, but there are bound to be plenty by April.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A modest advance for
private investors - Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: The Bank of England is planning to introduce an open
re-purchase (or 'repo') market for UK government securities or gilts. One
potential consequence is that interest on all gilts may start to be paid
gross of tax.
WHAT IT MEANS: The development of a gilt repo market would bring the UK into
line with most other international bond markets. Repos are loans between two
parties in which bonds are used as collateral. Party A lends its gilts to
Party B in return for cash up-front. At the end of a set period, Party A
re-purchases the gilts at a set price which reflects an interest payment
covering the period of the loan.
The Bank of England believes that creating a repo facility will add
liquidity to the gilts market by encouraging more investors to take part. In
the long run, this should reduce the government's borrowing costs. But the
introduction of such a system, while very useful to institutional investors
wishing to finance their gilt holdings, or to traders who want to speculate
on a fall in gilt prices by 'going short', will have little direct impact on
the private investor. Repos are definitely designed for professionals.
It is the side-effects of a repo system which may matter to the average
investor. A repo system would be made more complex by the fact that some
investors receive their interest gross while others get it only after
witholding tax is deducted.
One change that would make the system run more smoothly is for interest on
all gilts to be paid gross of tax. 'It is possible to have a gilt repo
market without gross payment of interest but I don't think it would be
satisfactory to the market' says Roger Shaw, head of arbitrage at Mildland
Global Markets.
Investors would then be responsible for declaring the tax payable to the
Inland Revenue.
Unsurprisingly, the Revenue fears it could lose money through the change.
The present witholding tax system is a highly effective way of collecting
money due.
The Revenue is soon going to produce a consultation paper on the subject.
Like the Bank of England's paper, issued this week, it will invite comments
by January 31. The Bank says the earliest likely date for a fully
functioning repo market would then be July 31.
Gross interest on gilts would make them more convenient for wealthier
non-taxpayers, such as non-working spouses. At present, they can receive
tax-free income on gilts via the National Savings Stock Register. If,
however, you hold gilts already, the amount of any one gilt you can transfer
to the NSSR is Pounds 5,000 a year. Then, too, new buyers of gilts can buy
only Pounds 25,000 of any one stock in one day. And, because the NSSR is a
postal system, it is slower than operating via a broker; it also means
investors are unsure of the price they will get.
Buying via the NSSR is cheaper than buying through a broker but not as cheap
as it used to be; charges were increased this week from an effective 0.4 per
cent to 0.6.
So, while gross payment of interest would be a modest step forward for the
private investor, it would not be a revolution - especially as the
possibility of tax-free income from corporate bonds and preference shares is
now on offer from the chancellor.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (3): Extra cost, but extra service
too - Broker unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANET WALFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A broker unit trust forms a separate part of a unit trust of a host company
 -such as a unit trust group or life insurance company, which retains legal
ownership - but with investment advice provided either by a stockbroker or
independent financial adviser.
The broker or adviser has to obtain special permission from the Personal
Investment Authority (PIA), the Investment Managers Regulatory Organisation
(Imro) or the Securities and Futures Association (SFA) before he can offer
broker unit trusts.
The biggest host company of broker unit trusts is Old Mutual (which this
month changed its name from Providence Capitol), with about Pounds 70m under
its control. The host company has the power to withdraw the adviser's
investment management role if it feels the adviser is no longer fit and
proper to run the fund's investments; in which case the host company may
absorb the broker fund monies into its own unit trust or manage them itself.
Because the broker unit trust forms part of the unit trust company, the
investments have to be within unit trust legislation and regulation. This
will include shares quoted on any recognised worldwide stock exchange,
futures, derivatives and so on.
With the host company and broker both involved in running the broker unit
trust, all charges are split between the two. The initial charge will be
shared out to cover the broker's or adviser's commission and the management
company's administration. The annual management charge is also shared.
However, the charges on broker unit trusts are usually higher than those
levied by the underlying unit trust.
There are basically two types of broker unit trust: the securities version,
and the fund-of-funds version. The securities version invests directly in
shares and securities to achieve a specific investment objective. By
contrast, the fund-of-funds trust involves clients of a similar investment
profile, being invested in one unit trust which then invests in a range of
others to provide the required spread of investments with attendant saving
on costs boosting efficiency.
One big advantage of investing in fund-of-funds broker unit trusts is that
capital gains tax can be kept to a minimum. Through bed-and-breakfasting,
the liability can be diminished even further to almost nil. A broker unit
trust manager can make one transaction within his fund on behalf of many
clients without CGT, buying in bulk at competitive prices.
A broker unit trust is basically an asset allocation and administration
tool, which provides an extra level of service paid for by a higher
management charge. As such, the broker unit trust can offer a worthwhile
financial planning vehicle, and the fund-of-funds version offers a
cost-effective way of replacing the discretionary unit trust portfolio
management service, with the added benefit of closer dialogue with the
investment manager (the broker).

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (4): It's costly, but RPI is on your
side - Capital gains Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW RADICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Very few people pay capital gains tax - only about 150,000 assessments are
issued in any tax year. But it is an expensive tax, capital gains being
treated as the top slice of income (maximum rate 40 per cent).
You mainly need to think about CGT when you sell shares, second homes and
works of art. Many assets, such as a car or main house, are not subject to
the tax. Gilts and most corporate debt are also exempt.
CGT works like this. You set off your capital gains against your losses for
a tax year, to produce a net gain or loss. If your net gain exceeds Pounds
5,800 (the annual tax-free allowance since 1992-93 - which rises to Pounds
6,000 in 1995-96) you pay tax on the excess. So, if you make gains of Pounds
8,000 and losses of Pounds 5,000 in the 1994-95 tax year, the net gain of
Pounds 3,000 is tax-free.
The Inland Revenue insists that you set off all your current-year losses
against your gains before you use your annual allowance. In this example,
you are not permitted to set off only Pounds 2,200 of your losses in order
to reduce the net gain to Pounds 5,800, and carry the balance of the loss
forward to future years. But if you do incur a net loss in any year, you can
carry it forward, without wasting your annual allowance.
Calculating capital gains seems very simple. The basic principle is that you
deduct the base cost - the amount you paid for the asset - from the net sale
proceeds. The gain is reduced by 'indexation'. The base cost is adjusted in
accordance with the Retail Prices Index, so that only capital profits which
beat inflation should fall into the CGT net. If you owned the asset which
you are selling at March 31, 1982, you can substitute its value at that date
for the base cost, if that is to your advantage.
Unfortunately these simple principles are complicated by a mass of detailed
rules. For example: if the effect of indexation is to create a capital loss,
you cannot use the indexation part of any loss you realise after 5 April
1995, and there is a ceiling of Pounds 10,000 on indexation losses between
November 30, 1993 and April 5, 1995.
How to keep the bill down
Bed-and-breakfasting. If your shares are showing a profit, consider selling
and re-purchasing them to use up your annual allowance and increase your
base cost.
If you have indexation losses, you have until April 5, 1995, to realise
them.
Gifts between husband and wife are tax-free (unlike gifts to other family
members). You can give shares to your spouse before they are sold, to use up
his/her annual allowance, but the gift must be absolute  - the sale proceeds
must not find their way back to the donor]
You can defer CGT indefinitely by reinvesting the sale proceeds in
enterprise investment schemes or, from April 6, venture capital trusts (see
page 13). If you are in any doubt about CGT, there are several helpful
leaflets available at your tax office. If these do not deal with your
situation, take professional advice.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): Top up your income for
retirement - Additional voluntary contributions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine out of 10 employees retire on a lower pension than the maximum
permitted by the Inland Revenue, yet few take advantage of a readily
available, tax-efficient method of topping up their retirement income.
The simplest and cheapest way to top up is through your employer's
additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme, which runs in conjunction
with the main pension scheme. Almost without exception, all company pension
schemes must offer an AVC facility, although in most cases the investment
and administration is sub-contracted to a third party - usually a life
office, unit trust group or building society.
A second option is an individual arrangement known as a 'free-standing' AVC.
FSAVCs are sold by the same providers as the in-house variety, but in this
case your employer is not involved.
The Inland Revenue allows you to pay up to 15 per cent of your pensionable
salary into your main company scheme and AVC scheme combined (restricted in
the case of some higher earners). Most employees pay about 6 per cent to
their main scheme, so this leaves plenty of scope for additional
contributions.
Under Revenue rules the only time you can pay in to an AVC or FSAVC is when
you are a member of a company pension scheme. Both arrangements qualify for
full tax relief on employee contributions (employers cannot contribute) and
tax-free growth of the fund. AVCs may also provide a tax-free cash lump-sum
at retirement if contributions were started before April 1987. There is no
tax-free cash option with FSAVCs.
Performance is critical with additional contributions. Your main company
scheme is likely to provide a pension linked to salary, but in most cases
your top-up fund will be used to buy an annuity from a life office to
provide regular (taxed) income in retirement. The level of income you secure
is largely dictated by the size of your fund.
It is also important to check for flexibility - you should be able to pay
what you like, when you like, without penalty (within Revenue limits, of
course).
In theory, your employer's AVC scheme should provide better value than an
FSAVC, because employers usually bear some or all of the provider's costs.
With an FSAVC you pay all these charges yourself.
However, AVC investment choices can be limited - for example, you may only
be offered a building society deposit account. If you have more than five
years to go to retirement you might want a with-profits, unit-linked or
unit-trust fund, which provide various degrees of exposure to stock market
growth.
Do check the level of charges and the performance, though. With more than
100 FSAVCs on the market - each offering a range of funds - it is essential
to seek independent advice.
Finally, bear in mind that AVCs and FSAVCs usually lock away your money
until you retire from your main company scheme. If you want more
flexibility, consider a personal equity plan, available from stockbrokers
and independent advisers, or, for the very cautious, a tax exempt special
savings account (Tessa), from building societies and banks.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Siberia's cold cauldron is hotting up: Roger Garside
travelled to the land the Tartars called wonderful and found the bathhouse a
good place to learn about its business culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER GARSIDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago the author was preparing for a three-month visit to the heart of
Siberia. It resulted last month in a joint venture with former academics to
raise an investment fund for the region.
Russia's Strength Will Grow Out of Siberia. These words greet me from a
billboard on the road to Academic Town, half an hour from Novosibirsk,
capital of Western Siberia.
'That is a prophecy of Mikhail Lomonosov, an 18th-century scholar,' explains
Larissa Denisova, a graduate of the town's university.
'You think it's over the top? But we already produce three-quarters of
Russia's oil and gas and almost all its gold and diamonds. With Moscow and
the communists off our backs we'll make Lomonosov come true.'
It is winter, the temperature is -200C, the sky above the snow laden forest
is a brilliant blue. I have come to Academic Town for three months to
investigate the opportunities for international investment in Siberia, and
Larissa is to be my guide.
I have chosen the town as my base because it is an extraordinary
concentration of intelligent and knowledgeable people. It was founded 30
years ago to house the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences, it grew
into one of the greatest science centres in the world. One of its academics
is Maxim Bushuev, now an entrepreneur and he has thought up the idea of a
co-operative venture with the west.
The bleak housing estate for workers and technicians where Larissa has found
me a flat is not quite what I had in mind, but I tell myself that if I am to
encourage others to invest here, I had better find out what Siberia is
really like.
And if Larissa has not triumphed as a housing agent, she more than
compensates in other ways. At 27, she looks like Michelle Pfeiffer, has the
will of Margaret Thatcher and a great sense of humour. She is just the
person we need to break the barriers left from 70 years of bureaucratic
rule, and to find evidence to persuade investors to put their money into
Siberia.
That evidence will need to be good. At the beginning of this year, an
international survey placed Russia third from the bottom of a list of 104
places in which to invest.
Russia's economics and politics are a mass of contradictions, but I am
surprised to find that Larissa, and other well-educated Siberians, are
unconcerned by the difficulties which alarm foreign investors. Unlike
Muscovites, Siberians hardly read newspapers and watch the television news
in a state of semi-detachment.
Larissa says: 'Why should we spend our time following the goings-on in
Moscow? We have to get on with building our lives. We find ways to cope with
the policies they make.'
In the next few days I am impressed how hard people are working to build new
lives - and new companies. I become absorbed in their struggle to create
coherence and profit out of the incoherence and waste bequeathed by the old
system, so absorbed, indeed, that I do not bother to set up my BBC World
Service aerial.
I have found my way into a cauldron of entrepreneurial activity, and my only
anxiety now is that the lack of business culture may mean that projects are
too ill-prepared to attract foreign investors.
Any worries that we might be cold-shouldered are soon dispelled.
Families I have only met once invite me to their homes for dinner. My
landlady keeps me supplied with good food and drink: meat-filled dumplings
smothered in sour cream, borsch, beef stroganoff, salted salmon, smoked
chicken, good bitter beer and the best fruit juice.
On the first weekend, Larissa takes us cross-country skiing through woods of
silver birch. With us is Sergei Zaitsev, one of the explosion of young
entrepreneurs who have understood that the deficiencies of the old economy
offer them great opportunities. Communist rule favoured defence production
and heavy industry at the expense of the consumer, and Zaitsev is making a
fortune by doing something to correct the balance.
In the late 1980s, when he was a graduate student in high energy physics, he
visited Belgium on a youth delegation. He slipped away from the official
programme and persuaded a Belgian company to form a joint venture with him.
The company was Carin, supplier of hair care products to much of the
hairdressing trade in western Europe.
A Belgian aircraft carried the first consignment to Siberia. Today, Sergei's
company has a turnover of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.5m) and cannot meet demand
in its home province. It wants capital for expansion. He feels he has earned
his Italian clothes and his chauffeur-driven BMW.
On another weekend, Nikolai Zagoruiko, a senior scientist in the Academy of
Science, invites me to the banya, Russia's variation of the sauna. Naked, we
work up a sweat in the hot room, receive a thrashing with birch twigs, take
a shower and massage, exit into the night air (-200C) for total immersion in
a natural pool, then start again.
Afterwards we relax in a log cabin built by the professors with their own
hands. They have brought simple food from home, and observe the classic
rules of the banya - single sex and no alcohol.
The only decoration is part of a tree-trunk, stripped of its bark. True, it
bears an unmistakable resemblance to a girl's torso, but even this
concession to the flesh has a certain innocence: it is the torso of a very
young girl.
This evening, I hear Nikolai's story. 'In the 'stagnation years' of the late
1970s and early 1980s I built an industrial organisation on the principle of
rewarding people according to their personal productivity.
'This was heresy] We were too successful, so they closed us down to stop the
heresy from spreading. In recent years, I have done something to mobilise
people in the institutes of the academy into a consulting network.
'With state funding for science drying up and professors earning less than
bus drivers, most of us in Academic Town are looking for ways to apply our
knowledge to manufacturing or services - those of us still here, that is.
Perhaps a third have emigrated.'
Nikolai's principal business role now is as president of an investment fund.
In the weeks that follow, he will bring me a number of good investment
proposals, based on scientific findings but practical, and proven on some
scale.
He is in his late 60s, and combines worldly wisdom with social ideals, which
ensure that the projects he brings me include ones adapted for small farmers
or Russians repatriated from parts of the former Soviet Union where they are
now unwelcome.
One of my fellow guests in the banya is Sergei Yakushin. 'I run Siberian
Fair. We organise trade fairs here in Siberia and in the rest of Russia, and
abroad. This year we will put on 140, 40 of them abroad.
'We have a wonderful site in Novosibirsk to build our own exhibition centre
 -right at the geographical centre of Russia. On one side, the Ob, one of
our great rivers of Siberia, on the other, the highway and railway to
central Asia.'
He monitors Siberia's fast-changing economy closely. 'From this spring, I
will charge Russian companies the same prices as foreigners. Two years ago,
I would not have dared, but since then I have seen many Russian companies
grow stronger.'
Another visitor to the banya is Viktor Kornikov. His face is heavy, Asiatic,
dark-skinned and toughened by life. Never for a moment do his eyes betray
his thoughts or feelings. I guess he is a descendant of one of those peoples
who inhabited Siberia before the Europeans arrived.
He was an electronics researcher at the academy and a senior manager in a
factory making microchips until, long before privatisation began, he gave up
those secure positions to start his own business.
He and a few colleagues sorted through chips discarded for waste by the
factory, to sell those that were good for restricted use. With his savings
from that, he started in the food business, and is now one of the biggest
traders in Tomsk.
The food trade is very profitable, but also a target of the Russian mafia. I
want to know how he copes, because our venture may arouse interest in the
same circles.
Viktor turns his impassive face to me, pauses for a moment, then gives me an
opaque answer: 'In Russia, everyone has an umbrella, and mine is a sports
association.' His meaning becomes clearer when I ask him whether he has
problems obtaining payment for the consumer goods he supplies to hundreds of
kiosks.
'No,' he replies, 'If they don't pay, they receive a visit from members of a
sports group I sponsor. I'm sorry,' he adds with a slight shrug of the
shoulders, 'but it's necessary.'
The banya session ended, Nikolai drives me home down a long, straight road
lined by trees that will meet at infinity, perhaps.
Beyond the trees the snow-covered plain stretches to Europe, certainly.
Overhead are the biggest moon and brightest stars I have ever seen. On their
way to Europe, the Tartars named this land Sibir (wonderful) but it is
untamed and awesome. Men subsist on the edge of the wild.
So we work together, energised by the riches beneath us. Tomorrow we will be
at it again: more projects, more entrepreneurs, more hope of making
Lomonosov come true.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Hoping for a pot of gold -
Partners who are winning orders for their stoneware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It had been a long, dull, miserable February Sunday in St Ives, Cornwall,
and they had not made a single sale. Sarah Butler and Martin Clark were
about to close the pottery shop and go home when a couple with Italian
accents walked through the door.
The man expressed approval, and after asking a number of questions bought
Pounds 100 worth of their hand-thrown stoneware.
The two young potters could not believe their luck - particularly when their
visitor introduced himself as Vittorio Radice, managing director of Habitat
UK, and that he would like to buy 400 of the three of their designs he liked
best.
Butler and Clark went for a celebratory drink. It was a rare moment of
luxury after five months of hard slog, low sales and anxiety about what lay
in store during the rest of their first year's trading.
A few days later Radice phoned and increased his order to 1,200 examples of
three of their designs of white stoneware vases. The order was worth Pounds
9,600 - almost two thirds of their first year's turnover.
The BC Pottery completed its first year in October. Although it had turned
over a mere Pounds 15,000 it had shown a good profit - Pounds 8,500. The
figures were far better than either Butler or Clark had believed possible at
the onset of their enterprise.
The downside was that they had paid themselves only Pounds 1,500 each.
'It has been a very frugal existence,' said Butler, 25. 'But we have enough
money to see us through to our next order and there are not a lot of things
we want.' Clark, 24, agrees. 'It's been worth it,' he said. 'But a holiday
sometime would be nice.'
At the end of a day that frequently lasts 12 hours, the two bid each other
farewell and return to their bedsits. It is an arrangement that suits them.
They have little energy for socialising - even meeting other artists and
craftspeople in the Cornish town that houses 40 galleries.
'Really the whole of our first year has been given over to potting. We are
very lucky to be here. Throwing pots is very tiring and at present we are
investing everything in the future of the business,' Clark said.
In March 1993 the couple produced a business plan that convinced the
Cornwall Enterprise Trust to approve their individual applications for a
Pounds 1,500 12-month business start-up grant. Members of the interview
panel were impressed by the quality of sample pots.
The fact that Clark and Butler had known each other since their school days
in Hertfordshire, also convinced the panel that the personal chemistry
between them was likely to lead to business success.
Members of the panel also noted that Clark, who left school after GCSE
0-Levels, had worked as a sales assistant for two years for the John Lewis
Partnership's store in Oxford Street, London.
During that time the company had funded him for one day a week to pursue a
BTEC qualification, which he gained in Business Studies. Butler has an
honours degree in English and Art.
With a guaranteed company income of Pounds 3,000 for the first 12 months the
couple formed a legal partnership and took a small Victorian shop unit in a
narrow side street behind the harbour in St Ives. The rent was - and still
is - Pounds 35 a week.
For a few extra pounds their landlord, a local solicitor, allowed them to
throw pots in an upstairs room until they managed to find separate premises
for a studio.
'It was an ideal arrangement for the first three months while we built up
our range,' said Clark.
'It was cheap, and as we could only afford one wheel at that stage, only one
of us could throw at a time. The other one would man the shop. At times
trade was very quiet - we took barely more than Pounds 400 in our first
month.
'But it is very important to a potter to have time to read up about
different techniques, shapes and glazes, and that can take place in the
shop. Besides, a good potter must spend time away from the wheel.'
The two have never regretted the decision to invest in a shop, even after
they realised they were one of only two potteries in St Ives to have a shop
frontage.
'The panel that interviewed us for our business start-up grant endorsed this
view. We certainly would not have achieved the vital breakthrough with
Habitat without the shop being there,' said Butler.
After the Habitat order, the pair, who had originally financed the business
on Pounds 1,000 of joint savings plus a Pounds 1,000 loan from Clark's
parents, made their first approach to the banks.
On the basis that they took out a monthly insurance premium of Pounds 10 to
cover the risk, the local branch of Lloyds bank advanced them the Pounds
2,800 needed to buy a new kiln and a second potter's wheel. They repaid the
loan within four months.
In August, the head of design at Habitat chose another 15 designs, from
which Butler and Clark made samples. Of these, six have been chosen to
appear in next year's spring and summer Habitat range.
In addition there is a chance that BC Pottery small mugs and cappucino cups
will also be part of the range, and the pair has also been asked by the
store to make 12 sample lamp bases.
'We believe we were chosen because the Habitat buyers like the finish of our
pots, which differ from many others as they have a preliminary firing before
glazing. In some stores friends tell us we even have a small display devoted
to our pots,' says Butler.
'We are currently working flat out in our studio in a converted fishermen's
store producing 120 pots a week of the six designs ordered by Habitat, plus
the lamp bases, as well as trying to extend our range.
'St Ives in winter is an ideal place in which to work. The light is
wonderful and there are many peaceful coastal walks that provide a
liberating atmosphere. All we want is the opportunity to carry on in the
same way.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): New chance to become a
venture capitalist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke established his credentials as the friend of capital-hungry
growing businesses in the 1993 Budget, writes Richard Gourlay. This year, he
went further to encourage private investment in unquoted companies. The
latest measures may tempt even relatively risk-averse private investors to
try becoming swashbuckling venture capitalists.
For those who took their first tentative steps along this path by buying
shares in July's flotation of 3i, there was good news in the Budget. Shares
in 3i may now be put in general personal equity plans following changes to
rules on what assets investment trusts may hold in order to qualify.
The most interesting development, though, came with the announcement of
rules for the new venture capital trusts (VCTs). These will issue shares
like a conventional investment trust but will invest in unquoted companies.
The VCT is likely to be the preferred option for those wanting to take a
portfolio approach to their investment in private companies, and who do not
want to take any management role in the businesses they back.
Investors will be allowed to place up to Pounds 100,000 each year in the
VCTs. Their managers will be able to put up to Pounds 1m in any company
which has no more than Pounds 10m of assets.
The scale of the tax incentives dangled by the chancellor suggests sponsors
and venture capitalists will be queueing around the block to launch VCTs.
First, he has allowed 20 per cent income tax relief to be taken at the time
of investment and - in a move
that surprised even the more optimistic venture capitalists - he also
extended capital gains tax roll-over relief to investment in VCTs.
Investors will be able to defer indefinitely paying CGT on gains made from
the sale of almost any asset if those gains are re-invested in the VCTs.
They can, therefore, get some form of tax break on up to 60 per cent of the
initial investment.
The initial reaction from venture capitalists has been positive. 3i says it
is thinking of launching a trust. Even if it does not, it has said it would
be interested in co-investing alongside other VCTs. Murray Johnstone is
considering trying to co-invest with business angels. And with groups such
as Gartmore and Electra also enthusiastic about the new incentives, all but
those private equity investors who concentrate on large management buy-outs
might consider launching trusts.
None of these is likely to appear before the Finance Bill is published in
the spring. At that point, investors will have to start sifting through the
performance records of the management teams behind each trust. This will not
be easy. Venture capitalists do not always use the same valuation methods
for their portfolios. New teams may spring up with well-known managers but
no experience of working together. And almost none of the management teams
will have any track record in investing exclusively in the smallest
companies that the chancellor wants the public to back.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Chancellor closes loophole
 -Index-linked securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recently-discovered tax loophole, which could have allowed investors to
make unlimited tax-free capital gains from UK share price movements, was one
of the casualties of the Budget.
The chancellor acted swiftly to prevent further investment managers
following the path beaten by Fidelity last month when its Special Values
investment trust issued equity index-linked loan stock.
The stock - used to provide gearing for the trust - was structured so that
it was both a qualifying corporate bond, making it exempt from capital gains
tax, and a qualifying indexed security, which meant that gains were exempt
from income tax, too.
Most qualifying indexed securities are linked to the retail price index, or
some other measure of inflation, but the present rules also allow for
linkage to a UK equity index.
The Fidelity stock was linked to the FT-SE-A All-Share index, so that the
value of each unit moved up and down in line with the index and the interest
payments on the stock reflected the index's present yield. This made it very
attractive to private investors, particularly those who use up their annual
CGT allowance.
Such loan stocks are a simple, low-cost, relatively low-risk way to track UK
share price movements. And - until this week - any gains would have been
exempt from both income tax and CGT although interest payments were taxable
normally.
Accountant Price Waterhouse said: 'This was an ingenious idea, but it is not
surprising that it has not lasted very long.'
Explaining the measure, the Inland Revenue said: 'Securities linked to a UK
share index have been issued which can benefit from both the qualifying
corporate bond exemption from capital gains tax, and the deep gains
exemption for qualifying indexed securities.
'The result is that profits on disposal of such securities would generally
not be liable to tax. This could lead to significant loss of tax and to
distortion in the investment market.' So, the rules are to be changed so
that securities linked to a share price index cannot qualify as corporate
bonds.
The loophole has been closed with immediate effect, and even those who
bought the loan stock before the Budget will have to pay CGT when they sell
it. It is, of course, still possible to make use of your annual CGT
allowance of Pounds 5,800, rising to Pounds 6,000 next year.
Fidelity was the first to spot and exploit the loophole, but it is believed
other investment managers were thinking of using it. Other investment trusts
have issued index-linked loan stock structured differently, so gains are
liable either to CGT or income tax.
Index-linked loan stocks are still attractive if you are looking for a
low-cost index-tracking instrument, as they do not carry the sort of annual
charges made by index-tracking unit trusts. But private investors generally
should avoid the type of loan stock where gains are subject to income tax.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Relief for adventurers -
High risk investments / The new tax advantages for investors in small,
unquoted companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE: Better tax breaks for investing in small unquoted companies via
the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) and venture capital trusts (VCTs).
The chancellor added capital gains tax re-investment relief to the 20 per
cent up-front income tax relief available already on investments of up to
Pounds 100,000 through the EIS. Investors in VCTs - which come into
existence on April 6 - will be entitled to the same combination of 20 per
cent up-front relief on investments up to Pounds 100,000, plus CGT
re-investment relief, as well as tax-free income and capital gains from the
trust.
In both cases, the initial income tax relief applies only if the investments
are held for at least five years.
WHAT IT MEANS: Re-investment relief (or 'rollover relief') from CGT is an
idea the chancellor introduced in the 1993 Budget. It allows investors to
defer a CGT liability on gains made from any investment - shares, art works,
a second home - if the gains are re-invested in an unquoted trading company.
Initially, the relief was limited to direct investments in companies not
using the EIS, but this has now been broadened to include both the EIS and
VCTs.
As CGT is charged at 40 per cent, this means that when re-investment relief
is combined with the 20 per cent up-front tax relief on EIS companies or
VCTs, investors may be entitled to a total of 60 per cent tax relief. And as
each person is entitled to relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a
year in both EIS companies and VCTs, this adds up to 60 per cent tax relief
on investments of Pounds 200,000 a year.
The tax charge on gains rolled over into EIS companies, VCTs or other
unquoted companies does not disappear, however: it is merely postponed until
the investor disposes of the new investment. In any case, the shares must be
held for at least five years to qualify for the 20 per cent income tax
relief.
If you have subscribed already for shares in a company issued under the EIS,
you might still be able to take advantage of the new rollover relief. This
applies to investments disposed of on, or after, Budget day; but it is
available when the subscription for shares under the EIS is made up to one
year before, or three years after, the disposal.
This Budget also made it easier for companies to qualify under EIS rules by
relaxing restrictions on property-holding. Previously, a company lost EIS
status if, at any stage, land or buildings accounted for more than half its
assets. This was intended to rule out low risk schemes which proliferated
under the predecessor to the EIS, the business expansion scheme (BES) - such
as companies buying properties to let out under assured short-term tenancy
agreements.
Given, however, that business premises are often a company's biggest asset,
this rule ended up disqualifying many companies which fell within the scope
intended originally by the chancellor. Companies specialising in letting out
residential property will still be excluded from the EIS.
A few other minor changes were made to relax the EIS rules concerning
companies under common control, rights issues, and mergers.
In the first 11 months of its life, the EIS has not attracted investors at
the same rate as the BES. Most industry insiders have blamed this lack of
success on the tighter rules (which mean that only companies at the riskier
end of the old BES spectrum can qualify for the EIS), and on the lack of
generous sweeteners.
Likewise, when the outline proposals for VCTs were published, offering only
tax-free income and capital gains but no up-front relief, many people voiced
doubts about whether Pep-style tax breaks would be enough to entice
investors into the much riskier territory of venture capital.
The Budget changes go at least some way towards rectifying those situations.
But investors should not throw caution to the wind.
Albert Nawrocki, senior tax manager at accountant Binder Hamlyn, warns:
'Whilst the tax advantages obviously make both the venture capital trusts
and EIS much more attractive, investors should not lose sight of the
commercial viability of the underlying investment.'
EIS companies and VCTs are very high-risk investments. Both are ways of
generating money for small businesses in an early stage of their
development. Companies which have used the EIS so far have been involved in
activities ranging from film production, stubble-burning, pub management,
and even promoting a new type of musical instrument.
These are hardly mainstream investments, and there is no protection for
investors in the not-so-unlikely event of their collapse. The one
consolation is that with the EIS, unlike the BES, losses can be offset
against CGT or income tax. Yet, offsetting a loss is hardly the same as
making a profit.
VCTs will invest in similar small developing companies. Although VCTs spread
the risk a little by giving investors stakes in a range of companies, a few
of the investments are almost bound to fail - so investors must hope the
performance of the successes will more than make up for the failures.
An additional complication is that because VCTs will function like normal
investment trusts, it is likely their shares will trade at a discount to net
asset value - so, within a few weeks of launch, investors could see their
holding fall in value by 10 or 15 per cent.
This could wipe out much of the benefit of the initial income tax relief
(which is available only to investors subscribing for new shares in a trust,
not to anyone buying shares in the market). The value might not be recovered
for several years, if ever.
If any of these prospects worry you, you should stick to other tax-efficient
investments like Tessas and Peps. Always remember that no matter how
generous the tax incentives, you should never be tempted by them into making
an investment you would not have considered otherwise.

FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (1): Keep to the straight path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial planning is a bit like the Pilgrim's Progress: the correct path is
relatively straightforward; what is difficult is sticking to it. The
financial world is full of traps and pitfalls. But provided you head in the
right direction and avoid attempts to divert you and your money, you will
probably do better than most people.
This survey was not planned as a cautionary tale - but a number of the
articles point out traps and explain how to avoid them. Financial traps come
in three varieties: crooks and skulduggery, constraints and penalties, and
innocuous-seeming costs which eat into your investments and savings.
The founder of UK financial regulation, Professor Jim Gower, once commented
that far more financial damage was caused by incompetents than by rogues.
This is still true. Robert Maxwell was - fortunately - an exception. Of
course you need to check that an insurance company or a financial adviser is
genuine, and that your money is going where you think it is. But in most
cases the answer will be reassuring.
Lack of flexibility is a more common problem. Too many financial firms still
tie clients down to long-term contracts, with hefty penalties for anyone who
changes his mind. Conventional life insurance, pension plans and pension
top-ups can be particularly bad. Although the details of what you are and
are not allowed to do will usually be spelt out in the small print, few
clients read it, and even fewer would understand it if they did. Most find
it outrageous that someone can contribute to an endowment policy for several
years and get nothing back if he cashes it in early.
This lack of flexibility is the companies' way of protecting themselves
against the third problem: expensive incompetence. Too many financial firms
still act as though their customers owed them a living - regardless of how
their investments perform. But the heavy charges which provide that living
make it very hard for the investment to produce good results to the client -
even if the men who manage the money do a competent job.
This is now changing. From the beginning of next year, life and pensions
companies will have to explain how they operate in a way that customers can
understand. And already many of them are starting to tinker with their
products so that they will look acceptable when the curtain goes up.
But that does not mean the investor can relax. Initially, at least, there
will still be a bewildering variety of products on the market. Disclosure
will only be useful to those customers who take the trouble to compare what
different financial retailers have on offer. That often includes looking at
different products which can do the same job - which presupposes a good
understanding of how those products work. Knowledge is not the key to good
investment, but it is the key to avoiding bad investments.

There is a quiet anger about Mercedes, a smouldering resentment which on
evenings with me she keeps damped down only with rum and cigarettes.
It is the hospital wards she works in, she tells me - the shortage of
medicines and pain-killers, her inability to relieve suffering, the cries
and moans of patients which continue to pursue her long after her shift is
over.
Now, in the little room I have rented in the house of her friends Luis and
Isabel, Mercedes administers her own pain-killer, large gulps of dark,
caramel-tasting Paticruzados rum. Two whimsical, carefree sailors dance
about the label of the bottle. It sits conveniently close, parked on a
bedside table between a cheaply whirring Russian fan and a battered radio
which sprays the hot Havana night with brassy rhythms - salsa, rumba, cha
cha cha.
After a few glasses her gloom lifts, her smooth brown face lightens. She
flirts and laughs a little, shakes her shoulders in time to the music, takes
on the brightness that in a more ordinary time and place would naturally be
hers.
We plan a day at the beach, a walk along the sea front promenade of the
Malecon, ice-cream at La Coppelia in the smart part of town, and Mercedes
seems happy. Her anger, though, I know, is still there, profound and
indelible. It is not just anger over her work, for Fidel Castro's
unwavering, catastrophic vision for her country, for Cuba's years of
hardship and suffering. It is also directed at the outside world, at me.
'You know nothing,' she has already said to me in a brief moment of
unguarded bitterness. 'You tell me things have changed all over the world,
that Cuba is a dinosaur, that things can only change here, too. You tell me
democracy is around the corner. But you do not know Cuba.'
Tonight, though, Mercedes has no fight in her, no room left for debate. Like
most Cubans, she is sick to death of ideology and the politics of state. She
saves her energy for the true politics of Cuba - the strategies of
day-to-day survival, the salvaging of small satisfactions from moral
bankruptcy and material collapse.
She drains her glass, stubs out one of the American cigarettes she likes me
to buy her. 'Toda politica es mentiras,' is all she will say, shaking her
head. All politics is lies. She switches off the radio and stands, swaying a
little with music, drink and fatigue. 'Take me dancing.'
We walk out into the streets of Havana Vieja. Decayed and crumbling, Old
Havana is an eerie, empty quarter at night.
We stumble over rubble and around potholes, under hanging laundry and
through tall, broad arcades built by the Spanish against Cuba's fierce
tropical sun. Here and there are the remnants of an imperial finery financed
by slaves and sugar: an ornate stone church, a baroque opera house, a
pillared convent, a wall of Seville Moorish tiles, and matching pairs of
bronze lions along the tree-lined Prado.
But mostly there is inertia and neglect, decline and breakdown. We walk
gingerly. There is little lighting - electricity is a precious commodity in
Cuba today. Neither, in these still streets, is there much traffic - there
is little petrol to fuel the hulking pre-revolutionary Buicks and Pontiacs,
the tinny post-revolutionary Skodas and Ladas, that lie salt-corroded and
rotting on every corner.
Nor is there any of the business, the exchange, the human transaction that
is normally the heartbeat of a big city's life. Only occasionally in the
gloom do we pass a small boy raising water to an upper-floor apartment with
a bucket and pulley, an old man smoking a fragrant cigar on the cool of a
doorstep.
Old Havana is jammed with tens of thousands of tenement dwellers; but with
nowhere to go, no money to spend, and nothing to spend it on, they remain
indoors, comforted in the blue glow of Cuba's last accessible past-time, the
television soap opera.
'Nada . . . nada . . . nada . . . . ' mutters Mercedes as, one after
another, we pass the meagre window displays of government shops that have
nothing left to sell. I find them pathetic. Mercedes has little sense of
pathos - but a good deal of contempt - for state economic planning that now
fails to provide even the bare minimum needed for survival.
The defiant gesturing continues, Castro's revolutionary avowals persist.
But, as the people of Cuba know to great personal cost, there are no
provisions on any known communist chart or model for the plunge of the last
four years. Even the name given to the post-Soviet age by the Cuban
leadership - the 'Special Period' - indicates its lack of certainty in the
progress of the revolution.
Well might the leaders lack confidence. Before the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1990, Cuba was consuming Dollars 8bn worth of goods annually, most
of it garnered through special trade-and-aid agreements with the east bloc.
Not only did the Soviet Union, happy with a permanent foothold on the very
doorstep of the enemy camp, purchase Cuban sugar at above-world-market
prices, it also supplied the Caribbean client-state with subsidised oil,
food, machinery, medicines, vehicles, military hardware, technical advice,
and cheap loans.
With the fall of the Soviet Union, it all vanished overnight. The goodwill
dried up, the teachers went home, the agreements were cancelled, the ships
stopped calling in at Havana harbour.
Without foreign exchange, Cuban imports have slowed to a trickle. Without
raw materials, Cuban factories have stopped operating. Without fertilisers
and pesticides, the Cuban sugar industry is floundering. Not only demanding
payment of a Dollars 30bn Cuban debt, Russia has now rejected as a risky
deal even the simplest form of trade - the bartering of oil for sugar. US
refusal to do business with its revolutionary neighbour remains as firm as
ever.
Like an air-filled balloon, Cuba's prosperity - such as it was - has
suddenly blown up in the face of its people, leaving little trace behind.
Cuba has stopped spending money that did not belong to it - the value of
annual consumption has shrunk from the equivalent of Dollars 8bn to Dollars
1bn, with shortage and need everywhere. Not long ago a comprehensive social
safety net, universal health care and high educational standards made Cubans
the envy of the third world. Today they grub about in the wreckage of their
economy, no better off than the African disaster cases they used to assist,
and wonder how long the 'Special Period' can possibly continue.
Two rolls of bread a day, one box of matches a month, one bar of soap a
month, two portions of mince-and-soya paste a month, two pairs of underwear
a year . . . armed with her government-issue ration book, such is the level
of provision Mercedes now manages to obtain through the state. Often not
even these meagre undertakings can be met. Mercedes has not seen soap in the
government shops for three months. 'Mierda de nada,' she whispers, for good
measure.
At the end of the dark street, on the edge of Old Havana, we emerge into a
rare constellation of lights, the Hotel Plaza. No one, of course, manages to
live on the official ration, or on the official economy at all. It is around
the foreigner-frequented hotels that a parallel mechanism - a dollar-based
economy that pervades all sections of Cuban society - can be found in its
rawest, most distorted form.
For Cubans, life is an unending struggle, a daily series of problems which
must be resolved. There is a catch-all verb they apply to any action helping
them overcome their straitened circumstances - it is, simply, resolver, or
find a solution. One can, for example, like my hosts Luis and Isabel,
resolve the question of the spare bedroom by illegally renting it to
tourists. Consuelo down the road from Luis, on the other hand, has found her
own resolution in a supply of black market chickens that do not officially
exist; much to Mercedes' and my satisfaction, she runs a paladar, an illicit
back-room restaurant.
I am glad to have Mercedes by my side as we walk past the hotel entrance.
She is a sort of protection. For a good deal of 'resolving' in this part of
town takes place on the street, and involves separating foreigners from
their dollars. Cubans will go to desperate lengths to get hold of dollars,
for without them there is no meat, fuel, clothing, pharmaceuticals,
electrical goods, household items or much of anything else.
Some of the denizens lurking in the shadows here simply beg. They want soap
for their babies, milk powder for their mothers. I spot one who has already
asked me for the shirt off my back. These are not professional street
hustlers, but students, housewives, fathers, and there is no artfulness to
their approach. It makes their entreaties all the more painful.
Others have something to offer - themselves. Prostitution is now widespread
in Havana, although there is a wide gap between hard core professionals and
those casual young women willing to stay the night after an evening's
entertainment. Part of the problem is that there are many more single women
in Havana than men; over the years conscription for the Angolan war, the
Mariel boat lift, the haemmorrhage of young men to Miami, has made available
young men scarce. A young man with ready money in his pocket is even rarer.
On my first visit to the Plaza I was ambushed by two teenage girls in risque
attire who steered me straight to the bar. Were they after daquiris, pina
coladas, whisky, I wondered? Far from it. They craved the now-unavailable
treats of their childhood. One demanded a glass of milk, the other a gooey,
chocolate-covered marshmallow.
Lounging outside the doors of the Plaza we meet Ramon and Anna, already
acquaintances of mine. Like many of Havana's black marketeers, they are part
of a well organised system of theft and resale that operates in almost every
factory, warehouse, business and shop in Cuba. Ramon sells PPG-5, the
cholesterol-reducing miracle drug, fruit of Fidel's prestige medical
research project. Coincidentally, it commands a high street value for its
effects on male sexual potency. Anna acts as a street lookout for Ramon.
Most societies would judge Ramon and Anna's profession criminal, their
behaviour corrupt. But in an official economy as maladjusted to social needs
as Cuba's, definitions of corruption hardly mean much; what counts for
Cubans is a market-driven alternative that works. From the sidewalk, Ramon
tells me, he makes Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 dollars a day; in a state office
or factory he would not make five dollars a month.
Such a morality is widely accepted. Neither of Mercedes' parents work the
street, but both steal from the state. Her mother, a cigar roller, smuggles
cigars from the factory where she works. Her father, a petrol-tanker driver,
has an agreement with the depot foreman for the falsifying of way-bills. It
is the only way to keep food in the house.
Nor is the administration exempt from such behaviour. Ramon could never ply
his trade without the connivance of the police and his local Committee for
the Defense of the Revolution, the organisation that regulates Cuban life on
a city block-by-block basis. Ramon regularly turns over a percentage of
profits to his CDR chief. In its own interests the regime tolerates a
certain level of black marketeering and petty corruption - it relieves
pressure on the state to provide.
It also relieves Mercedes and me of the task of finding an officially
licensed taxi. Just outside the glow of the Plaza's lights a wheezing,
fly-by-night Moscovitch skulks. We climb in and clatter along the Malecon
sea front, six lanes of deserted city-centre highway, to the 1830 Club.
Through the doors of the dance club lies another world, a brave and shiny
new Cuba in which failure might never have existed.
In a seaside garden of rustling palm trees and well-kept lawns, a crowd sits
scattered around an outdoor dance floor. They are well off, wealthy enough
to spend in an evening what most Cubans earn in six months. They are young.
The men are casual and tanned. They smile a lot. The women are sleek, well
made up, alluring.
This is not exactly the old elite, the senior military, the party
ideologues, the command economy captains who grew up fighting in the
mountains with Fidel Castro. These are their children, the technocratic
class, Cuba's new elite. They work for new joint ventures, in import-export
agencies, the tourist industry. They have access to dollars, to the outside
world, to new ideas.
Mercedes and I sip rum daquiris, wander in the garden, dance to American
disco music. There is a Tropicana-style floor show - all sequins and legs.
Then a fashion show - casual opulence and legs again. More drinks, more
dancing. Mercedes is entranced. Her eyes sparkle, rove over the clothing,
the coloured cocktails, the happy couples.
Returning from the dance floor I meet a small-time Swiss businessman, a
maverick at the far edge of emerging markets. His face is flushed with
achievement - today through his Cuban partner he has purchased yet another
downtown Havana apartment at a rock-bottom price.
Cuba will change fast, he assures me. Already the signs are there, in the
recently-opened private markets for farmer's produce, in a new European
investment fund for Cuba, in rumours of foreign financing for the sugar
industry.
'In two or three years all this unpleasantness between Cuba and the US will
be patched up,' he beams with anticipation. 'Investments will come rolling
in. Then watch real estate prices rocket]'
In the taxi back to Ramon and Isabel's I am perturbed. I am unable to make
the link between this gasping, exhausted city and the self-assured ease of
the 1830 Club. It all seems make-believe, I tell Mercedes.
I am still perturbed back in the room where the little table-fan whirs and
the radio continues pumping hot Latin music into the night. Where will it
end, I ask Mercedes. Surely something good must lie at the end of such hard
times?
The sparkle has left her eyes. 'You still don't understand,' she says
quietly, reluctantly, shaking her head. 'That was not make-believe. That is
the future.
'Do you think because our economy is in ruins the state is in ruins? There
is something that counts more in Cuba than economics. It is political power.
It is as strong as ever, as absolute and privileged as ever.
'The men who run this country see the writing on the wall. They know the old
times are gone forever. But do you think they will surrender their places to
some new, local breed, or to Cubans screaming for their jobs from Miami?'
She pours herself a last glass of Paticruzados. 'Yesterday the men at the
1830 Club were good communists. Tomorrow they will be good capitalists. The
lies will change, but the liars will be the same.'
And what, I ask, will happen to her patients, her neighbours, her
compatriots, the people of Old Havana?
Mercedes downs her glass, shivers, and closes her eyes. She is tired, and
bitter, and has the chronic victim's calm certainty of the future.
'Nothing,' she replies 'the elite shall remain the elite, with all their
power and privilege. The poor of Cuba shall remain the poor.'
She is whispering now, nearly asleep. 'It seems that is the way of the
world. They say we are the last state of our kind on earth. But are we not,
after all, much the same as everyone else?'

FT  03 DEC 94 / The Blair project and the pot of gold: Can the Labour leader
overcome the Tories' bribe and become the next conservative prime minister?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look around the House of Commons and you see at once who would make the best
leader of the Conservative party. There he sits, just opposite the first
lord of the Treasury, a sense of destiny suppressing his usual nervous
smile. Can you doubt it? Tony Blair, Tory prime minister, would romp home
with a majority not seen since Margaret Thatcher left the stage.
Admittedly, the fact that he is leader of the opposition is an obstacle. It
can be overcome by standing the Labour party on its head, affixing the word
'new' to its title, and 'educating' the voters. That is the essence of what
Mr Blair calls his project. He could of course abandon the conservative
image that he conjures up in the electorate's mind. To do so would be to
waste an invaluable asset. The erstwhile socialists behind him must
therefore fall in line, a few stubborn dissenters being the only permissible
exception.
Mr Blair is apt to observe that he would not want his present job on any
other terms. When you see the disgraceful way in which the Tories are making
his choice of school for his 10-year-old son a political issue you wonder
why he, or anyone else, goes into politics at all.
We must assume, however, that he knew what he was in for when he bid for the
leadership. The way I read him, his plans for the further development of his
project are startling. Let the people's party embrace the prevailing
free-market ideology. Let it be the proponent of the dynamic market economy,
competition, choice, capitalism. A touch of regulation is needed, no more.
Capitalism? Surely not. Well, no. I was getting a bit carried away there. Mr
Blair is not in the habit of advertising himself as a capitalist, although
he has used the other previously taboo Tory words to describe 'new Labour'
and its supposedly continuing values. This week the formulation was
'competitive market economy with a strong industrial and wealth generating
base'. The least we capitalist-roaders can expect is something along those
lines in the revised statement of party aims and objectives called for by
the party leader at the conference in Blackpool in October.
Anything less, and Labour's internal debate about scrapping Clause IV of its
constitution will have been a waste of time. The consultative paper endorsed
by the national executive committee would not be 'historic', as Mr Blair
claimed on Wednesday, but just another piece of trash. The details of this
consultative exercise can be tedious, but the essence of the matter is
central to British politics in the 1990s. Clause IV is laced with pious
hooey about securing for 'the workers by hand or brain the full fruits of
their industry'. It speaks of doing so 'upon the basis of the common
ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange'.
This dotty quasi-Marxist invocation was appended to Labour's constitution in
the same month as the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. It has not been a
success, not as a guide to policy and certainly not as a vote-winner. It has
never been put into practice, not wholeheartedly, not even by the
nationalising Labour government of 1945-51. If it had been, Britain would
long since have been packed into containers and driven in lorries to eastern
Europe. Nobody, not workers by hand or brain nor anyone else, has benefited
from the clause, the most famous passage of which is printed on every Labour
party membership card. The single exception is the Conservative party, which
has used it as a weapon of counter-propaganda.
Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since Hugh Gaitskell lost his
battle to have Clause IV dropped. He died before he could 'fight and fight
and fight again' to save the party he loved. The poison clause was left
intact until April 1992, when, after losing four elections in a row, it
became clear that it would have to be removed. The late John Smith was
unconvinced, even when in March last year Jack Straw produced a pamphlet
arguing the case for amendment.
Mr Straw's proposed substitute clause mentions markets, but demands that
they be the servants not the masters of the community. The latter 'should
intervene through appropriate measures of regulation, control and public
ownership'. Since he managed Mr Blair's campaign in the leadership election
after the death of Mr Smith, Mr Straw's ideas presumably carry weight.
Labour would be better served by a constitution that omitted any mention of
public ownership, such as the Fabian Society draft produced in summer 1993.
Best of all would be the version produced by Stephen Pollard, and published
by the Social Market Foundation a fortnight ago. It includes the
formulation: '. . . all relevant decisions should be taken according to the
workings of the market'. State control, says this optimum Clause IV 'is only
justified where other forms of ownership are incapable of delivering the
efficient allocation of resources'.
It may be that the party will not swallow anything so stark. Mr Blair is
attempting to bedazzle his followers by surrounding the core issue - the
wholehearted acceptance of the market - with clouds of rhetoric about what
other parties in other countries do. These are speckled with talk about
'social justice, freedom, opportunity, equality, democracy and solidarity'.
His central idea, which is that people owe a duty to one another as well as
themselves is, however, appealing. You could say that he sees the 'me'
generation of the 1980s being succeeded by the 'we' generation in the 1990s.
He had better get a move on. Labour has a huge lead in the opinion polls
today, but that must be set against the mountainous bag of our gold that
Kenneth Clarke is stashing away in order to bribe us to vote Tory when the
election comes. The chancellor has two budgets ahead, enough to dissolve any
poll lead.
Mr Blair will understand better than anyone that talk of community values is
a hard sell against reductions in taxes on incomes. Mr Clarke stood up twice
in the House of Commons this week, performing at his best as the prime
minister sat slumped on the seat beside him. He is the only potential
Conservative leader who might be a match for Mr Blair.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: The changing face of taxation - You cannot
impose levies on an international market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is a British chancellor of the exchequer proposing to freeze the tax on
beer but remove another slice of the tax subsidies on housing? This is
surely not traditional British political behaviour.
And why is he doubling valued added tax on household fuel, at substantial
political cost, while also considering removing the withholding tax on
government bond interest, a change that would gain not a single vote at the
next election? It is easy to be impressed by the political bluster that may
be used to justify such decisions, but less easy to distinguish the
long-term pressures which are pushing the tax system in particular
directions.
A British Budget statement is a curious ritual in which an apparently
all-powerful finance minister produces a series of rabbits from a battered
red box. Last Tuesday's speech by Kenneth Clarke was duller than most, but
he still revelled in his ability to select arbitrary targets without warning
or prior consultation. He proposed a tax on kiddies' arcade video games;
surely you cannot get much meaner than that, although he knows the teenage
lobby is a lot less powerful than the pensioner pressure groups which may
yet scupper the proposed domestic energy VAT increase.
Yet, when a government can no longer command a reliable parliamentary
majority, the chancellor has to accept limits to his power. Once, in 1977,
Denis Healey had to reverse a Budget petrol tax increase when the Liberals
proved tiresome over the cost to Liberal-minded folk in remote country
districts.
There is, however, a more important way in which tax gathering has become
increasingly constrained. The economy has become open. Capital, goods and
people flow readily across borders. This produces faster economic growth,
lower costs and greater choice. But when tax authorities fail to recognise
the implications, strange distortions follow inevitably.
Take the European Union's so-called single market. This has generated a
bizarre chain of alcoholic drink transfers - from Italy and Spain into
France, from France into the UK, and from the UK into Ireland. This
northwards cascade of booze follows the geographical progression of alcohol
taxation.
Consider also the way little Luxembourg has become one of Europe's biggest
centres for investment funds, with assets worth more than Dollars 250bn -
substantially bigger than those of the UK's unit trust industry. This is due
almost entirely to the tax-free status of funds there; this has proved a
magnet for European tax-dodgers, especially in Germany.
Britain is responding belatedly by introducing new, open-ended investment
companies (Oeics) which will be able to pay dividends tax-free to
foreigners. These Oeics probably will supplant unit trusts in due course.
Clarke also is tempted to open up the gilt-edged market fully to foreigners
because this would cut the government's borrowing costs. An open sale and
re-purchase (or 'repo') market would permit large-scale speculative trading
and, by improving liquidity, would make gilts more attractive to the world's
fickle and foot-loose investors.
Yet, the Inland Revenue might have to stop deducting tax on gilt interest
payments at source because global investors cannot be bothered to buy
securities, on which they must claim back tax, when there are plenty of
untaxed bonds they can buy instead. You cannot impose tax on an
international market: after all, that was precisely why the Eurobond market
came to London in the 1960s: to escape from US withholding tax. But to pay
gilt-edged interest gross of tax could turn out to be a charter for evasion
by domestic investors in Britain.
Ultimately, the tax authorities will have to wake up to the truth: that, if
you eliminate borders, you can tax only the things that cannot move to a
more friendly jurisdiction. You must stop trying to tax investments and
company profits and goods that can be transported easily, and concentrate on
taxing jobs, property and internal services.
Yes, property: it is quite likely that our houses will, over a period of
years, finally cease to be subsidised and will become taxed quite highly.
Owner-occupied housing became a remarkable tax shelter after the
Conservatives abolished the old Schedule A tax in 1963. Houses were exempt
from capital gains tax, and there was income tax relief on mortgage interest
at anything up to 83 per cent. This tax haven status lasted until 1974, but
then began to be undermined as inflation ate into the value of Healey's
once-generous Pounds 25,000 ceiling for mortgages qualifying for tax relief.
From next April, interest tax relief will be limited to 15 per cent on
Pounds 30,000 of debt - worth no more than about Pounds 400 a year at
present mortgage rates. This residual benefit is likely to be phased out,
perhaps under the cover of income tax cuts elsewhere, over the next two or
three years. Capital gains tax on first homes might come next.
How different is the trend in taxing investment. In the post-war environment
especially (but not only), when Labour was in power, and when investors
trapped in the UK by tough foreign exchange controls were sitting ducks for
penal taxation, their 'unearned' income was taxed at premium rates. The
worst year was 1968-69 when Roy Jenkins imposed a special 12-month surcharge
which pushed the top tax rate on investment income to 136 per cent.
Now, however, the top rate is 40 per cent. Moreover, there are useful
tax-free personal pension plans, Tessas and Peps, the latter accumulating in
a substantial way over a period of years and now open to corporate bonds as
well as equities (although, curiously, not to the government's own
gilt-edged bonds).
Clarke has added venture capital trusts to the list of tax shelters. How
different this is to the style of Jenkins. But this is not just because
Clarke is of a different political persuasion. It is because we live in a
different world.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Cream for comfortable cats - Gillian O'Connor
surveys the Budget and picks out the good news for top-end investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke was suitably modest in his presentation of this week's
Budget. Left and right agreed that the chancellor had plenty to be modest
about. All the changes that mattered - the big tax increases - had been
flagged a year ago. This year's minor concessions are just a way of marking
time as cheaply as possible until next year's give-away Budget.
So far, so dull. But if you look at the detail of the measures affecting
savers and investors (analysed in the next four pages), they are remarkably
generous. Comfortable cats should get even plumper - provided they look hard
before they guzzle down the cream.
The only class of investors which actually suffers is the poor - notably,
those canny enough to take advantage of the generous, tax-free, government
save-as-you-earn schemes (see page 4). These offered the cognoscenti better
rates than most savings accounts - but contributions were limited to Pounds
20 a month. Other blows at the impecunious are the abolition of the National
Savings regular savings scheme and the increase in the cost of buying gilts
at the post office.
The popular, tax-free Tessa savings accounts get an extension; a big mercy
for building societies. But the extension will only be welcomed by apathetic
savers: Tessas looked attractive when launched, but that was at a time of
high interest rates. They are far less attractive now.
The most important Budget concessions concern personal equity plans,
high-risk investment in very small companies, and pensions. All are
interesting, but the concessions on high-risk investment could trap the
unwary. And there is a very real danger that the new flexibility for
personal pensions could prompt another wave of mis-selling.
The proposal to allow Pep investors to put money into corporate bonds,
convertibles and EU preference shares (see page 3) is as welcome as it is
unexpected. It will be particularly useful to cautious investors interested
mainly in a high income.
Bonds work very much like gilts, with three significant and connected
differences. They have higher yields than the equivalent gilt - that is,
both your present income and your eventual total return will be usefully
higher than if you invest in a gilt. But - as with an equity share - there
is always the possibility that the company issuing the bond will run into
trouble and default on either the interest or capital payments. The greater
credit risk is why the market values corporate bonds cautiously, and why
they yield more.
But fans of corporate bonds are arguing already that a portfolio providing a
broad spread of bonds can offer a higher yield than one made up of gilts
with only a marginally inferior credit risk: if you have a dozen bonds in a
fund, the risk of all of the borrowers defaulting is less than the
individual risk that each one of them might. (An argument that should not be
pushed to excess - as victims of the junk bond collapse in the US would
testify). Intelligent use of bonds should make it possible to offer cautious
investors a better alternative to building society deposits than products
such as guaranteed equity bonds. High-income unit trust managers have
already gone into overdrive working out ways to mix and match different
bonds.
It is always possible that some investors will manage to get into trouble
with corporate bonds because they do not understand them or misuse them. It
is virtually certain that many investors will get into trouble with the
Budget's new concessions for high-risk investment (see page 2).
The total tax shield - tax breaks of up to 60 per cent on investments of up
to Pounds 200,000 - sounds alluring, but with good reason. Both enterprise
investment schemes and venture capital trusts are intrinsically high-risk
investments, and many investors will lose some or most of their money.
The fact that an investment saves tax is never a good reason for making a
bad investment. Many investors fail to understand this, and they are pained
when they lose money in ventures that always looked unlikely to succeed -
for example, the early business start-up schemes. And even schemes which
look relatively solid - such as the residential business expansion schemes -
have been known to turn sour.
Anyone with Pounds 200,000 of capital gains to invest ought to be able to
afford decent financial advice. More vulnerable are ordinary members of
company pension schemes. The Budget proposal - to allow pensioners to choose
their own moment to swap their pension fund for an annuity (see page 5) -
applies only to personal pensions.
Already, some hard-nosed salesmen are suggesting that this is another
splendid opportunity to persuade members of company pension schemes to
transfer to a personal pension. No way.

FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: RJB Mining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 11 per cent cut in the price RJB Mining is paying for English Coal may
look like smart haggling. But it makes little difference to its financial
prospects. RJB is getting less for less: most of the Pounds 99m reduction
can be accounted for by lower stocks and greater liabilities. Admittedly,
the lower price allows RJB to cancel its Pounds 100m corporate bond. That,
together with the opportunity to defer part of the payment, may help reduce
interest payments and improve cash-flow, but only marginally.
Until April 1998, when the electricity generators' fixed contracts expire,
English Coal will enjoy strong cash flow. By the end of that period, RJB
should have paid off its bank debt. The problem for equity investors remains
forecasting what happens thereafter. Investors have limited objective advice
to call on. There is a dearth of City expertise and the specialist
consultants' forecasts diverge considerably. With so much still uncertain,
it is unfortunate the gap between the prospectus' publication and the
offer's close will be just one week.
The company's long-term attraction will be dependent on the accuracy of
RJB's ambitious assumptions for volumes and prices after 1998. Much depends
on RJB's ability to cut costs sufficiently so it can deliver coal cheaply
enough to keep out imports. RJB has proved highly successful at open-cast
mining, but its relative inexperience in deep mines is worrying. For equity
investors, RJB is a high-risk company. The price, when set, will need to
reflect that.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Should companies massage investors' expectations ahead of formal
announcements containing bad news? If they do give analysts a nod and a
wink, do they not end up breaching laws designed to prevent insider dealing?
Such questions have been raised starkly by the pummelling BTR's share price
has taken since it revealed disappointing results in September. This week's
trading statement did only a little to repair the damage.
BTR could undoubtedly have done more ahead of its results, perhaps through
an expanded analysis of trading conditions at its annual meeting in May. But
Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, its finance director, was right not to give analysts
a private steer as to what was coming. The dissemination of price-sensitive
information other than to the market as a whole is, in most cases, banned
under this year's beefed-up legislation. The practice of giving 'guidance'
on profits forecasts is not specifically outlawed and certain finance
directors are still willing to give off-the-record hints. But they may be
breaking the law. Stock exchange rules interpreting the law should be
tightened to eliminate the grey area.
This would give analysts a headache, as they thrive on obtaining an
information advantage. It need not upset institutional investors who can opt
to obtain privileged information by agreeing not to deal. All, including
small shareholders, would benefit if companies were to publish more
information, more frequently.

FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Virtue's modest reward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets have been caught in a vicious circle all year from which
they may just be escaping. So far, 1994 has been characterised by a tumbling
dollar and falling US bond prices, leading scared Japanese investors to sell
dollar assets so making matters even worse. European markets have had
limited success decoupling from the US. But yesterday the dollar poked its
head above the Y100 level, building on a rally that has lasted a month. The
yield on the long US Treasury bond also dipped below 8 per cent and there is
talk of Japanese investors once again buying dollar bonds.
The change in mood is modest but real. Investors, who previously thought the
US Federal Reserve was not taking tough enough action to pre-empt inflation,
have been impressed by last month's 75 basis-point rise in short-term
interest rates. Recent weeks have seen a pronounced flattening of the yield
curve, implying that the market expects further rate rises from the Fed and
thinks they will keep inflation at acceptable levels. If this tentative mood
change is sustained, the year's vicious circle could be replaced by a
virtuous one, in which a stronger dollar encourages Japanese investors to
buy dollar assets which in turn provide more support for the currency.
The market's reaction to yesterday's employment data shows its willingness
to look on the bright side. Non-farm employment rose faster than expected in
November, which could have been seen as inflationary. But comment focused on
the falls in hourly earnings and the average working week. Inflation will
undoubtedly pick up in the US. But 8 per cent bond yields already discount
quite a lot on that front.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Tory faithful toast Ribena Kid: A party to mark Portillo's
10 years as an MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was billed as the biggest Conservative party celebration since the
election victory more than two years ago.
More than 560 of the party faithful braved a protest against the Criminal
Justice Bill and a tight cordon of policemen and cameramen around London's
Alexandra Palace yesterday to join in the fun marking Mr Michael Portillo's
10th year as MP for Enfield Southgate.
The loyal friends and members of Mr Portillo's constituency party had paid
Pounds 30 a head for the black tie dinner and dance.
A video film devoted to the life and times of the employment secretary was
to be the highlight of the evening, although there were rumours last night
that it had fallen victim to a bout of ministerial modesty.
The video had been expected to chart his rise from an early appearance as a
'Ribena Kid' in television commercials, to his anti-Brussels speech at this
year's Tory party conference.
Some guests said they were there for the Christmas party of the Enfield and
Southgate Conservative Association. Others admitted Mr Portillo was the real
cause for celebration.
Party-goer Dr Dennis Singh was one of a 20-strong contingent from Finchley,
Baroness Thatcher's former constituency. 'We have come to crown the Crown
Prince,' he said. 'He's an honest, sincere man and he is Thatcherite to the
core, as I am. Michael Portillo will be the next prime minister.'
Constituency officials, who spent several months preparing the black-tie
affair, described the party as a 'fund-raising event'. Local businessmen
were courted for their financial support and even sponsorship of the event,
which featured an after-dinner speech by former television presenter Mr
Gyles Brandreth, who is MP for Chester.
Less sympathetic observers had suggested the party could become a campaign
rally for the 41-year-old minister, who has been tipped as a future Tory
leader.
They compared last night's extravaganza to the low-key events held by other
MPs. Mr John Major's 10th anniversary as MP for Huntingdon in 1989 was
marked by a small party and the gift of a silver salver.
Mr Jeremy Lucas from Colchester rejected suggestions that Pounds 30 was too
high a price to pay for a sight of Mr Portillo. 'Unlike the Labour party two
years ago, which charged Pounds 500 a ticket for a party event and made it
very elitist, we have been charged just Pounds 30 a head which seems very
reasonable.'
The organisers had planned a surprise party for the minister. But in August,
the Enfield and Southgate Conservative Association was aghast to find that
details had leaked to the press.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein ready to discuss IRA arms as part of full Ulster
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein is prepared to discuss the crucial question of the disposal of IRA
weapons - but only in the context of an overall settlement in Northern
Ireland, one of the organisation's leading political strategists said
yesterday.
The disclosure by Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's northern chairman, came
as the Northern Ireland Office announced that next week's talks with the
IRA's political wing had been put back 48 hours to December 9 at Sinn Fein's
request.
Whitehall officials said last night that they had been given no explanation
for the delay, beyond being told that the Sinn Fein delegation wanted more
time to prepare.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr McLaughlin is among six Sinn Fein councillors
who have been invited to an important Belfast investment conference to be
launched by the prime minister on December 13 and 14.
It was initially decided that Sinn Fein would not be invited to attend the
conference. But the government appeared to change its stance after several
US institutions threatened to boycott it.
Mr McLaughlin said Sinn Fein was 'prepared, perfectly prepared, to discuss
the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland, both
legal and illegal'.
But he said the weapons question had to be resolved in the context of
discussions on 'the political conditions in Ireland and how we can replace
those failed political structures with agreed political structures'.
The British government wants the issue of paramilitary arsenals to be
addressed in the preliminary talks due to begin next week and not in future
political negotiations to which Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives may
in time be admitted.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that
preliminary discussions 'must elicit proposals for the disposal of arms and
explosives'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a speech to the Conservative Women's
conference in London yesterday to confirm that the government would also
begin talks with loyalist political representatives before Christmas.

FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as bonds post
strong gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices surged yesterday on the heels of a soaring bond market to
post their highest gains in more than a month, writes Lisa Bransten in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 44.75 at 3,745.62. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 4.38 at 453.30, while the American Stock
Exchange composite gained 1.27 at 432.46. The Nasdaq composite rose 3.84 at
745.03. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 285m shares.
The 30-year bond rallied strongly taking heart from a decline in wage
inflation to 2.6 per cent. By 4pm, the long bond was up over a point, with
its yield pushed back below 8 per cent. Two-year bonds were up 1/32 ,
helping to flatten substantially the yield curve.
Also contributing to the rally were gains by the dollar against the Japanese
yen and the D-mark. By the end of the day, the dollar was at Y100.60 and
DM1.5800.
The rally came despite more signs of inflationary pressures in the economy.
The labour department reported that November's unemployment rate was 5.6 per
cent, down from 5.8 per cent in October. The figures came at the end of a
week-long barrage of economic data indicating a robust economy, which
earlier in the week created fears that the Federal Reserve would boost
interest rates.
Retail stocks were mixed as news of lower-than-expected sales for some
swamped out early reports of strong consumer spending so far this holiday
season. Dayton Hudson fell Dollars 1 at Dollars 79 3/4 , Kmart lost Dollars
 1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 and Dillards Department Stores dropped Dollars  1/4
at Dollars 27 7/8 . Investors returned to Best Buy, pushing the shares up
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 33 1/4 . The electronics retailer lost more than
Dollars 11 after it reported earnings well below expectations.
Commercial banks, which tend to be sensitive to changes in the interest
rates, posted narrow gains. NationsBank rose Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 5/8
, BankAmerica up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41 1/4 , Chemical Banking up
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 37 3/8 and Citicorp up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41
1/4 . Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at Dollars 35 3/8 .
Canada
The Toronto Stock Exchange was up slightly on the day as booming metal
stocks balanced out heavy losses in gold shares. While a strong late-session
rally in New York helped lift the weaker Canadian market.
The TSE 300 composite index added 10.57 points, or 0.26 per cent, to
4,092.99, with losers over winners at 369 to 326. Volume of 61.7m shares was
down from yesterday's 70m. The TSE 300 lost 6.26 points on the week.
Seven of the 14 sub-indexes were up, led by metals, paper, financial and
industrial product stocks. Real estate and gold stocks led the declining
issues. Metal stocks were the stars, adding 2.68 per cent. The leader was
Inco, which jumped 2 1/8 to 40 3/8 in active trading. Mexico
Stocks closed down 2.08 per cent yesterday in a bout of foreign investor
profit taking and price adjusting to Thursday's decline on Wall Street.
The IPC index closed off 53.86 points at 2,537.48 - a loss of 2.08 per cent.
At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63.
Traders said the Mexican Stock Exchange saw a relatively sleepy session
apart from opening arbitrage transactions as investors moved to balance out
local prices of American Depositary Receipts of Mexican blue chips.
The market was closed on Thursday for the inauguration of President Ernesto
Zedillo, and traders said his speech had little effect on stock movements.
They also said the currency added little pressure to the market. The spot
dollar closed almost flat at 3.4390 new pesos, from 3.4405 new pesos at
Wednesday's close.
Volume totalled a light 863.6 million new pesos, on 61.6 million shares
traded.

FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar's strength helps
bourses move ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar strength in the aftermath of yesterday's US jobs data helped some
European bourses and raised expectations that the US Fed would increase
interest rates once again, which analysts said was generally good news.
FRANKFURT found little enthusiasm to end the week, the Dax index falling
just 8.08 to 2,038.51, for a week's decline of 0.6 per cent.
Turnover was around DM4bn. In the Ibis the index closed at 2,040.24.
Volkswagen remained in focus as analysts met the group.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, admitted that there was no 'sustained
recovery' in sight, but added that forecasts could be met 'even under
difficult circumstances'. The stock lost DM4.70 to DM414.80, picking up to
DM416.20 in the post, for an 8 per cent decline over the week.
The VW story is in contrast to that of BMW, up 50 pfennigs at DM749. Hoare
Govett is positive about the group, rating it a buy on the grounds of
accelerating sales growth, boosted by new models.
In the post-bourse financial stocks made advances, ahead of results from
Deutsche and Dresdner next week. Dresdner, off 50 pfennigs at DM412.00 in
usual hours, ended at DM413 in the Ibis.
PARIS was given a push by Wall Street and the CAC-40 index rose 18.76 to
1,982.71, but in low turnover of less than FFr3bn. The market rose 2 per
cent on the week.
News of a rise in French car sales held motor stocks: Peugeot up FFr9 at
FFr791 and Renault 90 centimes firmer at FFr181.80. Michelin improved 90
centimes to FFr204.90.
Eurotunnel fell 95 centimes or 2.5 per cent to FFr20.90. The Eurotunnel
shareholders association in Paris said yesterday that the government should
inject FFr4bn to help the group through present difficulties.
MILAN lacked direction, with this week's accord on pensions between the
government and unions still providing some grounds for optimism but there
were nerves about the outcome of the second round of local elections
tomorrow.
The Comit index finished 1.44 lower at 631.45, up 1.3 per cent on the week.
Fiat finished L68 lower at L6,008.
The shares had dipped to a low of L5,970 after a block trade of 20.1m
shares, equal to 0.75 per cent of the company's capital, was traded at
L6,070, raising immediate fears of a large divestment.
However, an analyst said later that the trade was more likely to have been
technical, perhaps related to warrants, and added that there would be no
logic in making a divestment through one large block trade under existing
market conditions.
Among the banks, Credito Italiano eased L2 to L1,626 and Credito Romagnolo
was L1207 lower at L17,162 as speculation grew that there could be further
moves in Italiano's bid for control this weekend.
STOCKHOLM followed the trend throughout the continent with the Affarsvarlden
general index falling 10.60 to 1,488.90, slightly down on the week.
Turnover was thin at SKr2.3bn.
Astra eased SKr3.50 to SKr198 on profit-taking but Trelleborg was up SKr1.50
to SKr111.
MADRID shook off early worries to close with small gains as late buyers
entered the market. The general index picked up 1.39 to 301.92, and finished
little changed over the week.
Much of the day's interest centred on Central Hispano Bolsa's acquisition of
Banesto shares. Dealers said Banco Central Hispano was believed to be
calling in shares put up as guarantees by Mr Mario Conde, the former Banesto
chairman.
Banesto finished Pta9 lower at Pta938.
ISTANBUL's rally continued, and the market closed at yet another new high
for the year. The composite index added 717.87, or 2.5 per cent, to
29,145.1, a week's gain of 8 per cent.
Turnover was TL4,870bn, down from Thursday's TL6,700bn, which was an
all-time-high.
Brokers said that activity switched from state-owned stocks to
private-sector shares having good year-end expectations.

FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Bumpy road likely for Swiss investors -
A market that is far from boring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is getting more difficult to accuse the Swiss of being dull.
The tense proxy battle last month between the board of Union Bank of
Switzerland and BK Vision, its largest shareholder, attracted wide attention
and whetted investors' appetites for further displays of shareholder
aggression against complacent boards.
Analysts are also scratching their heads over the extraordinary strength of
the Swiss franc. Its big rises this year against the dollar and leading
European currencies have done a lot of damage to earnings statements of
Swiss multinationals. But that means there could be some hefty positive
effects on next year's earnings if exchange rates return to more moderate
levels.
Add to that the uncertainty over the impact of the introduction at the
beginning of the year of value added tax, both on inflation and on corporate
margins, and you have lots of food for both bulls and bears.
This year, the bears have clearly been in control. The all share Swiss
Performance Index is off 9 per cent on the year and 15.7 per cent down from
its end January peak. The blue chip SMI index has done even worse, plunging
19.3 per cent since the peak, reflecting a widespread downgrading of the
Swiss market as a whole in most international portfolios. It finished up 1.5
at 2577.5.
After three years of sparkling rises, this setback was hardly a surprise,
although few expected it to be so brutal. The rise of the Swiss franc and
the drastic slump in earnings from the big three universal banks counted for
a lot in the deterioration of sentiment.
For the moment, the view is that the Swiss market is not going to be an
outperformer in the next few months. 'We think that valuations are still
quite high,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz, head of Credit Suisse investment
research in Zurich. 'Our market recovered very early in the cycle, long
before the economy started to improve, and most of the earnings are in the
prices.'
Mr Tschanz sees the SMI up 10 per cent in a year's time to around 1,880.
Mr Martin Newson, of Goldman Sachs International in London, says the Swiss
market could put on between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in the next year,
'assuming that other European markets are also rising'. And on that basis,
he is maintaining a slight underweighting for Swiss stocks.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer, of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich, also wonders if the
Swiss market will suffer from the fresh focus cast on its political
isolation by recent decisions in Sweden and Finland to join the European
Union.
Mr Simon Marshall-Lockyer, of Kleinwort, Benson, is more optimistic, putting
the case for a strong rebound in earnings next year thanks to a significant
weakening of the Swiss franc.
Mr Marshall-Lockyer says the Swiss current account surplus could tumble to
SFr12bn this year from last year's record SFr27bn, and fall substantially
again next year, taking considerable pressure off the currency. He sees
Swiss interest rates staying flat in contrast to rises in the US and the UK.
'I think this is likely to result in an upgrading of earnings,' he says, and
points in particular to multinational industrials, such as power engineers
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, aluminium, packaging and chemicals group
Alusuisse-Lonza, and the cement giant Holderbank, as promising shares.
Holderbank has attracted a wide following in recent weeks on the strength of
higher earnings and the announcement this week of a less onerous fine from
the European Commission than expected for restricting competition.
The Holderbank bearers at SFr1,045 on Thursday were 12.5 per cent higher
than they were at the beginning of the year, and Mr Hasslauer sees further
potential as a result of strong earnings growth next year, thanks partly to
the weakening Swiss franc.
Other analysts share enthusiasm for cyclical stocks for investors willing to
take a longer view. 'We think this will be a very long cycle, carrying on
until 1997, and underlying inflation will be low,' says Mr Tschanz.
The fallout from the battle over the future governance of the UBS is still
difficult to assess. The lingering effective 12 per cent premium on the UBS
registered shares appears to reflect a suspicion that some compensation for
the loss of their extra voting power may still be won, perhaps in return for
a withdrawal by BK Vision of its legal appeal of the bank's now approved
plan to convert the registered into bearer shares.
UBS insists that it cannot legally offer any compensation.
On fundamental grounds, there is no enthusiasm for any of the banks' shares,
in spite of their steep falls this year. The SPI banking sub-index is off
24.3 per cent since the January peak. 'Yes, the stocks are down, but so are
the earnings,' says Mr Newson.
On one point there is unanimity - that in the wake of the UBS battle, most
Swiss companies will feel increasing pressure to provide higher returns to
shareholders.
'In such an environment, big companies will sell parts of their businesses
to focus on their core businesses and increase return on equity,' Mr Tschanz
says.

<TEXT>
Position covering by traders ahead of the weekend pulled a lacklustre market
lower, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 lost 15.30 to 18,998.30, up 1.7 per cent on the week. The 225
index drifted between a morning high of 19,080.22 and an afternoon low of
18,946, rallying before the close on arbitrage buying.
Losers outnumbered gainers 594 to 402 with 201 stocks unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks, after losing 1.21 on Thursday,
shed another 3.35 to 1,515.85, while the Nikkei 300 dipped 0.52 to 279.22.
The day's volume of 210m shares was down on the 265.29m shares that changed
hands Thursday.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.01 to 1258.01.
Leading steel makers shared in the day's declines on active trading. Nippon
Steel, the day's most active stock for the third consecutive session, was
off Y8 to Y366 in volume of 5.4m shares.
Japan Tobacco extended its declines to make a new low of Y955,000, down
Y5,000 on the day and nearly half a million off its October public offering
price of Y1,438,000.
In Osaka the OSE average slipped 63.82 to 21,115.19 in volume of 13.7m
shares. .
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight fall and anticipation of yesterday's US jobs data
put pressure on regional markets.
HONG KONG sank 2.5 per cent to a low for the year as losses were seen across
the board and the Hang Seng index finished 209.23 down at 8,221.57, having
been as low as 8,135.64. The index lost 5 per cent over the week. Turnover
rose to HKDollars 4.2bn as regional funds raised cash in preparation for
redemptions.
The latest H-share issue from China, Zhenhai Refining, plunged 30.5 cents to
HKDollars 2.075 on its debut from its offer price of HKDollars 2.38.
SINGAPORE fell 1.8 per cent as investors cleared positions ahead of the
weekend. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 40.33 to 2,189.02 for a
2.1 per cent fall on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up from the day's lows with the emergence of bargain
hunting but the composite index still finished down 8.39 at 977.74, having
been under pressure by afternoon selling, largely from funds from the US and
Japan. The index dropped 3.4 per cent over the week, amid worries about
rising interest rates locally and in the US, and bearish technical
indicators in several key KLSE index component stocks.
SEOUL extended early losses on hefty institutional selling of blue chips,
sending the market to a lower close for the third consecutive session. The
composite index lost 12.58 to 1,053.63 for a 2.9 per cent fall on the week.
TAIPEI closed higher in modest trade, led by state-run banks, despite
investor worries over today's elections, brokers said. The weighted index
added 35.77 to 6,479.82, off a high of 6,503.66, and 1 per cent up on the
week. Turnover was TDollars 54.8bn.
MANILA lost 1.8 per cent in the shadow of Wall Street's overnight fall. The
composite index fell 48.61 to 2,596.75, for a week's fall of 4.6 per cent.
Petron was the main loser, falling initially to an all-time low of 18.50
pesos in early trade, before settling at 19.25 pesos, off 0.50 pesos.
SYDNEY lost ground assisted by weakness in bullion. The All Ordinaries index
shed 20.3 to 1,880.1, a week's loss of 1.5 per cent, in turnover of ADollars
356m.
WELLINGTON ended at its lowest level for 14 months as the market continued
to follow weakness in overseas markets and reflect higher domestic interest
rates.
The NZSE-40 capital index lost 33.5 to 1,942.56 on the day and 2.5 per cent
on the week.
BANGKOK was depressed by renewed political uncertainty although the market
managed to close off session lows on buying interest initiated by fund
managers.
The SET index fell 33.49 to 1,338.11, after a low of 1,330.41, and in
turnover of Bt4.6b. The SET fell 2.4 per cent over the week.

FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities were sold hard during the afternoon as a lower price for gold,
softer world markets and activity ahead of the weekend eroded senti-ment.
Gains were seen in sectors related to reconstruction and development, but
late declines in other stocks dragged the index down.
The overall index shed 25.8 to 5,720.0, industrials 27.6 to 6,879.6 and gold
17.1 to 1,911.4. De Beers shed R1 to R89, while Anglos eased 50 cents to
R229.50.

FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market tumbles amid inflation
worries - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market remained a slave to events across the Atlantic as
well as domestic events and moved a step closer to the 3,000 level on the
FT-SE 100 index in the wake of yet more worrying economic news from the US.
At the end of another session of low volumes but high anxiety the FT-SE 100
was left nursing a further 22.3 decline at 3,017.3, a two-day decline of
64.1.
The latest bout of weakness left the 100 index down 16.2 in a week that
included what was perceived by most equity market strategists as a broadly
neutral Budget.
Second-line stocks were also given a rough ride, with the FT-SE Mid Cap 250
index settling 17.2 off at 3,459.9, down 37.9 over the sessions and 20.4 on
the week.
It was the release of the latest US data on employment levels that
exacerbated an early fall in the London equity market.
US non-farm payrolls, which were forecast by London-based economists to come
in around 220,000-230,000, actually rose 350,000, which startled London
traders who quickly marked prices lower expecting Wall Street to plunge.
The sharp increase in job creation in the US manufacturing sector was seen
as another inflationary trend in the US, following hard on the heels of a
series of disturbing economic trends this week.
Earlier in the week it was revealed that US gross domestic product for the
third quarter had been revised upwards to show a year-on-year rise of 3.9
per cent, while the consumer confidence index rocketed and the National
Purchasing Management index came in well above forecasts.
But Wall Street's response to the jobs data confounded the UK market. The US
market rose 15 points shortly after the opening only to slip back into
negative territory before stabilising in mid-session.
Share prices in London wilted at the outset, with market-makers unhappy
about recent talk of interest rate rises both here and in the US. Wall
Street's overnight 38-points fall, plus the rate rise fears in London, saw
share prices marked down sharply and the FT-SE 100 off some 18 points at the
opening. Various half-hearted attempts at a rally came to nothing and prices
weakened again after the US news.
Summing up the day's events, the head of trading at one of the leading
broking houses in the City said the market was delicately poised. 'There are
stories of a big switch out of equities and into bonds in the US, as well as
stories that the US inflation story has been overplayed and the Dow set to
rally strongly.'
He cautioned, however, that intense volatility is usually a bad sign and
that most of the big market-making firms in London were trading off small
short books.
Others took the view that the market had factored in any bad news regarding
inflation and that many of the big funds were now focusing on dividend
potential.
The regional electricity stocks surged ahead in the morning session as the
market alive with stories that either Hanson or Scottish Power were about to
bid for Northern Electric. Other recs also made rapid progress as analysts
highlighted the prospects of big dividend increases in the sector. On
Thursday Seeboard set the benchmark for dividend increases in the sector,
announcing a 21 per cent rise in the interim payment.
Another story circulating in the market was that Ladbroke was considering
the sale of its Texas DIY division to Sainsbury.
Turnover in equities totalled a disappointing 447.5m shares, with non-FT-SE
stocks accounting for 57 per cent of the day's business.
Customer turnover on Thursday jumped to Pounds 1.76bn, the highest level for
two weeks.
The FT-SE 100's best performance came from Royal Bank of Scotland, after the
market re-assessed the 25 per cent dividend increase.

Stock index futures had a volatile session, ending sharply lower in by far
the heaviest volume of the week, writes Jeffrey Brown.

net 31 points lower.
Volume rose steeply from 1pm onwards after the latest US unemployment data.
There were 15,919 contracts traded, up from 12,828 on Thursday. Stock option
volume was 44,235 lots, compared to 32,365.

FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms buzz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecoms shares were active ahead of the publication on Tuesday of Oftel's
consultative document on interconnection charges. BT dipped 6 to 370p in
5.3m turnover and Cable and Wireless shed 3 to 376p.
Interconnection charges are the fees paid to BT by users of its network.
Hoare Govett sees any changes as relatively neutral for BT but potentially
profitable for C&amp;W, boosting profits at its Mercury subsidiary by around a
fifth from 1996.
On Vodafone - down 1 1/2 to 198 1/2 p - Hoare Govett expect interconnection
charge moves to lead to a big jump in volume through reduced charges for
incoming calls.
Otherwise, talk in the sector centred on prospects for C&amp;W expanding its
services side. It is widely thought to be in talks to buy 25 per cent of
Amadeus, Europe's airline reservations network. Turnover in the shares was
2.3m.
Regional electricity companies continued to see keen demand with dealers
expecting sharply increased dividends as more companies report figures.
Dealers were also hoping for further news on the flotation of the National
Grid, which is owned by the 12 generators.
The sector was further enlivened by speculation that international
conglomerate Hanson, or Scottish Power, was about to launch a bid for one of
the recs. Northern appeared to be the favourite to be on the receiving end
of such a bid. Shares in Northern put on 10 to 853p, though Scottish eased 2
to 355p. Hanson was steady at 237p.
One of the sector's best performers was Southern which improved 11 to 805p.
National Power improved 4 to 497p.
Hard-hit Royal Bank of Scotland recovered 9 to 409p as some analysts felt
the stock had been too harshly treated after top-of-the-range results.
Lehman Brothers told clients that RBoS remained one of its two favoured
stocks in the banking sector and the recent setback presented a buying
opportunity.
Also Panmure Gordon was recommending the stock for which it has what appears
to be the highest profit forecast in the City so far - Pounds 650m. NatWest
Securities also increased its estimates.
Lloyds Abbey Life shed 5 1/2 to 321p with some analysts arguing that the
stock was overvalued.
SmithKline Beecham added a penny at 425p in the 'A's after some US
investment banks bought the Units actively.
Oil group Burmah Castrol improved 3 to 821p as Lehman Brothers turned more
positive on the stock. The house moved to a buy on the stock in order to
reflect the strong growth forecast for the chemicals industry.
Paper and plastics group Bunzl gained 4 to 167p after a successful visit by
analysts to its cigarette filter plant in Jarrow and some upgrades.
A 3.8 per cent increase in full-year profits from brewer Wolverhampton &amp;
Dudley was below market expectations and the shares eased 2 to 526p. Several
brokers marginally downgraded current year profit expectations - among them,
Hoare Govett shaved Pounds 1m off its forecast to Pounds 41m.
Nervous trading in Taunton Cider ahead of Tuesday's interim figures left the
shares 2 lighter at 155p. However, Mansfield Brewery, which reports interims
the day after, were in demand and the shares rose 6 to 228p.
A big seller of Scottish &amp; Newcastle was seen early in the session, bringing
a decline to the stock. The shares tumbled 13 to 498p, with traders
attributing part of the decline to nervous trading ahead of Monday's interim
figures. Ladbroke closed 5 lighter at 153p as talk started to circulate that
the group was about to sell Texas, its DIY subsidiary.
International trader Lonrho saw 4.8m shares change hands on the back of two
boardroom appointments which analysts interpreted as a further step in the
company's process of normalisation. The shares ended 1 1/2 lower at 155 1/2
p.
In building materials Blue Circle and Rugby, the two groups at the centre of
a wrangle with the European Union over cement cartel fines, fell 10 to 291p
and 3 to 119p respectively. In each case turnover was nominal.
Lilleshall became the second windows business casualty in two days, sliding
18 to 123p following a forecast of little or no profits growth this year.
Underlying profits were 66 per cent ahead at the interim stage when the
shares stood at 155p. Anglian dipped 4 to 171p having turned in weak
interims on Thursday and warned of lower full-year profits.
Jeans maker Vivat Holdings jumped 27 to 65p, the biggest percentage gain in
the London market, as Chiefco Holdings, a newly incorporated consortium led
by NatWest Ventures, made a 65p-a-share offer.
Waste management group Attwoods saw its shares rise 3 to 120p, matching the
value of the Pounds 391m hostile bid from Browning-Ferris Industries. An
11th-hour counter bid by Ikotek of Canada, set at 130p a share, arrived too
late.
Improved figures from luxury products group Vendome had already been
discounted and the shares relinquished 17 to 483p.
Concerns about Christmas trading continue to overhang the retail sector.
Talk that several retailers may be forced to reduce prices in the run-up to
Christmas, also affected Boots, whose shares fell 6 to 488p, their low of
the year.

FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: GMet up on broker support
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan rose 3 to 381p as the group's
brokers lent their support. Full-year figures on Thursday had received a
mixed reaction but buyers returned yesterday encouraged by recommendations
from Panmure Gordon and NatWest Securities.
Panmure pointed out that the shares were at a five-year low and analysts at
the broker said: 'This discount to the average market rating must be
unsustainable.'
The team at NatWest Securities urged investors to 'add' to holdings and
said: 'The shares look fairly rated for 1995, at a small discount to the
market for a year in which we forecast a small decline in earnings.
Thereafter, growth should start to accelerate.' Dealers also reported
switching into GrandMet from Guinness, which fell 7 to 445p.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong November jobs report in the US helped the dollar rally yesterday,
finishing above Y100 in London for the first time in nearly two months,
writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar's rally was prompted by the expectation of higher US interest
rates, with the market believing the Fed will be forced to take further
steps to curb inflation.
The dollar finished one yen firmer at Y100.4, from Y99.34. Against the
D-Mark it finished at DM1.5778, from DM1.5722.
With little fresh information to trade on, sterling finished slightly weaker
at DM2.461, from DM2.4639, and Dollars 1.5598 from Dollars 1.5672.
The D-Mark was little changed in Europe, though the Italian lira gained
ground to close at L1,026 from L1,028.
The slightly jagged upward progress of the dollar reflected the mixed
message of the jobs report. 'There was something in there to satisfy
everyone,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in
London.
Although the market focused on the headline rise in non-farm payrolls, this
was partially offset by falls in hourly earnings and the average working
week.
Some analysts, however, said the fall in the unemployment rate to 5.6 per
cent, from 5.8 per cent, spelled danger.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, commented:
'Given the momentum of the economy, it is now unlikely that unemployment
will stop falling until it is close to 5 per cent - deep into the inflation
zone.' He said the market would now be expecting a 25-50 basis point rise in
US rates at the December 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private sector
business-research group, supported this view, saying: 'Interest rates
probably have to go much higher to discourage the momentum building in the
consumer sector.'
Mr Hawkins said the jobs report added 'a little' pressure on the Fed to act
soon, but he did not expect them to raise rates in December, unless
inflation data later this month is very poor.
Whether the Fed moves sooner or later, Mr Hawkins said 'the ballgame has now
changed in favour of the dollar.' Not only was the Fed finally perceived as
having raised interest rates to a level where policy could be seen to be
neutral, but US rates were now at a level where it actually paid to hold
dollars.
Two other factors appear to be helping the dollar: the shrinking Japanese
current account surplus, which should remove support from the yen, and the
dollar's tendency in recent years to rally in the festive period.
According to a fortnightly survey by IDEA, the financial analysis service,
the dollar is currently the most popular 'buy' currency. On a two month
outlook, the median rates expected are DM1.59 and Y100.25.
The dollar bears, however, have by no means thrown in the towel. SG Warburg,
for example, says that the dollar is being supported by the perception of
rising real interest rates. It argues, however, that real rates have
probably peaked, on the assumption that inflation must start to rise, just
as real rates in Europe are likely to start rising.
Warburg predicts a 'significant further fall' in the first half of 1995, to
DM1.40-50 and Y95-100 by mid-year.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.15bn money market shortage at
established rates in its daily operations.

The market was quiet this week, reports Man Producten. Prices for black and
white were under pressure, as buying interest vanished temporarily. The
black pepper price decrease was mainly caused by selling pressure from
Brazil and India. Brazilian exporters were forced to sell some material to
pay interest on loans. Indian traders felt able to sell off remaining stocks
as their new crop will become available in January. This new crop is
expected to be the same or slightly better than the last one. Muntok white
was quoted at USDollars 3,600 a tonne, spot, and for December/January
shipment at Dollars 3,500, cif. Spot black pepper faq was at Dollars 2,450
and for December/January shipment at Dollars 2,400, cif.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Nickel in Dollars 1,200
price surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nickel market took over the pace-maker's role at the London Metal
Exchange this week. As concern deepened about Russian supply disruption the
metal's three months delivery price bounced by 19 per cent from Tuesday's
low to reach a fresh 3 1/4 -year high of Dollars 8,970 a tonne. It closed
last night at Dollars 8,952.50 a tonne, up Dollars 1,207 on the week.
The seeds of this surge were sown early last month when an explosion hit the
power plant supplying the Norilsk smelter in northern Siberia, the world's
biggest nickel producer, which normally accounts for about 15 per cent of
global production.
Norilsk officials claim the plant will be able to meet contractual
obligations despite the resulting output losses, which market estimates put
anywhere between 30 and 50 per cent (42,000 to 70,000 tonnes). But western
analysts are dubious. 'There seems to be too much smoke here for there to be
no fire,' said GNI, the London trade house. 'Watch out for a force majeure.'
The explosion has also focussed attention on more fundamental problems at
Norilsk. Mr David Allen, vice president for public and government affairs at
Inco of Canada, spoke this week of his misgivings about the Russian
operation. A technical assistance protocol his company signed with Norilsk
in 1993 had 'got absolutely nowhere', he said.
The Canadian group had organised a teach-in in Toronto for Norilsk about
privatisation to which it invited western bankers and consultants. 'Yet
today (Norilsk executives) sometimes won't answer telephone calls or faxes
from us,' said Mr Allen.
Given this apparent lack of interest, he now doubted the Russian company's
ability to maintain production at last year's level in the face of daunting
financial and technical problems. Norilsk is desperately short of money and
is one of the world's worst polluters.
Among the other LME metals copper and aluminium registered substantial gains
on the week, the former touching a fresh four-year high, while lead, zinc
and tin finished above their mid-week lows.
At the bullion market silver's continued weakness finally undermined gold's
support band in the mid-Dollars 380s a troy ounce. As the white metal
plunged below Dollars 5 an ounce to a 10-month low, gold subsided to Dollars
379.20, down Dollars 5.75 on the week.
Silver's fall was seen as a salutary reminder of what can happen when
investment funds, having driven prices up with a buying spree, decide to
quit the market. The cash price steadied a little yesterday but still ended
25 cents down on the week at Dollars 4.92 1/2 an ounce, 78 cents below the
high reached in late September.
Soft commodities were also generally weak.
The London Commodity Exchange's January coffee futures touched a five-month
low of Dollars 2,755 a tonne yesterday before closing at Dollars 2,781, down
Dollars 207 on the week.
Cocoa's support gave way early in the week and prices plunged after a trade
house was forced to unwind a substantial long position. After slipping to
Pounds 920 a tonne on Wednesday the March delivery position steadied to
Pounds 937, Pounds 50 down on balance.
White sugar had been the LCE's strongest market but the bubble burst and the
May price fell Dollars 18.50 from Monday's four-year high of Dollars 414.50
a tonne. A trader explained that the market had 'basically overcooked
itself' in its response to concern about supply tightness and had to retreat
when trade buying dried up.
