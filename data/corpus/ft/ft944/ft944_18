FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Entrepreneurial spirit
abounds - British Coal / Michael Smith discusses privatisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal has long proclaimed that there is plenty of entrepreneurial
spirit among its employees, even if it has been in the public sector for 47
years.
Proof has arrived over the past year through the emergence of five
management buy-out teams bidding to take over some of the mines which are
being, or have been, privatised this year.
Two are already up and running and producing coal from pits closed by
British Coal in the past two years. They are both single-pit companies, one
operating out of Betws in south Wales, the other from Hatfield in Yorkshire.
The other three MBOs were all playing for higher stakes, bidding for one or
more of the five regions to be sold to the private sector later this year.
It is likely that only one of these three will be successful. Celtic Energy,
led by British Coal's opencast director in south Wales, has been selected as
the government's preferred bidder for south Wales.
The other two put in credible bids. English Coal, led by Bob Siddall,
British Coal opencast director, wanted all three English region. Northern
Coal, led by Alan Houghton, central north director, bid for the region
encompassing the Yorkshire pits.
That they failed, or are likely to fail, is at least partly because they did
not offer enough money. RJB Mining became the government's preferred bidder
for all three English regions by putting in a tender for Pounds 900m. That
beat English Coal's offer by at least Pounds 300m.
English Coal and Northern Coal's only chance now is that RJB will fail to
raise the money to finance the bid.
Like RJB, Celtic Energy's success was due in part at least to the size of
its bid. According to NM Rothschild, which advised the government, each of
the preferred bidders offered the most amount of money for the region or
combination of regions for which they were chosen.
Celtic's achievement is all the more notable because south Wales was by far
the most popular of the five regions on offer, with at least eight companies
or consortia putting in tenders.
Rival bidders included Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, in one
consortium, and Wimpey, the construction group, and Powell Duffryn, the
engineering company, in another. Ryan Group, an established mining company,
was another contender.
But if beating them was impressive, Celtic now faces the more arduous task
of making money out of what it has won. Neither it nor the government is
saying how much it bid for south Wales but analysts think it was about
Pounds 95m.
According to an analysis by Coal UK, the FT newsletter, that makes the bid
extremely expensive when compared to deals involving mining assets in other
parts of the world.
David Price, Coal UK editor, says the bid equates to Pounds 1.79 a tonne of
reserves and Pounds 47.50 a tonne for saleable coal. Typical values in
recent international deals around the world are about 30p a tonne and Pounds
20 a tonne for saleable coal.
Yet, the south Wales region has a relatively small contract with the
electricity generators. The 1m-tonne-a-year deal it inherits from British
Coal to supply National Power until 1998 is tiny when compared with the 29m
supplied to National Power and PowerGen from the central England regions.
In addition, the bid would run into severe difficulties if National Power
were to close its Aberthaw power station, which takes all 1m tonnes.
Nonetheless south Wales was not the most popular bid target in the the
British Coal privatisation for nothing. Aberthaw seems unlikely to close
before 1998 and could last much longer than that. In addition, much of of
the 2.4m tonnes a year of coal produced from the Welsh mines, all of which
are opencast, is high-quality anthracite.
A naturally smokeless product, it can attract premium prices, sometimes more
than Pounds 100 a tonne, which is more than double the price of coal sold by
British Coal and its successors to the electricity market.
In addition, Celtic Energy has, in Mr Riddleston, a leader who is an
enthusiast for the anthracite coal, or black diamonds as he calls it, which
his company will produce.
The selection of Mr Riddleston and his team was not greeted with universal
acclaim. The opencast section of the Transport and General Workers' Union in
south Wales passed a motion of no confidence in Celtic shortly after it was
selected as preferred bidder.
Mr Riddleston's track record is good. A 46-year-old graduate in chemistry
and a qualified accountant, output has almost doubled from British Coal's
south Wales opencast sites since he took over the job six years ago.
Celtic's backers include Charterhouse Development Capital. It has been
advised by KPMG Marwick.
The two MBO pits already running - Betws and Hatfield - are trying to make
money out of pits that in the latter years of British Coal's stewardship
were unprofitable.
Betws Anthracite, led by Martin Cook, former deputy manager in British Coal
days, is already exceeding its weekly target after taking over in April. The
company says it more breaks even by producing 2,340 tonnes a week but has
recently been producing 2,500 tonnes.
The 100 employees are achieving high levels of productivity by returning to
traditional mining methods using shovels rather than mechanical coalface
shearers. Betws has borrowed more than Pounds 2.5m, mostly from Barclays
Bank.
Hatfield Coal, which employs 180 men, expects to produce just under 400,000
tonnes a year when in full swing. Nigel Lowry, finance director, said in the
year to June next year output should be about 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes.
All of its output will go to the industrial and household markets, whereas
previously British Coal sold coal to the electricity generators from the
pit. The buy-out is backed by ECI Ventures.
Elsewhere in British Coal, at least two more MBOs are likely to make bids
for non-mining businesses which are being sold off in the next few months.
An MBO is among four organisations which are on a shortlist of four to bid
for Coal Products, the smokeless fuel subsidiary. Centris, the pensions and
insurance arm to be sold next year, is also likely to attract an MBO bid.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (6): Royal Mail
delivers replies - Client server systems / As a newly-organised company
where each section is a business unit, the national postal system needs
flexible ways of reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Mail started with a list of a dozen accounting packages when it
started looking for a client-server system that would reflect the new shape
of its structure since re-organisation in 1992.
'The main requirement was good flexible reporting and enquiry facilities,'
says Royal Mail systems accountant Penny Maguire, whose department acted as
the internal consultants on the choice of software.
Although Royal Mail had some out-of-the-ordinary VAT requirements, the main
need in addition to standard accounting was project management. 'Scala had a
project management module which managed timesheets and work scheduling, and
that was a real attraction,' says Ms Maguire.
Another consideration was that the Royal Mail's structure was not set in
concrete.
'The coding structure allowed for forward compatibility in terms of the
current company structure and future development,' she says.
The plan was to run under OS/2 and Lan Manager, over a Wide Area Network
(Wan) linking sites at Swindon and London to the centre at Chesterfield.
Scala supplied the software and some consultancy in a Pounds 65,000
contract.
In July the users came online in a 30-user PC network, and the response has
been positive, according to Ms Maguire. 'There are better response times to
our clients, the end users: having one point of contact for queries is real
benefit to them,' she reports.
'In turn they can be more responsive to outside clients who ring in with
queries, because the information is so much more accessible and timely.
'Timeliness will improve even more as the regular monthly reports become
available on the Wan.'
Supplier profile Product: Scala is a multi-lingual multi-currency and
multi-dimensional integrated business management and accounting system.
Launched in the UK in 1989, its current release is 3.1.4, with an update

Number of users: 10,000 sites worldwide.
Price: Pounds 1,500 for DOS system comprising General, Sales, Purchase

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (5): Local support
proves a tonic - Controlling global costs / Multinational pharmaceuticals
company Syntex needed a swift answer to a sudden unprecedented loss of sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like all pharmaceuticals companies, Syntex is operating in a fast-changing
market in which profit margins are under threat. Best known for its
anti-arthritic drug Naprosyn, Syntex is in the pharmaceuticals diagnostics
and animal health business.
Although well prepared for the moment when Naprosyn came off patent in the
US and generic alternatives became available, the effect came as a shock to
Syntex. 'We lost an unprecedented level of sales,' says Ronan Byrne,
formerly European finance director, now director of EFSO, the European
Financial Services Organisation set up by Syntex to implement its new
business systems in Europe.
'In a business used to high margins and high research expenditure, we had to
look at our cost base with some urgency,' says Mr Byrne. 'The loss of
revenue at an unprecedented rate focused our attention on scaling down
costs.'
The decision to control costs by using standard systems internationally was
taken in the US headquarters in Palo Alto. The aim was to use a common
system to improve the quality of the information on which operating units
worldwide based their decisions.
A crucial factor in the decision was the availability of local support and
the ability to run in a decentralised organisation. SAP's R/3, a client
server solution was chosen in the US from a shortlist including JD Edwards,
BPCS, and Oracle. The selectors saw SAP as an astute company: 'SAP was
regarded as the only game in town in terms of the global answer,' says Mr
Byrne. 'It couldn't do everything we wanted but it was still streets ahead
of the competition.'
As is typical of a pharmaceuticals company, Syntex is customer focused. Mr
Byrne, who has been with the company since 1975, wanted to make the new
business systems part of the 'quality ethos' that he says pervades Syntex
and set up EFSO to create a pan-European service.
'We accountants need to focus on providing a truly 'added value' service
which can support the business decision making and not just focus on
historic events.'
The EFSO team used the concept of 'better information delivery' to sell the
idea to those users who (until they saw something better) were satisfied
with what they had. 'The system promised meaningful information, rather than
just what they did last month,' says Mr Byrne.
The other main objective is to do away with the rush of month-end
processing. 'We want interactive systems on-line the whole time so that we
can do away with the concept of month end, and know where we are by pressing
a button at any one time.'
Syntex has standardised on hardware from Hewlett-Packard, and in the long
term is planning links between its laboratory information systems (on
Perkin-Elmer computers) and its supply and sales systems. Mr Byrne estimates
that the software itself accounts for only a tenth of the entire cost, with
large amounts going on training and some on consultancy from KPMG on
business process re-engineering and project management.
The two pilot sites up and running are Nordica, consisting of four
countries, and Benelux, made up of three, working closely with EFSO via
dedicated telecommunications. Each country has scaled down its internal
accounts departments.
The pilots have taught the EFSO team a great deal about change management.
'A lot of the groundwork is in mapping out the organisational structure
before implementation,' says Mr Byrne.
The company had to take a long hard look at itself. It had to decide on
international standards for such things as chart of accounts, product
numbering and nomenclature, which meant people had to give up their
long-establish codes or names for products and raw materials.
In some cases people's objections were hidden and resistance was more
difficult to overcome. 'Some cultures accept change more than others.' says
Mr Byrne.
'It is essential that users have ownership of the system and do not see it
as something that is being imposed.'
Chris Knight, European information systems manager of EFSO, says: 'There was
a real sense of urgency that focused us, in that everyone realised that we
couldn't go on as we were. There were national variations, such as pricing,
reimbursement, just about every aspect of the business.'
Tailoring options built into the software have largely catered for national
differences but some national quirks - banking in Sweden, for example, -
have been dealt with in SAP's ABAP programming language, with extra coding
shared between SAP and Syntex. Obtaining updates, new releases and
alterations delivered on time has sometimes been a problem for SAP,
according to Mr Byrne, but this is as a result of its success. 'The uptake
of SAP's software - for the same reasons that we chose it - has been so
great that there simply aren't enough people to go round.'
The Syntex goal is a worldwide system that can close the books within two
days and deliver almost immediate information while moving towards a
paperless environment. Mr Knight estimates that the pilot systems use only
10 per cent of the SAP software's potential.
'The objective is to use 80 per cent of the logistics and accounting
functionality, so that we map our entire business process through the
software.'
Mr Knight believes SAP is one of the few packages that can deal with the
complexities of an international company that operates in multiple
currencies and languages with research and development, manufacturing and
marketing operations.
EFSO has used the well-trodden path of picking 'super-users' to popularise
the system. Some of the most experienced users have become part of EFSO. Ann
Page, formerly financial manager of the UK, now does the same job for EFSO,
and is a regular user of the live systems.
'Integrated systems have changed the job. The time that used to be spent
reconciling systems, accounts receivable to general ledger, cash book to
general ledger, can now be devoted to supporting the decision making
process,' she says.
'This system gives me more analytical power. I can look at sales
achievements for an area, or expenses over a period. Eventually we will be
able to look at anything from anywhere, compare costs and outgoings in
different operations.'
Supplier profile Product: SAP's R/3 system, current release 2.1, launched in
January 1993, is an integrated suite of client/server-based applications
software covering the entire scope of business operations, from accounting
and financial management to manufacturing, logisitics and human resources.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (9): Franchises will limit
profits - British Rail / Nearly 100 businesses will be offered for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of British Rail represents a challenge for the management
buy-out specialists among the financial community and also for BR's
managers.
Traditionally, venture and development capitalists have put equity into a
new business in the hope of making a sizeable capital gain when they sell
out after a few years.
But the franchising of BR's 25 train operating companies will not require
large injections of equity because most of their assets will be rented or
leased. Managers will be 'bidding for a series of inter-related contractual
rights and obligations rather than hard assets', comments Richard Price, a
partner in the law firm McKenna &amp; Co.
The limited franchise period - probably between seven and 15 years - will
mean that managers and their backers will not be able to profit from the
goodwill they have built up in the business by selling their shares or
floating the company on the stock exchange.
Unless management is successful in bidding for an extension of its
franchise, another owner will take over the business. In reality, the
incumbent management team will be well placed to win a second franchise
period.
Despite this unpromising climate for buy-outs, the government is setting its
hopes on managers winning a substantial share of the franchises on offer.
Sceptics say this is because the rail franchises are unlikely to attract
many outside bidders although conversations with BR's managers reveal an
enthusiasm on the part of many to bid.
Management and employee buy-outs have figured prominently in previous
privatisations of publicly-owned transport undertakings such as the trust
ports, the bus companies and the National Freight Corporation. But the need
to continue subsidising large parts of the railway network even after it
moves into the private sector has forced the government to adopt a different
approach with BR.
It is breaking the company up into nearly 100 separate businesses most of
which will be sold to trade buyers or management buy-out teams. Prominent
among these businesses are the train operating companies ranging in size
from the Cardiff Valley lines with fare revenues of Pounds 7m to the west
coast main line with revenues of Pounds 239m. A management bid has also been
made for Freightliner, the container arm of BR
Other businesses to be sold include three newly-created rolling stock
leasing companies; the Red Star parcels service; and track maintenance and
renewal companies with annual contracts worth more than Pounds 1bn.
Railtrack, the new owner of BR's track, stations and signalling, will be
floated on the stock exchange.
The structure chosen for the railway is for Railtrack to levy access charges
on the passenger and freight train operators for the use of the lines. The
level of charges will depend on the number of trains run, the types of train
 -freight wagons which inflict heavy punishment on the track or lighter
commuter trains, and whether the train operator wants 'slots' at peak times.
Railtrack's charges have been set to give it an acceptable return on capital
and to allow it to finance investments. The Treasury has agreed to match
these charges by a continuing subsidy to the train operators. The point of
this arrangement is that it makes apparent the cost of keeping open
individual lines and running specific services. Once the biggest loss-makers
have been identified then, in theory, a rational decision can be taken on
whether they should be kept open.
The result of this arrangement is that the train operators own very few
assets. Their track and signalling is rented from Railtrack while their
locomotives and carriages are leased from one of the three rolling stock
companies. On the one hand this helps management teams because their capital
requirements are small. On the other it makes life difficult for the
financiers who normally back buy-outs because there is little requirement
for their funds.
'It is a mixed blessing for the venture capitalists,' comments Chris
Beresford, head of buy-outs at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. 'They want to
lay down a lot of money to achieve their internal rates of return of 50 per
cent but this arrangement does not allow them to get their funds invested.'
Traditional loan finance also has a problem with this way of working because
there are practically no assets on which to secure a loan. And, if a
franchisee defaults, his creditors will have very little in the way of
assets to call upon. With few assets available financial backers will be
doubly vigilant to ensure that they pick a competent management team.
Although they will not need to finance much by way of assets, managers will
need working capital and will probably also have to provide performance
bonds. These would be called in by the franchising director, responsible for
finding buyers for the train operating franchises, if the company defaulted.
Managers may have to make their loan proposals on the basis of cash flow
forecasts although the tight regulation of the railway industry which will
continue after privatisation may make some lenders nervous. Train operators
will not be able to shut down unprofitable services to stem losses because
their contracts with the franchising director will require them to maintain
a certain level of service.
One advantage enjoyed by managers bidding for parts of BR is a government
commitment to meet part of the costs of making a bid, though the successful
team would have to repay the advance. Managers can recoup 85 per cent of the
first Pounds 10,000 and 75 per cent of the rest up to a total of Pounds
100,000. Unlike some other privatisations, however, management bids will not
be allowed a 5 per cent 'discount' against other bidders.
An important concern of the government is that employees and not just
managers should be involved in bidding and proposals which include them will
be given preference.
The favoured position enjoyed by management teams and the keenness shown by
many of them suggests that most of the early franchise sales will be by way
of buy-outs, says Mr Beresford. But the government wants to achieve a broad
mix of ownership and will not allow buy-outs to dominate the entire
privatisation.

Funding for management buy-ins and buy-outs in the UK midlands has
outstripped the demand, in spite of the upturn in corporate activity as
economic confidence seeped back into the regions.
This is not surprising. There was an upsurge of activity in the first half
of the year but an easing off in the number of deals during the third
quarter.
Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-out Research, funded by
Barclays Development Capital and accountants Touche Ross, established that,
during the buoyant first half, the main activity on the market shifted from
London and south-east England to the Midlands. In the West Midlands,
activity was 13.8 per cent higher than in 1993, while in the East Midlands
the rise was 9 per cent.
This greater concentration of activity in the regions has been picked up by
NatWest Ventures, the venture capital arm of National Westminster Bank,
which claims to be second after 3i among venture capitalists in the scope of
its regional office network.
Of the Pounds 74m it has invested in 29 management buy-outs and buy-ins this
year, 18 deals with investment of Pounds 41m have been completed by its
regional office network.
Certainly, venture capitalists are more active in the sector as corporate
activity gathers pace. 'We invested as much in the first six months of this
year as in the whole of 1993,' reported Chris Rowlands, regional director of
3i in Birmingham. Nottingham University calculated that venture capitalists
were involved in financing 47.9 per cent of all management buy-outs during
the first half, compared to 35.7 per cent in 1993.
Accountants Price Waterhouse tracked in the East Midlands 11 management
buy-outs and buy-ins during the first quarter of this year, seven in the
second quarter but only five in the third quarter.
In the West Midlands, Price Waterhouse said there were 13 buy-outs and
buy-ins during the first quarter, valued at Pounds 24.7m, 21 worth Pounds
83.9m in the second quarter but only 10, valued at Pounds 139.9m, during the
third quarter. The abnormally high value of the transactions during the
third quarter came because of the Pounds 94m buy-out of Dollond &amp; Aitchison,
the optical group, from Gallaher.
The explanation for the third quarter decline is not clear. Certainly it was
part of a more general fall in the level of corporate management and
acquisitions activity. But, said Price Waterhouse, 'the fundamentals for
increased activity in the region remain in place. We consider it likely that
the fall in completed deals during the last quarter is short term and,
cumulatively, the volume of transactions will remain ahead of last year.'
The money is ready to finance the transactions. 'There is no shortage of
capital,' said Mr Rowlands. 'The demand by companies for new funds is
lagging behind the banks' willingness to lend,' said John Gregory, director
in Birmingham of Singer &amp; Friedlander, merchant bankers, and chairman of the
West Midlands Bankers' Association.
The association surveys showed, Mr Gregory said, that 'the provision of
derivatives and other Treasury products is increasing, alongside project and
trade finance as well as mezzanine debt and management buy-out leveraged
lending, often involving equity in the form of development capital. However,
many banks are still cautious about sectors related to the leisure industry
and hotels, or high-tech industries and speculative property transactions.'
Where management buy-outs and buy-ins are taking place, there has been a
growing emphasis on deals involving medium-sized companies. Nottingham
University's research centre reported that deals ranging from Pounds 5m to
Pounds 25m accounted for 20.7 per cent of the total value of buy-outs during
the first half.
'Traditionally, deals in the regions have generally been of smaller size
than those done out of the London office. This has not been the case
recently,' according to NatWest Ventures, which said that, of the 18
regional deals it has transacted this year, eight involved more than Pounds
10m and three more than Pounds 20m.
This may reflect, of course, the greater importance which the financial
institutions are giving to the regional market. 'Over the last 18-24 months,
there has been a significant change in the way the mid-size corporate deals
 -for companies with turnover between Pounds 15m and Pounds 50m - are being
done. Predominantly they are being handled by regional professionals. What
are organisations going to do if they are based only in London?' asked Mr
Rowlands.
Recent deals have shown the growing reliance on regionally-based advice
mixed with capital and loan funding from the branches of the London
financial institutions.
In November, the managers of Rubicon Packaging at Mountsorrel near
Loughborough, a company with annual turnover of Pounds 11m, used KPMG
Corporate Finance in Leicester to negotiate and structure a buy-out which
drew in equity finance from Barclays Development Capital, loan finance from
the Bank of Scotland, Leicester, and lease finance from NWS Bank.
In October, Price Waterhouse, Nottingham, completed a buy-out deal for the
managers of Intermotor, the Nottingham automotive electrical component
manufacturer, which involved Pounds 15m in total funding. Equity came from a
syndicate led by Gresham Trust and comprising Candover 1991 Fund and
Threadneedle Investment Managers, which is part of Eagle Star, the insurance
group.
But the most famous buy-out and the deal about which Midlands financial
groups crowed loudest, not least because of the sentimental hold the company
has on Birmingham, was the Pounds 40m buy-out from the receivers in April
1993 of Leyland Daf Vans.
For that Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Birmingham, structured a package which brought
in equity capital from 3i's regional office, loan funding from Royal Bank of
Scotland, Birmingham, and United Dominions Trust, a land purchase which had
the effect of providing new working capital by Birmingham Heartlands
Development Corporation and regional selective assistance from the local
office of the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (4): Last minute
solution - A publisher's view / Portal was convinced that Windows was the
answer. But it was hard to find the right package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
Shopping can be a frustrating experience when you know what you want but
cannot find it. Neil Beardsley, operations director of Portal Publications
in the UK, was sure he wanted a Windows package when he started the search
for an accounting system.
It was unexpectedly hard to find one, and the package he now uses, Kewill's
Dynamics, came into the picture at the eleventh hour, thanks to an
eagle-eyed book keeper who had read a magazine review.
Portal is the UK arm of a US publisher with a Dollars 200m turnover, the
world's largest in the specialist area of shrink-wrapped posters and prints
of the kind that adorn student rooms all over the world. Portal had set up
in the UK under the wing of a sister organisation, which initially provided
accountancy services and software on a contract basis.
The arrangement had its drawbacks: Mr Beardsley found the contractor's
implementation of the Pegasus package too limiting.
'The Pegasus software didn't retain historical data, nor did we have
drill-down, such as being able to look at a trial balance and drill-down to
the source of a figure,' he says.
'We couldn't track back without using huge print-out reports.
'We looked at half dozen well-known packages, mostly good, but none had made
the leap into Windows.
Although it was clear at the demonstration that Dynamics was not yet
complete, Mr Beardsley was prepared to compromise, and wait for the
purchasing and sales order processing modules. 'We took the view that if
what was to come was as good as what we had already seen it would be what we
wanted.'
The flexibility of the package is its strength but also its danger, because
it demands skilled analysis in implementation. Portal used a Kewill
consultant to do the initial set-up. 'If you don't spend time setting it up
correctly, and give yourself time to understand its potential, you'll never
get the best out of it,' says Mr Beardsley.
As a UK subsidiary, Portal is self-sufficient in IT terms, and there is no
need as yet to link with the parent's AS/400. So far there have been few
problems in any downloading of data, and Portal makes its software work
hard, providing stock label data into Word and data for analysis into Excel
spreadsheets. 'We've had no problems, and are happy with our choice,' says
Mr Beardsley.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (3): One version of
the truth - Upgrading international delivery information / Integrating its
operations has reduced DHL's reporting times and increased its productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Quick delivery is the essence of DHL's business. 'Enthusiasm and getting
things done is the key to this company,' says Jeremy Young, the financial
systems manager based in Brussels responsible for implementing DHL's new
pan-European accounting system.
'However, the exercise of implementing something on this scale, in 23
countries, is not to be rushed . . . The challenge is the re-evaluation of
old practices as well as implementing a new computer system.'
DHL ships more than 80m packages annually, serving 80,000 locations in more
than 200 countries. The company has grown rapidly, employing about 28,000
people worldwide, and prides itself on using information technology
effectively in its operations. Its reorganisation of European and African
operations in 1991 triggered a rethink of its accounting system.
The existing Insight system on an IBM System 36 had become outdated.
'General Ledger and Accounts Payable were not integrated, there was a lot of
re-keying of data, and the information available to support management
decisions was simply too limited for the speed DHL is growing,' says Mr
Young.
The accounting project is part of a Pounds 1.5bn spend on updating and
automating DHL's entire operation. The upgrade allowed it to convert to an
open systems, Unix-based policy, using Hewlett-Packard computers. For a
company whose essence is international operation, there were obvious
long-term benefits and savings in implementing one package across all
countries.
The draft specification went to DHL working parties in six countries, whose
recommendations went into the final tender specification. This went to 11
suppliers with international packaged offerings, but not all could manage
some features with an 'essential' rating, such as Gapp requirements in the
US (Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Oracle Financials won on the question of resources: DHL had already
identified that any package it chose would need one major bespoke
alteration. 'DHL has a remarkable business need in Accounts Receivable,'
explains Mr Young.
'We have an invoice line for each package. There might be massive volumes
for one customer, so we might have a query on only three packages in a
1,000-package order. We need that information up-front on one screen, and in
every package we saw, the user would have needed to look at several
different screens to get that information.
Aware that it did not have all the necessary skills in-house, DHL has built
a 'core team' for the international implementation, made up of DHL staff and
consultants from Oracle and Price Waterhouse. This team turns its attention
to each country: five main modules are being implemented in 23 countries.
Francis Veldeman, DHL's financial director, wanted to 'transfer the
knowledge into the organisation'. According to Mr Young, this has worked
well. The transfer and sharing of knowledge and experience has made the
international project workable.
'Good project management is essential. We use Oracle's applications
implementation methodology, but some flexibility is vital because different
attitudes are needed to each country: Croatia needs more central support
than the UK.' DHL has had to push for local support in some countries, but
where local resources are short, Oracle has sent someone out.
The benefits are already clear. 'In terms of DHL's day to day business, the
most important is Accounts Receivable, because of the interaction with
customers.
'It is not just a debtors' ledger, it helps us to control the cash flow.'
'It's an integral part of our 'customer care' approach. Credit controllers
can keep notes on queries, see the customer history, the amount of business
outstanding, and ensure that queries are dealt with quickly, and followed
up.
The Oracle Financials are integrated with DHL's in-house billing system, and
currently with the MicroControl consolidation and reporting software. There
are plans to build on an executive information system once the core
implementation is complete.
Mr Young can already measure the benefits in terms of days and labour saved.
'Where Oracle Financials are implemented, reporting times at the month end
have gone down from 13 to within a mere eight days of closure,' he says.
'And we spend more time qualifying the information and less time
number-crunching.'
There have also been productivity gains in the Purchasing and Accounts
Payable systems, from the integration of the information which is now only
keyed in at one point.
'The UK estimates productivity gains overall of 50 per cent from when they
had separate systems,' he says. 'The main advantage of integration is that
we all get one version of the truth, and there are no longer any disputes or
misunderstandings over the actual figures.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (5): Successful connection -
Small MBOs / Peggy Hollinger on New World Payphones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Thompson will be paying a Pounds 1m phone bill this year, and he
could not be happier. The bill is hard evidence that the chief executive of
New World Payphones is making some headway into British Telecom's
stranglehold on the vast public telephone market.
Less than a year ago, however, Mr Thompson's company, which installs and
maintains payphones linked to BT's network, was facing the possibility of
being cut off just when prospects seemed brightest.
New World had won a number of substantial contracts, including one to
install payphones on the London Underground. Yet its parent company, Antah
Holdings Berhad, the diversified Malaysian group, was reluctant to provide
the additional working capital to carry out the work.
For years NWP had been making losses. Antah was now being asked not only to
fund those losses, but to provide additional support to fund the company's
growth until it could return to profit. That required what one of the small
company's eventual backers describes as 'an act of faith'.
'New World needed resources to take it past the break-even point,' says Ian
Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures, the venture capital firm which supported an
Pounds 8.15m management buy-out in May this year. 'The company had a
substantial order book and prospect list. If one was prepared to make that
act of faith, give it all-equity funding and sufficient resources to install
that order book, one could get it rapidly through break-even and into the
virtuous cicle of generating cash to fund its own growth.'
Six months after the MBO, New World is 'profitable, but it is still
investing faster than it is making profits', Mr Hawkins says.
New World is just one of the rising number of smaller management buy-outs
completed in the past year. Smaller MBOs may be getting more popular, but
that does not mean it is any easier for management to find backers.
In general, small MBOs of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m take up more
time, require more help through the growth period and are more difficult to
exit than the larger buy-outs.
'With a bigger company the prospect of a float is obvious,' says Paul Jobson
of ECi, the venture capital firm which specialises in smaller buy-outs.
'With the smaller one it may not be big enough and will be more dependent on
the trade sale.'
Smaller MBOs also present greater risk for potential funders. 'Larger
companies have a certain momentum in place,' says Mr Jobson. 'You need to do
more through due diligence to get comfortable with the risk of backing
buy-outs on smaller companies which may not have that momentum.'
One of the biggest risks from the venture capitalists' point of view is
often management.
'A bigger company can afford a bigger and better management team,' says Mr
Hawkins of PhilDrew Ventures. 'Usually, in a smaller company, the chief
executive has taken on a number of responsibilities.' This, in many cases,
means a flawed or overstretched management.
The first demand from potential backers is usually to strengthen the team,
with candidates introduced by venture capitalists.
This does not mean that smaller companies are forced to undergo what the
trade calls a Bimbo - a combined buy-in and management buy-out. Bimbos
generally mean the introduction of a chief executive.
In smaller buy-outs, the chief executive remains and a few 'grey hairs' are
brought in to guide and advise the newly independent management.
In New World's case, Phildrew sought to balance the youthful team - Mr
Thompson is 36 - with the experience of 51-year-old Derek Harris, former
chairman of Linx Technologies. There are also plans to appoint a part-time
finance director.
'It was felt it would be useful to have someone on board who was used to
going through the growing pains,' Mr Hawkins said. 'So when they get
over-excited there will be someone to calm them down and help them to get on
with the business.'
Once the management team is strengthened, smaller companies will be under
greater pressure to produce organic growth than their larger colleagues.
Growth by acquisition is an option reserved for larger companies, where
cashflow can be used to service debt. Small, growing businesses need every
penny to fund their everyday businesses.
Smaller buy-outs are generally structured with these pressures in mind.
Large amounts of debt are seen to be inappropriate for young growing
companies. 'With an already high-risk transaction it is imprudent to add to
the risk by overloading it with debt,' says Mr Jobson.
This is not done merely out of generosity. Venture capitalists need a
profitable exit which is not likely to materialise unless these smaller
companies reach a certain critical size. To do this purely by organic growth
is a challenging task.
Venture capitalists also demand higher returns from smaller MBOs. According
to Mr Hawkins, venture capitalists would expect returns of about 25 per cent
per annum from the very biggest buy-outs of Pounds 100m or more. Development
capital could call for returns of up to 50 per cent per annum.
Yet he disputes that this means there is greater value in the small company
arena. In the end, the larger MBOs are inherently the better bets, he says.
'Higher returns are generated by larger transactions because the degree to
which the pricing falls as you get to the smaller deal is not as great as
the degree to which the risk increases,' says Mr Hawkins.
Mr Jobson of ECi disagrees. 'The big buy-out market is over-farmed so the
pricing gets silly,' he says. 'There is value to be had in the small sector,
but it also means there is more work to do.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (6): The road to the year's
biggest buy-out closes - Case study / National Parking Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 45 years ago two men, one a former Westminster City Council trainee
surveyor, the other a 24-year-old ex-soldier, began buying up second world
war bomb sites and offering car parking space for 1s 6d (7.5p) a time.
As car ownership and demand for parking spaces in the UK's increasingly
congested inner cities grew, National Parking Corporation, the parent of
National Car Parks, flourished.
Today, NCP runs 600 car parks and owns all but 40 of them.
The average cost of parking is Pounds 2.20, although prices are higher in
some areas, particularly in London.
Bolstered by property profits, a coach-hire business and a rapidly growing
breakdown and recovery service, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
50.5m - including Pounds 28.9m from car parking - in the year to March 25,
on turnover of Pounds 265.3m.
It is not surprising that the desire of the founders to sell one of the UK's
most successful private companies should have become one of the year's
hottest topics among venture capitalists.
But last Friday, the deal collapsed because the syndicate led by Prudential
Venture Managers (PruVen) was not prepared to pay the price the vendor was
demanding.
There is little doubt that the business will eventually be sold.
The only question is the identity of an eventual buyer.
With car parking revenues and profits rebounding after the recession, it is
an obvious target for venture capitalists. NPC's large and predictable cash
flows could support a high level of debt.
In addition, it is likely that if NCP and Green Flag, the fast-growing owner
of National Breakdown Recovery and Home Emergency Service, were sold
separately they would together be worth more than the parent company.
Most of NPC's equity is still in the hands of the group's two founders, Sir
Donald Gosling, now aged 65, and Ronald Hobson, aged 73, making it ideal for
a buy-out.
Structuring the deal was complicated by the fact that in 1986 about 28 per
cent of NCP's equity was placed with about 40 institutional investors at
155p-a-share.
Since then the stock has traded in the over-the-counter market under rule
4.2, and it fell from 550p to 450p, following last week's announcement.
The venture capitalists therefore had to negotiate with the vendors under
stock exchange takeover rules, something to which they are not accustomed.
In addition, existing institutional investors wanted to be offered the
opportunity to roll over their existing shareholdings into shares in the new
acquiring company.
Among the original institutional investors from the 1986 placing are Royal
Insurance, and the Prudential itself, which initially invested about Pounds
750,000 in the stock.
Despite the placing, Sir Donald and Mr Hobson, the joint chairmen, retained
tight control of the group and, together with charitable trusts of which
they are directors, still hold 73.2 per cent of the equity including
personal stakes totalling 68 per cent.
However, the issue of succession had become increasingly important to the
joint chairmen. They had taken a paternalistic view of the company they
created and were keen to ensure continuity for the management, including the
two deputy chairmen, Gordon Layton and John Flack.
Accordingly, they turned down the option of a share disposal, via a
flotation. Morgan Grenfell, NPC's financial adviser, also received several
offers from others. However, the joint chairmen reportedly felt more
comfortable choosing a venture capital consortium which included
institutions with which they were already familiar.
Discussions began at the start of the year and heads of terms were signed at
the end of June, prompting publicity-shy NPC to issue a brief statement to
the stock exchange confirming that it was involved in negotiations which
might lead to a bid.
The consortium members included Electra, NatWest Ventures, Charterhouse
Development Capital, Cinven, Montagu Private Equity and Royal Bank
Development Capital.
Due diligence was completed without problems - the only barrier to agreement
was money.
Many more of the British Venture Capital Association's 100 members have
expressed an interest, but, given NPC's size, only the largest operators
could consider the deal, and many of these had joined with PruVen.
The consortium would have provided around 50 per cent of the cost as equity,
with the remainder funded by bank debt, which would have been arranged by
National Westminster Bank.
NPC's solid asset base, quality of earnings and its strong cash flow from
NCP, could have supported substantially more debt.
But Prudential Venture Managers was keen that the buy-out should be
conservatively financed, so that the group could continue to expand without
being burdened with debt.
Early asset disposals were ruled out by PruVen, although a longer-term trade
sale of Green Flag and flotation of NCP would have been likely.
Under this scenario, equity investors would have had to settle for more
modest returns than they are accustomed to, in exchange for a lower level of
risk.
Enthusiasm among the banks for the proposed deal also underlines the shift
in the balance of power between equity and debt providers in the leveraged
buy-out market. The banks, shunned by cash-rich domestic corporate
borrowers, were said to have been falling over themselves to win a slice of
the deal, which raises the possibility of a more leveraged buy-out.
With PruVen out of the frame, Sir Donald and Mr Hobson will continue to run
the business and collect their dividends.
However, their intentions have been clearly signalled, and it is only a
matter of time before other institutions decide to join the negotiating
table.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (3): Users demand
more - The choice of accounting packages is widening as various needs emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People want more from their accounting systems than ever before. Finance
directors want better reporting facilities, packages that run on different
sorts of hardware and, increasingly, systems that can be implemented
globally. Indeed, several users suggested that accounting packages used only
as statutory reporting tools were of little relevance to the activities
which produce the data.
The number of packages available continues to mushroom in response to
different needs. Dennis Keeling, director of the Business and Accounting
Software Developers Association, Basda, keeps data sheets on more than 200
products, for the guidance of buyers. Mr Keeling's research, among 7,000
users, identifies a shift towards 'Open Systems', Unix-based and
client-server solutions, and an increasing preoccupation with 'global'
implementations.
Accounting research specialist Tate Bramald Consultancy's annual review of
accountancy software packages for 1994 found about 250 solutions being used
among its 1,000 interviewees. John Tate, founding partner at Tate Bramald
says there is a clear division in the various competitors for accounting,
amounting to a sort of 'league table'. His analysis puts Oracle, SAP, QSP
and the Dun and Bradstreet packages, (previously separate offerings, MSA and
M&amp;D Millenium) into the top stream, as corporate heavyweights, mostly
running on mainframes.
Into the next category come those catering for companies likely to have
multiple sites, complex requirements and a fair degree of tailoring. Tate
typifies these as JBA, Coda, JD Edwards, Walker, Ross Systems, Lawson and
Dodge Group.
Tetra Chameleon, Systems Union SunAccounts, Multisoft Premier Plus, and
Strategix are typical of packages that have grown with their users, probably
old hands now on their second or third accounting system. Companies in the
Pounds 5m to Pounds 50m turnover bracket would probably look in this group
first. Those a little smaller, with a turnover between 500,000 and Pounds
5m, would probably look first at Pegasus Senior (or its Opera successor),
Multisoft Prestige, Sage Sovereign, and the newcomer, SBS Exchequer, which
has won praise for its reporting facilities.
The choice widens as the size of the company comes down, with small
businesses picking from packages such as Sage Sterling and Tas Books from
Megatech. Home users also have an increasingly wide choice of systems, with
sophisticated functions - Sage Moneywise, Quickens/Quickbooks from Intuit,
Microsoft Money.
Global accounting still presents a challenge. 'With accounting standards as
they are, there is no reason why you can't have one core product for
virtually every country in the world,' Mr Tate says. 'But, if you are
starting with a product that has not been designed with international
operation in mind, it's virtually impossible to make it into international
product. It is a huge problem for any software house to develop and release
a product internationally. Too many still use their clients for quality
control.'
European products competing in the UK such as Scala (from Sweden) and Exact
(originating in Holland) have to win success on home ground before spreading
elsewhere. And the secret of any local success, suggests Peter Quinn of
fast-expanding UK software supplier, JBA, lies in providing reliable user
support.
'Ventures elsewhere are doomed unless you can provide the same level of
support locally that you can on your home ground and that means training,
and assimilating people into the company culture,' Mr Quinn says.
International accounting, and particularly consolidation, is the niche in
which Dillon Technology International of Maidenhead has become well
established outside the UK with its Falcon package. Richard Dillon, who
founded the company in 1983, emphasises that the knowledge-base of the
vendors matters far more to multinational corporations than 'functionality
checks' on the package.
'Purchasers expect us to know about regulations such as SSAP20 and FASB52.
We sell knowledge, not software.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (4): Impressive profits but no
hurry to float - Case study / Gardner Merchant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardner Merchant, bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the
end of 1992, has been reporting its results as if it had already come to
market.
But those who were expecting it to float this year have been disappointed.
Presenting an impressive increase in interim profits in October, Garry
Hawkes, the chief executive, said the group was under no pressure to float.
'Our investors are happy with their returns, and clearly the current market
conditions are not very encouraging,' he said. In the same week the
depressed conditions led three other companies to defer flotation plans.
Gardner's management buy-out succeeded only after 12 months of uncertainty.
An attempt by the management to acquire the business, backed by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts (KKR), the New York-based leveraged buy-out specialists, had
failed earlier in the year, as did a takeover proposal by Compass, its main
rival in contract catering.
Forte wanted to sell Gardner to concentrate on its international hotel and
restaurant businesses. However, it retained a 25 per cent stake when a
consortium led by venture capital company CinVen mounted a successful bid.
Mr Hawkes, the managing director, and other senior staff subscribed for 8
per cent of the company. He said the buy-out was 'an attempt to bring back
ownership and hopefully motivation' to the managers who had delivered 15 per
cent growth for Forte in recent years.
At the time Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte, said the investors hoped to
float the group in four years - although other observers were talking of a
listing as early as the end of this year.
The omens looked good. In addition to operating in rapidly expanding markets
as government contracting out increased, the group had the advantage of
requiring very little capital.
Debt was also unlikely to be much of a burden because the interest rates on
most of the Pounds 200m of senior debt was hedged long term.
Furthermore Gardner was used to paying most of its profit and cash flow to
Forte in dividends.
The liberating effects of the MBO were soon obvious. By May, Mr Hawkes
revealed that the company had sold more contracts in the first two months of
1993 than during the whole of the previous year.
The results for 1993 showed just how much Gardner was distracted by bids and
buy-out plans in 1992. In the financial year ending January 31, 1994,
profits before interest and tax rose by more than 50 per cent and turnover
burst through the Pounds 1bn barrier.
Strong cash flow enabled the group, which employs 47,000 people worldwide,
to cut its senior debt from Pounds 200m to Pounds 163m.
Mr Hawkes described the first year of independence as 'one of the most
successful years in our history'. He cited strong morale, helped by the fact
that 1,000 managers were shareholders.
Their 8 per cent stake was expected to rise to 20 per cent on flotation. A
further 6,800 employees had been granted the right to share options.
Since then the group has made its first significant acquisition, doubling
the size of its business in the US with a Dollars 100m deal to buy part of
Morrison Restaurants' contract food division.
The deal made Gardner the fifth biggest contract caterer in the US, although
it remains behind arch-rival Compass Group.
The acquisition took Gardner into 40 states, up from 18, and the number of
US employees rose from 5,500 to 13,000. US turnover is expected to rise from
Dollars 180m to Dollars 400m, and account for 25 per cent of total group
turnover.
'It fits brilliantly, and we are very happy with it,' says Mr Hawkes.
The group now has a good presence in the southern states, whereas it was
stronger in the north, and has further strengthened its position in the
business and industry market.
The deal was financed through increased bank debt, taking the total to about
Pounds 225m. But in August the group completed a Pounds 240m refinancing
package with the Royal Bank of Scotland and five other banks.
The package included a Pounds 155m five-year loan to refinance borrowings
left over from the MBO; a Dollars 100m five-year loan to fund the Morrison's
acquisition; and a Pounds 20m multi-currency working capital and guarantee
facility, again over five years.
Mr Hawkes says the refinancing demonstrated confidence in the group,
especially as it had been done between the MBO and the future flotation.
The interim results, announced in October, showed strong organic growth,
with a net gain of 175 contracts, compared with 163 previously. Profits
before interest and tax were almost 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 26.9m in the
six months to July 31 on the back of a 9 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds
556m.
The group relies on the UK for more than half its business and most of its
profits. UK profits grew to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 17.2m) on sales of Pounds
320m (Pounds 291m).
Almost one-third of new contracts in the UK, where margins improved from 5.9
to 6.2 per cent, were in the public sector - an area the group has targeted
for future growth both in the UK and overseas.
In the rest of Europe profits edged ahead to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.2m) on
sales of Pounds 152m (Pounds 141m), held back by the recession in France.
European margins eased to 3.6 per cent (3.7 per cent). Profits from the rest
of the world, including the US, were Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of
Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 77.2m).
The group considers there are still considerable opportunities in the core
businesses. It wants to exploit the critical mass more, growing on the
existing cost base, improving information technology and taking further
advantage of its purchasing power. Then, when the time is ripe, it will
float.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (1): Services start
to converge - Comment / Microsoft's plans to acquire Intuit, another US
company, which specialises in personal finance software has aroused concerns
about a concentration of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest software house, is facing some delay over
plans to acquire Intuit, another US company, which specialises in personal
finance software.
The deal, worth Dollars 1.5bn and the biggest in the history of the software
business, was struck in October. The most recent delay is because the US
Justice Department has asked for further documents to help it assess the
anti-trust potential of the deal.
Intuit's principal product is Quicken, a Windows-based program which enables
purchasers to manage their personal finances. It gives Microsoft an
immediate passport to the limited world of home banking.
So there is little, one might think, to connect a small home accounting
system supplier such as Intuit (sales of Dollars 120m last year) with the
giants of the accounting package market such as SAP of Germany or Dun and
Bradstreet of the US.
Yet the Microsoft connection was enough to have analysts in Britain asking
Sage, a Newcastle-based group which leads the UK accounting software market
for small and medium sized companies, about the threat to its business.
Sage which strengthened its position in the European market with the
acquisition earlier this month of Saari, the leader in the French market for
personal computer accounting software, discounted the threat from Intuit,
arguing that the two companies were operating in different areas, one in
personal finance, the other in small business software. It compared the
price it paid for Saari, Pounds 18.7m or 64 per cent of sales with
Microsoft's expensive splurge.
Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates, however, rarely makes a move that he has
not considered deeply. Look at the development of Microsoft itself. It has
its origins in the PC revolution; operating systems and simple utilities for
single users. Over the years, its ambitions have had to take account of more
complex systems. Its current flagship operating system, Windows NT,
resembles a mainframe operating system in its size and complexity, not to
mention the time it is taking to become fully robust. It cost Dollars 150m
to develop - the most expensive PC program ever.
In a new book on the development of NT* Greg Zachary notes: 'Microsoft's
rivals grasped the essential importance of NT: the program defined the shape
of software to come. At the very least, NT promised to serve as the
foundation for a variety of ambitious Microsoft programs to be released
through the 1990s - everything from video-on-demand software to corporate
information networks.'
Microsoft has already rolled out Microsoft Network, an on-line service which
it hopes will form a standard technical foundation for interactive on-line
services. It is forming relationships with a diverse group of potential
information providers for the network - publishers, telecommunications
suppliers and entertainments groups.
More of the advantages of the Intuit purchase become clear with this
development. The software house has established relationships with
organisations such as Visa International and the US company Checkfree which
give it access to a system through which individual can pay bills
electronically. It is also the owner of an electronic bill-paying service,
the national Payment Clearing House.
Microsoft is therefore well positioned to offer personal finance management,
electronic shopping and electronic banking on an on-line basis. It is this
concentration of power that is worrying some industry observers and,
seemingly, prompting the Justice Department to look closely at the deal.
Many industry observers believe the deal could prove anti-competitive,
awarding Microsoft a large slice of the electronic future in a whole range
of activities from electronic banking to on-line shopping.
The software packages business has been turned inside out by successive
waves of the PC revolution. Hardly any of the large accounting software
suppliers of a decade ago still exist. MSA and McCormack &amp; Dodge, for
example, have vanished into Dun and Bradstreet software.
Today, the question is how quickly accounting software houses can move to
client-server software designs. SAP with R/3 is a long way along the road,
as is QSP, a UK firm which reckons to have spent some Pounds 16m of its own
money on developing Universal Olas, a client-server based accounting
package.
How many others will follow? The cost of developing these large, integrated
packages means considerable risk for a software house even if the cost is
shared with the customer.
None of which should suggest that Microsoft, or any PC software company, is
going to spring into a leadership position in the big accounting software
business in the near future.
An enduring dream of the computer business, however, has been computing
power on tap - a commodity such as gas or water. The convergence of low
cost, high capacity on-line services, PC programs as complex as those for
mainframe systems and a growing tendency among even the largest companies to
outsource their basic data processing have brought that dream substantially
closer.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): Leader 3i hones its
competitive skills - Participants, Richard Gourlay looks at a familiar
picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
As the UK management buy-out industry enters an era of respectable maturity,
a glance down the top 10 deal leaders, lenders, mezzanine providers and
arranging accountants reveals a familiar picture.
There has been some rearrangement in the middle ranks, with some houses
elbowing their way a few places higher and others slipping. But there are
few new names, upsets or significant departures.
Below the surface, however, there are a number of developments that hint at
the way the management buy-out business could develop in the UK in the next
few years.
Funds are being raised in novel ways; banks not seen since the late 1980s
are protesting they never left the market and laying out their wares once
more; and the largest equity provider, 3i, is honing its competitive skills
under the public gaze of a new set of shareholders after its summer
flotation.
On the equity side, 3i remains at the top of the pile in terms of numbers of
deals led, its 17 transactions more than double the total for Natwest, the
nearest rival. Focused on smaller deals, 3i's average deal at Pounds 20m is
only a quarter the size of those backed by CINVen, which leads the funding
table with total funding of Pounds 561m.
But before its flotation, 3i introduced the first of a series of new funds
which could put providers of equity to middle-sized deals under considerable
competitive pressure.
Its newly-launched fund for co-investing with UK institutions will invest in
management buy-outs larger than Pounds 10m. The Pounds 150m fund - half
provided by 3i - will not only earn the group a management fee.
The fund will also allow 3i to reduce the amount it is forced to syndicate,
or hand on, to other venture capitalists in the market.
It will reduce third-party access to deals originating from 3i's network of
regional offices.
And the new fund will give 3i greater fire power and appetite for the
mid-sized MBO deals, an area where it has not recently been strongly
represented.
This could also increase the trend for venture capital houses to develop
regional offices or national office networks to move closer to the local
accounting firms that are an increasingly important source of deal flow.
It might also lead to some houses considering moving out of London
altogether to offices nearer the source of deals.
On the debt side, 1994 has been a year of transformation. Bank of Scotland
and NatWest, the most visible lenders over the past three years, have been
joined by an army of banks seeking to put assets on their books.
Notable among the new arrivals is the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose head of
corporate finance, Leith Robertson, moved from Bank of Scotland.
Aggressively back in the market are Morgan Grenfell, Midland Bank and Samuel
Montagu.
As a result commitment fees and the typical interest rate spread have both
fallen to below two percentage points.
Other banks with recently awakened appetites have been less responsible.
Some have tried to buy market share, pushing up the price of deals and
offering more debt to back the higher valuations. While this has not yet led
to deals being structured with very demanding levels of gearing, the
appetite of some banks is making some equity providers distinctly edgy.
This willingness to lend has had a detrimental knock-on effect for the
mezzanine market where Intermediate Capital Group - which also floated this
year - remains by far the largest debt supplier.
The greater availability of pure debt has meant that the amount of mezzanine
supplied so far this year in the UK has fallen quite sharply.
In effect the banks are prepared to take more risk for a simple debt reward
and are to some extent 'stealing mezzanine's clothes', according to one
observer.
One of the most intriguing changes in 1994 has been the way new funds are
being raised. The big funds, like Candover and Charterhouse, appear to have
raised large funds in the conventional manner, involving long-term
commitments from fee-paying institutional investors, mainly in the US.
But some new fund raisers are rocking the boat. For example, 3i is only
charging a management fee on its larger buy-out fund when it has commited
funds to an investment. Similarly, Legal &amp; General, which last year raised
funds for the first time from sources other than its parent, has ruffled
feathers.
'The standard partnership has a five-year investment programme,' says
Charles Peal, managing director of Legal &amp; General Ventures. 'Ours is a
one-year investment programme. You can join it for that year and if we have
not spent the money your commitment is released.' The investors have the
option to renew or not to renew.
Where Peal has made himself particularly unpopular is in the structure of
fees. In the first year L&amp;G looked beyond its parent for funds. It charged a
management fee only when the money was committed and then at half the
prevailing market rate. This year, because deal flow is slower it is
charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 1 per cent after funds are
commited.
L&amp;G hopes to raise Pounds 150m a year - two thirds from its parent - on this
basis. If the practice spread, fund-raising would become an annual event - a
prospect that weary venture capitalists, who have spent the past 18 months
raising new funds, find too appalling for words.
It is too early to say if this practice will spread. Low commitment fees and
annual roll-over of funds do not necessarily go hand in hand with good
investment decisions.
And there are other drawbacks. As Chris Beresford, head of corporate finance
at KPMG, says; 'It's a very high risk strategy - a bit like sitting down on
the eve of your wedding anniversary and asking your wife if she wants to
remain married to you.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (2): Acquisitive adventurer -
Case study / Compass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compass, the catering and healthcare group bought by the management in 1987,
surprised the City last April with a rights issue to raise almost Pounds
146m towards the cost of buying the third biggest caterer in the US for
Dollars 450m.
The purchase made Compass the third biggest catering company in the world,
behind ARA and Marriott of the US. However, Francis Mackay, chief executive,
emphasises that the US rivals are domestic businesses, while Compass is
international.
The US deal is indicative of the rapid expansion of Compass since the Pounds
160m MBO from Grand Metropolitan in 1987, which was then the biggest deal of
its kind in the UK. At the time the genial Mr Mackay was finance director,
while Gerry Robinson, now chief executive of Granada Group, was chief
executive.
'I'm sure we did have problems with the buy-out, but it did seem to go in a
very regular and quick way,' Mr Mackay recalls. 'There were no black holes -
we knew the business. Gerry Robinson had been there for three years and I
had been there for one year as finance director and managing director of the
hospitals.'
He describes the negotiations with GrandMet as 'tough, but straightforward.
The handling of the disposal was very well managed and ably done.'
The speed of the deal that was struck reflected the maturity of the MBO
market at the time and the obvious attraction to venture capitalists.
'The characteristics of the business were good for venture capitalists,' Mr
Mackay explains. 'The business had enormous growth potential, a strong cash
flow, and had been around for 50 years.'
Furthermore, the management had the luck to move when interest rates were
still around 7 per cent.
The subsequent rise in interest rates was behind the rapid flotation, which
followed at the end of 1988 and valued the business at about Pounds 200m.
'At the time of the MBO we had capping facilities to cover interest payments
for two years,' Mr Mackay explains. As interest rates started to rocket, the
group decided to float quickly to get more equity in.
The first results as an independent company showed the potential. Pre-tax
profits in the year to the end of September 1988 soared from Pounds 5m
sterling to Pounds 13.3m on sales ahead from Pounds 261m to Pounds 277m.
Nevertheless, only 68 per cent of the offer for sale was taken up at 245p
per share. It must have irritated the investors who steered clear in the
early days to see the first results as a listed company - pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 23.3m.
Mr Mackay blames the poor take-up of shares on the timing of the float,
which coincided with redundancies at several brokerage houses. 'They took
their eye off the ball,' he says. 'Immediately after the float the shares
went up by 1p a day for two-and-a-half months.'
The group quickly turned its attention to growing the core businesses of
catering and healthcare. Within two years of the flotation it had got out of
property services, building services and security.
'You have to get quickly back on the growth part,' explains Mr Mackay. 'An
MBO brings financial discipline - in the first years the debt structure
means you want cash flow to be as rapid as possible. Then you need to start
looking for investment and growth.'
The group has been growing ever since, with the only apparent setback coming
in 1992 when it failed to acquire principal rival Gardner Merchant from
Forte.
However, with the benefit of hindsight Mr Mackay believes that losing
Gardner Merchant has been more beneficial. 'We have expanded into new market
sectors and broadened our market base. Gardner would have given us much more
volume - but in one sector.'
At the end of 1993 the group was able to report a 31 per cent rise in
profits (Pounds 41.5m for the year ended September) on the back of good
performances by its acquisitions.
Turnover moved ahead 44 per cent to Pounds 497m, including a contribution of
Pounds 156.2m from acquisitions, mainly reflecting the purchase of SAS
Service Partner's airport catering business via a rights issue, and the
acquisitions of Travellers Fare, the station caterers, and Letheby
Christopher, the sports and events caterer.
This year's deal to buy US caterer Canteen Corporation was by far Compass's
most adventurous acquisition. Mr Mackay described the deal at the time as 'a
one-off opportunity to buy into the world's biggest food market at a price
that is sensible'.
The deal was funded by a 6-for-19 rights issue, priced at 270p. Earlier this
week, the shares were at 328p, giving the group a market capitalisation of
almost Pounds 780m.
Since the 1987 MBO, turnover has grown from Pounds 250m to a pro forma
Pounds 1.5bn. At the time of the float the management held 10 per cent of
the shares, but now holds only 2 to 3 per cent, mainly because of the
expansion.
But Mr Mackay points out that some of the original venture capitalists still
have a stake in the group, the biggest being the Prudential with just under
3 per cent.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (1): MBOs weave their special
spell again - It has been a good time for buy-out financiers as they raise
new funds.  But there may not be enough deals to go round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venture capitalists in the UK will look back on 1994 as a special year.
Financiers will probably provide management buy-outs with Pounds 3.5bn of
equity, making it the best year since 1989 when Pounds 6.5bn was invested,
according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
On the fund-raising side, the big MBO equity providers have successfully
raised large new funds after a burst of flotations early in 1994 that
greatly improved performance figures. Candover, Morgan Grenfell Development
Capital, Baring Capital Investors and Charterhouse have all raised funds in
a year that has seen more than Pounds 1.5bn of new money come into the
industry.
At the same time, banks that had almost entirely withdrawn from lending to
MBOs, after losing their shirts in the late 1980s, are able and willing
lenders again.
Whereas two years ago, a venture capitalist would have been hard pushed to
raise debt from banks other than National Westminster Bank and the Bank of
Scotland, there is now a desire to lend that verges on the incautious.
From the point of view of companies trying to raise money, therefore, there
has rarely been a more propitious time. The trauma managements endure in the
process of structuring and managing an MBO is as great as ever (see our
hypothetical example on page 12 of this survey). But the potential rewards -
both financial and in terms of personal fulfilment  - also remain just as
attractive.
As for companies considering selling subsidiaries to management or a
management buy-in team, the market is also healthy. The reason? The
increased supply of money means competition between financiers is fierce.
Venture capitalists increasingly find themselves bidding against each other
in auctions.
There is therefore no question about the popularity of buy-outs. But hanging
over MBO financiers, as the industry matures in the UK, is concern that
there might be too much capital around for the number of deals available.
'Over the last few years, venture capitalists have been managing flotations
from their portfolios and more latterly raising new funds,' says Chris
Beresford, head of corporate finance at KPMG. 'Now they are keen to invest
but there are not enough deals to go around. Some houses are finding it hard
to do enough deals to justify the number of people they have,' he added.
Put another way - it is only a matter of time before someone finds a way to
pay too much for a business as happened in the late 1980s, notably with the
purchase of the Magnet and Isosceles.
'With this wall of money there is no doubt that the market will be very
aggressive in the next 18 months,' says Jon Moulton, who moved from Schroder
Ventures this year to Apax Partners.
Despite such warnings, the venture capital industry does appear to be
maturing. Last week, a syndicate led by Prudential Ventures pulled out of a
deal to buy National Parking Corporation because they said the vendor was
asking too high a price. In less responsible times, the venture capitalsts
might well have put more debt into the financing, taken a more optimistic
view of growth prospects and put the Pounds 600m deal to bed.
Predictions that over-capacity in the industry would lead to a shake-out
have not, however, been borne out this year.
Grosvenor Ventures was taken over by Mercury Development Capital and at the
higher-tech end of the market, Trinity Partners merged with Advent
International. Europe.
But elsewhere there have been almost no mergers or casualties. The fate
awaiting those venture capital houses whose records would not support a new
fund-raising is probably death by a thousand cuts as management fees slowly
decline to a level that no longer covers overheads.
Competitive pressures have been increasing for other reasons, too. Large
conglomerates have either traded out of problems or sold most of the obvious
subsidiary businesses to management. And the subdued level of mergers and
acquisitions' activity has meant there have been few disposals.
As a result, competitive pressure is increasing. 'When new deals arise,
everyone is trampling over the same patch and it is getting pretty bare of
vegetation,' says Mr Beresford.
It is not an isolated view. 'This has been a great year for venture
capital,' says Charles Peal, managing director of Legal &amp; General Ventures.
'A lot of people's track records have solidified into some pretty impressive
records. But I am slightly worried looking forward.'
Mr Peal says at least a dozen equity providers could lead at least three
Pounds 50m deals a year - meaning there is capacity for at least 36 deals.
On average, however, there have been only 11 such deals a year since 1992.
Shortly to be adding to this capacity is Apax Partners. Mr Moulton is about
to announce a new vehicle - not a fund - that he says will allow Apax to
invest up to Pounds 100m in a business without having to syndicate the deal.
Not surprisingly, the hunt is on among venture capitalists to find ways to
stand out from the crowd.
Some organisations, such as Schroder Ventures, have firmly established
reputations for doing more complicated transactions - turnarounds, or
transnational deals. Mr Moulton aims to do similar deals at Apax. Others
like, CVC Capital Partners and Baring Capital, have successfully pushed in
to Continental Europe. Some can claim to be faster decision-makers or more
knowledgeable about certain markets. But for others, there is little choice
but to slug it out on price.
What is more, there is an increasing incidence of the so-called financial
deal, where the venture capitalist approaches potential vendors directly,
for instance with the suggestion that a division does not fit and should be
sold. In this respect, UK buy-outs are looking more like US-style leveraged
buy-outs - though for the moment they carry less debt than their notorious
transatlantic cousin.
Ernst &amp; Young believes this is the most significant development in the
buy-out market this year. 'It is a function of the weight of money in the
market and the desire of the larger funds to find some homes for that money
as quickly as possible,' says Martin Aguss, a member of the Ernst &amp; Young
buy-out team.
A variant is the purchase of a job lot of divisions, a route taken by
Schroder Ventures when it bought a collection of instrumentation and
transducer businesses, which it called Solartron, from Schlumberger late
last year. The intention was to eliminate losses at one of the four
companies, build the others and sell the restructured business. As it
happened, the entire business was bought by Roxboro, before these plans came
to fruition.
This was a particularly rapid realisation. The more common exit route for
venture capitalists - flotation - has been more troublesome lately, with
1994 being a year of two halves.
According to Tom Attwood, director of marketing, new issues, at stockbrokers
James Capel, small company fund managers were having to evaluate two new
issues a day in the early spring, many of them former buy-outs.
Then the train hit the buffers. New issues like MDIS and Aerostructures
Hamble, issued profit warnings only months after flotation. Institutional
investor confidence in all flotations was seriously damaged.
'Venture capitalists will have to expect a comparatively low or lower
potential exit price because of the recent publicity,' says Mr Attwood. 'And
(institutional) investors will not only be exerting their muscle to get a
lower price they will also be looking for the very highest quality.'
This does not work entirely to venture capitalists' disadvantage. Finding an
exit for smaller companies may be temporarily more difficult. But the low
values that the stock market is attributing to small companies may also be
reflected in the price the venture capitalists pay for businesses.
What is more, research by James Capel and others suggests that former MBO
companies outperform their sector after flotation, notwithstanding the
aforementioned exceptions.
Venture capitalists would say this is the MBO continuing to weave its
beneficial spell on the business.

FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was another Footsie casualty as the share price
reacted to a key resignat-ion and competition worries in the US.
Initially, the shares fell on news that Dr Franz Humer, the chief operating
director, is leaving the company to take up another job in the industry.
Analysts said that the news was a disappointment as Dr Humer is highly
regarded within the industry, but there had been no suggestions of a
boardroom rift. Dr Humer is rumoured to be going to Sandoz or Roche.
The blow to sentiment was increased by market focus on a key US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) advisory meeting on Losec, the stomach ulcer drug
of Swedish rival Astra.
The meeting, scheduled for today and tomorrow, is expected to recommend that
there is no need for side-effect warnings to accompany the drug, which is
the principal competitor to Zantac, Glaxo's headline drug. If the warnings
are removed then Losec can be approved for long term use. Glaxo shares were
down 13 at one stage and closed 8 1/2 off at 616 1/2p.
Motor parts group T&amp;N continued to wilt under the impact of cash drain and
rights issue worries, sliding a further 20 to 166p in active trading. At 15m
shares, turnover was 6m more than on Tuesday when the company disclosed an
unexpected Pounds 100m jump in asbestos-related provisions.
According to NatWest Securities, the extra provisions plus any takeover of
German pistons group Kolbenschmidt - T&amp;N's option on a 52 per cent stake in
the company runs out next March - will increase group net borrowings as a
proportion of net worth to around 100 per cent, without taking account of
possible goodwill write-offs.
Accordingly any rights issue is likely to be sizeable, possibly a
one-for-three, said the broker. The shares have now tumbled 25 per cent in
two days.
Cement producers mostly breathed a sigh of relief at the size of the fines
imposed by the European Union on competition infringement grounds, with Blue
Circle gaining 3 at 304p in 2.4m turnover and Rugby adding a penny at 123p.
The sector has been weak in the run-up to the EU's ver-dict, with most
commentators braced for fines of up to 6 per cent of European turnover. In
the event, Blue Circle faces a fine of 4.6 per cent of sales, or Pounds
12.3m.
This represents some 5 per cent of the middle range of brokers' estimates
for Blue Circle's 1994 pre-tax profits. The profits cost is also around 5
per cent at Rugby, while CRH - down a penny at 341p - faces a 2 per cent
cost.
Regional electricity companies rose sharply as the market celebrated the
lack of new taxes for the sector in the Budget.
Worries about a windfall tax, fears that the government may reduce tax
credits on share buy- backs and recent political uncertainty had combined to
cast a shadow over the sector.
Market watchers expect a strong performance from the sector as the results
season opens today, with bumper dividend increases of around 20 per cent
expected.
Seeboard, which reports interims today, was among the strong performers
yesterday and the shares jumped 19 to 425p. Northern climbed 28 to 838p and
East Midland advanced 18 to 766p, while Yorkshire gained 17 at 730p.
The news in the Budget that the government plans to introduce a tax on
landfill hit water stocks with an exposure to the waste sector. Wessex Water
fell 8 1/2 to 289 1/2p, while Severn Trent receded 6 to 534p and
Northumbrian relinquished 8 to 692p.
Shanks &amp; McEwan dropped 5 to 84p and Leigh Interests shed 5 to 169p on
worries over the new tax.
Clearing bank shares rebounded following weakness on Tuesday when the sector
was unsettled by pre-Budget worries. National Westminster rose 14 to 521p,
Barclays 13 1/2 to 608 1/2p and Lloyds 8 1/2 to 574 1/2p.
Concern that discount houses would lose out following the Budget
announcement establishing an open market for gilt repos left Cater Allen
down 6 at 483p and King &amp; Shaxson off a penny at 114p.
Insurer General Accident slipped a penny to 533p. Smith New Court is a
seller on the argument that the premium to net asset value will remain too
high unless US Treasuries recover.
News and electronic information service Reuters gained 10 at 491p, with
support from news that the company has established a new international
division to market and develop insurance information.
Chemicals leader ICI jumped 16 to 762p on the combination of a firm dollar
and the removal of a line of stock which had been overhanging the share
price.
Telecoms shares were active, with BT seeing 8.7m shares traded and improving
5 1/2 to 379 1/2p following a buy recommendation from Hoare Govett. Cable
and Wireless added 8 at 387p in 2.5m turnover.
Nervous trading in Grand Metropolitan ahead of today's final figures saw the
shares surrender 5 to 383p. Property Group MEPC is another stock reporting
annual results today. Dealers were positive and the shares put on 3 at 403p.
The market appeared to have discounted an increase in duties on alcohol,
thus shares in drinks group Bass gave up 11 to 528p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sales dip weakens Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retailer Argyll Group tumbled 17 to 255p, the day's biggest Footsie
retreat, after a disappointing statement confirmed fears that the group was
losing market share.
A hefty 16m shares were dealt, marking Argyll's busiest day for around five
months. Traders also said a large overhanging line of stock had depressed
the shares further.
The group's interim profits were up by Pounds 8m to just below the market
consensus of Pounds 206.8m. But the statement on current trading, indicating
that same store sales at Argyll's Safeway chain had fallen 0.8 per cent in
the first six weeks of the year, was the particular disappointment. Analysts
were also disappointed by the lack of more detailed information on the
review of the business started 18 months ago.
SG Warburg was said to have been one of the brokers downgrading full-year
profits expectations, with rivals of the house suggesting it had reduced its
forecast by around Pounds 10m to Pounds 390m. Analyst Mr Neil Currie was not
prepared to confirm the figures but said: 'The current trading situation is
not good and has to be addressed. In the meantime, some of the reasons to be
bullish about Argyll are postponed rather than eliminated.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures extended their recent rally to five days, the FT-SE 100
December contract moving back near to 3,100 in improving trading volume,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
December stood at 3,093 at the close of pit trading for a rise of 25 points.
Over the past five sessions the contract has advanced 69 points.
At the official close the premium to the cash market was 13 points - more
than seven points over fair value - but at times during the day the premium
topped 20 points, encouraging a certain amount of arbitrage business.
Although volume remained below the level at which most traders are happy to
run a book, there was a notable increase to 12,828 lots, from under 10,000
on Tuesday. Most real business was on the buying side and dealers said
sentiment showed a clear improvement.
There was some buying for next year, which helped to underpin the better
mood, with around 1,400 of the day's trades counting as roll-over into the
March contract.
Option trading remained subdued, with 27,102 contracts dealt, against 25,991
on Tuesday. Call and put trading was again fairly evenly matched. FT-SE and
Euro FT-SE turnover accounted for almost 17,000 lots. British Gas was the
most active stock option at 1,145 lots dealt. Banks were busy, notably
Barclays and HSBC.

FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Programme trade activity boosts
equity market - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A burst of strong overseas buying, via a series of heavyweight programme
trades, put the final touches to an unexpectedly buoyant trading session in
London's equity market.
The rash of overseas buying took the market completely by surprise. Earlier
in the session share prices had wilted in the face of a general stand-off by
the big institutions to what was almost universally described as a
disappointing and uninspiring Budget.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed at the day's best level, up 20.3 at 3,081.4, with
many dealers adopting the view that this morning could well see an extension
of yesterday's excellent late performance.
The flurry of demand was not confined to the market leaders, with the
second-liners sharing in the late upsurge, albeit on a slightly smaller
scale. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 8.1 higher at 3,497.3. Helping to
fuel the market advance was a strong opening by US Treasury bonds and Wall
Street, a move which took many market observers by surprise.
The Dow Industrial Average raced higher in early trading, adding more than
20 points, in spite of more economic data pointing to continuing
inflationary pressures in the US economy. These included a higher than
expected upward revision of third-quarter gross domestic product and a sharp
increase in the Chicago Purchasing Management Index.
Dealers expected such inflationary indicators to depress US markets, coming
so soon after the startling increase in the consumer confidence index
announced late on Tuesday.
The big programme trade activity gave a strong boost to turnover levels,
which earlier in the day had looked like producing no more than a routine
session's business. Volume reached a respectable 682.8m shares, of which
non-Footsie stocks accounted for 59 per cent of the total. But levels of
customer business remained disappointing. On Budget Day retail business only
just topped the Pounds 1bn mark.
The trading session began very quietly, with share prices marked down at the
outset after the generally restrained press response to the Budget. The
FT-SE 100 opened around three points easier but gradually began to creep
higher within the hour, with dealers noting minor bouts of support in
selective areas.
Among these were the electricity stocks, which built on Tuesday's late gains
in the absence of the much-feared windfall profits tax or any moves to block
special dividends or share buy-backs. Buying interest faltered in
mid-morning, however, and the Footsie retreated over the lunchtime period
and early afternoon before staging a strong run in the last hour of trading
as the programme trades were said to have been activated.
Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, was said to have executed
the largest of three big programmes, a balance trade worth Pounds 150m each
way, while NatWest Securities and SG Warburg were also said to have executed
large programmes.
A leading marketmaker at one of the integrated UK securities houses said
demand triggered by the programmes would probably boost London at the outset
today, although he stressed that Wall Street's performance would be crucial.
Around the various sectors, bank shares were in the forefront of the
market's advance, but food retailers came under sustained selling pressure
as Argyll Group upset the market in revealing a decline in like-for-like
sales in the first six months of its financial year. Other supermarket
groups, including market giants such as J. Sainsbury and Tesco, also lost
ground. Glaxo was one of the day's big casualties, the shares falling
sharply in the wake of the resignation of one of its highly regarded
directors and on talk of increased competition.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow barely changed awaiting
fresh data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities finished mostly flat yesterday as traders awaited important
economic data due out today and on Friday, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.68 at 3,739.23. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.48 at 453.69, while the American Stock Exchange
composite gained 0.77 at 433.86. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.16 to 750.32.
NYSE trading volume came to 298.6m shares.
For most of the afternoon, the Dow held steady at about 15 points above
Tuesday's close. Program trading was credited with driving the index down in
the last hour of trading. The morning saw the market reacting to differing
signals about inflationary pressures in the economy.
Capacity utilisation figures for October were revised downward, while the
Commerce Department revised its estimate of gross domestic product up. A
survey by Chicago purchasing managers showed business activity up at 67.4
per cent in November from 64.3 per cent in October and a sharp increase in
the 'prices paid' component of the report from 72.5 per cent to 79.4 per
cent.
While the Chicago survey is not considered an extremely important figure, it
is taken as an indicator of the direction of the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' figures due out this morning.
Although news of the slowing of the economy is generally bad for the stock
market, lately investors are watching for any news that might put off
another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The upward revision in GDP figures boosted shares in large cyclicals, which
generally gain from a strong economy. Aluminum Company of America moved up
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 , Caterpillar Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54,
Dupont Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 , Union Carbide Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 28 5/8 and International Paper Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 .
Most major pharmaceutical stocks posted increases. Pfizer appreciated
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 77 3/8 , Eli Lilly Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 62 5/8
and Warner Lambert Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/8 .
Apache, the oil and gas company, jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 on news
that it had agreed to buy more than 300 oil and gas fields from Texaco for
Dollars 600m. Texaco hardened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 .
American Brands, the consumer goods company, put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 35
3/8 on news that it would sell its insurance unit to American General for
Dollars 1.2bn. The latter firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 .
ADRs of two of Mexico's largest companies, Telemex and Grupo Televisa, both
retreated in spite of news generally considered positive for both that the
telecommunications group would acquire 49 per cent of Televisa's cable
subsidiary Cablevision for Dollars 211m. Telmex shed Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 53 and Televisa fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 45 1/4 .
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo, strong in the morning as investors continued to buy on
lower interest rates and forecasts of a reduction in inflation during
December, fell back as anxiety ahead of the outcome of a National Monetary
Council - Brazil's highest economic body - meeting being held yesterday
triggered strong profit-taking late in the session.
The Bovespa index lost 160 or 0.3 per cent on the day at 46,560, having
risen 2.9 per cent at one stage. Volume was high at RDollars 448.6m (Dollars
528.4m), but brokers said around 50 per cent of the total was due to a huge
box operation involving Telebras options. This involves a combination of two
call and two put options.
Merrill Lynch said it expected Brazil's stock markets to grow by 50 per cent
in 1995 and to outperform all other major emerging markets in Latin America.
Merrill added that the country was a good investment option because
prospects for a period of sustained economic growth were good.
Brazil's stabilisation plan, which included the introduction of a new
currency on July 1, had cut inflation to around 3 per cent in November from
50 per cent in June.
Merrill cautioned that the stabilisation plan had yet to overcome a few
obstacles before it achieved long term success. These included reforms to
the economy, welfare and taxation.
Canada
Toronto mirrored the New York market trend, seeing an initial advance lost
by afternoon selling. Early firm sentiment was helped by Canada's stronger
than expected third-quarter gross domestic product data and improved metals
prices, but this gave way to fresh nervousness over interest rates.
The TSE 300 index was finally a net 10.31 points down at 4,093.41, but rises
led declines by 404 to 368. The index had been up almost 25 points in late
morning. Volume was a moderate 63.4m shares. Golds fell 2.6 per cent.

The market improved but non-gold shares saw early gains eroded, ending only
slightly better on the day, with investors remaining nervous about short
term prospects.
Trade was generally limited and dealers said shares consolidated as they
searched for fresh direction. The overall index added 7.4 at 5,756.4, the
industrial index was 11.6 better at 6,898.4 and the golds index put on 20.1

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cement makers mixed on news of
fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT and MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European cement manu-facturers put in mixed performances as they awaited
details of the fines imposed by the European Commission on 33 companies
after a five-year investigation into a cement industry cartel. Details were
made public after most markets closed, and subsequently a number of the
companies announced their intentions to appeal.
Mr Martin Murch at Robert Fleming Securities said the fines, which averaged
5 to 6 per cent of the companies' 1992 turnovers, were sharply less than the
10 per cent maximum which could have been imposed, and which some people had
feared. Mr Murch believed that shares could bounce higher in coming days in
further response.
In Italy, Italcementi, which earned the highest fine, fell L184 to L10,336,
but in the opposite direction, Lafarge Coppee, in France, rose FFr16.10 or 4
per cent to FFr413.10 and Ciments Francaise picked up FFr1 to FFr170.
Holderbank, in Switzerland, was marked SFr8 lower late in the day to
SFr1,029, while CBR, in Belgium, was BFr75 down at BFr11,950. In Germany,
Dyckerhoff fell DM30 to DM650 and Heidelberger rose DM29 to DM1,255.
FRANKFURT moved modestly higher amid low turnover. The Dax ended official
hours with a gain of 3.98 at 2,048.26, and then climbed to 2,057.28 in the
Ibis session. Turnover was DM5bn. Dealers remarked that the bund future
lifted stocks late in the day.
Hoechst finished with a gain of 50 pfennings at DM314.50 in the official
session, adding a similar amount in the Ibis after reporting a rise of more
than 80 per cent in pre-tax profits to September, above analysts'
expectations. Goldman Sachs, which raised its full-year forecast to above
DM2bn, noted that there was scope for further outperformance, 'helped by the
more rapid feed-through of higher earnings and dividends'.
Elsewhere in the sector, Bayer was up DM1.60 to DM343.80 and then to
DM347.40 in the post, and BASF, down to DM304.20 in normal hours, recovered
to DM305.50 later.
Deutsche Babcock lost DM6.50 to DM205.50 and then rose to DM206.7 in the
post following losses earlier in the week on weaker-than-expected results.
PARIS found its motivation mainly in technical factors as the November
CAC-40 futures contract expired. In the cash market the CAC 40 index put on
36.69 or 2 per cent to 1,976.66, in higher than average turnover of above
FFr5bn.
Thomson-CSF, which is thought to be a candidate for an overseas defence
contract, gained FFr8.20 or 5.1 per cent, to FFr169.
Accor made FFr12 to FFr587 on reports that it was likely to meet its target
of selling some FFr2.5bn of assets by the end of 1995.
Cap Gemini Sogeti rose FFr3.90 to FFr184.80 after announcing that, together
with IBM France, it had won a FFr500m contract.
MILAN turned its attention to worries that the day's last-ditch talks
between the government and unions on budget reform and the budget plan would
fail to prevent tomorrow's planned general strike and the Comit index eased
1.24 to 625.72.
Olivetti gained L48 to L1,927 after the cabinet gave the green light to the
mobile phone contract awarded to its Omnitel consortium.
Credito Romagnolo, which resumed trading after a two day suspension, picked
up L568 or 3.3 per cent to L17,664 on expectations that Credito Italiano
would make an improved bid. Italiano picked up L29 to L17,664 after recent
losses, amid doubts by some analysts that it would necessarily succeed in
winning over the Bologna-based bank this time round.
ZURICH put in a firm performance in low volumes, the SMI index finishing
10.2 higher at 2,594.9, supported by rising bond futures.
Nestle took its lead from the firmer dollar, rising SFr17 to SFr1,232 while
a SFr6.50 slide in SMH to SFr141.50 was attributed to a Goldman Sachs
downgrade.
AMSTERDAM was supported overall by the dollar. The AEX index ended with a
gain of 2.66 to 409.49.
Nedlloyd put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 53.00 after reporting slightly firmer third
quarter net profits, and saying that it expected full year figures of around
Fl 90m.
Unilever added Fl 1.30 to Fl 172.80, with Royal Dutch Petroleum up Fl 1.90
at Fl 190.70, and Philips 60 cents firmer at Fl 53.20.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Renewed buying helps
Nikkei over 19,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Active buying by public funds and investment trusts boosted share prices and
the Nikkei 225 average recovered the 19,000 level for the first time in six
trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index added 149.13 at 19,075.62, rising above 19,000 for the first time
since November 21, and having moved between 18,943.79 and 19,134.03.
Equities moved higher on purchases by public postal and insurance funds,
which absorbed arbitrage selling and profit-taking by overseas investors in
the afternoon.
Volume was 300m shares, against 168m, with public funds buying some 20m
shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 17.59 to
1,520.41, while the Nikkei 300 rose 3.44 to 280.08. Gains outscored declines
by 802 to 232, with 138 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 4.26 at 1,255.50.
Short-covering by overseas investors boosted banking shares. Some traders
said the buybacks could signal an end to the Nikkei's declines since selling
of bank shares ahead of the sector's interim results announcements last week
had prompted the downturn of the index. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y70 to
Y1,760 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,480.
Brokerage issues, recently depressed on fears of weak earnings due to the
stock market decline, were also bought back. Daiwa Securities firmed Y30 to
Y1,290 and Yamaichi Securities Y19 to Y726.
High-technology stocks, which reported firm interim earnings owing to
increased demand, gained on active buying. Toshiba, up Y1 at Y692, was the
day's second most active issue, followed by Hitachi, Y22 higher at Y977.
Steels and shipbuilders were also heavily traded. Nippon Steel, the busiest
stock of the day, added Y5 at Y384 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y5
at Y734.
Privatisation stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Japan Tobacco fell Y1,000
to Y963,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y5,000 to Y840,000.
Petroleum shares declined on the government's continuing push to deregulate
the sector: Showa Shell Sekiyu dipped Y50 to Y1,180.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 280.11 to 21,178.34 in volume of 14.7m
shares. Ono Pharmaceutical rose Y190 to Y4,720.
Roundup
The region was mixed, with the outlook for US interest rates again proving
an inhibition. Manila was closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG fell 2.2 per cent amid renewed worries about higher US interest
rates, and with index futures falling sharply. The Hang Seng index lost
192.00 at 8,466.26, off a day's low of 8,428.57, in turnover that grew to
HKDollars 3.9bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 3.2bn.
New stocks replacing two Jardine companies and a pair of textile groups in
the index failed to find support.
Guangdong Investment fell 10 cents to HKDollars 4.40, Amoy Properties
declined 15 cents to HKDollars 7.70, Oriental Press retreated 20 cents to
HKDollars 4 and Johnson Electric slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 19.80.
SEOUL saw profit-taking and institutional selling in the afternoon which
more than wiped out strong early gains. The composite index ended 6.85 lower
at 1,074.41, after hitting a high for the day of 1,092.03, in volume that
picked up to 38.2m shares from Tuesday's 31.2m.
TAIPEI fell in slow trade due to caution ahead of Saturday's elections. The
weighted index shed 24.38 to 6,363.72 in turnover of TDollars 26.85bn.
Food shares, after gains in recent sessions, encountered profit-taking, with
President Enterprises down TDollars 1 to TDollars 56.
SYDNEY was little changed overall after recovering from early losses on
worries about interest rates following news of higher than expected
third-quarter GDP data. The All Ordinaries index, after a day's low of
1,881.4, lost just 0.6 on balance at 1,890.7 in turnover of ADollars 479m.
WELLINGTON was hit hard by a rise in local interest rates, the NZSE-40
capital index receding 13.68 to 1,990.97.
Salmond Smith Biolab suffered another fall, closing at NZDollars 2.20, down
25 cents, prompting a stock exchange enquiry. The company said it expected
to appoint a new chief executive today and would be examining annual
forecasts.
SINGAPORE was firmer, although the mood was hesitant in response to the
uncertain trend of Wall Street. The Straits Times Industrial index put on
9.29 at 2,242.09.
QAF rose 13 cents to SDollars 1.66 amid speculation that Indonesia's Salim
Group might be about to increase the 8 per cent stake it recently acquired.
KUALA LUMPUR was driven higher by a spate of late foreign buying, the
composite index adding 9.44 at 1,013.13.
BANGKOK gained ground, spurred in the last few minutes of trade by a jump
staged by the finance and building materials sectors. The SET index closed
9.10 ahead at 1,362.44 in Bt3.99bn turnover, while the finance group climbed
1.3 per cent on Bt541m volume.
BOMBAY was lower, with mutual funds absent as buyers, and state elections,
the results of which are not due until December 10, making for a cautious
mood. The BSE-30 index fell 25.68 to 4,124.18.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, however, believed that India could be among Asia's
top performing stock markets next year, in spite of expectations of a poor
election outcome for the ruling Congress party in the southern states of
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time to speculate on likely trends in the world's emerging markets
next year, and one of the first off the mark in the UK has been Mr Arnab
Banerji of London-based investment managers Foreign &amp; Colonial, writes John
Pitt.
At a presentation yesterday Mr Banerji said he believed that US yields at
the long end would peak during the first half of 1995, leading to a
strengthening of the dollar, a fall in the yen and a rise in most emerging
markets. Consequently he had already turned positive on those emerging
economies linked to the dollar.
Notwithstanding dollar influence, he presented an argument demonstrating
that, historically, emerging markets' performance also bore a strong
correlation to the strength of OECD economies. With the latter showing all
the signs of corporate earnings growth, emerging markets looked likely to
follow past experience.
Mr Banerji's bets for 1995: Brazil ('still undervalued'), Egypt ('cult of
equity returning'), Russia ('first world technology with third world wages')
and Bangladesh ('liberalised economy; same population as Japan').

FT  01 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Australian and NZ dollars touch long term
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antipodean currencies were the main movers on the foreign exchanges
yesterday as the prospect of higher interest rates drove both the Australian
and New Zealand dollars to long term highs, writes Philip Gawith.
The Australian dollar touched a 31-month peak, after third-quarter GDP
reached the highest level in 10 years, while the New Zealand currency posted
a four-year high after the Reserve Bank hinted at the prospect of higher
interest rates.
Sterling rallied slightly after Tuesday's Budget to finish in London at
DM2.4578, from DM2.4475, but it closed at Dollars 1.5652 from Dollars
1.5678.
Elsewhere, the dollar showed little response to the release of third-quarter
GDP, industrial production and capacity utilisation figures. It ended at
DM1.5703, from DM1.5612, after the Commerce Department revised its estimate
of third-quarter growth up to 3.9 per cent from 3.4 per cent. In New York it
closed at DM1.5700.
In Europe, the D-Mark remained weak under pressure from the firmer dollar.
The French franc closed at FFr3.431/DM from FFr3.432. Outside the ERM, the
lira continued to strengthen, touching a high of L1,028.45/DM at one stage,
while the Norwegian krone maintained its post-referendum strength, ending at
NKr4.351/DM from NKr4.356.
The general consensus among City economists was that the Budget was positive
for sterling, especially in the longer term. Chase Manhattan entered the
caveat that this was 'more a reflection of the well-balanced economic
recovery to date than any inspiration in the Budget.'
NatWest Markets said: 'Most relevant (for sterling) were Mr Clarke's growth
estimates (and more specifically the implication for interest rates) and the
more optimistic outlook on the trade front.'
It noted that revised current account deficits for 1994 and 1995 represented
just  1/2 per cent of GDP, compared to 1 3/4 per cent in 1993. 'This is a
significant change for the UK and sterling, a currency that has had to fight
against significant current account deficits through the latter half of the
1980s and early 1990s.'
NatWest concluded its assessment on an optimistic note, saying: 'It may just
be that the 1994 Budget statement will be looked back upon as the first in
which sterling was no longer considered a constantly depreciating asset.'
Midland Global Markets also set out the positive case for the pound, asking
rhetorically: 'How many developed western economies can offer good growth,
now balanced towards net exports and investment rather than consumption, a
current account improving towards surplus, low inflation and rapidly
improving public finances?'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, cautioned that
political uncertainty would probably place a cap on sterling's gains.
There were some in the market who expected a rise in interest rates as early
as yesterday. This accounted for the firming of cash rates, with three-month
LIBOR finishing at 6 1/4 per cent, up from 6 1/8 per cent. Mr Richard
Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, estimated that around 30 per cent of his
clients expected rates to rise next month, while 90 per cent expected higher
rates by the end of January.
The New Zealand dollar closed in Wellington at a four-year high after a
signal from the Reserve Bank caused a jump in interest rates, with the
currency following suit. The 'Kiwi' closed at USDollars 0.6283/90, off its
high of Dollars 0.6291 but substantially above its opening of USDollars
0.6232/39.
The Australian dollar hit a 31-month peak after GDP data showed economic
growth running at a 10-year high. Australia's annual growth rate surged to
6.4 per cent during the September quarter, the highest since 1985. The
figure would have been even greater, around 7.3 per cent, had it not been
for the impact of a severe drought.
The growth heightened expectations of further interest rate rises, and the
Australian dollar rose on the back of this. It gained nearly  1/2 cent in
Australian trading, breaking through a key technical resistance level at

FT  01 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metdist to build Dollars 500m
copper refinery in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A USDollars 500m copper smelter and refinery with an associated copper rod
plant is to be built in India by Metdist, the privately-owned, UK-based
group whose chairman, Mr Raj Bagri, is also chairman of the London Metal
Exchange.
Mitsubishi Materials Corporation of Japan is to supply the technology and
will take an 18 per cent interest in the project.
Scheduled to start up in 1998, the new complex will have the capacity to
produce some 150,000 tonnes of refined copper annually using Mitsubishi's
continuous smelting technology, and about 60,000 tonnes of continuous cast
copper rod.
The plants will be located at Pipavav in Gujarat, where the state government
has agreed to allot the land required and the State Pollution Control
Authorities have issued a 'no objection' certificate.
The project will have its own jetty with highly mechanised facilities.
Mr Bagri said a company would be set up to implement the project and 40 per
cent would be floated on a stock exchange when construction was well under
way.
Metdist will manage the plants and Mitsubishi, as well as providing know-how
and technical assistance, will subscribe cash for its 18 per cent of the new
Indian company.
Mr Bagri described the project as a 'very logical extension of Metdist's
presence in the world of physical metals - a logical backward integration'.
His group at present operates two continuous cast copper rod and wire mills
and a thin-wall, inner-grooved, air-conditioning copper tube plant in
Malaysia with a combined fabricating capacity of more than 100,000 tonnes of
copper a year.
Mitsubishi has worked closely with Metdist for some years in Malaysia and
has a 15 per cent stake in the tube manufacturing plant.
Metdist, with a turnover of about USDollars 600m a year, is also involved
the non-ferrous metals trade and one of its subsidiaries is a ring-dealing
LME member. Mr Bagri said his group was therefore well positioned to export
any part of the new Indian production surplus to domestic requirements.
The Indian smelter will produce 450,000 tonnes a year of sulphuric acid as a
by-product. Mr Bagri pointed out that India imported about 1m tonnes a year
of elemental sulphur to produce this acid and said some of the production
would go to replace these imports.
In addition, a plant to use sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid - used
in fertiliser production - might be built.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norilsk problem helps drive up
nickel prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nickel prices yesterday jumped to their highest level for two and three
quarter years, helped by fresh fears about production problems at Norilsk in
Russia, which is the world's biggest producer and accounts for about 15 per
cent of total output.
The market's concern about Norilsk's situation was echoed by Mr David Allen,
vice-president for public and government affairs, at Inco of Canada, the
Russian group's biggest rival. He said that in recent months Inco had
changed its assumptions about Norilsk's ability to maintain production at
last year's level. 'Our own visits, and everything we read, suggests Norilsk
will not be able to do that.'
The Russian group was so short of money it was failing to pay its workforce
for weeks on end and cannibalising equipment to keep going. 'You can't go on
for long like that without costs increasing and output falling,' said Mr
Allen.
Norilsk needed 'a huge amount of capital and there is no sign that it is
getting any'. It did not collect much from the recent shares issue. He
pointed out that, in the longer term, Norilsk would have to do something
about its enormous environmental problems - its smelters are among the
world's worst polluters.
Inco signed a technical assistance protocol with Norilsk in February 1993
but this had 'got absolutely nowhere', said Mr Allen. 'It is very difficult
to conduct relations with them. They have shown no interest.'
He said Inco helped Norilsk, at the Russians' request, by organising a
teach-in in Toronto about privatisation. This involved western bankers and
consultants invited by the Canadian group. 'Yet today they (Norilsk
executives) sometimes won't answer telephone calls or faxes from us.' Mr
Allen said the relationship between the two groups was 'not hostile, but it
is not particularly productive'.
Mr Allen was in London following the formal inauguration this week of an
Pounds 8.5m nickel coating facility at the group's refinery in South Wales.
Yesterday's market concerns about Norilsk helped to take the price of nickel
for delivery in three months to Dollars 8,200 at one point where it met
strong resistence. Nevertheless, it closed at Dollars 8,157.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 332.50 on the day and Dollars 637 above this week's low point.
Worries continued to focus on the after-effects of an accident at a power
plant supplying the group in northern Siberia early last month. Traders in
London suggested early yesterday that about 25,000 people had been
evacuated, pipes had frozen at the smelter and Norilsk's line carrying
concentrate (an intermediate material) was out of action. Norilsk insisted
that it would honour its commitments to customers and a Norilsk city
official told the Reuters news agency that heating to homes was being
maintained 'at a low but acceptable level'.
However, about 32,000 people in the small Arctic town of Talnakh, 25km north
of Norilsk, were without heating or water because of a water pipeline break.
Repairs were almost completed, an official insisted.
Inter-Tass news agency said that in Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula, only
one-third of the required heating was delivered to houses because of the
heavy debts - totalling USDollars 62m - owed to energy producers.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead expected for Western
Australian gas pipeline project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Participants in the ADollars 440m Goldfields Gas Transmission project in
Western Australia yesterday submitted final proposals to the state
government, amid indications from Mr Richard Court, the WA premier, that the
project will probably gain final ministerial approval in late-January.
The project involves building a 1,400km gas pipeline from Karratha, near
Port Hedland, through the Eastern Goldfields to Kalgoorlie. This would be
used to transport gas from the offshore fields to the mining area, and to
power projects en route. The participants in the venture are Western
Mining's Wesminco Oil subsidiary, Normandy Pipelines, which is part of
Normandy Poseidon, and BHP Minerals.
As part of the scheme, BHP plans to use a spur line to carry gas to a
newly-constructed power station that will supply its iron ore operations in
Newman. This would eliminate the need for an overhead electricity
transmission line from the Port Hedland power station to the WA town.
If the project gets the final go-ahead by end-January, it is anticipated
that the first gas deliveries should take place in the second half of 1996
to the Goldfields, with Newman coming on stream slightly earlier. Mr Colin
Barnett, the WA resource development minister, said that the pipeline was
expected to provide energy savings of anything from 15 to 50 per cent to
companies using the gas to power operations.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soyabean patent breeds
discontent - Geoff Tansey reports on latest moves in the battle for control
of tomorrow's seeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle over who will control tomorrow's seeds enters another round today
when a Canadian public interest group makes a European challenge to an
attempt to gain monopoly control of all genetically-engineered soyabean
seeds and plants.
The Rural Advancement Foundation International is supported by 17 other
non-governmental organisations from all over the world. It is opposing a
patent application at the European Patent Office by Agracetus, a
wholly-owned biotechnology subsidiary company of US multinational WR Grace &amp;
Company, the world's largest speciality chemicals company with 1993 sales
exceeding Dollars 4.4bn. Only just over 1m acres (400,000ha) of soyabeans
are grown in the European Union, but the worldwide total is about 130m
acres, nearly half in the US. The crop's value is around Dollars 27bn
annually.
The controversial patent covers all forms of genetically engineered soyabean
plants and seeds, irrespective of the genes used or the transformation
technology employed. 'A patent granting a single corporation monopoly
control over genetic research on one of the world's most important food
crops - soyabeans - is a threat to world food security, and demonstrates
that the patent system is recklessly out-of-control,' claims Patrick Mooney,
executive director of RAFI.
'The soyabean patent is technically flawed and morally unacceptable - and it
must be revoked.'
The notice of opposition, filed just days before the deadline, claims that
the patent does not meet the necessary technical criteria. RAFI argues that
it is neither novel nor non-obvious and that it contains insufficient
disclosure. It also argues on ethical and moral grounds that no company
should be given such broad-ranging monopoly rights over a plant species.
Seed companies share RAFI's concern. 'I believe it is ethically wrong,' says
Ed Dart, research and development director of Zeneca Seeds, about the
species-wide patent. 'If they have got a transformation method then they
should get a patent for that method,' he says, but not for others not
invented.
Agracetus 'intends to make non-exclusive licences broadly available at
reasonable terms', according to a company statement. It will also offer free
licences to academic or government researchers to 'ensure that publicly
funded research will proceed unaffected by this patent'. No licences have
been requested up to now according to Russ Smestad, vice-president of
Agracetus.
Dr Geoff Hawtin, director of the Rome-based International Plant Genetic
Resources Institute, is highly sceptical of such claims about the impact on
research. He is gravely concerned about species-wide patents, fearing that
they could put a stranglehold on the future development of the species
involved. Other companies or researchers would be discouraged, not just in
soyabean research, but in other crops. 'One danger I see,' he says, 'is that
investments made in genetic engineering by companies and countries through
public research will count for nothing when this type of patent is awarded.'
Such awards are likely to discourage research unless the researcher is sure
to be able to get the patent, he believes.
Mr Smestad rejects such fears, drawing a parallel with the development of
hybrid seeds, beginning with maize in the 1920s and 1930s. This helped
catalyse the conversion from a seed industry largely supported by public
breeding programmes to one supported by major, private seed companies, but
it did not stop research, he argues.
Although the initial effects of species-wide patents are likely to be felt
first in the seed industry of the developed countries, Dr Hawtin expects
them to affect developing countries too. Many of these have not recognised
patents so far but the new Gatt settlement means that many countries will
have to recognise them, he warns.
Under patent law, say RAFI, 'it is illegal for farmers to save transgenic
soyabean seed harvested on their land for replanting'. They may have to make
royalty payments. Moreover, since many developed countries prevent import of
products infringing a patent, 'in the case of transgenic soyabeans,
signatory states to the EPC (European Patent Convention) would be legally
permitted to block imports of transgenic soyabeans, or even products derived
from soyabeans (such as oil or animal feeds containing transgenic soya) if
they originated in countries that fail to recognise the patent', RAFI argues
in its opposition statement.
Agracetus counters that it is simply following similar patent strategies to
the rest of the biotechnology community. It wants patent coverage as broad
as the patent laws allow.
Overall WR Grace sees patent protection as the key stimulus to global
scientific advance and innovation. 'In countries with weak patent
protection, companies will be reluctant to invest in research and
development at the risk of having their intellectual property pirated,' said
a company official.
Agracetus has also applied for a similar soyabean patent in Canada and the
US and received a wide-ranging patent in Australia in 1992.
Opposition appears to be mounting, however, to species-wide patents. An
earlier Agracetus patent on transgenic cotton is being challenged by the US
Department of Agriculture and another, anonymous, party in the US. The
Indian government has also announced its intention of revoking the company's
cotton patent and, in Canada, RAFI is challenging the soyabean patent.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Yield curve flattens as investors shift
into longer gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK yield curve flattened yesterday as the shorter maturities came under
pressure from interest-rate jitters and investors shifted into longer
maturities.
Upbeat economic forecasts by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer,
in his Budget speech on Tuesday revived worries about an
earlier-than-expected rise in UK base rates.
'Although people were expecting an upward revision in growth forecasts, it
has highlighted the pressure which will be on the government to accept any
recommendation from the Bank of England to put rates up,' said Mr Robert
Thomas, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets.
This fuelled 'a growing fear in the market that Clarke and (Bank of England
governor Mr Eddie) George will agree to put rates up when they meet next
week', said a dealer. He reported significant selling of three, four and
five-year paper and some buying at 10-years and beyond.
The longer maturities fared better than the short end, despite - or some
said because of - the Bank's announcement that it plans to auction Pounds
2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts due 2005 next Wednesday. 'The market was
pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was not more than Pounds 2bn,' said
Mr Thomas.
The December long gilt futures contract rose by  5/16 point to 103 1/16 .
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday with short dated securities down
slightly and the long bond up in reaction to differing signals about the
extent of inflationary pressures in the economy.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 94
9/32 yielding 8.000 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
1/32 at 99, yielding 7.404 per cent.
The variance in prices led to a flattening of the yield curve, which
generally means the market is expecting an economic slowdown. But economic
data released yesterday gave mixed indications about inflation.
Afternoon trading was light as investors waited for important data on
industrial prices and jobs due out today and Friday.
Early in the morning the Commerce Department announced it was revising its
estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product upwards to 3.9 per cent
from 3.4 per cent, which sent bond prices down modestly. But later the
market reversed course after capacity utilisation figures for October were
revised downward.
Investor reaction was mixed to a report from Chicago purchasing agents that
business activity rose 67.4 per cent in November, up from 64.3 per cent in
October. Although there was a sharp increase in the 'prices paid' component
of the report, the investor reaction was divided. While some sold because on
portent of inflation, others stepped in to take advantage of rising yields.
German government bonds were lifted by a combination of factors yesterday
and the December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 91.28, up 0.42.
Bunds started the day cautiously, and in the afternoon firmness in the US
Treasury market fed into bunds.
Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody said that remarks by Mr Helmut
Schieber, Bundesbank director, on interest rates, were well received by the
market.
His remarks combined with some short covering and the cancellation of two
issues of bonds by the Treuhand in December, led to the rise in bunds.
Italian government bonds drifted in limbo late yesterday as Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, prime minister, was meeting trade unions to discuss the budget
and pension reform. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Italian government
bond was largely unchanged, drifting up from 11.99 per cent to 12.01 per
cent as the Italian market underperformed Germany, which rose.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Bonds: PepsiCo returns after six years amid
flood of issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A flood of eurobonds lit up dealers' screens yesterday with issuance in a
variety of currencies, maturities and structures.
Activity in the short-dated dollar sector was especially strong, with a
highlight being the return of PepsiCo to the market after an absence of more
than six years.
Strong demand from Europe for short-dated US dollar paper after recent rises
in interest rates, perceptions of a strengthening dollar, as well as
end-of-year concerns to complete funding programmes and what one syndicate
manager termed 'league table-itis' were among explanations offered.
In addition, with further rises in short-term US rates expected, a number of
dealers pointed to improved arbitrage opportunities for issuers seeking to
swap liabilities from fixed-rate into floating-rate dollars.
'Fundamentally, investors think it's a good time to buy short dollars and
people in the swap markets fear rates will go higher,' said Mr Denis
Kelleher, syndicate manager with Daiwa Europe.
'The pipeline has been open for some time on the arbitrage front,' said
another dealer.
'What people have realised is that US rates are going to go up. Short-dated
dollar deals are de rigueur at the moment,' said another trader.
PepsiCo's issue of Dollars 250m of three-year bonds - which carried a spread
over the equivalent US Treasury of 24 basis points - followed an issue by
Walt Disney earlier this week and is to some extent part of a trend as the
credit quality of US corporates improves.
Syndicate managers at Morgan Stanley, which brought the issue, said US
companies could cut borrowing costs by between 5 and 10 basis points by
turning to the euromarkets and many were keen to diversify their borrowing
sources.
The issue was the first of a new Dollars 2bn euro medium-term note (EMTN)
programme for PepsiCo.
Another large deal in the dollar sector was a Dollars 350m three-year issue
by Carco Auto Loan Master Trust, a financing subsidiary of Chrysler, the US
motor company. The issue, backed by loans issued by motor dealers, carried a
spread of 37 basis points over the equivalent US Treasury, and was brought
by CSFB and Salomon Brothers. The yield spread widened marginally when the
bonds were were freed to trade.
Swiss Bank Corporation brought another asset-backed transaction - a Dollars
150m floating-rate note issued by Crystal Castle Euro-Finance, a special
purpose company which will purchase trade receivables from Italy's Cremonini
Group, an integrated food company. The issue was guaranteed by Financial
Security Assurance, the US insurer.
CEZ Finance, the Czech state-owned electricity company, made its expected
debut with a Dollars 150m five-year issue. The deal - the first by an east
European corporate - met a positive response, with the yield spread over the
equivalent US Treasury tightening from 110 to 108 when the bonds were freed
to trade.
JP Morgan, which led the deal, said spreads on two other outstanding Czech
issues - by the Czech National Bank and the City of Prague - have both
narrowed since their launch.
Distribution of CEZ's paper, which is rated BBB- with a positive outlook,
was broadly-based with 35 per cent placed in Asia, 15 per cent in the US and
50 per cent in Europe.
Elsewhere, both Ireland and Argentina tapped the yen sector. Merrill Lynch
International brought a 10-year Y30bn issue for Ireland and Daiwa Europe
arranged a Y12.5bn five-year issue for Argentina.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: CFTC to take tough stance on
fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will insist all US futures
exchanges prove within the next 45 days that they can meet fraud detection
guidelines. It will also press ahead with plans to comply with more
stringent trade-tracking requirements by an October 1995 deadline set by
Congress.
In a report to Congress released on Tuesday, the agency, which regulates US
futures exchanges, took a tough stand. It said that while a number of
exchanges, including the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, claimed they could meet existing trade-tracking rules, CFTC
inspections showed that they fell short of requirements.
Evidence of trading abuses in Chicago trading pits uncovered by a Federal
criminal investigation in 1989 prompted Congress to require better trade
auditing procedures. This year, exchanges must be able to track trades
within one minute of execution with 90 per cent accuracy.
Although the Chicago exchanges have upgraded trade-tracking procedures since
1989, most of their efforts at audit trail improvements have focused on
developing an expensive high-tech trading card which they say is still four
years from being operational.
Mrs Mary Schapiro, who chairs the CFTC, told Congress her agency would not
tolerate the delay, and would require exchanges to use alternative
procedures to upgrade audit trail standards to 1995 levels while developing
the electronic trading card.

Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), the partially-privatised company which is
India's leading producer of electricity generation equipment, saw a 46 per
cent rise in net profits during the first half of its financial year, scored
on record sales.
Net profits in the six months to end-September totalled Rs327.5m (Dollars
10.4m) compared with Rs223.3m a year earlier on sales of Rs13.79bn, against
Rs10.89bn. At the gross level, profits were Rs1.06bn, up from Rs911.9m.
BHEL said it had secured orders worth Rs25.90bn for the supply of power
plant equipment, industrial products and services in the six-month period.
The company said it had won some prestigious orders in spite of the
'turbulent market situation', taking its total outstanding orders in excess
of Rs80bn.
The orders include a Rs1.14bn export contract for gas turbines from the
Electricity Corporation of Saudi Arabia, which BHEL won in the face of
competition from European and American multinationals.
The company has also secured a World Bank-funded contract for the supply of
shunt reactors to Nigeria as well as some large domestic orders.
A spokesman said the company had shifted its focus to the non-power sector,
which accounted for 46 per cent of the company's turnover in 1993-94
compared with 27 per cent in 1986-87.
The state-run company had its shares listed on the Bombay stock exchange
after 38 per cent of its equity was sold to employees and select financial
institutions.
Voltas, one of India's leading manufacturers of home appliances and
compressors, and part of the Tata group, the country's largest business
house, announced an increase of 166 per cent in net profits to Rs94.10m in
the six months to September 1994, compared with Rs35.30m for the
corresponding period last year. Net revenues advanced to Rs5.55bn from
Rs4.58bn.
India's Century Textiles, part of the Birla group of companies reported a
net profit of Rs567.8m for the six months to September 1994, an increase of
6.1 per cent over last year's Rs535.37m. Net sales rose to Rs6.45bn from
Rs5.74bn.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Caltex and Ampol may merge
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Pioneer International, the Australian building materials group, announced
yesterday that it was in talks with Caltex Australia, whose ultimate joint
owners are Chevron and Texaco, the US oil companies, about the possible
merger of the groups' petroleum refining and marketing operations.
Pioneer International owns the Ampol petroleum business in Australia.
Speculation that the two groups would combine these operations has
circulated for some time. They are the two smallest groups in the
five-company retail petroleum market, and competitive pressures in the
sector have been strong. If the deal proceeds, the merged operation would be
larger than that of Shell Australia, the existing leader in this market.
Both companies said that no agreement had yet been reached and that
'discussions are progressing . . . to examine the various issues involved'.
However, news of the talks brought speedy intervention by the Trade
Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog.
The TPC said it would make preliminary inquiries to ascertain whether the
merger would be anti-competitive, and if so, whether public benefit would
outweigh this detriment.
Both Caltex Australia and Pioneer's Ampol division have seen profits
squeezed recently by falling oil prices, deteriorating refiner margins and
retail petrol discounting.
In the year to end-June, Pioneer's petroleum division reported static sales
of ADollars 2.83bn, while operating profits fell from ADollars 194.1m to
ADollars 143.8m (USDollars 109.2m). However, at the time of those results,
the company also predicted a better outcome in 1994-95.
In the six months to end June, Caltex Australia saw profits of ADollars
19.8m after tax, down from ADollars 35.4m, while sales dipped from ADollars
1.71bn to ADollars 1.66bn.

<TEXT>
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has amended its corporate reporting rules so
that all companies listed on the exchange's main board have to announce
their annual results three months from their financial year-end instead of
six months currently, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
The exchange said in a statement that this was to allow investors to make
better investment decisions and enhance transparency. Companies which do not
provide their results within the specified time may be suspended until the
results are ready for release, the exchange said.
The KLSE also said it would make it easier for companies to transfer from
the exchange's second board to the main board by relaxing one requirement.
It said it would remove the need for companies to issue detailed
introductory circulars, which are a document second-board companies have to
release to inform the public of their transition to the main board.
The changes take effect from the year ending December 31 1995.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Uphill struggle to drum up
interest in property - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance it is difficult to see why derivative financial products
based on a property index have never captured the attention of investors.
Property is the most illiquid institutional asset class. As a result,
investors find it difficult to make tactical asset allocations into property
at the right point in the economic cycle.
At the start of this year, for example, institutional investors were eager
to buy UK property. Yet many could not find suitable investments.
Property index-linked bonds or futures would, in theory, solve these
problems and allow institutions to gain quick exposure to property.
Owning and managing a building is also far more complex than owning an
equity or a bond.
Property company shares are are no answer because there is little
correlation between the performance of the quoted property sector and the
performance of the underlying property market.
Index derivatives might offer smaller investment institutions a way of
including property in their investment portfolios without the hassle of
owning buildings.
Yet the recent history of property derivatives is not encouraging. In 1991,
the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) admitted that its property
futures contract was manipulated to inflate trading volume.
In practice it seems that investment institutions are not that interested in
such products.
The failure of the Fox futures contract was all the more worrying because it
was at least based on a widely recognised property index.
The Investment Property Databank index is based on valuation data provided
by investment institutions and covers about 75 per cent of all UK investment
property.
Many other countries are years away from having a similarly robust index,
although IPD is now working with Dutch investors to that end.
However, the experience of Fox suggests that the conservatism of
institutions is a big hurdle to the creation of a liquid market even where a
reliable property index is available.
A survey of UK institutional investors by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors,
found that only 22 per cent were actively interested in new innovations in
property derivatives.
A further 20 per cent said they would use property derivatives, but only
once the market has become established.
Disappointingly, 43 per cent of the respondents would only participate
selectively even in an established market, and 15 per cent were generally
not interested at all in such instruments.
The findings show why drumming up interest in property derivatives has been
an uphill struggle, even in countries such as the UK with a reliable index.
Earlier this year, Barclays Bank took the initiative and issued property
index certificates (Pics) - essentially bonds linked to the IPD index. The
instruments helped the bank hedge a portion of its own property portfolio.
Although the issue came after the flow of institutional funds into property
had subsided, the bank managed to sell Pounds 150m of Pics.
The JLW survey found that almost half of the investment institutions which
decided not to buy Pics declined because they expected to beat the IPD index
with their own holdings of direct property, whereas the instrument offered a
return in line with the index.
This finding underlines that the 'stock-picking' attitude among property
investors is very strong. Since no two properties are alike, it is perhaps
not surprising that most investors have relied on their stock selection
skills. The modest success of PICs offered a glimmer of hope to supporters
of property derivatives, but it may take a wider cultural change before a
truly liquid market can be created.

Metropolitan Life, the South African life assurer controlled by the
recently-listed black investment group New Africa Investments, saw total
income advance by 20 per cent to R1.67bn (Dollars 472.3m) in the year to
September and is increasing its total dividend.
The improvement resulted from a combination of a rise in investment income,
15 per cent higher at R452.5m, and a 22 per cent improvement in premium
income to R1.22bn.
Attributable income also rose by 22 per cent to R86.5m, up from R70.8m a
year ago.
The directors have declared a final dividend of 53.5 cents a share, which
raises the total dividend for the year to 83 cents, up 24 per cent from the
previous year's 67 cents.
Total assets increased by 29 per cent to R7.38bn from R5.73bn.
Metlife has also published, for the first time, a statement of actuarial
values of assets and liabilities, which show a surplus of R1.86bn, up 36 per
cent from last year.
Mr Marius Smith, managing director, said the company remained focused on
recurring premium business, which constitutes close to 92 per cent of the
total, but he added that he expected an increase in new business over the
coming year.

<TEXT>
The way was cleared yesterday for the sale of Aerospace Technologies of
Australia, the aircraft component manufacturer, to the private sector after
legislation was passed in the federal parliament in Canberra.
The company, which was born out of the former Government Aircraft Factories
and constituted as a government business enterprise in 1986, is currently
wholly-owned by the federal government. Its main business is as a components
supplier to the big aircraft manufacturers, like Boeing or McDonnell
Douglas, although it also has a service role in the local aviation market.
The potential privatisation was announced a year ago, and expressions of
interest closed this month. The government has said it would prefer to sell
ATA as a whole, but a piecemeal approach may be considered. It is hoped a
deal can be finalised early next year.
In 1992-93, ATA notched up exports of over ADollars 130m.

Tokyo Securities, a medium-sized stockbroker, announced yesterday that it
had punished some of its most senior executives over a Y32bn (Dollars 324m)
extraordinary loss incurred in unauthorised trading of US Treasury bonds and
forward foreign exchange contracts.
The broker said that a managing director, Mr Yukio Sugimura, would retire
early, while one of his colleagues, Mr Masaru Fujita, would be demoted to
director. Similar punishment had been dealt to other responsible personnel,
a company spokesman said. The unnamed individual directly responsible for
the losses had already been disciplined.
In addition, all members of the board of directors are to have their pay cut
by between 5 per cent and 30 per cent for an unspecified period starting
from this month.
The company reported last month that it had suffered a special loss of
Y32bn, a sum equivalent to almost its entire annual operating revenues, and
representing more than one-third of its shareholders' equity.
The cost to the company is reflected in its forecast for the current
financial year to the end of next March. It expects to report an after-tax
loss of Y32.5bn, compared with a profit of Y7.6bn last year.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: CRA closes Port Kembla refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group, and its partners in the Southern Copper
consortium, announced yesterday that they had decided to close the refinery
and smelter at Port Kembla, in New South Wales.
The move was foreshadowed a month ago, when CRA, which holds a 60 per cent
interest in the project, said it would not support an upgrade of the
facility unless a new partner was brought in to reduce 'substantially' its
stake. The other two existing partners in Southern Copper are Japanese -
Furukawa with 30 per cent, and Nissho Iwai with 10 per cent.
The plant has seen strike action recently, with employees protesting at job
cuts. But CRA said the closure decision was based on consistently poor
financial performance since 1991, a bleak short-term outlook, and the
reluctance of shareholders to support further capital expenditure needed for
environmental upgrading.
It added that during a period of care and maintenance, efforts to find a new
equity partner would continue. The plant employs around 440 people.

<TEXT>
Net profit at Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), the overseas arm of
Telefonica de Espana, Spain's state-run telecommunications group, rose to
Pta15.51bn (Dollars 118.9m) in the first nine months, up 47 per cent
compared with the same period a year ago, agencies report.
Earnings benefited from a 73 per cent rise in revenue from investments, to
Pta28.59bn.
The company said its recently merged Peruvian units, CPT-Peru and
Entel-Peru, posted a 24 per cent rise in revenue from a year earlier, with
operating profit up 80 per cent, but did not provide details.
Telefonica also cited the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Telefonica Peru,
the group which controls a 35 per cent stake in the merged CPT-Peru and
Entel-Peru, to each of its Peruvian partners Banco Wiese and Grupo Grana y
Montero, for Dollars 200m.
It said revenue from its Venezuelan unit CANTV fell slightly.
Profits climbed 10.5 per cent to Dollars 193m at its Cia de Telefonos de
Chile unit, while its Telefonica de Argentina unit posted a 26 per cent
increase in profit to Dollars 392m.
The company also said that Telefonica Internacional had acquired a 20 per
cent stake in Telecommunicaciones y Sistemas SA of Argentina, which provides
communications services to large clients.
At the end of the third quarter the companies in which the international arm
has stakes managed more than 7m telephone lines, while their cellular
telephone operations had 271,536 clients and the cable activities 49,768.
Earlier this month Telefonica de Espana announced a 17 per cent rise in
consolidated net profit in the first nine months to Pta86.61bn from
Pta73.72bn.
Pre-tax profit climbed 11 per cent to Pta104.65bn from Pta94.68bn.
The growth in net profit was attributable to the declining corporate tax
burden, which is currently about 17 per cent of profit.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Slow winds of change blow among
China's banks - Banks are trying to free themselves from state control but
barriers remain and progress has been varied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wang Qiren, chairman of the Bank of China, uses a colourful metaphor to
describe the predicament of Chinese specialised banks in their efforts to
commercialise their activities and free themselves from pervasive state
control.
'We can't continue to behave like the People's Bank (China's central bank),
throwing meat to dogs which can't be retrieved,' he says of persistent
demands for loans from state enterprises struggling to stay alive.
Twelve months after the Communist party's central committee approved
sweeping reforms of the financial sector, including measures to facilitate
the transformation of debt-burdened specialised banks into commercial
entities, debate among Chinese bankers and their foreign advisers is
focusing more sharply on both barriers to reform and opportunities for
change.
Mr Gordon Barrass, international adviser with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accounting firm, believes real change is stirring among hitherto moribund
state financial institutions.
'I have been impressed with the change in culture at some of the specialised
banks, but they have got a monumental task,' said Mr Barrass, who recently
completed a study of Chinese banking.
China's 'Big Four' specialised banks account for about 80 per cent of the
country's banking business, but because they have been obliged to continue
funding ailing state enterprises they have accumulated a huge burden of what
the Chinese call 'problem' loans. These 'non-performing' loans, by western
measures, may account for up to 30 per cent of loan portfolios.
An indication of the size of the problem is that of total state bank loans
outstanding at the end of 1993 of Yn2,600 trillion, more than 70 per cent
was for working capital. The banks are therefore acting as welfare agencies
to keep enterprises afloat.
Chinese banks' burden of bad loans renders three of the four specialised
banks technically insolvent - the Bank of China being the exception. As Mr
Wang puts it: 'We really have to pull out the firewood from under the pot,
we just can't keep burning any more.'
State enterprise reform, including the merger or closure of factories beyond
salvaging, is critical to the banks' commercial transformation, but this
requires political will. In the present climate of inflation, uncertainty
over the transition to a new generation of leaders and incipient worker
unrest, the authorities are approaching change with great caution.
The state enterprises' burden - some 45 per cent of China's 11,000
medium-to-large state companies are in the red this year - also makes its
virtually impossible to liberalise interest rates.
Chinese officials say any substantial increase would be extremely harmful
for state enterprises. Interest on bank deposits is about half the inflation
rate.
In spite of the barriers, however, the face of Chinese banking is changing
slowly.
A new commercial bank law will, in theory, provide legal protection against
banks being obliged to make 'policy' loans to failing enterprises; new
policy-lending banks will shoulder the burden of funding to state projects;
new commercial banks are being licensed and some urban and rural
co-operatives are being transformed into banks; and moves are under way to
allow foreign banks to engage in local currency business.
Attempts are also being made to strengthen the People's Bank's supervisory
role over the banking sector under a new central bank law.
Among its main tasks will be to try to ensure provincial-level bank branches
adhere to credit ceilings and abide by regulations laid down by the central
authorities. Local branches of the specialised banks have tended to bend to
the will of provincial officials rather than follow directives from Beijing.
In tandem with requirements aimed at bringing order to a chaotic system the
four specialised banks will have to begin putting their own houses in order.
While a start has been made, progress varies markedly from one to another:
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - the country's largest, with
500,000 employees and 50,000 branches - almost certainly faces the most
difficult task in 'commercialising' its activities. Officials note the bank
numbers China's top 500 state-owned-enterprises among its clients, but given
the parlous condition of many of these enterprises this is hardly a bonus.
The ICBC is said to be facing a 'generational split' between younger
officials who favour quicker steps towards commercialisation and an older
generation who believe the bank should remain close to the ministry of
finance and state planning commission.
The Agricultural Bank of China (500,000 employees and 50,000 branches) is in
better shape than the ICBC, partly because of the success of township and
village enterprises (TVEs). These are providing a huge volume of deposits.
The ABC has also divested responsibilities for policy lending in agriculture
to the newly-established Agricultural Development Bank. As an inducement it
transferred one-fifth of its assets to the new policy bank. The ABC has also
reportedly embarked on a tougher approach by refusing new lending to the
more recalcitrant creditors among state enterprises.
The People's Construction Bank of China (250,000 employees and 25,000
branches) is regarded as being in the best position among the three
'domestic' specialised banks to commercialise. The recent establishment of
the State Development Bank to handle infrastructure lending for big projects
such as the Three Gorges Dam has left the PCB looking for a new role. The
bank's recent announcement that it was joining Morgan Stanley to form
China's first investment bank is an indication of this. The new institution,
to be known as the China International Capital Corporation Limited, will
focus on capital raising abroad to satisfy China's huge appetite for
infrastructure funds.
The Bank of China (170,000 employees, 8,000 branches and outlets in China
and 474 offices abroad) says it aims to expand its overseas activities. In
Hong Kong the Bank of China and its subsidiaries have 24 per cent of the
market and it has begun issuing banknotes in preparation for a post-1997
role. The Bank of China is also developing its merchant banking arm.
Mr Wang says the removal of the contraints of a centrally-planned economy is
allowing the Bank of China to explore expansion at home and abroad.
'The direction we want to go is to commercialise,' he says. 'We will enjoy
greater independence (under the new commercial bank law) but we will remain
a state-owned commercial bank and that means we will have to support state
lending priorities in such areas as transportation and energy.'
While attention has focused on the difficulties of reforming China's vast,
unwieldy specialised banks, progress is being made in other areas. The
Shanghai-based Bank of Communications (BOC), for example, has been preparing
to expand its activities, and possibly sell some its stock to private
shareholders.
The BOC, re-constituted in 1986 as a joint stock company with the People's
Bank and Shanghai Municipality as its main shareholders (it was merged with
the People's Bank in 1949), recently created a unified shareholding
structure to facilitate the stock sale. Previously its ownership had rested
on a web of joint stock companies.
With its stronghold in the fast growing Shanghai and Yangtze Delta area, the
BOC's prospects are good. It also has powerful friends at court. Mr Dai
Xianglong, a deputy-governor of the People's Bank, is a former head of the
BOC.
Other small to medium-sized commercial banks are also beginning to make
their presence felt. The China International Trust and Investment
Corporation bank (Citic Industrial) ranks sixth among banks in China, and is
regarded as having significant growth potential. Everbright Bank, owned by
the Everbright Group, one of China's new industrial and trading
conglomerates, is in the same category.
Mr Tang Gong Yao, chairman of Everbright Bank, said the bank was keen to
expand and had established branches in six cities and representative offices
in others. It was involved in loan syndications, leasing deals, securities
underwriting and foreign exchange trading. These activities were expanding
rapidly.
China has also announced the establishment of the first private bank to be
permitted since the 1949 revolution. This will be known as the 'People's
Livelihood Bank' and will cater for private business whose access to credit
from state-owned banks is limited.
As for foreign bankers, they are waiting for the moment when foreign
branches are authorised to begin dealing in the local currency. This is the
'holy grail' for foreign banks which have established more than 100
branches, most of them in Shanghai, since China sanctioned the first foreign
branches in 1986.
Mr Fiepko Klug, chief representative in China of Banque Indosuez, believes
permission will be granted in the next year or so on an 'experimental
basis', with yuan loans tied to the ratio of a bank's yuan deposits.
But Mr Klug fears the authorities may allow just a few selected banks into
the market first. 'It would be very unfair if it was done selectively,' he
says. 'It would create a distortion among foreign banks. It would give rise
to unfair competition.'
But if China follows its normal pattern of initial gradualism in reforms it
may well restrict to a handful the numbers of foreign banks allowed to deal
in local currency. Banking reform linked inextricably with state enterprise
reform is proving to be a slow and painful process.

Bank of Nova Scotia

<TEXT>
Bank of Nova Scotia suffered a one-third drop in fiscal 1994 earnings, due
to one-time charges stemming mainly from its forays into the trust and
securities businesses.
But the bank, which has the most extensive international operations among
Canada's big six banks, posted record fourth-quarter earnings. Profits for
the year would have been at an all-time high were it not for the
restructuring charge.
The strong underlying performance was reflected in a two-cent increase in
the quarterly dividend to 31 cents.
Net earnings for the year fell to CDollars 482m (USDollars 349.7m), or
CDollars 1.76 a share, from CDollars 714m, or CDollars 2.98. Excluding the
charges, income rose 10.2 per cent to CDollars 787m. The charges stemmed
mainly from the purchase earlier this year of Montreal Trust, and
accelerated amortisation of goodwill at Scotia-McLeod, the securities firm
acquired in 1988.
Fourth-quarter income grew to CDollars 205m, or 81 cents a share, from
CDollars 194m, or 80 cents. Return on equity slipped from 14.9 to 14 per
cent. Loan-loss provisions for the year rose to CDollars 567m from CDollars
465m. Non-performing loans shrank 25 per cent to CDollars 1.6bn.
The bank also said that Mr Peter Godsoe, currently chief executive and
president, is to become chairman in place of Mr CE Ritchie. Mr Godsoe
remains chief executive.

<TEXT>
Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, reported a strong third
quarter due to a bigger contribution from Du Pont, the US chemicals group in
which it has a 25 per cent stake, and higher spirits and wines income.
Net profit was USDollars 199m, or 53 cents a share, after Du Pont dividends
and unremitted earnings. In the 1993 period, Seagram posted a loss of
Dollars 100m, or 27 cents, after taking its share of Du Pont's special
charges.
Spirits and wines produced operating income of Dollars 193m, up from Dollars
181m a year earlier, and most brands gained market share, said Mr Edgar
Bronfman Jr, president. Profits rose in all areas except Latin America, and
the US and Asia-Pacific were up sharply.
But Tropicana, the juice business, contributed less because of aggressive
competition and the cost of international expansion.
Sales and other income from the drinks business totalled Dollars 1.51bn
against Dollars 1.47bn.
The third quarter includes a Dollars 35m charge related to the company's
continuing re-engineering program.
Seagram's nine-month net profit was Dollars 545m, or Dollars 1.46 a share,
against Dollars 232m, or 62 cents, after the special Du Pont charges in the
same 1993 period. The drinks business had sales of Dollars 4.17bn against
Dollars 4.05bn.

General Magic, the US multimedia communications software company, has added
five new partners to its technology alliance.
Cable and Wireless of the UK, Northern Telecom of Canada and Mitsubishi, Oki
and Sanyo of Japan have each taken a small minority stake in General Magic,
bringing the total shareholding of alliance partners to about 50 per cent.
The new partners will license General Magic's software, called Telescript,
which enables users of personal computers and personal digital assistants to
send 'intelligent agents' into a communications network to deliver messages,
retrieve information or shop.
General Magic said that the new partnerships were further step toward
establishing its technology as a worldwide standard for multimedia
communications.
General Magic's existing partners include AT&amp;T, which recently launched its
PersonaLink network using General Magic software, as well as Apple Computer,
France Telecom, Fujitsu, Motorola, NTT, Philips and Toshiba.
The new General Magic partners plan to develop products and services based
on Telescript and General Magic's Magicap user interface software.
Cable &amp; Wireless said it would develop multimedia services for users of its
global digital network.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: US machine-tool group acquires
Krupp Hoesch unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cincinnati Milacron, the big US machine-tool and plastics machinery
manufacturer, has announced its biggest European acquisition with the DM150m
(Dollars 95m) purchase of Krupp Widia from Krupp Hoesch, the German steel
and engineering group.
The purchase, for DM113m cash and the assumption of DM37m of debt, marks
another expansion of Milacron's sales in industrial consumable products,
following its Dollars 80m purchase in 1992 of the US company Valenite.
Essen-based Krupp Widia is Europe's second-biggest producer - after Sandvik
of Sweden - of metal-cutting tooling, used mainly on machine tools. Its
range includes carbide inserts, insert holders, carbide dies and wear parts,
and magnets.
The deal comes two months after Sandvik withdrew from the proposed purchase
of most of Krupp Widia, after the German cartel office said the Swedish
group would gain too strong a position in certain product segments on the
German market.
Krupp Widia's sales this year are estimated at about Dollars 250m, with
about 15 per cent in India and most of the rest in Europe.
The deal will include Widia (India), in which Krupp Widia has a 51 per cent
stake.
Milacron said the deal should push its annual revenues to more than Dollars
1.5bn next year and add 'a solid profit contribution in 1996'. Its sales in
1993 were Dollars 1bn.
Mr Mike Claybaugh, Milacron's group vice-president for machine tools, said
the deal would lift sales of the industrial products business from about
one-third to more than 40 per cent of total sales.
This would further reduce the US company's exposure to the more cyclical
machine tools and plastics machinery markets.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hungary delays decision on hotel
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's privatisation authorities have postponed a decision on the
controversial sale of its last remaining state-owned hotel chain. This
follows the failure to meet yesterday's deadline for agreement with the top
bidder.
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US company which outbid its
nearest rival by more than 20 per cent, was last week close to signing a
deal to acquire 51 per cent of HungarHotels when it was asked to raise its
bid by another 20 per cent.
The two sides were unable to reach a compromise during further negotiations
this week.
The sudden price increase, which came after local pressure to ignore the
tender, has led investment advisers to doubt the government's willingness to
sell the group. It also puts into question its commitment to privatisation
at a time when it is budgeting for Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn in privatisation
revenues over the next two years.
The State Property Agency (SPA), which is handling the sale, said yesterday
it was considering re-opening talks with other bidders for the chain over
the next two weeks. The other main contender for HungarHotels, which owns 15
hotels, is Intercontinental, the Japanese-owned international hotel chain.
However, the SPA also hinted it might cancel the sale, which is only the
second significant privatisation since the socialist-led government took
office in July.
Mr Gabor Halmi, SPA deputy managing director, said: 'This is a high-value
company. It is not a company we need to sell quickly and it is not a problem
for us if we don't sell it now.'
A cancellation of the tender would be a victory for the social security
fund, which has campaigned against the deal. The fund, which is backed by
powerful trade unions, is pressing the government to meet obligations to
transfer state assets of Ft300bn (Dollars 2.7bn) to it and other related
funds by handing over the hotel group.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hoechst cautious despite growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, wants to almost double the return on
capital from its core European industrial divisions, Mr Jurgen Dormann,
chairman, said yesterday.
Mr Dormann reported pre-tax profits up 83 per cent to DM1.69bn (Dollars
1.1bn) in the nine months to September 30, and forecast a further strong
earnings rise for 1995. However, he said further rationalisation was needed.
Restructuring costs and provisions this year would reduce earnings by about
DM1bn.
European industrial operations, which embrace all sectors except
pharmaceuticals and agricultural products, had returned to profit this year
after losing DM600m at the operating level in 1993 on sales of DM13.5bn.
'But we are still far away from acceptable return on equity. Our goal is to
get a net return of 15 per cent,' said Mr Dormann. In the meantime, the
company aimed to regain by 1996 the ground lost in the recession. According
to Mr Dormann, operating earnings from the industrial businesses shrank by
DM2bn between 1990 and 1993.
While stressing that the job cuts of the past few years were almost at an
end - the group has spent DM2bn on redundancy schemes and other provisions
to reduce its payroll by 17 per cent since 1991 - he said the group's cost
and structural problems were still not resolved.
Co-operative ventures such as the recent deal to merge the textile dyes
operations of Hoechst and Bayer were one way forward.
Mr Dormann, who recently said the aim of his restructuring project was to
double the group's stock market value by the end of the century, gave a
bullish view of current conditions.
The three-year decline in chemicals prices seemed to be over, and a rise in
Hoechst's average selling prices in the third quarter had cancelled out
declines in the first half.
Volume sales were also rising and had climbed 7 per cent in the three months
to the end of September, bringing to 5 per cent the aggregate for the
nine-month review period.
Turnover rose 8 per cent to DM36.4bn, with almost DM20bn coming from Europe.
In the US, where the chemicals industry was working at the limits of its
capacity, the Hoechst Celanese subsidiary had lifted turnover 15 per cent to
Dollars 5.5bn.
Total US turnover rose only 5 per cent, partly because of difficulties in
the pharmaceuticals market, including the expiry of Hoechst Roussel Pharma's
patent on its biggest seller, DiaBeta.
US operations have also been disrupted by the need to make provisions
against claims from householders whose water supplies have been disrupted by
defective pipes supplied by Hoechst Celanese.
Mr Dormann said claims for damages were also expected following the recall
of two drugs from the Copley generics business.

Matsushita Electronics Corporation, the Japanese electronics group, is to
acquire the picture tube factory of Nokia Consumer Electronics in Esslingen,
Germany.
The price is not being disclosed. Nokia, the Finland-based cellular
telephones, consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment
manufacturer, had said earlier this year that it intended to withdraw from
the picture tube manufacturing business, closing its Esslingen and Straubing
factories by the end of 1994.
Matsushita plans to refurbish the facility to manufacture up to 2m tubes a
year in Germany. It already makes 2.4m a year at its factories in the US,
1.2m in Malaysia and 2.6m in China. The German facility will deliver colour
tubes to Matsushita's factories and to other television manufacturers in
Europe.
Panasonic, Matsushita's consumer electronics brand, currently takes picture
tubes in Europe from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telmex seeks 49% stake in
cable-TV business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's monopoly telephone company, has
agreed to take a 49 per cent stake in the cable television subsidiary of
Televisa, the country's dominant media company, for Dollars 211m.
The proposed agreement would enable Cablevision, the cable arm of Televisa,
to use Telmex's fibre-optic cables to expand its subscription television
service. In turn, it would help Telmex move into video and data telephony.
The venture would not be an exclusive arrangement, with other television
companies able to use Telmex cables.
In practice, however, the alliance would remove a potential competitor to
Telmex in the local and long-distance telephone service, and give
Cable-vision a significant edge over its competitors in subscription
television.
Legal questions have been raised about the alliance, given that Telmex's
concession explicitly prohibits it from exploiting 'directly or indirectly,
any concession for public television services'.
Nevertheless, Telmex argues that this provision does not prevent it from
carrying Cablevision's signal on its network. It is confident that
regulatory approval will be given, arguing the link-up would help it and
Televisa compete against planned broadcasting and telecommunications joint
ventures between local and foreigner groups.
Telmex, with sales last year of Dollars 7.9bn, is by far Mexico's largest
private company. Grupo Televisa, with sales of Dollars 1.9bn, owns the
country's principal television networks, as well as Cablevision, which has
220,000 subscribers.
The two companies are respectively controlled by Mr Carlos Slim and Mr
Emilio Azcarraga, Mexico's two richest businessmen according to Forbes
magazine.
The competition commission has formal power to block mergers or alliances
that it believes could lead to monopolistic behaviour. However, even if it
wanted to prevent the venture, it may find it difficult to rule against Mr
Slim and Mr Azcarraga, two generous contributors to Mexico's long-ruling
party whose combined net worth is reported by Forbes at more than Dollars
10bn.
Telmex's move into Cable-vision was welcomed by analysts, who are concerned
about the company's prospects when the long-distance telephone market opens
up to competition in 1997. Earlier this month, Telmex's stock price fell
sharply after AT&amp;T, the big US telecommunications concern, announced it had
agreed a joint venture with Alfa, an industrial conglomerate, to provide
long-distance telephone services in Mexico.
Over the long term, the Telmex-Televisa venture is expected to increase
usage of Telmex's new 13,500km fibre-optic network, as Cablevision uses it
to send television signals throughout the country. Cablevision's current
concession is limited to Mexico City, but analysts are optimistic this will
be extended to cover the whole country. The use of Telmex's network will
reduce installation time and costs for Cablevision, enabling it to reduce
prices and broaden its subscriber base.
The transaction would help reduce Televisa's heavy net debt load of Dollars
1.15bn. It is not expected to affect Telmex's earnings over the short term,
with the purchase value just 8.4 per cent of Telmex's expected cash flow for
this year.

Apple Computer, AT&amp;T, IBM and Siemens yesterday announced plans to work
together to encourage the adoption of technical specifications that will
improve the compatibility of computer and telephone systems.
The companies said their goal was to identify, develop and promote open
technical specifications for data communications among a variety of devices
such as personal computers, personal digital assistants, telephones and
private branch exchanges.
'The revolution promised by the convergence of telecommunications and
computing will not reach its full potential unless our industries agree to
open, interoperable standards that make using a PDA, telephone and notebook
computer together as easy as turning on the different components of a stereo
system,' said Ms Ellen Hancock, senior vice-president of IBM.
The group initiative, called Versit, will become a forum for establishing
technical specifications, the companies said.
The group is 'small enough to get things done, but large and diverse enough
to make an impact,' said Ms Hancock.
Versit will work with other communication and computer companies, as well as
standards organisations. It is not clear, however, whether Versit will win
the support of other companies such as Intel and Microsoft that play a
central role in establishing de facto standards in the computer and data
communications industries.
Although presented as a neutral body that will further the objectives of the
computer and telephone industries, Versit will inevitably be controversial
because differing technical specifications are often competitive issues. It
is also uncertain whether Versit will be able to persuade other companies to
co-operate in widely licensing their technologies to create standard
specifications.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd net surges to Fl 43m
for quarter

<TEXT>
Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, posted a net profit of Fl 43m (Dollars
25m) in the third quarter, up sharply from a F l7m loss a year earlier, when
results were burdened by extraordinary charges of Fl 44m.
The results, at the high end of analysts' expectations, would have been even
better but for the weakness of the US dollar, the currency used in shipping
contracts.
Group turnover fell slightly, to Fl 1.66bn from Fl 1.68bn. However, on a
comparable basis, taking into account the dollar's decline and corporate
divestments, turnover rose by nearly 5 per cent in the period, Nedlloyd
said.
In shipping, operating profit fell to Fl 24m from Fl 37m. In road haulage,
operating profit rose to Fl 23m from Fl 12m, extending the strong trend that
emerged in the second quarter.
The third-quarter figures take net profit for the first nine months to Fl
78m, reversing the Fl 123m loss in the same period of 1993.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: PowerGen wins tender to buy
plant in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PowerGen, the UK electricity generator, said yesterday it had won an
international tender to negotiate the purchase of the first Hungarian power
plant to come up for privatisation.
It said it hoped to complete negotiations for the Csepel power plant, an
independent power producer, by the end of the year.
The acquisition price has not been disclosed. However, PowerGen is believed
to be considering investing up to Dollars 100m on top of the purchase price
to upgrade the plant and construct a combined-cycle gas turbine generator at
Csepel.
The existing gas-fired plant, located on an island on the Danube on the
outskirts of Budapest, has installed electricity capacity of 43MW and 400MW
in thermal energy.
It was built to service an industrial park and 12,000 households on the
island.
PowerGen said the plant's proximity to Budapest and its population of 2.5m
electricity users made it an attractive acquisition.
Under plans announced this week, Hungary aims to privatise a large part of
MVM, its electricity monopoly, mainly through sales to western strategic
investors over the next two years.
Deregulation and increased competition in the sector will widen the scope
for independent power producers, such as the Csepel plant.
PowerGen, which began talks with the Hungarian privatisation authorities
last February, is believed to have beaten competition from Germany, France
and Belgium in the tender.
It said it hoped that the Csepel acquisition would strengthen its position
ahead of expected intense competition for stakes in MVM companies next year.
Several of the UK's regional electricity companies are also looking for
diversification opportunities in Hungary and other former communist
countries.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sanderson Electronics ahead 27% to Pounds
4.23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanderson Electronics, the computer software and hardware company which is
also the sponsor of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, yesterday reported a
27 per cent increase in full-year profits, helped by acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 rose from Pounds 3.33m to Pounds
4.23m on turnover up 44 per cent to Pounds 34m (Pounds 23.6m).
Earnings per share increased to 7.3p (6.3p).
Sanderson paid a first interim dividend of 1.35p in February and second
interim dividend of 1.5p in July, making 2.85p (2.48p) for the year. The
company said yesterday it would pay a first interim dividend of 1.6p in
February. The shares closed up 2p at 86p.
Sanderson, which has expanded to 15 offices in the UK as well as operations
in Australia, New Zealand and east Asia, reported operating profits of
Pounds 4.31m (Pounds 3.59m) while interest costs fell to Pounds 82,000
(Pounds 267,000).
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said the majority of the 11 UK operating
subsidiaries had performed well. He added: 'All three UK acquisitions
contributed to this year's profit.
'Annual recurring revenues from software licence fees and service and
support contracts provided turnover of over Pounds 134m during the year and
covered 72 per cent of overheads. We have continued to invest substantial
amounts in the development of our open system application software
packages.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: US closure boosts Dawson Intl - Rising raw
material costs and warm weather limit progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textiles group that has closed its
fleece and jersey business in the US, reported almost doubled interim
profits of Pounds 15.8m for the 27 weeks to October 1.
The figure compares with Pounds 8m, when the discontinued US business made
operating losses of Pounds 8.6m. Operating profits from continuing
operations fell to Pounds 19.6m from Pounds 22.1m on sales ahead to Pounds
204.2m (Pounds 191.8m).
Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, spoke of rising raw material prices, citing in
particular cashmere from China, which had almost doubled in price.
Furthermore, the warm weather of the past couple of months throughout the
northern hemisphere had dampened demand.
The pace of future progress depended on the return of consumer confidence in
Japan and Europe. Nevertheless, he said the latest figures demonstrated 'the
inherent strength of the group as it is now constituted'.
Earnings per share were 6.1p, up from 3.1p, and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.5p. Gearing fell from 90 per cent to 52 per cent following
the 1-for-4 rights issue in May, which raised Pounds 45m.
Operating profits at the fabrics and yarns division eased to Pounds 9.6m
(Pounds 9.8m) on higher sales. Clothing profits fell from Pounds 11.1m to
Pounds 8.8m, while the fabrics division increased profits from Pounds 1.7m
to Pounds 2.6m.
The group has abandoned plans to sell Dawson Home Fashions, a maker of
shower curtains and bath mats, and has switched the Pounds 12m provision for
its disposal to a restructuring charge. The operating loss from the division
rose from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.4m.
COMMENT
Sir Ronald pointed out yesterday that the exit from the US fleece business
would both liberate the group from a financial drain and enable the
management to concentrate on the continuing businesses. But it looks like
the management will have to run fast just to stand still. Raw material cost
increases will be difficult to pass on as consumers are now after value for
money rather than luxury brand names, and the recent warm weather has curbed
any desire to buy sweaters and thermal underwear. The fierce competition in
the US retail market is more likely to appear in Europe and Japan than go
away. And the management is still lumbered with the shower curtain business.
City analysts yesterday scaled back profit forecasts to below Pounds 30m for
the full year. At the closing price of 126p, up 2p, the group is on a
forward multiple of about 12, which looks high enough.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 3i may form venture capital investment
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the UK's largest investor in unquoted companies, is considering setting
up a venture capital investment trust following the Budget announcement of
tax incentives for investors in these new vehicles.
Mr Charles Richardson, director of corporate affairs, said 3i was seriously
considering the new scheme, which seemed 'very interesting' to private
investors.
The new VCITs will issue quoted shares, like any investment trust, but will
make investments of up to Pounds 1m in unquoted companies.
Private investors will be allowed to invest up Pounds 100,000 in VCITs,
which are likely to be launched in the spring. These more than averagely
risky investments carry income tax relief of 20 per cent on purchase of the
shares. In addition investors will be able to defer capital gains tax
liabilities on the sale of almost any other asset, if those gains are
reinvested in VCIT shares.
This brings the total potential front-end tax break on investment in VCIT
shares to 60 per cent, on top of which investors will receive relief from
any capital gains or dividends from their trust shares.
Even if 3i does not set up its own VCIT, it will still benefit from the
enthusiasm for the new vehicles shown by other venture capital groups, such
as Electra and Murray Johnstone.
The FT-SE 100 group has a policy of taking a minority stake only in the
companies in which it invests. It therefore requires syndicate partners with
which to co-invest. But because 3i tends to invest in companies that are
smaller than most venture capital funds will look at, it has sometimes had
difficulty finding co-investors.
Managers of new VCITs will be anxious to minimise the cost of sifting
through a large number of small potential deals. Co-investing the funds
alongside smaller deals that 3i wants to back would be an attractive way to
find deals and invest relatively cheaply.
3i has an established network of offices around the UK with good contacts
with regional accounting firms - a source of deals of all sizes. Other
venture capital groups considering setting up VCITs would need to make a
greater proportionate increase in their staff levels to seek potential
deals.
3i is also likely to benefit from the Chancellor's relaxation of rules on
which investment trusts qualify to be included in personal equity plans.
Like many of the 21 other quoted venture capital trusts, 3i's shares can now
be included in a general Pep.
The old rules stated that 50 per cent of an investment trust's assets had to
be held in ordinary shares in order to be included in a general Pep. The
Chancellor has now allowed preference shares in unquoted companies to be
included as well.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As warned of in August, exceptional costs of Pounds 2m connected to its
reorganisation kept Andrews Sykes, the industrial services group, in the red
to the tune of Pounds 1.96m in the first half.
Turnover increased to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 25.1m) and operating profit was
45 per cent up at Pounds 602,000 (Pounds 415,000) in the six months to
September 30. The exceptional item included the write-off of fixtures and
fittings, plant and machinery and redundancies due to the closure of two
sites.
Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 555,000 (Pounds 539,000), from
turnover of Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 5.08m), but interest payments took Pounds
932,000 (Pounds 820,000).
The previous first half carried a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.34m, after losses
of Pounds 2.05m on the sale and closure of discontinued activities.
Losses per share 16.6p (19.4p).
The group said that during the period under review, the workforce had been
reduced by about 15 per cent.
There are plans for further non-core disposals and asset realisations.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Investors take care as they venture out
again - Richard Gourlay analyses the background to the collapse of the
buy-out for National Parking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An air of deep despondency has descended over Prudential Venture Managers,
the venture capital company that was leading the buy-out of National Parking
Corporation until the deal collapsed last week.
The 11th hour loss of a transaction worth about Pounds 600m that would have
been the largest in the industry for three years has taken the gloss off
what Mr Paul Brooks, managing director, says has otherwise been a sparkling
year for the Prudential.
After six intense months scrutinising NPC and its main asset, National Car
Parks, the syndicate's final offer last Thursday was not high enough to
tempt Sir Donald Gosling, the founder and pivotal shareholder.
Yet the decision by Prudential and its syndicate investors not to proceed
should be seen as a victory for common sense.
Not only has the industry turned its back on a deal it thought was
overpriced, it has shown this restraint at a time when venture capitalists
are awash with money they want to invest, and when banks are once again
anxious to lend to management buy-out teams.
So far this year, management buy-out and venture capital funds have raised
more than Pounds 1.5bn in new money. Despite dire warnings a year ago that
fund raising would be difficult, a late burst of flotations early this year
perked up some otherwise ordinary performance figures.
In the event, UK investors and US institutions, who are allocating an
increasing proportion of their funds to what they call 'alternative
investments', stumped up. As a result, 1994 will be the best year for fund
raising since the last boom year of 1989.
At the same time, banks, which had almost entirely stopped providing debt to
management buy-outs, have returned in numbers. A year ago the few banks
still lending, such as Bank of Scotland and NatWest Bank, were unwilling to
take more than Pounds 50m of debt on to their own books in any transaction.
However a number of other banks are now willing to lend more than Pounds
200m on their own.
Mr Jon Moulton, a partner at Apax Partners, a venture capital group, says
the fund raising and banks' appetite to lend has produced 'a wall of money'
and stiff competition for deals.
Some venture capitalists fear the prices of deals will be bid up by hungry
investors and bankers. They fear a repeat of the late 1980s when the
industry backed highly leveraged buy-outs such as that of Magnet, the
kitchens company, and Isosceles, the supermarket group, based on optimistic
assumptions about the businesses' growth potential and ability to generate
cash.
'It is only a matter of time before venture capitalists find a way to
overpay again,' says Mr Moulton. 'There is no doubt that the market will be
very aggressive in the next 18 months.'
Against this background, the refusal of the Prudential syndicate to
'overpay', as they saw it, has led to a degree of self-congratulation. The
'industry is maturing and learning self-restraint', one intermediary said.
There is some justification for this view. At no time was the quality of the
NPC business in question. Its main asset, National Car Parks, has a rock
solid cash flow and an excellent quality of earnings, according to venture
capitalists close to the negotiation.
Yet the very stability of the business meant the Prudential could not pay
any more. While the NCP business was solid, analysts saw it as having
limited growth potential. Yet the Pounds 650m price the founders are
understood to have been asking implied a historic price earnings ratio of
nearly 20.
This would have been a significant premium to the current stock market and
much higher than venture capitalists are usually prepared to pay even for
businesses that are growing quickly.
The Prudential syndicate is understood to have been prepared to pay Pounds
600m including a performance related deferred payment, a sum which the
Prudential said it had 'every confidence' it could raise.
But this implied a valuation of nearly 17 times historic earnings. The
syndicate may have resisted loading the transaction with debt, but it is
still questionable whether this was cautious pricing.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift plans Pounds 6.5m property
injection for London Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nu-Swift, the fire protection and property group that was taken private in
March, is proposing to inject a Pounds 6.5m commercial property portfolio
into London Securities, taking its stake in the quoted shell company to 75
per cent.
Nu-Swift, which is controlled by Mr Jacques Murray, already has a 29 per
cent stake in London Securities.
London Securities is to pay Pounds 6.79m in new shares for a portfolio of
six commercial properties, valued at Pounds 17.6m by Jones Lang Wootton,
giving a net value of Pounds 6.2m after related debt of Pounds 11.2m.
Current rental income is about Pounds 1.8m a year. Nu-Swift will place some
of the shares it receives to limit its stake to 75 per cent.
London Securities' company voluntary arrangement with creditors entered in
October 1992, expired in October this year. Most of the group's assets have
been sold and the proceeds used to repay secured creditors.
The company made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 342,000) in the
year to September, representing the costs of operating the voluntary
arrangement. The company warned that its cash resources stand at about
Pounds 10,000 and would run out by the end of January if no action was
taken. The shares were suspended at 2 3/4p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cape shares fall despite 7% advance to
Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cape, the building products and industrial services group, fell 8p
to 223p yesterday after it announced a 6 per cent fall in sales at
continuing businesses.
Turnover on continuing operations - excluding acquisitions - dropped to
Pounds 111.3m, the main decline coming in the industrial services division.
Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, blamed falling demand for
insulation services.
A lower interest charge of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 600,000) helped overall
pre-tax profits to advance by 7 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.1m). Total
turnover for the six months to September 30 was down 5 per cent at Pounds
113m (Pounds 119m).
Despite a 9 per cent drop in turnover from industrial services to Pounds 76m
(Pounds 83.6m), profits nudged up Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 3.4m. Mr
Farebrother said demand for insulation services, which had been particularly
poor in France, was not expected to pick up until 1996.
The French insulation subsidiary SOCAP made losses of Pounds 400,000 in the
first half, although it had been expected to break even. Similar losses are
expected in the second half. Last year SOCAP management was dismissed after
financial mis-statements were discovered. A further restructuring involving
30 redundancies is planned.
Operating profits from building and architectural products edged up to
Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4.1m) on sales 3 per cent higher at Pounds 36.5m (Pounds
35.3m). This was despite increased raw materials costs of 18 per cent for
steel and 40 per cent for pulp. UK sales in the second quarter were up for
the first time in four years.
The charge for compensation for industrial disease - a number of former
employees contracted asbestos-related illnesses - remained at Pounds
800,000. Mr Farebrother said the group had no US operations and did not face
any litigation claims.
Earnings per share and the interim dividend were unchanged at 7.6p and 3p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Drugs setback for British Biotech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Biotech, one of the best performing stocks in its sector on either
side of the Atlantic this year, has dropped two of its research programmes.
Disappointing results of early clinical trials prompted the company to
abandon one form of Aids vaccine, p24-VLP, and the use of another drug,
lexipafant, for septic shock.
The company also announced a second quarter pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.63m,
against a deficit of Pounds 4.61m in the comparable period last year. This
brings the loss for the half year to October 31 to Pounds 12.3m, against
Pounds 8.81m.
Turnover for the quarter increased from Pounds 693,000 to Pounds 858,000 -
mostly as a result of grant funding - making a deficit of Pounds 1.63m
(Pounds 2.83m) to date. Losses per share for the quarter emerged at 13.7p
(11.9p), amounting to 25.6p (22.8p) for the six months.
The company, which raised Pounds 46m in a rights issue in March, had cash
and short-term investments of Pounds 58.2m at the end of the quarter. At the
time of the rights issue it also sold warrants exercisable from December
1995 that could raise another Pounds 48m.
Other clinical trials are progressing steadily and important results are
expected during 1995, described as 'a pivotal year' for the company by
chairman Mr Brian Richards.
Statistically significant trials on the injectable version of batimastat
should yield results by the summer. Early trials on the same drug used for a
different condition, called pleural effusion, should begin in Europe and the
US. Results from early lexipafant trials in heart bypass surgery and asthma
should be available during 1995. Late stage trials in pancrea-titis will not
be complete until 1996.
Early stage trials in BB-2516, a pill version of batimastat, should start
'around the middle of 1995' in several tumour types and in both the US and
Europe.
There will be further initial clinical studies on BB-10010, designed to
protect bone marrow against damage during cancer chemotherapy.
The shares fell 2p to 573p yesterday.
COMMENT
Abandoning drugs in early development is a sign of strength, not weakness.
Too many of British Biotech's peers have carried on with a doubtful drug to
secure further funding or because they had nothing else. But little else is
rational about British Biotech's share price strength. The stock has risen
from 400p to almost 600p since midsummer, even though the company's top
drugs, batimastat and lexipafant, have yet to succeed in statistically
significant trials - the ones that count for regulators. On the other hand,
few analysts discourage a feel-good sensation among investors. If either
drug is a success, the shares could be worth many times their present value.
Rational investors will have to wait for a year to see if the company is
prepared to release the result of trials before the warrant exercise date.
Until then, emotion may well drive the share price up further.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: North of England helps Wainhomes to Pounds
5.28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, the Chester-based house builder which came to the market in
spring, increased interim pre-tax profits by almost half to Pounds 5.28m,
compared with Pounds 3.54m.
The company's share price, up 1p at 131p, remains more than a fifth below
its issue price of 170p.
Turnover rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 35.8m) for the six
months to the end of September. The company completed a record 682 sales
compared with 502 for the same period last year.
The bulk of the increase had been achieved by the businesses in north-west
England and Yorkshire. Its operation in southern England nonetheless
contributed almost a fifth of operating profits with the region enjoying
'its most successful trading period to date'.
The group also reported its first sales in the Midlands where it has only
recently expanded.
Mr Ron Smith, chief executive, was cautious about the outlook for prices:
'In the north-west, which accounts for the majority of our business, prices
have been and remain under pressure.'
This pressure, however, had been offset by overhead and marketing economies
of scale. Average house prices across the group's businesses in the first
half were similar to last year's level. Operating margins improved slightly
from 10.2 per cent to 10.4 per cent.
Mr Smith said changes in product mix were expected to increase average
selling prices in the second half.
Wainhomes is paying an interim dividend of 1.5p out of earnings per share of
5.7p (5.4p).
At the end of September, the group had Pounds 8.7m cash having increased the
number of housing plots under its control to just under 3,200 compared with
2,300 in September 1993. It expects the number of homes sold annually to
rise by about 500 to at least 1,800 within three years.
Brokers' forecasts suggest the company will make more than Pounds 10m
pre-tax profit this year compared with Pounds 6.23m in 1993-94.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest suffers from pricing pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the processing arm of the former Milk Marketing Board, reported
a 28 per cent drop in interim operating profits from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds
14m, following pressure on milk prices and cheese margins in the run-up to
market deregulation.
The company is now owned by the residuary body charged with winding up milk
board business, and speculation about its future has been rife for many
months.
Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said the body had two years to make a
decision about Dairy Crest's fate, but it had to consider the feasibility of
a stock market flotation as a first option.
Flotation was initially planned for this autumn, but was put off because of
uncertainty over milk prices in the new competitive market. 'Who would sell
a dairy company now? We're in no hurry to be sold,' said Mr Houliston.
He said profits had been halved in recent months after milk prices rose
substan-tially in the new market which started on November 1.
'But the really difficult time will come next year when we will see if price
rises for cheese stick and whether the higher prices suck in more imports.'
The dairy industry must recover an additional Pounds 450 to Pounds 500 a
tonne on cheddar cheese if it is to cover higher milk costs. That means
consumer cheese prices must rise by at least 40p a lb - 10p has already been
passed on, with an extra 30p to come in the New Year, taking the price for a
pound of mature cheddar to Pounds 3.
Mr Michael Landymore, food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the London
brokers, said: 'Dairy Crest has been powering away at the mature end of the
cheese market as a source of profit, but that is predicated on demand
holding up in the face of higher prices.'
The company has completed an extensive rationalisation to shape up for
market liberalisation. And other dairy companies, such as Northern Foods and
Unigate, have yet to announce substantial rationalisation plans. The number
of Dairy Crest plants has been cut from 28 to 10 in the past three years and
the workforce reduced from 13,000 to 4,200.
Recent closures and rationalisation of the company's transport interests
resulted in exceptional costs of Pounds 16m (Pounds 21.9m) in the half-year
to September 30 which, along with net interest receivable of Pounds 900,000
(Pounds 1.6m payable), took the pre-tax profit to Pounds 1m (Pounds
600,000).
Dairy Crest is basing its strategy on concentrating on higher value consumer
products, such as its Clover spread and recently launched Frijj milk drink,
but the bulk of its turnover still comes from liquid milk and cheese sales
which are under strong competitive pressure.
Doorstep sales accounted for Pounds 235m out of a total turnover on
continuing operations of Pounds 403.4m (Pounds 409m), but are declining at a
rate of 15 per cent a year.
The drop in milk deliveries is likely to continue for several years. Mr
Houliston said the deterioration could stabilise with 80 per cent of sales
in supermarkets, compared with the current 55 per cent.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Endowed with the power to sell - Nicholas
Denton on Kleinwort Benson's latest privatisation coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The selection of an adviser on a key Latin American power sell-off has
confirmed UK investment banks' domination of electricity privatisation.
It emerged this week that Codelco Chile, the state copper mining group, has
appointed Kleinwort Benson of the UK to handle the sale of a 570MW
coal-fired power plant, valued at Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m). One of the two
runners-up for the privatisation of the Tocopilla power station was also
London-based: NM Rothschild made it to the shortlist as well as CS First
Boston of the US.
About 80 per cent of international electricity privatisations have involved
either Kleinwort or Rothschild, one UK investment banker estimates. The
energy specialists of the two firms bump into each other in hotels all over
the world.
The impetus came from the UK's electricity privatisation on which Kleinwort
advised the government and Rothschild the Recs. 'It gave us leverage,' says
Mr Simon Robertson, deputy chairman of Kleinwort.
As work in the UK tailed off, Argentina's electricity sell-off, on which
Kleinwort advised the government, took off. It has privatisation mandates in
the UK, Portugal and Italy, as well as in Chile.
Rothschild's record is equally impressive. It lists no fewer than 23
international electricity transactions on which it has advised. In South
America alone, Rothschild has worked in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Brazil.
Even US competitors concede UK banks' strengths. 'Kleinwort does have a lot
of experience in these transactions,' says Mr Dan More, head of Morgan
Stanley's London-based energy group. About 30 Kleinwort staff worked on UK
electricity privatisation and the core of that energy team remains, headed
by Mr Richard Morse.
But critics say that the Kleinwort team, now 12 strong, is not particularly
deep. And to the extent that Kleinwort has a franchise in electricity
privatisation it is one that is dependent on individuals. They are
poachable: Morgan Stanley has hired Mr Glenn Suarez to beef up its team.
Rival investment banks point out, moreover, that the UK houses' dominance of
the electricity advisory rankings is a function of their work on the UK
privatisation, which remains by far the largest so far. Internationally, CS
First Boston, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers have also established
reputations in the sector.
For all the carping, advice on electricity is widely acknowledged to be a
strength of UK houses. 'It's a thriving industry, the export of these kinds
of services,' says Mr Charles Alexander, Rothschild's head for Latin
America.
Rothschild has what investment bankers describe as 'a real niche' in
privatisation advisory work. And Kleinwort's work on Argentinian electricity
privatisation helped tide the firm through a period which it is now the
first to admit was 'awful'.
Kleinwort's privatisation experience also pushed it to embrace the idea of
departments organised around sectors. 'Everybody says they do it now. We
were very early,' says Mr Robertson.
One key question remains. Advisory work on privatisation allows investment
banks to establish close contact with company managements. It is not in
itself the most lucrative part of investment banking.
The pay-off often comes in ongoing business, such as capital raising
exercises. US investment bankers wonder whether Kleinwort and Rothschild may
not be too specialised to do that.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Organic growth boosts Quadramatic 63% to
Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Quadramatic climbed 17p to 188p yesterday as the acquisitive
specialist engineer announced a 63 per cent pre-tax profits increase from
Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 7.5m in the 12 months to September 30, its first full
year as a quoted company.
The flotation price was 123p.
Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, stressed that there had been organic growth
within the group - including within the acquired companies since purchase -
of 17 per cent. For example, the instruments division - including Quota for
11 months since its Pounds 11.25m acquisition and KM Comark bought for
Pounds 3.8m in June 1994 - lifted operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds
2.4m. The operating margin was 25.2 per cent.
Operating profits in the core coin handling division rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 4.9m on turnover down 1 per cent to Pounds 21.1m. The margin rose one
percentage point to 20.1 per cent. Mr Gartland said the group had knocked
out Dollars 1m of low-margin turnover in the division and that chasing
high-margin profits, not sales was the priority.
In specialist moulded products, profits grew to Pounds 790,000 (Pounds
680,000) on turnover up 6 per cent at Pounds 6.6m. Barely a week ago, the
group announced the acquisition of Kestrel Injection Moulders for an initial
Pounds 4.4m and up to Pounds 6.6m in total.
On the acquisitions front Mr Gartland said he wanted to expand the
temperature measuring and plastic moulding sides. Private companies were the
likeliest targets and he said he was prepared to 'pay a lot for goodwill' -
topping management buy-out offers - acknowledging that in tangible terms
this might make the balance sheet 'a bit thin'.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 27.4m) including Pounds 9.36m from
Quota and Comark. Some 64 (55) per cent of the group total is derived from
outside the UK and, notwithstanding the UK-bound Kestrel, is expected to
rise. Operating profits were Pounds 7.5m. A final dividend of 4p is a 57 per
cent increase on the pro forma 2.55p and makes a total for the year of 6.5p,
twice covered by basic earnings per share of 13p (9.8p).

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Safeway's own brand helps cola sales rise
20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alistair Grant, above, chairman of the Argyll food retailing group, said
yesterday the launch of his Safeway chain's Select Cola had increased its
own-label cola sales nine-fold, and its total cola sales by 20 per cent,
writes Neil Buckley.
Speaking in the week Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola went on sale, adding
to the challenge to market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Sir Alistair said
the success of own-label colas demonstrated the positive impact own-brand
product launches could still have on retailers' businesses.
The proportion of Safeway's sales accounted for by own-label increased from
39 per cent to 41 per cent in the most recent half-year, helped by the
launch of Safeway Savers, a cut-price range aimed at countering competition
from discounters.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Thos Cook cheque buy proceeds - Two
operations to be kept separate in case final go-ahead not given
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has allowed Thomas
Cook Group, the travel company, to proceed on a temporary and conditional
basis with its acquisition of Barclays Bank's travellers' cheques business.
The deal was blocked last month just before it was due to be completed, when
Mr Heseltine referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the
advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Thomas Cook said yesterday that the acquisition had now been completed,
subject to an order from the department of trade and industry saying that
the core businesses must be kept separate.
This means that Thomas Cook must keep its own data and processing systems
distinct from those it is acquiring from Interpayment Services.
This is to ensure ISL could still be disentangled if the MMC recommended,
and Mr Heseltine agreed, that the deal should not be allowed to go ahead.
Thomas Cook is already the world's largest issuer of Mastercard travellers'
cheques, and the deal makes it the biggest issuer of Visa travellers'
cheques as well.
It is increasing its share of the Dollars 54bn (Pounds 33bn) travellers
cheque market from 17 to 30 per cent. The market is led by American Express
with 44 per cent.
When the deal was announced in August, Thomas Cook said that part of its
rationale was the use of the same distribution and processing facilities.
But Mr Graham Rider, Thomas Cook's managing director of financial services,
said yesterday that the first stage of bringing the operations together
simply involved putting them in the same location.
Integrating the systems themselves was not due to begin until next autumn.
The DTI decision on the MMC recommendation is expected in spring.
The DTI took the unusual step of issuing the new order after joint
representations from Thomas Cook and Barclays. They argued that putting the
deal on hold until after the MMC report would undermine the case for
proceeding at all, with the risk that the business would have to be closed
down.
ISL is said to be running at a loss of about Pounds 20m a year.
Thomas Cook intends to operate the Interpayment Visa brand separately. Mr
Rider said that though the deal would be less attractive if the two
processing systems had to remain separate indefinitely, it would not be a
'deal-breaker' since most of the synergies arose from co-locating the
operations.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bondholder support for overhaul of Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reconstruction of Heron International under US entrepreneur Steven Green
became a virtual formality yesterday, when bondholders voted in favour of
the buy-out of Gerald Ronson's collapsed property empire.
A number of conditions still need to be met before the offer becomes
unconditional, but the bondholder meetings were the main hurdle. Mr Green's
offer won 99 per cent support from both classes of bonds.
A spokesman for Heron said: 'We are very pleased with the result, and we are
confident that we will reach a successful conclusion.'
Mr Green's HNV Acquisition has yet to receive approval from the Head Office
Banks.
However, they have given verbal commitments to support the deal and the
delay in approval is a 'technical hitch' at one of the banks.
A meeting was to be held in the US yesterday by the Resolution Trust
Corporation to consider a proposed settlement concerning the collapsed
financial services group Pima - another condition of the offer.
However, the bond meetings demonstrated overwhelming support for the HNVA
proposals. Around 70 per cent of senior bondholders voted, along with 73 per
cent of the junior bondholders.
Investors were given cash or share options, but Mr Green's consortium, which
includes Rupert Murdoch and the family trust of Michael Milken, will retain
at least HNVA 51 per cent of Heron, if the deal becomes unconditional.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Verson forms Japanese joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verson International, the Midlands-based capital equipment manufacturer,
which announced yesterday reduced interim pre-tax losses, has formed a joint
venture with a Japanese heavy machinery company.
The group has reached an agreement with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, the
specialised forging machinery manufacturer, to jointly market its products
in the US and Europe and to produce a large portion of these products at one
of Verson's factories.
Verson cut its pre-tax loss by 17 per cent from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 2.39m
in the six months to July 31. However, turnover fell to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds
49.4m), reflecting a lower backlog of orders at the beginning of this year.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.36m). Mr Tim Kelleher,
chairman, said that borrowing was 'marginally higher' than at the year end,
when total debt reached Pounds 53.7m, giving a gearing ratio of 440 per
cent. The group plans to cut its debt by floating about 50 per cent of the
equity in its US operations on Nasdaq, in the next 10 to 22 months.
A charge of Pounds 750,000 was taken for the reorganisation of the UK press
business, Clearing International, where 80 people have been made redundant.
The subsidiary recorded an operating loss of Pounds 1.5m.
Income from royalties and service fees jumped to Pounds 1.99m (Pounds
667,000). New order intake in the first ten months of the year also improved
to Pounds 109m (Pounds 81.6m).
Losses per share were reduced to 1.65p (2p). There is no interim dividend.
The shares rose 1p to 16p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stockbroker queries value of BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of British Sky Broadcasting greatly overvalues the satellite
television venture, according to research by stockbrokers Henderson
Crosthwaite.
The firm's media specialist Ms Louise Barton estimates BSkyB is worth Pounds
2.6bn, compared with the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.6bn suggested in the flotation
proposals.
'We like the company but not its valuation,' said Ms Barton who has based
her pricing on an average of discounted cashflow analysis and a conventional
multiple of 1995-96 earnings.
Henderson Crosthwaite estimates that BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times holds a 17.5 per cent stake, will make a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 479m in the year 2000-01.
This compares with some analysts' forecasts of more than Pounds 800m.
Ms Barton warned that a large proportion of the British population appeared
to be reasonably happy with terrestrial television 'supplemented with the
odd video'.
She predicts that BSkyB's penetration, through dishes and cable networks,
will rise from its present 15 per cent of 21m television homes to 27 per
cent of the 24m homes at the turn of the century.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Corporate investment in Lloyd's to jump
Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate investment in Lloyd's of London is to increase by more than Pounds
300m next year following a last-minute announcement of the launch of a new
company, backed by two US institutional funds, which plans to invest Pounds
88m.
Hours before the deadline for corporate investors to lodge funds at the
insurance market in time for the 1995 underwriting year, Insurance Partners
and Harvard Private Capital announced they would provide most of the capital
for a venture launched by Charman, a Lloyd's agency.
The new company, which will invest in one insurance syndicate, is the
largest of Lloyd's 'dedicated' vehicles - in effect embryonic insurance
companies.
Its launch is a fillip for the insurance market's attempts to raise extra
corporate capital to augment the Pounds 900m invested in 1994. Fund raising
has been hit by the lacklustre share performance of quoted Lloyd's vehicles
and the bad publicity surrounding Lloyd's.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, forecast an extra Pounds 250m
would be invested in 1995. But so far 13 groups, including Charman, have
announced plans to invest a total of Pounds 280m and Brockbank, one of
Lloyd's largest agencies, is expected to unveil plans to raise about Pounds
50m.
Charman's plans provoked controversy in the Lloyd's market when first mooted
earlier this year because they entail splitting its syndicate 488 into two.
The first syndicate, to keep the number 488, will be supported by existing
Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported Lloyd's - but
its premium writing capacity is expected to fall from Pounds 264m this year
to about Pounds 140m in 1995. The second syndicate, numbered 2488, will use
the Pounds 88m new money - sufficient to underwrite premiums worth Pounds
160m.
Some Names had expressed concern that their interests would not be protected
on the old syndicate. But Mr John Charman, the Charman group's managing
director, said that 'anyone who wanted capacity on 488 was offered it'.
Charman shareholders - including Mr Charman, other staff and directors  -
have also invested in the new company, making Mr Charman among the largest
individual investors in the insurance market, albeit with limited liability
rather than unlimited liability like most Names.
The two US funds have also purchased 25 per cent in the Charman holding
company, the maximum allowed under Lloyd's rules.
Insurance Partners is a Dollars 540m equity investment fund specialising in
acquisitions, recapitalisations and other investments in the insurance
industry. Its investors include Centre Re, a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance,
and Chase Manhattan Bank.
Harvard Private Capital Group manages about Dollars 1.4bn of private
investments and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Harvard Management.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson buys 20% of Chicago fund
manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking and fund management group, is
taking a 20 per cent stake in LaSalle Partners, the Chicago-based property
fund manager.
Kleinwort's existing joint venture in real estate fund management, 50 per
cent owned by Alex Brown, the US investment bank, will be merged with
LaSalle to create the third largest property fund manager in the US.
The group is paying Dollars 20.8m (Pounds 12.6m) for its stake in LaSalle
and Dollars 10.6m to buy out Alex Brown from the joint venture.
Mr Gary Thomas, finance director of Kleinwort Benson investment management,
said: 'Our joint venture with Alex Brown was a good investment, but it is
clear that the business was too small to provide the high level of service
demanded by investors over a long period of time. We had to decide whether
to invest in that business or strike a deal with someone else.'
The joint venture with Alex Brown had Dollars 3bn of property under
management, against La Salle's Dollars 9bn.
Kleinwort Benson has the right to maintain its holding in LaSalle at 20 per
cent by acquiring additional equity in the company up to a maximum
additional cost of Dollars 12.2m.
Mr Thomas added that the group has been expanding its US fund management
operations including Fenchurch Capital Management and Kleinwort Benson
Investment Management Americas.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Referral for SB Holdings buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the acquisition of
Kelvin Central Buses, a Glasgow-based operator, by SB Holdings, the holding
company of Strathclyde Buses.
Mr Jonathan Evans, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that the
acquisition raised concerns about competition in the bus market in and
around Glasgow.
The Monopolies Commission is required to make its report by March 8. The
referral decision was taken on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg, the
director general of fair trading.
Kelvin Central was sold to its management by the Scottish Transport Group
for Pounds 1 in 1990 and bought by SB Holdings for Pounds 11.1m in
September.
A 20 per cent stake in SB Holdings was acquired by Stagecoach, the largest
UK bus group, on November 15, for Pounds 8.3m. Stagecoach said it might
acquire a larger stake in SB Holdings at a later stage, though the Office of
Fair Trading has said it would look into the deal.
SB Holdings was also acquired by its managers from Strathclyde Council in
1993. It has annual turnover of Pounds 86m, owns 1,330 vehicles and employs
3,700 staff.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hollinger buys back 200,000 Telegraph
shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
has bought a further 200,000 shares at 348p in The Telegraph as part of its
policy to buy back up to 6.8m ordinary shares.
The share price yesterday fell by 2p to 350p.
When the policy was announced in early October the shares jumped 20p to
330p.
The latest purchase takes Hollinger's holding to 79.2m shares, or 58.51 per
cent of the issued share capital. Mr Black is chairman of both companies.
In May, Hollinger reduced its stake in The Telegraph from 66.2 to 57 per
cent, raising CDollars 152m (Pounds 70.7m), only weeks before the Daily
Telegraph cut its cover price. The share price consequently slumped from
540p to 332p. A London Stock Exchange inquiry cleared Mr Black of any
wrongdoing.

FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Buzzacott acts to meet charity rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buzzacott Investment Management, a firm of chartered accountants which also
manages funds for charities, has turned over Pounds 60m of its clients'
monies to Mercury Asset Management, largely in response to new rules on
charity investment.
Mr Brian Regan, a senior partner of Buzzacott, said: 'This is a natural
development in view of the new audit requirements for charities which are
expected to come into force towards the end of 1995.
Buzzacott said it would continue to act as financial adviser for its
auditing clients and continue its performance monitoring function of client
portfolios.
From next year, auditors to charities face tougher requirements under the
Charities Act of 1993. A further statement of recommended practice from the
Accounting Standards Board says that those who audit the investment
portfolio of a charity should not also be responsible for making investment
decisions.

FT  01 DEC 94 / JP Morgan wins Polish bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US bank, has won the highly prized mandate to lead Poland's
first sovereign bond issue since the country defaulted on its debts.
Intense competition between investment banks to handle the debut issue and
the appetite of investors for Polish paper promise attractive terms for
Poland.
JP Morgan is understood to have indicated pricing which would have yielded a
spread of about 200 basis points (2 percentage points) over US Treasuries.
That would allow Poland, a defaulter, to borrow more cheaply than Hungary,
which serviced its borrowings throughout the debt crisis. An analyst said:
'It means that markets are looking at outlook rather than history.' The bond
issue, which is expected to take place around next March, would mark
Poland's full financial rehabilitation after it reached agreement with its
creditors earlier this year.
JP Morgan emerged from a initial field of 17 investment banks which narrowed
to a shortlist of the five pre-eminent US bond houses: CS First Boston,
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as JP Morgan.
Debut sovereign issues are prestigious and JP Morgan has won the most sought
after transaction since South Africa in November hired Goldman Sachs and
Swiss Bank Corporation to handle its first bond issue since the end of
apartheid. Morocco, Slovakia and Pakistan are believed to be considering
similar transactions.
JP Morgan has also lead-managed CEZ's Eurobond issue, priced yesterday at
110 basis points over Treasuries, in which the Czech electricity utility
became the first investment-grade corporate issuer on the Euromarkets.
The Polish decision, which is expected to be announced today, is a
disappointment for CS First Boston which is understood to have undercut JP
Morgan on the spreads it indicated. CSFB is strong in the eurobond market
and in eastern Europe but has won few mandates to lead sovereign debt issues
from the region.
Poland intends to seek ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's and the
market expects it will receive an S&amp;P rating of about BB+. That would put it
just below investment grade and three notches below Czech sovereign debt,
which carries a rating of BBB+. Investment bankers believe the prospects for
further expansion may lead rating agencies to give Poland a positive
outlook.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Waddington passes Monopoly to Hasbro and collects Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday bought Waddington's games division for Pounds 50m in cash,
giving the biggest US toy and games group a monopoly on Monopoly, the
world's best-selling board game.
Mention Monopoly in the UK, and people immediately think of Waddington. But
the archetypal game of capitalists, once banned in the Soviet Union as
ideologically unsound, was invented in the US in the 1930s.
Waddington has always been a printing company, diversifying into games in
the 1920s by printing playing cards. The grandfather of Mr Victor Watson,
who retired as chairman last year, obtained the Monopoly licence for the
British Empire in 1935. The licence was granted by Parker Brothers of the
US, now part of the Hasbro empire. Hasbro itself had a licence to market
Cluedo, owned by Waddington, outside the UK.
Mr Michael Buckley, chief executive of Waddington, said that the sale of the
games division was viewed with some regret, but it was matched by pleasure
at how the group could use the cash. 'The games division is a super company,
but we did not think we could make it any bigger or better.'
The deal will leave Waddington cash positive to the tune of Pounds 13m. It
plans to invest further in both the printing and packaging divisions.
Hasbro was pipped to the post this summer in a battle for Scrabble with
Mattel, its main rival in the US market. Mattel paid Pounds 62m for JW
Spear, the UK company with the rights to Scrabble outside North America.
Hasbro, which owns the North American Scrabble rights, said it felt the
winning price for Spear, at about 21 times earnings, was too high. However,
it is paying about 21 times earnings for the Waddington division, which made
operating profits of Pounds 3.5m on sales of Pounds 25.9m in the year to
April, because of the quality of the portfolio.
Mr Brian Ellis, of Hasbro UK, said the Waddington catalogue had 850 items,
only about 60 of which were games. Monopoly, which sold 300,000 sets in the
UK last year, represented only 15 per cent of the turnover.
'It is much more of a general toy company than a games company,' he said,
citing in particular the Get Set craft products, which are expecting 35 per
cent growth this year.

FT  01 DEC 94 / BTR brings in outsider as chief executive of Nylex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced its second
top management change in two weeks with the appointment of Mr Philip Aiken
as chief executive of BTR Nylex, its Australian-based subsidiary. The move
sent the shares of both companies down.
Mr Aiken, 45 and an Australian, is managing director of BOC Group's European
gases operation. Mr Graeme Pearson, who was previously managing director of
BTR Nylex, becomes managing director of BTR Nylex's operations.
The apparent sideways move for Mr Pearson and the unexpected appointment of
Mr Aiken caused heavy trading in BTR Nylex shares, which are quoted on the
Australian Stock Exchange, as analysts tried to interpret the changes. They
closed two cents lower at ADollars 2.40. BTR shares fell 1p to 286p.
BTR said that Mr Aiken's appointment reflected 'the board's view that the
group holds strong positions in areas such as Australia and the US, as well
as the fast-growth area of Asia, offering a significant opportunity to
expand'. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR chief executive, added that Mr Aiken would
oversee an expansion plan centred on the Asia-Pacific rim.
Sources close to the company said it signalled a more aggressive approach to
acquisitions with Mr Aiken focusing on deals while Mr Pearson concentrates
on operational management.
At the annual meeting in June, Mr Jackson said that he believed acquisition
opportunities were emerging. Mr Jackson remains chairman of BTR Nylex, which
in the 1980s he transformed from an obscure BTR belting subsidiary into one
of Australia's largest industrial groups.
Nylex announced disappointing interim figures in September with after-tax
profit of ADollars 207m (Pounds 158m ) rising only 6 per cent on the
previous year.
BTR's shares have been further unsettled by worries about management
succession. Last week it announced the surprise retirement of Mr Bob
Faircloth as chief operating officer.
Separately, BTR announced that it is to raise its stake in BTR Nylex from
59.8 per cent to 61.9 per cent. The increase is the result of the exercise
of certain options held by BTR.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Burned again: 'How can we know this is the end?' - Simon
Davies finds T&amp;N under fire after new asbestos bombshell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When companies choose Budget day to announce bad tidings, they are
invariably suspected of trying to hide behind the chancellor's publicity
skirts. In the case of T&amp;N's announcement of Pounds 100m provisions against
future asbestos claims, this was clearly an unfortunate coincidence, but the
reaction has been strident.
Its share price reflected the blow to management credibility, falling 20p to
166p yesterday, after a loss of 35p on Tuesday, for a 25 per cent fall in
two days.
'The manner and the way in which the Pounds 100m exceptional charge has
arisen can only be described as disconcerting,' says Mr Sandy Morris,
research analyst at NatWest Securities.
Only in August, T&amp;N had put forward the argument that the worst of the
uncertainty over asbestos claims was over, after a US judicial ruling
provided a set framework to cover future claims. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and
chief executive, said at the time that 'there are good prospects that
asbestos-related costs will now stabilise and then enter a period of
progressive decline'.
But one analyst said: 'If you take this at face value, within a three-month
period, the asbestos problem has got worse to the tune of Pounds 100m. So
how can we know that this is the end?'
T&amp;N said the charge resulted from a change in the type of claims that had
appeared in the proliferation of cases that were lodged before the judicial
ruling.
These cases are handled by the Center for Claims Resolutions, which combines
claims against 21 member companies, who then pay a share of the costs
according to their exposure to the cases.
Mr Hope said there had been a dramatic shift towards industries where T&amp;N
had greater exposure, which became apparent after sifting through 'tens of
thousands' of claims over the past month.
'The only thing that has gone wrong is that we didn't pick up that there was
going to be this dramatic change in our share of the pre-global settlement
(claims),' Mr Hope said. T&amp;N's US subsidiary Flexitallic, for example, has
become party to as many claims filed in 1993 as in the entire previous
decade.
Back in September 1989, T&amp;N's shares tumbled 9 per cent, after the company
revealed a surprise Pounds 9m provision, in addition to its expected annual
charge.
Few analysts suggested that the market reaction to the latest provisions was
over-done. The absorption of insurance cover means that the annual
provision, which is on top of the Pounds 100m, will also rise to between
Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m.
In many ways, the latest shock provides a vindication for the work of Mr
Hope since he joined T&amp;N - then called Turner &amp; Newall - in January 1985.
The full extent of T&amp;N's potential liabilities related to its former
asbestos-producing operations was not then recognised, but Mr Hope became
the architect of a strategy to expand its automotive components and
engineering businesses.
T&amp;N had a market capitalisation of about Pounds 60m, and could clearly not
have withstood the Pounds 250m of asbestos-related costs that it has carried
since Mr Hope joined.
One of the ironies was that the latest provisions come at a time when T&amp;N's
core operations are showing 'continuing improvements in efficiency and
further strengthening of demand'. As one analyst said: 'The pity of it is
that you can't fault what the management have done strategically. If they
had been able to relegate asbestos to a minor item, they would have been
perceived as a high quality company.'
T&amp;N's past has caught up with it at an awkward moment. For three years, the
management has appeased investors by maintaining its dividend against
substantially lower earnings per share. It stemmed the impact by offering an
extremely enhanced scrip alternative, but despite this, cash outflows have
been substantial.
NatWest expects that high capital expenditure will lead to a net cash
outflow of Pounds 31.5m next year, excluding acquisitions. With a full cash
dividend, the figure would have exceeded Pounds 50m.
Gearing remains high - it was 60 per cent at the end of June - and will
remain at around that level at the year end, following these provisions.
At the same time, T&amp;N has identified a suitable German purchase, which would
fit in with its strategy of building up globally dominant shares in its
sectors. The problem is how to finance such a deal. Analysts estimate a 52.5
per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, including the assumption of debt, would
cost T&amp;N about Pounds 380m. Gearing would therefore exceed 100 per cent.
A rights issue is expected, but after four cash calls in the five years up
to mid-1991, there seems to be little enthusiasm from institutions. One fund
manager pointed out that even before the provisions, earnings per share in
1995 would have been well below the 1989 figure.
Mr Hope said T&amp;N was not tied to the acquisition, and will decide in March,
after it gets a ruling from the German cartel authorities. 'We are
acquisitive in order to be a world player, so that we can ride the asbestos
wave and come out a winner at the end.'

A downbeat trading statement sent shares in Argyll, the grocery retailer,
down 17p to 255p - the biggest fall of the day among FT-SE 100 stocks - in
spite of a 4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. Profits before
tax for the 28 weeks to October 15 rose to Pounds 205.3m, from a restated
Pounds 197.3m.
The market was disappointed by a 0.8 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in
Argyll's Safeway chain in the past six weeks, in spite of an aggressive
marketing campaign. Analysts were also disappointed that the group did not
give more details of restructuring plans following a recent strategic
review.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, defended the group's achievement in
maintaining its operating margin at 7.1 per cent in a competitive market. He
suggested the fact that Safeway had increased sales 9 per cent but shown
only a small increase in market share suggested the total grocery market was
expanding more quickly than observers had predicted.
Mr Colin Smith, chief executive, said Safeway had adopted marketing
initiatives aimed at improving its range and price perceptions to attract
more young families. It had launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign,
lowered prices, and introduced cut-price own-label products. Gross margins
had fallen about 0.1 points.
Further measures to improve efficiency would follow from the strategic
review, but details would not be given until the full-year results in May.
Total group sales increased 7 per cent from Pounds 3.14bn to Pounds 3.36bn.
Safeway's sales rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 2.78bn, with a 9.6 per cent
growth from new stores offset by a 0.3 point fall in existing stores.
However, price falls of 0.5 per cent masked an underlying volume increase of
0.2 per cent in existing stores.
Safeway lifted operating profits 9 per cent to Pounds 186.2m, but sales
growth in the second half has slowed to 7.2 per cent, with a 0.8 per cent
decline in existing stores. Sales in Presto and Lo-Cost fell 3 per cent to
Pounds 583m, with operating profits un-changed at Pounds 20.9m. Part of the
decline resulted from the sale of the Lo-Cost chain and 28 Presto stores in
two deals worth Pounds 100m.
The interim dividend was lifted 4 per cent from 3.75p to 3.9p, with earnings
per share also up 4 per cent at 12.8p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Contacts with IRA reopened after Newry killing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government reopened secret contacts with the IRA last month
after the killing of a Newry postal worker in a raid by republican gunmen.
This emerged yesterday as the government looked poised to send a letter to
Sinn Fein indicating its readiness to begin preliminary talks with the IRA's
political wing before Christmas.
These are now thought likely to start either on December 12 or December 16.
Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland security minister, said he had no doubt
exploratory talks would begin 'within a few days'.
The government has also promised to start preliminary dialogue with loyalist
representatives by the end of the year.
It is understood that the government contacted republican leaders
immediately after the Newry murder to demand in the strongest terms an
explanation for what happened.
The demand brought an admission from the republicans that they did not know
what had prompted the raid and that they were trying to find out. The
government then sent a second message demanding firm answers.
The exchange underlines how close the killing - the first since the IRA and
loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires - came to derailing the peace
process.
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, initially
accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the process by
blaming republicans for the shooting. But the IRA later acknowledged its
members were responsible.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said on the day of the
killing on November 10 he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked'
murder. The next day he stressed the peace process was 'on course'.
It is believed the secret contacts may have been initiated by Downing Street
but were probably carried out by MI5. A Downing Street official said
yesterday he had seen 'no evidence' such contacts had taken place.
Yesterday's developments came as Mr Adams said the government had reopened
its secret contacts with Sinn Fein to advise it to expect a date shortly for
exploratory talks.
Earlier Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, issued their first joint statement since the
IRA ceasefire. They urged the government to be more positive in its attitude
to the peace process.
Mr Adams has also been invited by Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's
national security adviser, to meet him at the White House next week to
discuss ways of advancing the peace process.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Budget help for jobless 'must include training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many employers will not use the chancellor's key Budget measures to
encourage the recruitment of the long-term jobless unless the government
abandons cuts in its training programmes and concentrates on providing the
unemployed with skills.
This was the main judgment yesterday on the centrepiece of Mr Kenneth
Clarke's Budget from the UK's most influential employer organisations, the
Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors.
'The worry is employers are being asked to hire workers who have been
without a job for over two years, but at present few of them have been
trained. For companies it comes down to a question of their employability,'
said Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's social affairs director.
The main measures to encourage employers to recruit the long-term unemployed
were: a 0.6 per cent cut in their National Insurance contributions for low
earners; a 12-month NI rebate for each worker hired after two years of
unemployment; an extension of the two existing recruitment incentives. A
recent CBI survey of the long-term unemployed found the biggest barrier to
hiring among employers was their lack of 'suitable experience or
qualifications'.
The CBI has been urging the government to improve the skills of the
unemployed. 'A greater proportion of long-term unemployed people need to be
persuaded of the value of training and skills improvement,' said the CBI.
The Institute of Directors added its voice to the call for improved
government training for the long-term unemployed.
'Many of our council members have already told us today unprompted that the
Budget's employment measures will have no effect on their recruitment
decisions,' said Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the IOD's policy unit.
She added: 'They are looking for the best person for the job in a highly
competitive labour market. It would have been more sensible for the
chancellor to remove some of the many regulations and cost burdens that
discourage employers from hiring more labour.'
Several leading companies were sceptical about the likely effects of the
Budget's employment measures.
Vauxhall Motors said it was 'unlikely' the company would recruit people who
had not worked for two years or more. 'Our task is to make ourselves
relentlessly competitive.'
Rover car group said it was 'possible' the company would hire some long-term
jobless but added 'those concerned would have to fulfil other criteria
before getting a job with us, like being capable of reaching the skill
levels required'.
Imperial Chemical Industries said the company tended to recruit school
leavers and graduates. 'We would not lower our skill demands for employees.
That would not do anybody any favours,' it said.
The Trades Union Congress warned that 'any strategy for full employment must
address the skills and qualifications of unemployed workers with a
significant expansion of training facilities'.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Hopes for Bosnia peace hit as Serbs snub Boutros Ghali
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of securing an immediate Bosnian ceasefire collapsed yesterday when
the defiant Bosnian Serb leadership refused to meet Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, at the UN-controlled airport in Sarajevo.
The meeting had been set to revive the peace process by ending the political
isolation of the Bosnian Serbs. There were also hopes that it would revive
the strained credibility of the UN as a mediator in the Bosnian war.
However, Mr Boutros Ghali refused to hold talks with Serb leaders on their
territory.
Instead, the UN leader met only Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia,
who reaffirmed his acceptance of an immediate three-month ceasefire. In an
uncompromising mood, Mr Izetbegovic chastised Mr Boutros Ghali for refusing
to use his authority to support the 'legitimate government' of Bosnia.
'We are ready for negotiations when the Serb side says yes to the 'contact
group' plan,' he said in reference to the five-nation plan to divide Bosnia
roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs.
The failure of Mr Boutros Ghali's Bosnian diplomacy came as Mr Robert Dole,
the incoming US Senate majority leader, sought to play down the rift in
transatlantic relations caused by the deepening crisis in Bosnia.
After talks in London with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Dole said
he was concerned that the Nato alliance should not be damaged by the
differences in approach of the US and its European allies.
But British ministers indicated that Mr Major had told Mr Dole his recent
criticism of the peacekeeping role in Bosnia of France and the UK threatened
to derail last-ditch efforts to restore peace.
For his part, Mr Dole continued to press the case for a lifting of the arms
embargo on the Bosnian Moslems combined with Nato air strikes against the
Serbs. That view was backed strongly by Baroness Thatcher, the former UK
prime minister, who sharply criticised Mr Major's government for not taking
stronger action against the Serbs.
Before leaving Sarajevo, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that the UN would pull out
of Bosnia unless the warring parties agreed to a ceasefire and halted their
harassment of the peacekeepers.
Mr Jovan Zametica, adviser to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
said he had refused to meet Mr Boutros Ghali at the airport because 'the
Serb side insisted on equal treatment for the warring parties'.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst is showing atypical dynamism. Yesterday's results were better than
expected. That was partly due to an early dividend from its PVC
joint-venture. But aggressive cost reduction also played an important role:
the number of parent company employees has fallen 12 per cent year on year.
Margins may still look low by comparison with other German chemicals groups,
but these have been depressed by restructuring charges.
Mr Jurgen Dormann, who became chairman this year, has also been sorting out
Hoechst's problem businesses. The dyestuffs, fibres and acrylics operations
have each been spun off or merged with other groups. Yesterday Mr Dormann
publicly announced he would strengthen the drugs business by making a US
acquisition. It certainly needs help: margins last year were just 10 per
cent compared with Bayer's 19 per cent. An acquisition will not be a
panacea. It may add market share but more will be needed to boost Hoechst's
unproductive research and development.
Although Hoechst's pre-tax profits rose 83 per cent during the first nine
months, its shares are where they started the year - primarily because of
worries about the US economy. Until a drugs deal is announced, they will
probably continue to tread water. Hoechst's cash-flow may be substantial.
But unlike BASF and Bayer, it has net debt, making investors more concerned
about acquisitions. Provided the group can allay such fears, the combination
of strong volume growth and the full benefit of price rises should drive
Hoechst's shares forward.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Private finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's private finance initiative has so far been characterised by much
noise and little action. The chancellor's claim this week that Pounds 5bn of
contracts would be awarded by the end of 1995 may prove accurate but that is
not saying much: for a start, the figure includes the Pounds 2.7bn Channel
tunnel rail link which is not scheduled to finish until 2002. In the short
term, the most the construction industry can expect from the initiative is a
palliative for the cuts in infrastructure spending announced in the Budget.
Nonetheless, there now seems sufficient political commitment to make a
success of the initiative in the long term. One effect will be to polarise
the construction sector. Companies such as John Laing and Tarmac, which have
strong enough balance sheets to make equity investments, may find the
volatility of their earnings eventually reduced. If they can properly
balance risk with return they should also generate good profits.
Smaller groups will be reduced to participating as minor partners in large
consortia. In theory, their financial weakness should trigger industry
consolidation. However, hostile bids are unlikely because little is publicly
known about the value of construction companies' contracts. Friendly mergers
are also unlikely. Most groups continue to be led by powerful personalities
reluctant to cede control.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Argyll Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have long suspected that Argyll is more vulnerable to intense
competition in food retailing than J. Sainsbury or Tesco. The fears were
borne out yesterday and, as a result, the shares fell 6 per cent despite
pre-tax profits up in line with expectations.
There are three problems. First, the decline in like-for-like sales in the
first half worsened in the first six weeks of the second half. This is
worrying since like-for-like sales are rising at Sainsbury and Tesco, which
appear to have beaten off the threat from discounters. Second, gross margins
slipped in the first half, and are unlikely to show any marked improvement
over the full year as the group continues to cut prices. Third, there will
be no announcement on the group's long-awaited restructuring, expected to
cut costs by at least Pounds 30m, until the spring. It would have been
damaging to morale to announce job cuts in the busy period ahead of
Christmas. But the group should not have given the impression earlier in the
year that details would be revealed by now.
These issues apart, the group is taking the right steps to entice
high-spending young families into its stores. Moreover, the fact that sales
per square foot are far behind its bigger rivals means there is scope for an
acceleration in earnings growth as the gap is narrowed. The shares are
unlikely to fall significantly further after yesterday's correction as they
are underpinned by a yield of nearly 6 per cent assuming a full year
dividend of 12p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: A cracking cartel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's Ecu248m fine on the European cement cartel is a
record but may have little impact on the share prices of the companies
concerned. Large penalties had already been fully discounted by the market.
In fact, the fines - at up to 6 per cent of relevant 1992 turnover - were
lower than the 10 per cent some had feared. So share prices could even
benefit a bit.
The bigger danger for cement makers would be if the Commission's crackdown
led to a more competitive market. Certainly, they would be extremely foolish
to collude to carve up the market. But collusion may not be necessary to
keep competition at bay. The high cost of transporting cement means the
market is naturally divided into local monopolies. It typically does not pay
one manufacturer to ship cement to a different territory even if prices
there are high. Nor is there much incentive to build new plants in
high-price locations. There is no need for new capacity and in any case
Pounds 100m in capital would have to be sunk into a new 1m tonne plant. The
risk that an established operator would react to a new entrant by slashing
prices is too great for most companies to contemplate.
Still, there are situations where more competition may develop. Coastal
regions are vulnerable since it is cheaper to transport cement by sea than
land. Cheap Greek imports have already had an impact on prices on the shores
of Spain and France. The French hinterland could also prove tempting to
competitors since prices there are much higher than the European average.
But so well dug-in are the French companies that a serious invasion would
require great bravery.

Cellnet's new guide to European business etiquette - Euromanners - promises
to help the Brit conducting business abroad '(avoid) any embarrassing social

Only trouble is, Cellnet itself would seem to be more urgently in need of
help than even the average clueless Brit. Take the little paragraph on how
women should dress, entitled 'view from a broad'. Or the entry on
accessories, which triumphantly reminds readers that handbags for men are
'widely known in the UK as 'pansy pouches' '.
Which casts doubt, to say the least, on the validity of any of the rest of

Benazir Bhutto and Michael Heseltine were obsequiously congratulating each

tete at the Confederation of British Industry yesterday.
The Brits seem to assume that flattery will get you everywhere and Bhutto
was, after all, the first foreign woman to become president of the Oxford
Union.
Feeling rather left out by all the talk of undergraduate days, John Major
eventually managed to butt in with a question for Bhutto as to whether she
had privatised her country's post office yet. 'I recommend it,' he threw in
mischievously.
'A little chat with an Oxford colleague will tell you all the advantages.'

It's all part of a GW promotion, Business First, which gives first class

The blurb for yesterday's 595-page offering has it as being 'impossible to

The European, the weekly newspaper founded by the late Robert Maxwell, is on
a bit of a roll these days. It is much livelier than it was in Maxwell's
day, which may reflect the fact that its new owners - the secretive Barclay
Brothers - do not seem interested in interfering in its day-to-day running.
Now the paper has recruited Bert Hardy, probably the most astute manager on
Fleet Street, as its chief executive. Bert, who retires as managing director
of Associated Newspapers at the end of the year, is knocking on a bit. But
after 52 years in Fleet Street, he should have as good a feel as anybody
whether The European has a future as a proper newspaper. His arrival
suggests that it can no longer be dismissed as just another rich man's
plaything.

Meanwhile, the prize for the most imaginative piece of post-Budget
scribbling must go to Credit Lyonnais Laing for its 26-page glossy booklet -
Kenneth: his new Budget. No one has tried harder to sell a boring Budget to
a wider audience. Starting with a flattering portrait of the chancellor, the
dust cover promises that Kenneth reveals all: how his spending disorder was
found out; how the markets forced him into a loveless marriage with Eddie;
how his private conversations were later revealed in the press, etc.
Plaudits for the book include: 'It's hard to believe it's all his own work'
(Norman Lamont), to 'Right up to the last page you don't know how much tax
you are going to be paying' (Crime Writers' Guild). However, Labour's Gordon
Brown summed it up best - 'A difficult one to follow.'

Will Sir Leon Brittan ride again? Word is that the big loser in the
share-out of portfolios among the new European commissioners could be eyeing
up one of the two vice-presidencies on offer in the new 20-member
Commission.
The posts may have been largely ceremonial to date, but the vice-presidents
will enjoy rather more room for manoeuvre if the genial new president
Jacques Santer does not assert his authority early on.
By failing to extract a consolation prize last month when he lost his
central and eastern European patches, Sir Leon has of course already passed
up his most obvious chance to go for the role. He huffed and puffed and
threatened to chuck in his entire job as commissioner for external relations
 -thereby eliciting numerous calls for him to stay in Brussels, but also
losing himself standing within the Commission.
Now friends believe his change of heart is not without its pitfalls. Hot
favourite for one of the posts is Karel van Miert, the popular Belgian
commissioner for competition policy. The five new women commissioners - led
by Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister  - meanwhile, spot an
ideal opportunity for one of their own to challenge the image of Brussels as
an exclusive male preserve. So does Sir Leon do the gentlemanly thing and
make way for a woman?

FT  01 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Iberia's woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after receiving a Pta120bn emergency injection of public funds,
Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline, says it needs a further Pta130bn
capital infusion to avert the threat of bankruptcy. If the EU is to have an
efficient airline industry and prevent the spread of state aids from
undermining competition, the European Commission must firmly reject any
proposal by the Spanish government to stump up the cash.
For Brussels to do otherwise would contradict its insistence, when it
blessed the last rescue, that Iberia seek no more handouts before 1996.
Nothing could demonstrate more clearly that the Commission lacked the
resolve to enforce its doctrine that state aids to the sector be granted on
a 'one time, last time' basis. Such a precedent would only encourage other
troubled airlines to flout EU disciplines with impunity.
Iberia's recent history is a textbook lesson in why such disciplines are
needed. Its latest crisis could probably have been avoided had the airline
been privatised in the late 1980s, while it was in profit. Instead, it was
encouraged by INI, the state holding company which owns it, to embark on an
aggressive attempt to become a global player by buying up carriers in Latin
America. The idea was that increased scale would give Iberia a central role
in an eventual restructuring of the European airline industry.
The price of this misconceived expansion has been losses on the acquisitions
equal to the value of the 1992 capital injection. A privately owned Iberia,
free to follow commercial logic rather than INI's dictates, would have had a
stronger incentive to pursue a more realistic strategy which would have
concentrated on improved productivity, not greater size.
That is particularly important in Iberia's case, since much of the
international competition it faces is from cut-price holiday charter
airlines with far lower costs. Matching its leaner rivals' efficiency is
Iberia's only hope for operating profitably. The Spanish government's
priority should be to accelerate the necessary restructuring and require
Iberia to finance it by selling assets. That process would be greatly
encouraged by setting a timetable for privatisation of the airline.
Brussels, meanwhile, needs to ensure that it maintains a line on subsidies
which is not only firm but consistent. Regrettably, the Commission's recent
record - notably its approval of FFr20bn of state aid for Air France -
suggests that this has not always been the case. To apply rules unevenly,
particularly when doing so appears to favour politically more powerful
governments, is as unsatisfactory as having no rules at all.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Small steps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Budget for jobs, perhaps, but very few of them. Mr Kenneth Clarke
demonstrated on Tuesday that he understands the UK unemployment problem
better than many of his predecessors. Regrettably, he appears only a little
more willing to do something about it.
Mr Clarke put his finger on most of the central problems facing the
country's unemployed workers in the several measures he announced: the
declining demand for low-skilled workers - especially when they have been
unemployed for some time - and the disincentives to work imposed by the
benefit system. But the effectiveness of a sniper depends on his fire-power
as well as his aim. On that score, Mr Clarke's Budget fares poorly.
As the chancellor noted, the long-term unemployed face a difficult battle
persuading employers to take them on. There is a strong case for tax breaks
targeted at these individuals. Mr Clarke followed this logic in introducing
a national insurance 'holiday' for companies which employ those who have not
worked in over two years. When it eventually comes into force, in April
1996, eligible individuals will be about 5 per cent cheaper to employers.
Welcome though this is, most employers think that human capital depreciates
rather more than this during a long period without work. Narrowly targeting
the measure to the very long-term jobless means that it will give one,
highly excluded, group a small advantage over those who have faced the same
barriers for a slightly shorter time. As with the small reduction in
employer national insurance contributions, it is difficult to believe that
many jobs will be created. At the very least, the holiday ought to have
applied to all those unemployed for over a year, and also have been
implemented sooner.
Many of the benefit changes are welcome. Preserving housing benefit for the
first four weeks after finding a job and speeding up receipt of family
credit may help lessen the financial uncertainties attached to taking
employment. But the 'fast track' procedure for receiving family credit will
never be instantaneous. Mr Clarke would have achieved rather more by
instituting a carry-over period for income support.
Fifteen per cent of non-pensioner households in the UK are out of work,
compared with 5 per cent 20 years ago. It would be unfair to say that Mr
Clarke did the least possible to help these people on Tuesday. He did at
least take several steps on the road towards bringing them back into the
workforce. He might have taken none at all. But with steps this small, it
will be a very long road.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Much ado about a little tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unfortunately, instead of analysing this week's Budget and the economic
prospects, attention is focused on how much the chancellor has saved up to
'give away' next time in the run-up to an election. In fact, no government
ever gives anything away; it merely takes more or less. But the vision of
the chancellor as Santa Claus is difficult to kill.
Even on conventional assumptions, the tax-cut discussion is spurious. The
small table shows that, based on the arithmetic of successive Budget Red
Books, the combined tax increases imposed by Norman Lamont in the first 1993
Budget and by Kenneth Clarke in the second Budget of that year amount to
Pounds 17bn per annum. This week's Budget remitted a negligible sum apart
from the temporary relief for business rates.
If the fiscal position turns out better than the Treasury's present cautious
estimates, the chancellor would still be mistaken if he did anything to
enlarge the Budget deficit or even to remit a surplus. The case for
achieving better than the Maastricht guidelines during periods of rapid
growth, to leave something in hand for a rainy day, is made by Mr Clarke's
own officials in the Red Book, and has been eloquently stated in a European
context by Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president.
In the few years from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, fashionable opinion
has swung from worrying about what to do with a budget surplus to an
obsession with what seemed to be an ever-growing fiscal hole; it is now
swinging back again. In fact, it is hardly possible to exaggerate the
cyclical and temporary elements in the fiscal swings, both past and
prospective.
The dangers of fiscal laxity are rather more subtle than financial alarmists
suppose, as we have seen from the number of times they have cried 'wolf'
over the US budget. Suppose then that Kenneth Clarke succumbs to siren
pressures from colleagues to remit some taxes in his next Budget. The small
table makes the extreme assumption that he will reduce the basic rate of tax
from 25p to 20p. It is, of course, most unlikely that he would do this other
than as part of a phased programme, the main benefit of which would be felt
after the election. It is also highly unlikely that everything available
would be concentrated on the basic rate. Some of it would be used to widen
the 20p lower rate band, and for other purposes.
But even on the extreme assumption of the table, the chancellor will only
have remitted some Pounds 10bn per annum, compared with the extra Pounds
17bn which he and his predecessor have levied in stages in their 1993
Budgets to plug the fiscal hole. If anyone wants to say that taking away 17p
and remitting 10p is a tax cut or a gift for which he or she should be
grateful, he or she is welcome to this funny use of language.
However, the absurdity is even greater. For announced tax rises represent
only part of the extra taxation imposed by government. Another part of the
increase arises from the automatic effects of economic growth on a tax
system which is indexed only for inflation and not for increases in real
income. The accompanying Treasury chart shows public sector receipts rising
from 36 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to a projected 39 1/4 per cent in
1996-97. Translated into actual cash this increased tax-take is worth over
Pounds 25bn per annum. If two-fifths of this is remitted by incautious
so-called tax cuts, the taxpayer will still end up paying a higher
proportion of his income to the government than during the Wilson-Callaghan
Labour government of 1974-79.
Let us, however, pause from crystal-gazing about next year's Budget to
celebrate the virtues of the Budget we have. It provides for a rapid move to
correct the imbalances in the public sector finances. The public sector
borrowing requirement is expected to be at the 3 per cent level required for
Emu in the Maastricht treaty by the next financial year, 1995-96. In the
year after, 1996-97, borrowing will be little higher than the level required
to finance net public capital spending: that is, the current deficit will
have all but disappeared. The PSBR itself should vanish a year or two later.
This is all expected to happen despite cautious official forecasts which
many City analysts believe understate both the rate of economic growth and
the improvement in government finances.
The specific measures to counter structural unemployment are also on the
right lines. Their main defect is that they are on too small a scale. But
now the door is open, critics should push against it, instead of indulging
in political sulks.
Indeed, anyone who reads the Economic Assessment section of the Budget Red
Book will find that Treasury economists are more up-beat on the prospect
than Kenneth Clarke was in his Budget speech. The upturn is export and
investment led: half the growth so far in 1994 comes from an improvement in
the net trade balance, arriving at a time when UK growth is faster than that
in the country's main trading partners. The balance of payments constraint
has been relegated to the dustbin where it has always belonged.
Looking ahead, the Budget Red Book has an illustrative projection of the
growth of the national income in the remainder of the 1990s. The broad
picture is that nominal GDP - which can be regarded as the national cash
flow - rises by nearly 5 per cent per annum, of which 2 3/4 percentage
points represent real growth and 2 per cent the inflation rate when the
government's low inflation objectives are achieved.
It is a pity that these medium-term projections have been removed from the
chapter on the Medium Term Financial Strategy - which has been emaciated to
the point of near-extinction. In fact medium-term movements are less
difficult to analyse than short-term changes, which are inevitably jerky and
are influenced by outside shocks which are by definition unforeseeable. The
value of the medium-term projections depends on users being adult enough to
see them as trend rates of change and not a vain attempt either to foresee,
or to eliminate, the ups and downs of the cycle.
Another reason for wanting to emphasise the medium-term projections for
nominal GDP is that they form a sensible objective for policy. A medium-term
objective for nominal spending makes more sense than the present reliance on
a target for inflation alone, but it would still put a firm limit on any
inflationary overshoot. It would also be less dependent than the present
approach on real output forecasts and guesses about the capacity gap.
The tentative medium-term projections contain other interesting information.
We are given the Treasury's estimate of trend growth as 2 to 2 1/2 per cent
per annum. The projected actual growth rates imply that there is enough
unused capacity and unused labour for above-trend growth to the end of the
century, without igniting an inflationary take-off. If the projections are
anything near the right ball park, the unemployment assumptions made for
forecasting social security spending are far too pessimistic. For they
assume that UK employment will stabilise at 2.5m, just below today's level.
Although economic prospects may be the best for 30 years, we are still in
the early stages of the upturn when policy is easy. A very early rise in
base rates is required for its own sake and to underline the low inflation
commitment.
The case for increasing interest rates does not depend merely on
hypothetical reasoning about underlying growth trends and the size of the
capacity gap. In addition there is strong survey evidence that businessmen
are looking for a chance to raise prices. Above all, the world, and
especially the European, economies are recovering much more rapidly than
expected; and this feeds into costs and prices both via rising commodity
prices and, more fundamentally, by making it easier for British producers to
adjust pay and prices upwards. Over to the next instalment of the 'Ken and
Eddie' show next week.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A fresh chance for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The autumn collapse of the rouble has brought the Russian government to the
brink of a credible attempt to stabilise the economy. There are serious
flaws in its new budget package, now awaiting the approval of both the
Russian parliament and the International Monetary Fund. But it is a
ground-breaking document nonetheless. Few would forgive either institution
if their doubts extinguished Russia's latest and best chance of laying the
foundations for stable growth.
Worked out partly in collaboration with the IMF, the draft 1995 budget marks
a decisive shift, on paper at least, from the gradualist anti-inflation
efforts of recent years. This is because further efforts to lower the budget
deficit would this time be accompanied by three safeguards which past
attempts have lacked: namely, the nominal anchor of a pegged exchange rate,
strict rules against monetising the budget deficit, and Dollars 13bn in
western support.
The plan still falls short in important respects. Tax revenues, for example
 -which have fallen to a mere 11 per cent of GDP this year - are unlikely to
meet the plan's rosy expectations. Neither are economic growth, inflation or
interest rates. This means that next year's budget deficit will not fall to
the targeted 8 per cent of GDP in 1995, down from this year's 10 per cent.
Indeed, without extra spending cuts, the chances are that it will grow
larger.
These weaknesses will have to be tackled sooner or later. But more
important, in the short run, than lowering the deficit is changing the rules
for financing it. The government hopes to fund half of next year's shortfall
through domestic bond issues, with the rest funded by a mixture of IMF
support and other foreign financing. The idea of the budget plan is that the
central bank would be barred from resorting to the printing press if the
deficit exceeded its target. If it held, the new regime would impose a
powerful new constraint on over-spending - showing that in principle at
least, the Russian authorities know what is needed to win credibility.
Here, too, the detail of the budget is over-optimistic. Only around 10 per
cent of this year's deficit had been covered by treasury bill sales by the
end of September. Real interest rates might have to rise substantially to
find enough buyers, thus further endangering the government's targets.
Opposing deputies used these arguments in criticising the budget in last
Friday's debate in parliament: they want a much less ambitious programme.
Rather than craft one of their own, however, they set up a conciliation
council, which must reach a compromise with the government by December 10.
Parliament has the power to stop the reform effort in its tracks. But it
would then have responsibility for finding a more palatable, or incremental,
alternative. The deputies have no hope of finding one. Weak demand for
government bonds is a symptom of failed gradualism. So, too, is the fact
that Russians now put half of their earnings into foreign currency.
Successfully pegging the rouble with a Dollars 5bn stabilisation fund from
the IMF would restore faith in its value. The reward would be rising demand
for roubles and government bonds, which would lower the cost of
stabilisation.
Unlike parliament, the IMF can improve Russia's chances of success. It
should work with the government to bring the package and its planned
implementation closer to its requirements. But then it should sign.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Parliamentary lunacies: British MPs' voting rules and
working practices are unnecessarily archaic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When will our politicians grow up? To judge by this week's House of Commons
vote on the Brussels budget, we have a long wait. No, I am not referring to
the substance or otherwise of Mr John Major's little local difficulty with a
bunch of Tory Europhobes who think Britannia still rules the waves. Nor is
this the occasion to think aloud about how Mr Tony Blair can reconcile a
pledge to keep Labour at the heart of Europe with voting against a financial
agreement he supports. We expect those sort of shenanigans from our
political masters.
What was sad on Monday evening was the sight of sick, and in some cases very
sick, MPs being forced to turn up at Westminster to vote on the issue. To
prove politics is a serious business, government and opposition felt it
necessary to haul their supporters from hospital beds to demonstrate in
person their loyalty. It didn't matter that friends fear for the life of one
of those who dragged himself through the voting lobbies; nor that another
was too ill to leave the car which had brought him to the Palace of
Westminster. The electorate expects such sacrifices of its legislators.
One or two MPs attempted a rational explanation. The vote on Britain's
contributions to the European Union had been turned by Mr Major into an
issue of confidence. If the government had lost, there would have been a
general election. With stakes so high, Mr Blair could not be blamed if he
refused the normal 'pairing' arrangements under which the votes of the sick
are deemed to cancel each other out.
Pull the other one. No one thought the government would lose. Mr Blair said
as much on numerous occasions even before the debate started. Once the
Ulster Unionists said they would back Mr Major, the only interesting
question was the number of Tory rebels who would be thrown out of the party.
Fair enough, conceded an old-timer. But you had to have a sense of history
about these things. Remember that Mr James Callaghan had fallen in 1979 only
because he was stupidly decent enough not to force a dying member of his
party to turn up for the fatal confidence vote. In those good old days of
minority government during the late 1970s, the courtyard of the Commons had
been full of ambulances during every vote.
So Mr Major, now shorn of his paper majority, cannot be let off the hook
which impaled Mr Callaghan. Anyway, chipped in a cabinet minister (yes a
Tory this time), the atmosphere, the uniqueness of the whole place, depended
on these moments of high drama. If we were not careful, someone would
suggest electronic voting to replace the time-honoured tradition of MPs
stumbling or being pushed in wheelchairs through the voting lobbies.
There is, of course, a simpler explanation. The powers-that-be in the
government and opposition whips' offices (there is no party politics in any
of this) will not change the present system because they trust no one. Any
arrangement which allowed the very sick to be 'paired' off instead of
turning up for important votes would depend on MPs being truthful. Some
would abuse the system by pleading the merest hint of a cold as sufficient
excuse to avoid the journey to Westminster. Even if MPs were honest about
their state of health with their own sides, you could hadly expect the
opposing whips' offices to tell each other the truth.
The same undercurrents of mutual mistrust and misguided defence of ignoble
tradition percolate the long-running debate over MPs' working hours and the
introduction of a more rational allocation of time for parliamentary
debates. For laws to be well made, it seems our legislators must preserve
the scope for late-night procedural ambushes and backroom deals between the
whips' offices.
In the next few weeks the government will announce one or two modest
reforms. Parliament will meet occasionally on Wednesday mornings. MPs will
be given more Fridays off, so that those from far-flung seats can spend more
time with their constituents. But the essential lunacies - time off in the
mornings for part-time jobs in the City and Law Courts, followed by
late-night sittings and endless wrangling over the timetable for legislation
 -will remain. So too will the voting rules which, before her death earlier
this year, obliged Ms Jo Richardson, the Labour MP, to spend the evenings of
all important debates in an ambulance parked next to the voting lobbies.
To change all this, it seems, would be to demystify Parliament, to remove
the essential adversarial quality of life at Westminster. Worse still, our
legislators might be obliged to take each other at their word. And the
politicians pretend to wonder why the voters don't trust them.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Phantom extras on the hotel bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LESLEY ABDELA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I do not know if other FT readers have minor cautionary tales of
working in the transitional states of the former Soviet Union and its
satellites, but it would be helpful to be told about the latest scams in
operation there.
So far, mine are only minor (I have not yet visited Moscow) in visiting
central Europe to conduct courses for future women leaders, for the British
Council/Foreign Office Know-How Fund/Harvard University/Undip. I would
thoroughly recommend visitors check out of their hotel and pay their bill
with at least half an hour to spare, to haggle over what exciting items turn
up on the account.
At the Novotel Europa in Sofia this month I discovered I had made phantom
calls to about five other countries, presumably in my sleep, as I certainly
did not during my waking hours, and I seemed to have developed a very large
appetite for eating several breakfasts and dinners at the same time.
Because I had to get to the airport, I paid and hared off. My feeling is
someone was making a nice income charging an imaginatively-disguised
desk-clerk tip in the bill.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Work begins on new wing: Nato is being urged to speed up its
eastwards expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, has his way, the family
quarrels in the house called Nato will soon be replaced by a breezy,
pioneering spirit as its residents set about adding a new wing to the
battered but well-constructed old building.
After an outburst of unusual rudeness between senior politicians on opposite
sides of the Atlantic over Nato policy on Bosnia, Mr Christopher will today
urge his European counterparts to stop bickering and start thinking hard
about opening the 45-year-old alliance to new members.
At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels today, he will call for a
sharp acceleration in the process of bringing ex-communist nations in
central and eastern Europe into membership.
He is not expected to name countries, but those knocking loudest at the door
are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - known as the Visegrad
states after the Hungarian town where they sealed a loose alliance.
Mr Christopher wants Nato's 16 members to hammer out the criteria and
procedures for incorporating newcomers by next spring, or autumn at the
latest. These would include the amounts they would have to spend on
reconfiguring their armed forces to integrate them into the alliance, and
how much help they could expect from Nato.
Once that process is complete, Nato should be able to make a detailed
presentation of the results to potential members. If all goes according to
the US plan, negotiations on a timetable for enlargement could start very
soon after.
On the face of it, the notion of Nato 'projecting stability eastwards' seems
absurd. The US and its European allies have been engaged in a fierce
transatlantic war of words following Serb advances in the north Bosnian
enclave of Bihac. After a US effort to win support for massive airstrikes to
defend Bihac found little backing, a disturbing note of recrimination has
entered the atmosphere. Enthusiasm for Nato appears to be dying among US
conservatives such as Senator Robert Dole, who have denounced European
faint-heartedness in Bosnia.
In the past, the global Soviet threat concentrated the allies' minds and
limited the intensity of their quarrels, but this is no longer the case.
'This is obviously not the first crisis there's been in Nato,' says Mr
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a veteran US foreign policy official, 'but we don't have
the ultimate discipline of the Soviet threat to push people into
compromise.'
This week, however, there were signs that the current phase of the quarrel
over Bosnia is dying down - at least temporarily. Even as legislators and
opinion-makers in the US and Europe have traded insults, the US
administration has quietly moved closer to its European allies over some key
questions on Bosnia.
Administration officials have acknowledged the impossibility of military
solutions in former Yugoslavia. They have also praised the European
contribution to UN ground forces, while offering to help with the messy
business of withdrawing them if that proves necessary. The US has thrown its
weight behind the peacemaking efforts of the five-nation contact group on
Bosnia - the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - and will make
proposals for an international conference on Bosnia when the group convenes
tomorrow.
Mr Arnold Kanter, a former under-secretary in the state department, says
that a reasonable interpretation of the administration's change of line 'is
that the US has decided that it is more important to save Nato than to save
Bihac'.
All this has soothed European tempers, and rescued enlargement to the east
from the realm of absurdity where it was languishing a few days ago. There
is a feeling that Nato has looked into the abyss of complete disintegration
and taken half a step backwards.
As one Nato official says, cooler heads in the alliance have realised that
'if Nato breaks up over Bosnia, that won't help the Bosnians - and it will
take away an instrument of security that is needed for other things'.
And Mr Peter Tarnoff, under-secretary of state for political affairs,
believes that enlargement could help to avert future Bosnias. In his words,
the focus of today's meeting will be 'a Nato which is reaching out to the
east, which is trying to prevent . . . repetition of what has happened in
the former Yugoslavia.'
Yet even if the name-calling over Bosnia is dying down, there are doubts as
to whether enlargement will work as the unifying enterprise for Nato members
that Washington would like to see.
All Nato members are committed in principle to enlargement, but most west
European governments are nervous about the potential damage to relations
with Russia. They hope Mr Christopher's proposals will not be too specific.
There is only one senior politician in Europe who matches, and often
outdoes, the US administration in his enthusiasm for early enlargement: Mr
Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister. He has given the impression he
does not particularly care how strongly Russia objects to this idea.
Russia's recent pronouncements suggest that opposition to the idea of its
former satellites joining Nato is hardening, at least so long as Russia
itself is excluded.
Some western politicians talk optimistically of 'reassuring' Russia and
gradually reconciling it to enlargement. But Moscow's increasing toughness
is likely to be seen by many as an argument against rapid incorporation by
Nato of the Visegrad countries.
The US has done its bit to soothe Moscow by floating some ideas on how the
53-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) could be
upgraded into the kind of European security umbrella that Russia wants so
much. But this seems unlikely to be enough to reconcile the Russians to the
idea of Nato engulfing its former satellites.
At today's Nato meeting in Brussels, and at next week's CSCE summit in
Budapest, Russia will be watching closely to see whether Nato really means
what it says about earlier enlargement.
If Russia seems uncharacteristically quiet, that could be a sign that Moscow
does not believe enlargement will happen: it expects western legislators in
more than one Nato country to balk at the financial and strategic
implications of amending the founding treaty.
If Russia calculates that this is the most likely course of events, it is in
good company: there are many western foreign policy experts who make a
similar prognosis. Desirable though enlargement might be as a unifying
project, there is a long way to go before the US can convince its allies of
the wisdom of the project.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sleaze and the new universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISTINE CHEESMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on 'sleaze' in higher education institutions ('Sleaze goes
to university after government reforms', November 29) highlights the
weaknesses of the 1988 Education Reform Act. The incidents which you quote
are, however, only a small proportion of those which have been brought to
our attention by academics employed in the higher education corporations.
Whereas the 'old' universities are governed by bodies on which there is
balanced and broad representation of both academic staff and the local
community, there is only minimum staff involvement in the governance of the
new universities and even that involvement is very strictly curtailed in the
finance and personnel areas.
Moreover, when problems occur in the 'old' universities, especially when
they concern senior staff, appeal my be made to the Visitor, who can usually
prevent a problem escalating into a scandal or cause celebre.
The model of a company without shareholders is not appropriate for the
management of academic institutions. The traditional university model was
developed over many years and produced a system where there was a level of
confidence, and yet the powers of their Visitor were then weakened by the
1992 Further and Higher Education Act. However, the generally held
confidence in the management in the traditional universities is sadly
lacking in many, if not most, 'new' universities.
The government should now realise that the Education Reform Acts are
seriously flawed and amend them, lest there be yet more incidents such as
those you mention.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: BT given no incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Of course - as Mr Ian Wheeler (Letters, November 29) indicates - BT
could fill its ducts full of optical fibre, but why should it do so?
What is the point of the company investing some Pounds 15bn in such a
broadband network when the current regulatory framework only allows it to
carry narrowband services on that network?
Britain needs a national information superhighway available virtually to all
homes and businesses in the country. However, local cable television
operators alone will never create such a ubiquitous network. BT - in
competition with many others - is prepared to make the national investment
if it is allowed to carry the full range of services that will generate the
revenues to justify that investment.
All it has at present is the government's promise of a review in 2001 of the
present regulatory constraint with no assurance that that constraint will be
lifted even then. The House of Commons select committee on trade and
industry provided an alternative scenario. The government should adopt it.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Criticisms of British Gas directors'
salaries unjustified and ignorant of new contract terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From The Chairman of British Gas
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much has been written recently about executive directors' salary
increases at British Gas, focusing principally on Cedric Brown, our chief
executive. Most of the commentary, either by the press itself or by others
reported by the press, has been critical and emotive. This criticism has
been unjustified and largely fuelled by misconception.
Cedric Brown did not determine his pay package; it was decided by the
remuneration committee of the board composed solely of non-executive
directors. Earlier this year the committee undertook a major reappraisal of
the British Gas pay structure for the executive board. This reappraisal led
to the following changes for executive directors.
Three-year rolling contracts were terminated and replaced by two-year
contracts. An annual bonus plan, which would have paid handsomely this year,
was scrapped. This decision was based on the committee's view that annual
bonuses for executive directors in British Gas's current circumstances were
now inappropriate, as well as some scepticism on the effectiveness of such
bonuses in general.
The remuneration committee also decided to terminate at the year-end British
Gas's executive share option scheme, which has many years to run before
expiring. A new, long-term, share-based incentive scheme has been designed
as a replacement. This new scheme includes performance criteria based on the
total return enjoyed by shareholders over time. Some of the executive
directors also received one-off significant salary increases to bring their
annual cash compensation to the median of a large sample of UK plcs.
These changes represent a complex set of trade-offs, but the remuneration
committee believes that the shareholders' interests have been served without
diminishing management's opportunity to earn more money if British Gas
performs.
Cedric Brown's increase was the most dramatic; however, as chief executive
he was the most underpaid. This was evidenced by the arrival of our new
financial director on the board at a salary higher than Cedric's before
these changes. Cedric Brown's current salary still places him well below the
cash compensation earned by most executives holding comparable jobs in
British industry, and below that of some chief executives leading smaller,
less complicated and less challenging businesses.
Contrary to assumptions in the press, British Gas is not a cosy monopoly
earning easy profits and high returns. Large parts of our revenue base are
now unregulated and open to competition. This is true not only in part of
our gas trading activities but in the whole of our service and retail
businesses.
We have an exploration and production business competing here and abroad
with all the world-class energy companies. It, too, operates outside the
regulatory net and it could qualify as a 'Footsie' company in its own right.
We are also deploying considerable resources overseas to exploit our skills
in gas transmission, distribution and power generation in a number of
developing countries where these skills are highly valued.
Lastly, we are engaged in one of the largest corporate restructuring
programmes ever undertaken in the UK, all designed to reduce dramatically
our costs by more than Pounds 600m per annum.
Any knowledgeable observer must surely realise that Cedric Brown's task in
leading British Gas is hardly easy sailing.
It is ludicrous to assume that the market pay for an executive can be best
validated by his changing jobs. This view is often expressed by questions
such as 'if he is underpaid why doesn't he leave?' or 'why hasn't he been
poached?' If this view drives pay decisions, executive mercenaries will do
well, but talented executives, whose experience is industry specific or who
value loyalty to their employers, will be put at a disadvantage. This would
surely be a perverse outcome of the process of determining pay.
It is hard to understand how continuing to pay Cedric Brown unfairly would
benefit anyone. It would be a hollow gesture to those British Gas employees
who have lost or will lose their jobs. What counts for them is the generous
and sympathetic redundancy terms on offer by British Gas, which so many have
already taken up.
Gas consumers have enjoyed a 20 per cent reduction in the real price of this
fuel since privatisation in 1986 (excluding VAT). An enviable record when
compared to other utilities. Moreover, following the current rebalancing
designed to create more cost-reflective pricing, gas consumers can look
forward to further price reductions through the effect of the regulatory
tariff and eventually the creation of full competition in the domestic
market.
Shareholders have nothing to gain by paying Cedric Brown less than he
deserves. The financial consequences of his success or failure will dwarf
these events. It is his performance that counts. The board has decided that
he is the right man to lead British Gas and we fully support him. The
shareholders must rely on that decision. If they believe that the board,
particularly the non-executives, are too cosy with management and
undemanding or that they lack diligence, they are wrong. There can be no
question that our non-executive directors are independent and men and women
of high integrity.
These pay decisions were made earlier this year and in the normal course of
events they would have been fully disclosed in the annual report. The
relevant information was always available for examination by any
shareholder. The timing has been described as 'insensitive'. It is hard to
visualise a 'sensitive' time for this emotive subject.
That Cedric Brown and his family have been the victims of an unjustified and
ill-informed volley of attacks is a matter for considerable regret.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: An intellectual tyranny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ANNE-CAROLE CHAMIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly argues that political correctness, in moderation, 'is
socially beneficial' ('All present and correct', November 26). Tact,
discretion, respect for others, diplomatic language, kindness and decency
have always been valued by the civilised; but they have little to do with
political correctness.
There is nothing moderate about pc. It is an intellectual tyranny that gags
open, rational discussion. It is the hallmark of a closed society that has
lost interest in the pursuit of objective truth. Far from promoting
tolerance and understanding, the repressions demanded by pc increase
paranoia, mistrust, ignorance and hatred. The enemies of political
correctness, whatever their political allegiance, are the friends of
intellectual freedom.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK should not discard criminal
justice tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TERESA WYSZOMIERSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a lifelong anglophile and civil libertarian, I was dismayed and
disappointed to learn that Parliament has recently acted severely to curtail
an accused subject's right against self-incrimination. British police are
now instructed to warn suspects that their failure to mention exculpatory
evidence at the time of arrest may strengthen the prosecution's case against
them.
The British government has therefore effectively discarded its criminal
justice tradition of requiring the burden of proof to rest squarely on the
heretofore broad shoulders of the Crown. In so doing, Britain diminishes its
reputation as the progenitor of many American liberties and fundamental
western values.
The US recently mourned the death of Erwin N Griswold, a former US solicitor
general and dean of Harvard Law School. During the 1950s, he courageously
defended the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in the face
of Senator Joseph McCarthy's war on so-called 'Fifth Amendment communists' -
alleged traitors hiding behind the Bill of Rights. According to Dean
Griswold, this privilege is 'one of the great landmarks in man's long
struggle to make himself civilised'.
I implore Great Britain, as a bastion of western civilisation, seriously to
consider Dean Griswold's fine words.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Milk processors and farmers must
recognise mutual dependence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Deborah Hargreaves's article, 'Competition likely to churn up and slim
down the dairy industry' (November 19), seems to suggest that high raw milk
prices will result in more added value products. This prognosis, we believe,
is wide of the mark.
With the exception of fresh liquid milk, all our dairy markets are exposed
to foreign competition. Our existing value-added dairy product manufacturers
have been among those hardest hit by the prices imposed by Milk Marque, with
increases typically in the 15 to 20 per cent range at a time when our
European competitors' prices have been falling. There is no overcapacity in
this sector, but there is a real danger of losing our existing value-added
markets to imports rather than seeing them develop. Who, in their right
mind, is going to invest in new capacity in the UK in this climate?
The article is dismissive of the cheddar cheese market, but is this
justifiable? Thirteen per cent of output goes into cheddar, which is a real
consumer market worth Pounds 600m per annum. Already, more than a third is
imported. Are we really saying that this large market should be abandoned to
imports altogether? Under the current pricing regime this will happen
because our manufacturers cannot compete on a 4 per cent gross margin.
There is a strong argument for seasonal cheddar production, taking advantage
of lower raw milk input costs from cheap grass feed rather than expensive
concentrates necessary for year-round production. This strategy is the basis
of the Irish industry, but throws up spurious capacity utilisations. Under
Milk Marque these cheaper input costs do not get passed on to the
manufacturer and then the consumer.
Further rationalisation of the industry is inevitable, but is a process that
has been ongoing for the past 10 years, driven mainly by the change in
distribution channel from doorstep to supermarket in liquid milk.
The fundamental Milk Marque issue remains - an uncontrolled monopoly in an
under-supplied market in which production is finite because of quotas.
Uniquely in Europe, the price UK farmers now receive is totally disconnected
from what markets will bear. High milk prices pose a threat to every dairy
market; investment is being strangled rather than stimulated.
Farmers need a healthy processing sector which can only be achieve if dairy
companies make profits to reinvest. Processors and farmers need to recognise
their mutual dependence and work together in partnership. Farmers' leaders
need to show real vision sooner rather than later.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: Dorrell delivers from a distance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So Stephen Dorrell came good. In the few months since he took over as
heritage minister this former Treasury apparatchik has kept a low profile,
avoiding operatic and theatrical first nights, even asking his staff to be
more circumspect about accepting cultural freebies. When he did appear above
the parapet he talked about tourism and Huddersfield. The arts world was
worried.
But in the Budget Dorrell delivered. The prime minister wanted to confirm
his pledge that the National Lottery would not be used as an excuse to cut
cultural funding. The Arts Council got an unexpected Pounds 5.1m increase,
and there will be less talk of arts companies closing.
Dorrell is different from past arts and heritage ministers in being wary of
going native. 'I'm more interested in expanding the arts economy rather than
drawing attention to my own enthusiasms. The department suffers from being
seen to be too closely connected with individual arts activities,' he said
yesterday. The commitment to subsidy should be taken for granted. Dorrell
wants to act as a catalyst to draw in outside cash.
There were three examples in the Budget. An extra Pounds 750,000 for the
Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme should attract Pounds 1.5m from arts
sponsors; the pools promoters have been persuaded to maintain funding the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts, which means another Pounds 20m plus a
year; and new money for the British Tourist Authority must bring more
visitors to London's cultural shrines. He is now looking at ways to attract
outside money to the arts.
With the Budget out of the way Dorrell can concentrate on the role which
enables him to make a greater mark on the nation than any government
minister in history: his chairmanship of the Millennium Commission, with its
anticipated treasure chest of Pounds 1.6bn to be spent by the end of 2000.
Dorrell is looking for the big, all embracing, Idea. So far he has scented
two - improving the natural environment; and using science for social rather
than business purposes. It is obvious that neither covers the British
Museum, the Tate, the South Bank Centre or the Cardiff Bay Opera House.
He does not discount arts and heritage projects, but he is steering these
expensive cultural structures towards the arts and heritage lottery boards:
and they are stressing their interest in helping the grass roots. The wider
arts world might be warming to Dorrell; our museum and opera house directors
may be looking rather ashen.

MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (U) Les Mayfield
CORINNA, CORINNA (PG) Jessie Nelson
CRONOS (18) Guillermo Del Toro
TO DIE FOR (15) Peter Mackenzie Litten
Can we sue Hollywood for abducting one of our leading philanthropists? We
refer to the disturbing case of Lord Richard Attenborough.
For years Lord R has been the white-whiskered Father Christmas of British
cinema. Find a selfless, hardworking movie committee anywhere in the land
and he will be on it. Watch a movie awards ceremony and he will be holding
out his ermine-fringed hat, soliciting help for that frail, lovable,
disadvantaged thing called the British film industry.
So what is he doing playing Santa Claus for the other side in Miracle On
34th Street? Short answer: making the movie bearable. Or more so than this
seasonal Hollywood tear-jerker would be without him. Attenborough is the
only class act in this remake of the 1947 schmaltzfest about a New York
department store Santa who gives everyone a Christmas to remember.
Kris Kringle, as our hero is called, materialises outside the store just
when the personnel manager needs him. The previous Santa has been falling
off his sleigh under the influence of too much Kentucky bourbon. Might Kris,
we are encouraged to ask as the plot unfolds, be the real Mr Claus? By final
reel he has spread cheer, patted children's heads, answered testing
questions on the geography of the North Pole and made everyone believe in
peace, goodwill and reindeers.
Attenborough has bonhomie written all through him. The make-up people have
been at his whiskers, curling the white moustache and giving a vertical
frisk to the white eyebrows. He looks like God after a bath and brush-up. He
cracks a lordly whip at the reindeer; shows a beaming patience with the
icky-eyed little girl he befriends who takes up so much screen time. (She is
the daughter of the store's publicity director Elizabeth Perkins.) And he
looks nobly harrowed in the climactic trial scene, when the judge must
determine if he is Santa or a fraud.
If only the film around matched its star. Written with more winsomeness than
wit by John 'Home Alone' Hughes, it is directed by Les Mayfield, who used to
make tie-in plugumentaries about other people's films (Back To The Future,
Who Framed Roger Rabbit). Miracle On 34th Street is a tie-in puffumentary
for Christmas: an on-location hype spree in snowiest Manhattan, filled with
a glutinous glow that Yuletide addicts may find appealing but no one else
will.
If Attenborough makes Miracle On 34th Street almost watchable, Whoopi
Goldberg does the same for Corinna, Corinna. Another resistible child is at
screen centre. Little Molly (Tina Majorino) has just lost her mother, and
her father (Ray Liotta) cannot cope with solo parenting as well as with a
high-pressure job writing advertising jingles.
It is hard enough finding a rhyme for 'pudding' without having to make the
things as well. So Goldberg enters: everyone's ideal cook/nanny. Soon she is
making puddings and finding a rhyme for them ('puddin''/'should'n''), and
inserting lovestruck stars in Liotta's eyes. But - political subtext time -
we are in the 1950s, so can the couple overcome racial prejudice? And will
little Molly, amid her dark-complexioned in-laws-to-be, grow up to be a good
Sixties liberal?
Writer-producer-director Jessie Nelson clearly grew up by having eight
spoonfuls of sugar every day on her cornflakes. As music swirls and hearts
climactically melt, a sweet tooth is not enough for this film: you need a
full set. But do marvel at Miss Goldberg - at that whimsy-free presence with
its brown, croaky, street-smart voice, its slow-burn reactions, its
ironising eyes that torpedo sentimentality or pretension even as they come
towards her.
More perversely scheduled for Christmas - but welcome in the circumstances -
is the Mexican horror film Cronos. At its centre is a present from Hell: a
golden bauble invented by a 16th century alchemist and now coming into the
hands (literally, with retractable steel pincers piercing his palms when he
holds it) of a modern-day antiquarian (Federico Luppi).
But he puts up with the pain. For the gruesome thing has an insect inside
which filters and rejuvenates the victim's blood, thereby conferring
immortality. Cue the film's chase subplot, with our hero pursued through
midnight streets by the plug-ugly henchman of a dying millionaire (ex-Bunuel
veteran Claudio Brook) who also covets eternal life.
Guillermo Del Toro directs as if Borges had visited him in a dream and
Hieronymus Bosch had arrived at the same time in a nightmare. Gothic
congestion is the style. The first half, in which eerie leitmotifs pile up
and plausibility waits on mystery, is spellbinding. Cameraman Guillermo
Navarro's silken chiaroscuro puts the romance into necromancy, while the
philosophy-prone dialogue - Toro himself wrote the original script - has a
mad ingenuity. Insects are God's chosen species, says the millionaire:
'Christ walked on water. So does the mosquito.'
Only near the close do we fall into the dull accounting process of
'explanation' and the routine modern-dress horror movie's search for novelty
locations. (Final showdown is around a giant neon sign atop a skyscraper
roof.) But Cronos is still, by a tall mile, the best film of the week.
To Die For is a gay comedy-weepie gauchely styled after Ghost and Truly,
Madly, Deeply. Mark (Ian Williams), after dying of Aids while looking
strangely healthy, returns to haunt his lover (Thomas Arklie). Like the
frequently returning hero of Cronos, he is dead but has no talent for lying
down. But unlike him he is dull, winsome company.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: Elton and Cyndi - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elton John is currently filling the Albert Hall for a prodigious number of
nights: well, a man must when there is a new album (Believe) to promote.
This is the new Elt, the scaled down, minimalist, version, both in
production values (just a percussionist to share his stage), and
personality. Gone are the Donald Duck outfits; the neon specs. Sure, he
wears an orange PVC suit and his one party trick, playing the piano prone
with fingers just reaching the keys, is a mild gesture for a man who used to
kick his instrument to death.
Dropping the razzmatazz is no bad idea: it always seemed a way for Elton to
hide an insecure personality behind layers of artifice. Now you get the man
himself and he seems genuinely nice: diffident, keen to please, relaxed. And
his accompanyist is Ray Cooper, who could make a garden hoe sound rhythmic.
If there is a problem it is the piano, which Elton plays very loudly,
over-dosing on arpeggios and minor chords, the keys jangling under
relentless muscle power. It endangers the subtleties in songs like 'Sorry
seems to be the hardest word' and makes the new album come across as
plangent.
But this is a minor grouse. Elton ranges far and wide across 25 years of
creativity and he does not refuse his fans the plums, even if he can only
bear to play 'Crocodile rock' as a ballad, which inevitably picks up speed.
Well over two hours later comes 'Candle in the Wind', a song which could
have been written about him rather than Marilyn Monroe but which now,
thankfully, seems a memory of a tumultuous past.
Madonna was a mistake: it should have been Cyndi Lauper. The lippie New
Yorker with the 'in your face' image, cheeky stage set, and politically
incorrect songs like 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun', should have consumed the
1980s like a hungry piranha. Instead the blonde from the boondocks got in
quick and Cyndi spent her time managing wrestlers and finding God.
But you cannot tie an outrageous ego down and now she is back with a 'Twelve
Deadly Cyns' tour which is the current hot ticket. She made an impact at the
Shepherd's Bush Empire. She needed to: the audience had been kept waiting,
and standing, two hours, thanks to that ingrained insolence pop promoters
manage to get away with.
But the very sight of this professional scream, with her flouncy tulle skirt
and frightening white wig, which she removed to reveal a yellow Worsel
Gummidge cut, was re- assuring: here was eccentricity on the grand scale. As
she passed like a parcel along the front row, squeaking out 'What's going
on', the place took off. Cyndi caught the mood and soon cast off her dress
and top to reveal a bustier a French maid might die for, and way beyond the
ambitions of most 41-year-olds.
Lauper is no fool. She has good material; a band that looks weird and sounds
fine; and the back chat that clings after more than 20 years in the
business. This led her astray in the middle of her set with some serious
statements - and a folk ballad - that killed the mood of joyous weirdness,
but when you hold in reserve songs like 'Time After Time' you cannot really
fail.

I've taken Forbidden Britain to task for its implicitly patronising
assumption that we suppose the evils it charts (unhappy marriages, adultery,
riots) to be purely modern phenomena, as if nobody in the television age
read books (or even had a memory).
Last week's film on homelessness recalled the vivid passage in A Clergyman's
Daughter where Orwell described dossing down in Trafalgar Square - in 1935.
But tonight's film on child sex abuse (9.45pm, BBC2) really does shake
complacency.
To the question of whether the media are currently exaggerating the problem
or whether it always existed, swept under the carpet, the programme gives a
disturbing answer. An octogenarian's carefully articulate account of her
sufferings at the hands of a foster-brother is movingly dignified.
She presumably, like the other speakers, represents a sort of happy ending
in her eventual ability to face the past and adjust to life. She speaks
touchingly of the good and loving man she married. But how many other lives
were ruined?

FT  01 DEC 94 / Arts: New England, hilarious but serious - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In New England, Richard Nelson has written a play at once brilliantly
accomplished and repulsively artificial. Every word, every scene, makes its
contribution to the whole. And not a word, not a scene, rings true.
Nelson is perhaps the most eminent of the several American playwrights who
now have the world premieres of their plays take place in London. New
England, set in America today, covers the events of one weekend, starting
almost at once with the onstage suicide of Harry, before the very eyes of
his cohabitrix, Alice. Harry's children and brother promptly arrive. None of
them know Alice well, and none of them have ever previously met Tom, who
happens to have arrived as Alice's weekend guest some two minutes before
Harry blew his brains out. What follows is as hilarious as it is serious. Oh
yes, and all of them are English expats living in various parts of the US:
hence the ironic title.
Nelson's brilliance is most evident in his ability to keep juggling several
dissimilar objects in the air at once. In one scene, two of Harry's children
and Tom do a jigsaw while airing various features of their own
Americanophobia, while the floorboards overhead tell everyone in the house
that Alice and Harry's brother Alfred have been having sex for the past
hour. Meanwhile, all of them are trying to come to terms with Harry's
suicide and are engaged artfully in preserving the illusion of fluent
discourse while actually jumping from subject to subject. Here and
everywhere else, Nelson can sustain separate currents of farce, misery,
pathos, satire, irony, suspense, and cultural commentary.
But so what? Even in the four or five minutes before Harry becomes the late
Harry, the lines have been ringing hollow: with the blatantly
pseudo-naturalism of their construction, their self-interruptions, their
contrived non-sequiturs, their awful theatricality. 'Take it easy, this
can't be easy' - spoken by Tom to Alice - is a minor, but typical, example
of Nelson's cleverness. What is its effect? Less to reveal Tom's efforts to
console Alice than to show us how admirable Nelson is in this little feat of
putting two apparently contradictory sentences back to back in unbroken
flow. Why is the jigsaw scene there at all? So that Harry's son Paul can
utter lines (about apportioning jigsaw areas) 'The sky is mine.' Poor
Chekhov, whose tragicomic influence is everywhere obvious, must be blushing
in his grave; for Nelson's artfulness is not what he - Chekhov - had in mind
at all.
Ironically, it is the theme for which Nelson is most renowned -
Anglo-American relations - which he has crafted least successfully here.
Most of the time, the occasional discussions that these English expats have
about the American culture in which they live are mere set pieces that could
be replaced by discussions of sex or traffic or art to the same effect (and
most of the play could be happening in England anyway).
There are, we eventually see, two plot connections between Harry's suicide
and his Americanophobe despair: the facts that he never told Alice that his
wife was still alive in England until two months ago (and was still his
wife) and that, only minutes before his suicide and before the play's start,
he had reviled his daughter Gemma on the phone for planning to marry an
illiterate gardener's assistant in New Mexico ('the barbarians are sweeping
over us'). Nelson leaves these bombs hanging unexploded in the air. Which
should be brilliant - except that the very way he shows the characters
avoiding their significance is too neat.
Nelson is often funny. There are lines and stories that make us laugh aloud,
and others at which we chuckle inwardly. On a larger scale, though, he
creates characters and situations without a jot of freshness in them. Paul's
French wife Sophie - humourless, possessive, coolly paranoid - is obviously
introduced solely as a two-dimensional comic device. Yet which of the
characters is three-dimen-sional? I could believe in none of them.
Peter Gill's production and the performances by the seven actors are exactly
in harmony with the play: polished, fluent, amusing, contrived in their
naturalism, and unconvincing. Angela Thorne is Alice; Selina Cadell and
Diana Hardcastle are Harry's daughters Elizabeth and Gemma; Duncan Bell and
Annie Corbier are Paul and his wife Sophie; David Burke doubles as Harry and
his twin brother Alfred; Mick Ford is poor Tom. Possibly the play would seem
more persuasive if it were played with more spontaneity, but that would be
to swim against the current of its writing. New England reminds us of real
life to the extent that a Faberge egg reminds us of a hen's egg.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Technology: Speeding up tax-collection - Software at work /
A radically different system was needed for new Inland Revenue
tax-collection methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One persistent theme in the search for techniques to make software easier to
build is to make its production more like a traditional engineering
activity. Software applications are increasingly 'assembled' from a set of
components - operating systems, database software and applications packages
 -rather like a car or an aeroplane.
Traditionally, software has been built in a haphazard manner with more
emphasis on the technology than on the business problem. But
'object-oriented' design aims to switch the emphasis back to the business.
The UK's Inland Revenue found itself using an object-oriented approach
almost by accident when its development team set about designing a system to
process corporate tax collection, following legislative changes. The new
rules allow UK companies to make their own tax assessments and pay
accordingly. Random audits police the system.
The Corporation Tax (CT) Pay and File system, in operation at the Revenue
since October last year, not only administers the new tax collection rules,
but forms the basis for another phase of tax change in 1996, which will
bring about 10m self-employed UK tax payers into the self-assessment system.
By using object-oriented design, the development team based in Telford in
the north of England has been able to plan the re-use of software modules in
future systems.
Although the details of object-oriented design can be complex, it starts
from a simple idea. It views the world as a set of self-contained 'objects'
that define both the data and processes needed to make the object 'work'. An
employee payslip, an invoice, a sales ledger or even an entire factory can
be viewed as objects in this way.
Each object is like a sealed black box recorder in an aeroplane. It can be
activated - but its internal workings are hidden from view. If you want to
print a payslip, for example, you send the 'payslip object' a message. It
contains all of the data it needs to format and print itself.
Object-oriented design helps to define computer software in terms that
relate directly to real things - such as a payslip.
Collection of corporate tax, like other Inland Revenue activity, is
currently undergoing changes akin to a business re-engineering exercise. The
change is comparable, for example, to a large business moving to
self-billing for its purchasing operations.
The new information technology system is, therefore, radically different
from the one it replaces. Previously, UK corporation taxes were collected
after a complicated, time-consuming assessment by the Inland Revenue and an
equally complex collection procedure.
All data processing was performed in batches after tax returns, payment
receipts and so on had been entered into the central tax database. This
batch processing system was slow, labour-intensive and required an expensive
technology support structure.
The introduction of self-assessment aims to reduce the cost of collecting
taxes - by cutting staff and technology costs. At the same time, the
batch-processing system was replaced with an on-line system, which gives
Inland Revenue staff instant access to data. 'The new system is on-line
rather than batch and aims to cut the time it takes to process changes. It
used to take three or four weeks with the batch system. Now we can offer a
better and more cost-effective service with the on-line system,' explains
Alan Ward, a senior software engineering consultant seconded to the Inland
Revenue from computer manufacturer ICL.
Ward explains that the CT Pay and File system, which handles the Revenue's
1m corporate accounts, currently supports a potential 14,000 users, although
only about 4,500 of the Revenue's staff are working directly on the system
operating the corporate tax accounts.
The system operates across a national network of personal computers running
Microsoft's Windows 3.1 and an ICL mainframe computer that manages a massive
160 gigabyte tax database.
'It was not part of the original decision to use object-oriented design,'
says Ward. 'Our priorities were to develop a new architecture to support the
application and to increase the amount of software we could re-use. We
wanted to build a system where the application was integrated at a high
level - so we could re-use large parts of an application in later
development.'
He acknowledges that object-oriented design has been an important element in
the success of the existing application. It also promises to lay a
foundation of re-usable code for the next phase of development.
This brings long-term benefits. Elements of a design can be recycled on
later systems. The Telford development team is using recycling - or 're-use'
 -to help build the expanded system for self-employed taxpayers due to go
live in 1996-97. High-level objects - or software components - are being
transferred from the CT Pay and File system for use in the new one.
'The object approach forces you to design software in modules. The result is
that we are getting re-use at all levels, which is something we did not
expect,' says Ward.
The Inland Revenue has found that object-oriented design provides a strong
base for applications software. It introduces engineering discipline and
brings long-term benefits like re-usable programs. It also helps focus
attention on business needs rather than technology.

FT  01 DEC 94 / People: Guinness - Irwin's move on record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Irwin, the first chief executive of BBC World Service
Television, has been appointed managing director of Guinness Publishing, the
book publishing arm of the drinks group.
Irwin, 46, has spent most the past 20 years working for the BBC and was one
of those involved in the early attempts to get satellite broadcasting
launched in the UK. Later he advised Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
on its move into British Satellite Broadcasting, one of the forerunners of
BSkyB.
The new managing director of Guinness Publishing was a key figure in the
founding of BBC World Service Television, which is now expanding around the
globe. Irwin has been on 'gardening leave' from the BBC since May when his
job disappeared in a reorganisation of all the overseas activities of the
Corporation carried out by Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director general.
A settlement was finally reached between Irwin and the BBC last week on what
are believed to be amicable terms.
Guinness Publishing, whose most important title is the Guinness Book of
Records, says part of Irwin's role would be to take Guinness Publishing into
the 'new media' although the company has already published a CD-ROM of the
Book of Records. The Guinness publishing arm produces dozens of other titles
 -mostly spin-offs from the Book of Records.

FT  01 DEC 94 / People: Humer heads back to Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Franz Humer, one of the top board directors at Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs
company, has resigned suddenly to 'take up a senior appointment in the
international pharmaceutical industry next year'.
Glaxo says Humer, a Swiss citizen, plans to return home to Switzerland.
Meanwhile, Roche, a Swiss drugs company, would not comment on suggestions
that Humer might take the job of head of its Pharma Operations subsidiary.
That post became vacant on November 14 when Peter Simon departed to pursue
private interests.
Humer made his intention clear to Glaxo a week ago. Although on a rolling
three-year contract - which prevents him from taking a job with a rival
company for six months - he leaves on December 1 without any severance
payment. Humer had been a main board director of Glaxo since 1989 and in
March 1993 became the director responsible for research and development,
commercial strategy, manufacturing and Latin America.
He joined Glaxo in 1981 as area controller for southern Europe and moved
through several posts to become managing director of Glaxo Pharmaceuticals
in the UK in 1987.
With a strong reputation in marketing and selling, Humer had been in the
frame to land the top job at Glaxo after Ernest Mario's departure as chief
executive in March 1993. But the position went to Sir Richard Sykes, the
research and development director.
Glaxo said yesterday that it would be examining several options for
replacing Humer or changing the structure reporting to that role. But the
company said strategy and development would 'not be affected in any way' by
his departure.
Glaxo's shares fell yesterday by 8p to 617p.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Technology: Standard rules of procedure - Alan Cane on the
resolution of a row in Europe's telecoms industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute over technical standards that has been threatening to split the
European telecommunications industry was resolved last week when a
compromise policy was agreed after more than five years of bickering.
Almost the entire membership of the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (Etsi) voted for the new policy, which ensures that companies will
not have to give up their rights to their own proprietary technology
unknowingly as part of the standards-setting process.
As a consequence, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association of America, representing large US companies including
International Business Machines, Motorola and Digital Equipment, has
withdrawn a complaint filed with the European Commission.
IBM said yesterday: 'It is a balanced and satisfactory solution for everyone
concerned.' Frede Ask, deputy director of Etsi with responsibility for legal
matters, said he was pleased that an agreement had been reached: 'I was
always in favour of the abandoned policy, which I believed was fair, but as
some of our members were unhappy, it was a clear indication that the policy
had to be changed.'
The dispute centred on the way telecommunications standards are set. Etsi is
one of three officially recognised European bodies responsible for setting
standards. Established by Brussels, it is composed of telecoms operators,
national governments, equipment manufacturers, information technology
companies and consultancies. US companies with European interests can be
members on the same terms as European-owned concerns, but when it comes to
voting, national governments and national telecommunications organisations
are in the majority.
Standards in telecommunications, as in any technical area, are vital to
progress. Setting industry-wide standards promotes competition, encourages
innovation, cuts costs and lowers prices. Europe's rag-bag of standards is
in urgent need of rationalisation. Yet after some years of wrangling, a
standards policy was approved by Etsi last year which proved impossible to
implement.
Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - the rights of a company to own its own
technological advances - proved the sticking point. Standards involve sets
of operational rules that can involve products and processes from a variety
of companies. These companies own the IPRs in their products and have
frequently invested millions in their development. Yet if progress is to be
made, they are obliged to agree to give up their IPRs so new standards can
be developed and broadly licensed. Given adequate compensation, most
companies would agree this is fair and reasonable.
Yet the Etsi proposal last year said that a company had just 90 days to
decide whether to withhold permission for a particular IPR to become part of
a standard. If it did not withhold permission, the technology became
available by default for licensing to Etsi members and non-members.
IT companies, which see their competitiveness linked to their stock of IPRs,
were outraged. Also, such is the rate of technological progress that large
companies, in particular, may not know in detail what IPRs they own or which
ones may be involved in standards Etsi is working on.
The compromise takes a quite different tack. Etsi has to approach a company
to request permission to use a piece of intellectual property it owns in
developing a standard. The company then has three months to decide whether
to give permission. The new policy says: 'IPR holders, whether members of
Etsi and their affiliates or third parties, should be adequately and fairly
rewarded for the use of their IPRs in the implementation of standards.'
If a company refuses to make its intellectual property available, it is up
to Etsi to find another way round the problem, either by investigating other
technologies or taking a different approaches.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Technology: Printer, copier and fax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second generation of combined computer printer, photocopier and fax
systems is on its way. Hewlett-Packard, the US computer maker, has launched
an OfficeJet system for the home, home-office and small-business user.
It is the first time a leading manufacturer has produced an inkjet
multifunction printing system. Previous efforts have been built around more
expensive laser printer technology and have often been more expensive to buy
than purchasing the individual components separately.
The HP OfficeJet was launched in North America last month and will be
released in Europe early next year. It is expected to sell for less than
Pounds 1,000 (it sells in the US for slightly less than Dollars 1,000) and
offers the ability to provide high-resolution printed output, to send and
receive faxes and to photocopy.
The price is still slightly more than the cost of buying the cheapest
equivalent components individually, but Hewlett-Packard is hoping that users
will be willing to pay a premium for a device that the company claims is
more than the sum of its parts.
Hewlett-Packard is using the same inkjet printing technology on the HP
OfficeJet as on the company's popular DeskJet inkjet printer range. It
promises 600 by 300 dot per inch printing resolution and uses HP's
Resolution Enhancement technology - which is designed to vary the size and
placement of the dots produced by the printer to smooth curves and edges on
individual char-acters.
The OfficeJet has a 24-page memory that enables it to store up to 24 pages
of faxed material even when it runs out of paper. It can print out stored
pages while receiving other pages.
When used as a photocopier, HP says, the OfficeJet is suitable for small
printing jobs - and it has document reduction capabilities.

FT  01 DEC 94 / People: Roger Bright - investing his authority in watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Bright, 43, a former high-flying civil servant in the Department of
Environment, is joining the new Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog
charged with protecting the private investor, as director of operations and
finance.
Bright's appointment, which takes effect next March, nearly completes the
PIA's new top management team under Collette Bowe, the chief executive. Bowe
was recruited from the Securities and Investments Board, as was Stuart
Severn, head of policy development at the PIA. Stuart Wiley, head of legal
services, comes from Lautro.
However, the PIA still needs to find a head of member relations to replace
Kit Jebens, 62, who retires at the end of the year. Jebens has been chief
executive of Lautro, whose regulatory powers are being absorbed by the PIA.
Jebens is joining Fishburn Hedges, a public relations consultancy, to help
its clients deal with regulatory bodies.
Bright joins the PIA from the Housing Corporation where he has been deputy
chief executive (finance and administration).
Before joining the Housing Corporation in 1991, Bright spent 18 years at the
Department of the Environment and had been principal private secretary to
two secretaries of state - Nicholas Ridley and Chris Patten. His last job
was heading the local government review team investigating the financing and
structure of local government.
Bright replaces Cyril Lanch who is retiring after seven years with Fimbra
and subsequently the PIA. Bright is the second deputy chief executive of the
Housing Corporation to quit in four months.
Greg Lomax, deputy chief executive (operations) left in August to be chief
executive of Thamesmead, a former GLC estate in south east London. He is
being replaced by Pam Alexander, 40, another DoE veteran, who joins in
January.
Bright's post, which is being retitled deputy chief executive (regulation
and finance) will be advertised shortly.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Accountancy: Clarke's 'lurker' worries insolvency experts -
Jim Kelly reports on possible gaps in the chancellor's plan to keep
threatened businesses afloat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every budget contains what one partner at a Big Six firm this week described
as a 'lurker': the seemingly dull detail that will actually change people's
lives far more than the trumpeted measures to promote jobs or increase
savings.
It is part of the definition of such an issue that it is not apparent, and
it is probably too early to say what Mr Kenneth Clarke's contribution to the
species is likely to be. However, for accountants, the Budget held two small
seeds of change.
Heralding a new 'rescue culture' in insolvency, the chancellor said: 'During
the recent recession, businesses, particularly small businesses, were too
often being closed down by their creditors and jobs lost before rescue
options had been properly explored.'
Mr Clarke explained that to give 'management more time to order their
affairs', a 28-day moratorium would be introduced, binding on all parties,
during which rescue prospects could be evaluated and creditors possibly
brought into an arrangement. The chancellor added: 'We are also consulting
further on a mechanism to help substitute equity for debt of firms in
administration or receivership.'
The details released by the Inland Revenue also contained the news that
'individuals will now be able to have necessary expenditure which takes
place after trading activities have ceased relieved for tax purposes against
other income or capital gains.'
'These measures,' said Mr Clarke, 'will contribute further to the creation
of a rescue culture, discouraging wasteful liquidation of sound businesses.'
The announcement prompted several partners with the big firms to remark that
this was all well and good, if a bit late, considering the position of the
economy relative to the recession which brought about the problem.
Insolvency practitioners might also argue that sound businesses are not
lost. The ownership might change through the insolvency process but that is
a different thing.
It looks as though practitioners, and others, will have to wait some time
for the vital detail missing in the chancellor's statement. The paper on
insolvency reform will possibly be with us by Christmas.
Mr Colin Bird, senior corporate recovery partner at Price Waterhouse, says
that the corporate affairs minister Mr Jonathan Evans recently reported
that, after lengthy consultation, there was a consensus in favour of the
moratorium.
There was no consensus, however, on the position of the banks during such a
moratorium. The control of assets during the moratorium period is crucial to
the moratorium issue and no answer was provided by the chancellor. The
British Bankers Association has already said it is unhappy with the
moratorium and the possible curbs it would place on the power of banks to
appoint receivers.
As Mr Bird, who is chairman of the technical committee of the Society of
Practitioners in Insolvency, says: 'You don't want to screw up the whole
basis of lending by banks to small businesses in this country.'
The issue of control during the moratorium is also central to concerns that
such a measure might give unscrupulous directors the opportunity for fraud.
Despite the chancellor's promise of 'safeguards', the public interest issue
will prove controversial. 'This is a very draconian measure and safeguards
are needed against possible abuse,' says Mr Bird.
Other questions crowd in once the concept of a moratorium is accepted. Would
a company's listing have to be suspended? 'I can't imagine not,' says Mr
Bird, considering that the calling of a moratorium would have to represent
the beginning of an insolvency period as creditors would not be paid during
the 28 days.
The suggestion from the chancellor that equity could be substituted for debt
during insolvency is, according to Mr Bird, 'mind blowing'. Although the
government is still at an early stage, Mr Bird essentially envisages debt,
other than mortgage debt, being wiped out and the equity being taken away
from the shareholders and placed with the senior creditor.
All creditors would be offered an option, valid for three months. 'This
would sure make companies solvent,' comments Mr Bird. The proposal depends
on the creation of a securities market for the options and Mr Bird wonders
if the proposals are workable despite being 'interesting economics'.
The second measure which surfaced in the Budget was self-assessment - the
biggest reform to the personal tax system since the introduction of PAYE 50
years ago. 'SA', as it is known, will be on stream by 1996-97.
Around four million people, mostly the self-employed, company directors and
partners and those with investments, currently use agents, such as
accountants, to file tax returns to the Revenue. All these returns fall
within the new system.
SA is a tax system based on figures provided by the taxpayer. The taxpayer,
or their agent, is invited to carry out an assessment of their liability on
the forms provided - but this element is not compulsory.
More fundamentally, the new system is based on current year assessment. The
tax bill for any year relates to the income in that same year and the new
system brings together all income, and capital gains, to be taxed at one
time. The new system has a set of payment dates which are fixed.
Accountants were concerned with two facets of the self-assessment which had
been extensively trailled before the Budget. First, a strict regime of
anti-avoidance measures was proposed to make sure profits and payments were
not shifted around during the transition period in order to avoid liability.
According to Mr Philip David, at Ernst &amp; Young, and a specialist on SA,
these have been watered down in the proposed Finance Bill text.
The second issue was the requirements on employers to provide the
information needed to file the SA return and penalties for failure to do so
by set times. These were published with the Budget, after lengthy
consultation, and are likely to disappoint some employers and accountants.
Mr Michael Kaltz, employer services tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'I
am astonished that the Revenue can quote figures of 80 per cent support for
the proposed extremely stringent penalty regime for 'accountants individuals
and others'. We agreed with the 65 per cent of employers who thought these
proposals were a bad idea.'
Finally SA has one other long-term repercussion for accountants. Its
introduction is planned to coincide with the development of the Electronic
Lodgement Service (ELS). This will let accountants file the returns direct
from their own computers, through a secure 'gateway', to the Inland Revenue
computerised system.
A pilot study is currently under way involving the Big Six. The problem is
that the accountants want something out of the project other than helping
the Inland Revenue cut its costs. Mr John Whiting, who heads a special
business forum looking at the project with the Revenue, and is a partner at
Price Waterhouse, says a shopping list of possible benefits have been given
to the Revenue for consideration.
This list swings from the improbable - making agents fees tax deducatable
when ELS is being used - to the extremely modest: allowing Revenue
information to flow back through the gateway to accountants. In the middle
are suggestions such as reducing the technical requirements for SA filing.
Whatever the outcome of this tussle, it will be crucial to the benefits
accountants, and their clients, can win from a system which may one day
dominate the entire UK tax regime.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Moving designs -
Lisa Bransten on plans to shake up transport advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground carriages may soon be completely wrapped in
advertisements designed to startle and impress consumers. William Apfelbaum,
head of the US company that now runs the newly privatised advertising
division of London Transport, aims to convince authorities it would be both
safe and profitable.
After 25 years in transport advertising, there are few things the chairman
and chief executive of New York-based TDI (Transportation Displays
Incorporated) likes better than putting ads on buses and trains. Now
Apfelbaum has nearly all of London to focus on since London Transport last
August sold London Transport Advertising to a 50-50 joint venture between
TDI - which manages the venture - and Hambros Group Investments, a
subsidiary of Hambros Bank Group.
London is only the beginning. The consortium is expected to announce today
that it has acquired the advertising rights for buses in at least five more
UK cities in the south-east of England, the Midlands and northern England.
Ultimately, the group would like to have a presence in the rest of the UK.
Transport advertising is already taking on a new look in London. There has
been a rush of advertising from US companies with which TDI does business in
the US - where it is the biggest transit advertising company. Popping up
increasingly on London buses, trains and Tube stations are advertisements
for fashion lines such as DKNY and Calvin Klein.
Apfelbaum would like to wrap buses and underground carriages with one
advertisement. Such total coverage has been extremely eye-catching in the
US, where, for example, TDI dressed a line of buses as sharks complete with
fin on top to promote a local sports team. Such full wraps have been carried
out on London buses, but never in the Underground.
He is out to capture consumers' attention and sees no better place than the
Tube, which he says reaches more relatively wealthy people than any other
medium. As soon as he has an advertiser willing to take on the cost, he will
propose a fully-wrapped carriage to transport officials. The idea is not
new, but this time industry observers and transport authorities believe TDI
is capable of carrying it out.
Michael Horne of London Underground says: 'This isn't the first time we've
heard these ideas, but Apfelbaum has put a lot of effort into putting
forward a structured deal. We will be looking at his proposals very
carefully and we hope we find a way of doing a deal. Personally, I'm
optimistic.'
Sales are up around 20 per cent at LTA in just the first three months since
privatisation, says Jeremy Male, the company's new managing director. The
increase is good news for the consortium which agreed to pay London
Transport more than Pounds 100m over the next six years as part of its bid
for LTA.
Previously, LTA generated sales of about Pounds 23m a year but observers
expect the TDI consortium to do rather better than that. One of Apfelbaum's
first moves was to increase the amount that sales staff could earn from
commission.
'There did not seem to be a motive for profit in this company before,
because they were just a division of a big governmental body,' he says. 'If
they made money it just disappeared, they didn't know where the money went.'
The commission strategy worked well for Apfelbaum after he was brought in by
an investor group in 1989 to salvage TDI. Company officials say 1994 should
be a record year for TDI.
Frances Dickens, head of posters at Zenith Media, the UK's biggest
media-buying company, senses new energy at LTA. Before the privatisation LTA
was 'terribly staid. If it wasn't in the rule book they wouldn't even think
about it', she says.
The TDI consortium, in contrast, 'brings a refreshing commercial way of
doing business. They are prepared to grow the business and listen to what
advertisers want'.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time to set up shop
in Japan - Openings for foreign retailers have improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, foreign retailers eyeing up Japan have been thwarted by high
costs, investment restrictions and an intricate web of wholesalers and
distributors.
But a number of factors are opening up new opportunities for overseas
chains, notably consumer taste for discounts, own-label products and
imported goods.
Toys R Us, the US toy chain, was one of the first foreign companies to move
into Japan. But others, such as Marks and Spencer, the UK clothes and food
retailer, The Gap, the US casual clothing chain, and Tati, the French
clothing retailer, are considering entering the market.
Japanese consumers' enthusiasm for expensive brands has been diminished by
the downturn in the economy and corporate earnings. Also, as more Japanese
travel abroad they have begun to question the exorbitant prices back home.
Meanwhile, the sharp appreciation of the yen has lowered the price of
imports, while stricter enforcement of antitrust law has eased the grip on
retail prices of manufacturers and distributors.
Relaxation of laws restricting large supermarkets and retailers has further
opened up the sector. This has weakened Japan's traditional retailers - both
the small 'mom-and-pop stores' and the upmarket department stores, which
until recently have been protected by a multi-layered distribution system
and old ties with the manufacturers. Many large supermarket and discount
chains that have developed their own product sourcing and distribution
routes have managed to shed their 'cheap' image, and have become mainstream
outlets in the sector.
All these developments offer new business chances for foreign companies,
says McKinsey &amp; Company, the business consultants. In a recent report* the
firm points out that Japanese businesses that have been most severely hit
are those with structural inefficiencies. Foreign companies with 'tried and
tested retailing skills' have much to contribute, either as partners for
domestic retailers or as new entrants on their own.
Traditional Japanese retailers are not only bound by established
relationships with suppliers and wholesalers; altering longstanding
organisational and management systems is difficult. For example, many large
Japanese department stores have modelled their personnel systems and
organisation on manufacturers. While main profit generation occurs on the
sales floor, many skilled and experienced managers are promoted to
administrative tasks, rather than focusing on the sales floor.
Foreign players, says McKinsey, have the advantage of being well-placed to
build relationships with suppliers from scratch, and design new ways of
operating that are beyond domestic retailers with established ties and
practices. They can also bring in new skills and systems in merchandising
and product procurement as well as new retailing strategies.
Without experience and understanding of the Japanese consumer or the retail
sector, it is essential to tie up with a Japanese partner, says McKinsey.
But while the emphasis for newcomers to Japan has been to do things the
Japanese way, McKinsey argues that relying on the Japanese partner's
traditional skills and systems could cause problems for those trying to
introduce new retailing expertise and ideas.
Toys R Us, for instance, which currently has 24 stores across the country,
cracked the conservative Japanese toy retail market with its use of direct
procurement combined with its store layout skills. However, it did lack
knowledge of running a chain in Japan, and so tied up with McDonald's Japan,
the fast food group.
'There is no need to be 'Japanised',' says Hirokazu Yamanashi, consultant at
McKinsey's in Tokyo. 'It is important not to fall in the same trap that the
Japanese players have found themselves in,' he warns.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Management (Management and Advertising): Smoking issue
smoulders - Victoria Griffith reports on a controversial US proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal government proposal to limit smoking in the workplace could
soon make private houses, clubs, cars and the outdoors the only places
people can light up, and would make cigarette marketing even more difficult
for the already embattled tobacco industry.
Hearings on the far-reaching proposal by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) will wrap up at the end of this month. Already, sparks
are flying over the possibility of sweeping changes. Cigarette maker Philip
Morris refused to testify at the OSHA hearings this week after accusing the
agency of bias against the tobacco industry.
The proposal could mean that smoking in any taxi, hotel room or restaurant
would be forbidden. Even cigarette and tobacco companies would have to post
'No Smoking' signs in their offices.
According to the proposal, setting aside a separate room for smokers within
an office building is not enough. The room would also have to be equipped
with its own ventilation system.
Even if a restaurant sets aside an all-smoking lounge, for instance,
management could not ask waiters to enter the area. Similarly, a conductor
could not be forced to walk through the smoking car of a train to collect
tickets, and a housekeeper could not clean up a hotel room in which someone
had been smoking.
The speed with which the anti-smoking movement has snowballed has caught
many by surprise. Yet OSHA says it is just trying to protect US workers.
'OSHA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and illnesses and protect
the health and safety of America's workers,' says Joseph Dear, assistant
secretary of labour for OSHA. 'We believe the evidence supports our
conclusion that air contaminants present a significant risk to employees in
indoor environments.'
The tobacco industry has been trying to garner opposition to the OSHA
proposal through a nationwide advertising campaign. 'This is nothing more
than an anti-smokers' pipe-dream,' says the Tobacco Institute. The industry
argues that proposals would outlaw smoking in private homes, since a
carpenter, repairman, or cleaner could not be asked to enter the house.
OSHA says this is simply not true. 'The agency is not proposing to regulate
smoking in private homes or private vehicles and is not banning smoking,'
says Dear. 'The objective of this proposed rule is to protect non-smoking
employees from the effects of passive smoke.'
Opposition is fiercer than OSHA may have anticipated, however. The agency
has received thousands of protest letters, a few so threatening that OSHA
handed them over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
With or without the OSHA proposal, the trend in the US is for more smoking
restrictions. Vermont and California have strict limitations in place, and
dozens of municipalities have banned smoking in all public buildings. The
new OSHA proposal, however, means cigarette restrictions would be put in
place much faster, and with more far-reaching consequences, than most
observers imagined.
The restaurant industry is one of the most outspoken opponents of the
proposal. The National Restaurant Association estimates that it will lose
Dollars 18bn a year in revenue if the smoking ban is enforced. 'People will
still go to restaurants, but they won't have the espresso, dessert or drink
they would usually enjoy with a cigarette,' says Robert Harrington, director
of technical services for the Association. 'That means they won't be
spending as much money.'
The furore over the proposal will probably guarantee that smoking in the
workplace remains a hotly contested issue. Tobacco industry advocates hope
the new Republican Congress will prevent OSHA from moving forward with its
proposal by enacting a law protecting smokers. However, anti-smoking
lobbyists point out that such a stance could be politically dangerous, as
the tobacco industry is, at the moment, extremely unpopular with voters.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Reforms of Customs work announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reforms to the way Customs and Excise carries out its work were announced
yesterday after a root-and-branch review which will result in 4,000 job
losses over the next five years.
Job cuts in the department, which is under pressure to cut costs and meet
the public spending targets set out in this week's Budget, will include 550
anti-smuggling officers and 2,000 value added tax officials.
The staffing reductions were criticised bitterly by trade union leaders
yesterday who said they were designed to pay for future tax cuts, would
damage the fight against drugs and allow significant VAT evasion.
But Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, denied that the
changes had been prompted by the need to cut costs: 'We have been moving in
this direction for some years. We have been analysing the risks and focusing
on areas where risk is greater.'
She added: 'By the year 2000, we expect our numbers to be just under 21,000
compared with the current figure of just over 25,000.'
Changes announced in the Budget on the collection of VAT - the registration
threshold is to be raised to Pounds 46,000 - will limit visits to companies
and reduce the burden on officials, said Mrs Strachan.
She envisaged more 'desk audits' at local VAT offices of traders' books
rather than visits to the workplace.
The development of the single European market had also altered the way the
department worked - shifting the workload away from ports and airports.
However, Mrs Strachan promised: 'There are not going to be any Customs-free
ports or airports.' In future there would be more concentration on catching
high-value complex smuggling and trafficking.
A further measure which will help cut costs is closer liaison with the
Inland Revenue. They are to share the same adjudicator, helplines, advice
centres, and possibly training programmes.
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the NUCPS civil service union, said:
'Cuts in the front-line fighters against drug smuggling will be paid for by
all of us in the human and cash costs of drug addiction and drug-related
crime on the streets. It is a dangerous and irresponsible decision.'
Mr Mike King, the NUCPS national officer for Customs, said: 'These cuts have
nothing to do with efficiency or effectiveness and everything to do with
finding the cash for future tax cuts to save the government at the next
election.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Tecs hail funding change as boost for unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed adults should get jobs and vocational qualifications more quickly
under the performance-related funding scheme for training announced in the
Budget, training and enterprise councils said yesterday.
But the councils, the employer-led bodies responsible for training in
England and Wales, said they were disappointed that the chancellor had cut
funding by 18 per cent.
The Tecs had sought Pounds 705m to run Training for Work, the scheme for
unemployed adults, in 1995-96, but the chancellor announced that the budget
would be Pounds 578m. Of this, 75 per cent will depend on candidates getting
a job, gaining a qualification or entering full-time higher education.
At present about 70 per cent of funding is received on a weekly basis,
regardless of how the trainee fares. Under the new system, putting a trainee
into a job will yield the highest payment and the government will also pay
the Tecs more for training people with special needs, such as the long-term
unemployed or the disabled.
Trials of performance-related funding at seven Tecs have produced
encouraging results. Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire
Tec, said the proportion of trainees getting jobs improved from 30 per cent
to 50 per cent.
Mr David Cragg, Birmingham Tec chief executive, said: 'If you pay by the
week, you are constraining training providers to use up a maximum number of
weeks per candidate. With outcome-related payment the provider has more
flexibility to customise programme lengths to individuals.'
But Tecs are concerned that the funding cuts will limit their training
provision. Mr Chris Humphries, chief executive of the Tec national council,
said: 'We are worried that the reduction in funding will make it more
difficult for Tecs to provide the longer and higher level skills training.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Civil service cuts 'to continue'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night forecast
further cuts in the size of the civil service as the constraints on public
expenditure were maintained.
He told the Commons, on the second day of the Budget debate, that the number
of civil servants had fallen by 10,000 since April. The civil service was
now smaller than at any time since Neville Chamberlain was prime minister in
1939, and the trend was set to continue, he added.
Mr Aitken attacked Labour leaders for advocating measures which, in sharp
contrast to government policy, would increase the size of the public sector
borrowing requirement.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, denounced the Budget as unfair, and
claimed it had failed to unite the nation and did nothing for its long-term
future.
To Labour cheers, he said the government had all the hallmarks of a business
on its last legs.
He likened the cabinet to the board of a company which had run out of credit
and ceased to operate as a viable entity. He said: 'This is a government in
need of liquidation and being wound up.'
Mr Aitken dismissed Mr Brown's attack as a 'pantomime performance' and
scoffed at his renewed call for a windfall tax on the profits of the
privatised utilities.
He said it would be a tax on earnings which certain utility companies -
already paying Pounds 2bn a year in corporation tax - paid out as dividends
to shareholders.
These included pension funds, which were paying them out as taxed income to
occupational pensioners.
Mr Aitken maintained that in effect Labour's windfall tax would be a new
impost on investment, an increase in corporation tax and a form of double
taxation on pensioners and shareholders.
He insisted that the main element in the Budget was the commitment to sound
public finances - a vital factor in maintaining Britain's standing in
international markets.
Mr Aitken said this was 'very important with regard to judgment on interest
rates and currency rates'.
Mr Aitken described it as a 'courageous, cautious and correct Budget'.
He questioned whether it was possible for government action to create the
so-called 'feelgood factor' which was supposed to be lacking among large
sections of the population.
There had been a revolution of change and public attitudes had yet to become
accustomed to low inflation and the shift in expenditure. Mr Aitken
acknowledged that it was particularly difficult to adjust to the loss of the
expectation of life-long employment in one job. He said: 'I believe that,
sooner or later, the electorate will come to see that the chancellor's
Budget does respond to the anxieties and insecurity factors I have
mentioned.'
Anxiety among Tory MPs about the government's refusal to reconsider
increasing value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17 1/2 per
cent from next April was underlined by Sir Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton
Kemptown, and Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West.
Mr David Heathcoat Amory, paymaster general, sought to allay fears about the
adequacy of the compensation package to be provided for pensioners.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Public sector fears jobs toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public sector workers may face nearly 250,000 job losses if their pay is to
keep pace with government forecasts for pay rises in the private sector in
1995-96.
Official estimates published with the Budget predict that average earnings
in the next financial year will rise by as much as 4.5 per cent, compared
with a 3.5 per cent average earnings increase expected for the current
financial year.
The Treasury is determined to maintain its four-year pay bill freeze for the
UK's 5.5m public sector workers and insists on a 10 per cent cut in real
terms in public service running costs over the same period. It is planned to
reduce government department running costs in cash terms from Pounds 15bn in
1994-95 to Pounds 14.6bn in 1997-98. Local authority spending is to be
frozen at the Pounds 73.4bn figure for the current financial year through
1995-96.
In the first 18 months of the public sector pay policy that came into force
in November 1992 more than 420,000 jobs disappeared from the public sector,
helping to fund pay rises and enabling public sector wage settlements to
keep broadly in line with those in the private sector.
Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation, said
yesterday that it would need an added Pounds 450m in spending in the public
sector to fund earnings increases of 4.5 per cent.
He said: 'The only way this could be done is by reducing dramatically the
number of jobs in the public sector, unless the government expects to see a
widening gap between wage rises in the private and public services.
'It is simply not possible to achieve efficiency savings as high as 4.5 per
cent in a single year. Every 1 per cent rise in earnings means the loss of
around 50,000 public sector jobs.'
The Red Book issued with Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget says: 'Central
government departments are expected to offset, or more than offset, pay and
price increases through efficiencies and other economies. Budgetary
provision for the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable
basis.'
In its analysis of the Budget the Trades Union Congress estimates that the
planned cuts in public capital spending in the next three years - which
amount to a 12 per cent reduction in real terms or the equivalent of Pounds
3.6bn - will lead to 160,000 jobs being lost across the economy.
The TUC calculates that the four-year freeze on cash spending of government
departments will lead to a reduction of a further 100,000 jobs.
It says: 'The chancellor referred to civil service numbers falling
'significantly' below 500,000 over the next four years. As the original
plans envisaged staffing levels of 524,000 by 1996-97, it is clear that the
staffing reductions must be far more severe to meet the chancellor's
expectations.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Economy growth to continue at 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is set for several years of good, steady growth and still has spare
capacity in the economy, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Clarke, briefing journalists the day after his second Budget, said some
parts of the economy were 'extremely flat'.
In this context, he mentioned 'anything to do with the housing market, for
instance'.
The chancellor indicated that the economy could continue to run at about its
current growth rate of 4 per cent for the time being, with the government
'keeping a close eye on things'.
He said the government's duty was to prolong the upturn and minimise
downturns.
Mr Clarke, looking rather subdued after two strenuous days of speech making
in the Commons, refused to be drawn on whether the time was approaching for
a new rise in bank base rates from the 5.75 per cent set in September.
He said, however, that inflation forecasts had tended to be extremely
pessimistic.
The chancellor was also reticent about the prospect for tax cuts in future
budgets. He underlined that he would not cut taxes until it was economically
prudent to do so, and that he would not take risks with inflation.
Mr Clarke stressed that the government did not have a target for the public
sector borrowing requirement that would trigger tax cuts. The timing of any
cuts was a matter of judgment.
Mr Clarke said the government's objective was still to bring the public
finances to balance in the medium term. The PSBR would be less cause for
concern, however, after it ceased to exceed the government's net capital
expenditure.
Mr Clarke said in his Budget speech on Tuesday that borrowing would be
'approximately equal' to capital spending by 1996-97.
He also explained why the government had decided to limit its scheme for a
one year employers' national insurance 'holiday' to cases where the employee
had been jobless for more than two years.
To pitch the scheme, which is due to take effect from 1996, at those who had
been out of work for less than two years would have picked up a lot of 'dead
weight' of people who would have got a job anyway, he said.
If a person had been out of work for two years then he or she was getting
'seriously stuck' in the labour market.
Limiting the scheme to those without jobs for two years enabled the
government to make it attractive to employers and 'get them to do something
they otherwise would not do', he said.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Clarke left pondering a return trip to Dudley -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good economics is good politics. It is a phrase that Mr Kenneth Clarke has
used many times since his appointment as chancellor 18 months ago. He
repeated it yesterday and sounded once again as if he meant it. Not everyone
in the government shares his confidence.
Mr John Major will not now face a leadership contest this year. When it came
to the crunch not enough of the malcontents were willing to risk putting
their names to a challenge.
Crucially, the prime minister's enemies on the left of the party judged that
they could not join forces with the Eurosceptic irreconcilables without
tainting the eventual candidacies of Mr Michael Heseltine or Mr Clarke.
But the leadership speculation will go away only if and when the
government's dire position in the opinion polls starts to improve
significantly.
Just as the Budget left Tory MPs expecting tax cuts next year, so the
passing of the deadline for a challenge to the prime minister was followed
by talk of a contest next year. Mr Major cannot eschew populism with the
same confidence as his chancellor.
Mr Clarke did not expect rave reviews for the Budget. He was as conscious as
anyone that Mr Tony Blair would exploit to the full the planned increase
from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in value added tax on domestic fuel. He
expects the government to win next week's procedural vote which would allow
Labour to re-open the issue. But he cannot be sure.
More broadly, a neutral package which left untouched the Pounds 6bn in tax
rises due next year was hardly calculated to nurture a feelgood factor in
the country. The raft of micro measures to ease the transition for the
long-term jobless from benefit to employment were not susceptible to easy
tabloid headlines. Nor was the package for small businesses.
As Mr John Maples pointed out in his now-celebrated memorandum to the prime
minister, real incomes for the average family are expected to fall again
next year. An economic recovery driven by exports and financing a huge cut
in borrowing may be virtuous. It is not voter-friendly.
So Mr Clarke's message to Tory MPs yesterday was once again an exhortation
to keep their nerve. The political gains from a strong economic recovery,
unthreatened yet from any signs of an upsurge in inflation, would
materialise before the general election - as long as the Tory party stopped
panicking.
But he was self-consciously Delphic about the prospects for the tax cuts
that every Tory MP now expects before the general election. He did not want
to commit himself a year in advance of the next Budget.
The chancellor is convinced that the government will reap the political
rewards from lower taxes only if the electorate believes they are
sustainable. But he thinks he has done enough now with the public finances
at least to give himself the option in 1995 and 1996. He knows also that
without the hope of sizeable tax cuts, many Tory MPs would already be
packing their bags.
By and large the package added to Mr Clarke's reputation as the leading
heavyweight in a government not overburdened with great political figures.
Even those on the right who loathe his pro-Europeanism tend to respect the
chancellor's political nerve.
The speculation about tax cuts, however, will be matched soon by the reality
of the public spending squeeze. In real terms Mr Clarke's figures allow for
growth in spending of less than 0.5 per cent between now and the election.
Next year he expects a real cut. Tory MPs applauded the cuts. Some of the
right grumbled that the axe should have cut much deeper. Few thought through
the implications for their constituents.
For all his protestations that key elements of the welfare state will be
protected, Mr Clarke is proposing a draconian regime. At best the figures in
the Red Book suggest that public services will not share in any of the
benefits of economic growth. At worst, there will be a real decline in
provision in transport, housing and, quite possibly, health and education.
Cynics at Westminster were insistent that the targets would not be met. Mr
Clarke would relax them before the general election. But either way it is
not going to be much fun for the next three years to work in the welfare
state. Doctors, nurses, street-cleaners and teachers are voters too.
Mr Clarke's breezy self-confidence did not disguise the short-term
difficulties of a government living from week to week. Next week's vote on
VAT is not the only hurdle before Mr Major can call a much-need Christmas
respite.
Some time ago, when he was being attacked by the opposition for reneging on
the government's 1992 promises to cut taxes, Mr Clarke insisted that he
would not be constrained by promises made 'on a wet night in Dudley'.
In two weeks' time the electors of Dudley have the opportunity to take their
revenge in a by-election the Tories seem certain to lose.
The chancellor has yet to decide whether to hit the campaign trail.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Reaction tempered by government's poor record of
cuts - Philip Coggan on doubts about the chancellor's spending plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When chancellors promise to cut public spending it is all too often a case
of 'give me chastity, but not yet'.
City reaction to the chancellor's ambitious plans for cutting the real -
after inflation - growth of public spending, was yesterday tempered by the
government's poor record of achieving actual cuts.
In the last Budget the chancellor forecast that in the current fiscal year,
1994-95, the control total - the core, mainly non-cyclical, elements of
spending - would fall by a real 1.25 per cent.
In fact, it is now set to rise by 1.4 per cent.
This spending overshoot, allied to lower than expected tax receipts, helped
explain part of the market's disappointment with the Budget. Some analysts
had forecast that this year's public sector borrowing requirement would be
as low as Pounds 30bn. The chancellor predicted a figure of Pounds 34.5bn.
To be fair, the real spending overshoot in 1994-95 has been due to
inflation, which came in at a lower rate than had been expected when
departments were set their nominal spending targets.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'It's not
that they've exceeded their nominal targets, it's just that the nominal
targets mean more in real terms.'
The chancellor has forecast a real cut of 0.8 per cent in the control total
for 1995-96. In nominal terms this translates into a reduction of Pounds
7bn, rather bigger than the Pounds 5bn many analysts had been expecting.
Mr Darren Winder, UK economist at SG Warburg, said: 'The 1995-96 figure is a
demanding one and more demanding than the one they set themselves last year,
which they didn't meet.'
The economics team at Goldman Sachs is more sanguine. It said: 'In real
terms, the government's public spending plans are intended to be much
tighter next year than envisaged last November.
'This is because the government hopes to claw back the overshoot in real
government spending that has taken place this year.
'Although the plans sound extremely ambitious, they seem reasonably
realistic for 1995-96.'
This year's cuts are mainly due to lower than expected inflation and the
time-honoured expedient of reducing the contingency reserve, the piggy bank
set aside to cover unforeseen events such as the Gulf war.
Some analysts had hoped that the contingency reserve might be abolished,
leading to the more optimistic predictions of spending cuts made before the
Budget.
Nevertheless, in 1995-96 the reserve has been cut from Pounds 7bn to Pounds
3bn, contributing more than half of the reduction in the control total.
Mr Bootle points out that the retention of the reserve, which amounts to
Pounds 9bn in 1997-98, gives the chancellor a margin for error he can draw
on when making tax cuts in future years.
There is certainly suspicion in the City that the chancellor, having played
the role of Mr Scrooge this year, will turn into the more profligate Mr
Micawber as the election approaches.
The Kleinwort Benson economics team believes that 'next year's Budget is
likely to contain significant tax cuts and public spending increases'. The
team points out that 'in real terms general government consumption has risen
in every election year, with the exception of 1970, which Labour lost'.
Mr Winder suggested that the government's long-term forecasts are also
suspect, given the expectations of 2.75 per cent annual GDP growth in the
last few years of the decade. This is well ahead of the long-term growth
rate of the UK economy.
The Treasury's long-term growth assumption has changed three times since
1992. Mr Winder said: 'The Treasury may be leaving itself open to
accusations of projecting a growth rate which allows it to present whatever
medium-term PSBR projections may suit.'
Given the doubts about the scope for reductions in spending, and the
expectations of tax cuts, there is accordingly deep cynicism about
projections of a budget surplus by the end of the decade.
The Kleinwort Benson team said: 'With an election to win, we doubt whether
there will be a public sector debt repayment this century.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Tuesday's vote is the first of at least two hurdles Labour must clear
if it is to block the proposed increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in
the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel.
If Labour wins this vote, with the help of the other opposition parties and
a few Tory rebels, the effect would be to enable MPs to table amendments or
new clauses on the subject. These could be considered during the Commons'
detailed scrutiny of the finance bill which implements the Budget.
Labour might choose to table an amendment at the committee stage. But party
strategists think it would be unlikely to win the day. This is because they
think it would be difficult to ensure the amendment was voted on by all MPs,
as opposed to the standing committee set up specifically to scrutinise the
bill.
The standing committee usually consists of between 20 and 30 MPs, with the
government expecting to command a majority capable of overturning such
controversial amendments.
Labour strategists believe their prospects are much better in the subsequent
report stage, where they would be able to table a new clause on VAT on which
all MPs could vote.
If the government thought it was in danger of losing this vote it might
consider saying that it regarded the issue as a matter of confidence in an
effort to turn the tables.
It is hard to see how the government could avoid abandoning the proposed
increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent if the vote nevertheless went
Labour's way, since it could not contemplate voting against the entire
finance bill at the third reading.
There is an outside chance the government might try to devise a way of
wording a subsequent confidence motion so as to override the enforced
U-turn. Government business managers indicated yesterday that this was
unlikely.

Mr Michael Zarraga, headmaster of St Thomas More Roman Catholic
Comprehensive in Blaydon, Tyne and Wear, by his own admission is not a
'brownie points man'.
'I don't go into any initiative for the sake of being a good boy,' he says.
But when the government launched the technology college initiative, Mr
Zarraga jumped at the opportunity to gain more resources and added impetus
for the objectives he already had for his school.
Raising Pounds 100,000, mostly in the form of equipment, from industry was
time-consuming but worthwhile, he says. Together with the government's
matching Pounds 100,000 capital grant and its annual maintenance grant of
Pounds 100 per pupil for three years, the school will benefit from a total
injection in cash and kind of more than Pounds 500,000 - a substantial
increase in the sums it has discretion in spending.
But Mr Zarraga says its commitment to a broad curriculum will remain. 'We
wouldn't say that we are specialising in maths, science and technology; our
ambition is to be excellent in maths, science and technology as well as
English, foreign languages, music and the arts.'
A 1,150-pupil comprehensive founded in the 1960s as a secondary modern, St
Thomas More has a stronger than average academic performance in spite of its
mixed catchment area, including inner city parts of Gateshead.
Mr Zarraga does not believe the technology college concept is unfair to
schools not participating. 'If you can't give it to everybody you give it to
those which have demonstrated they have the resources to use it correctly
and develop courses and ideas for other people.'
The biggest private sector sponsor was Komatsu UK, the locally based
Japanese-owned earthmoving equipment manufacturer. It gave Pounds 28,650 of
computer controlled robotic equipment and learning kits.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Lilley confirms government plans to overcome
benefit fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lilley yesterday confirmed that the government would be pushing ahead
with plans to combat benefit fraud by introducing swipe cards with which
welfare payments could be withdrawn.
Mr Lilley told MPs in a statement to the Commons that the government would
launch a computerised system for benefit payments in 1996.
The new system will be partly funded by private-sector capital and will mean
strengthening the post office network. Mr Lilley said nine companies had
submitted proposals to be prime contractors for the system.
He said: 'The card we choose must be easy and acceptable to use, especially
for pensioners.'
He also announced that the government would press ahead with plans to reduce
fraud by improving co-ordination between different local authorities.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Rueful companies decipher chancellor's rates
decision - Simon London, Ian Hamilton Fazey and Paul Cheeseright on the
Budget's business cashflow effects for north and south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's announcement on business rates will have a greater direct
impact on the cashflow of British business next year than any other element
of the Budget.
The amount companies pay under the uniform business rate system, introduced
in 1990, depends on a national rate in the pound set by government and on
the rental value of individual properties, revalued every five years.
The rate in the pound announced on Tuesday is not controversial. In England,
the uniform business rate for 1995-96 will be 43.2p, only a slight increase
from 42.3p this year.
Fluctuations in property values since the last revaluation should, however,
have led to a huge shift in the rates burden from the south of the country
to the north and the Midlands.
The chancellor decided to prevent this shift by capping rates rises in the
north and limiting reductions in the south. That decision drew fierce
criticism.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman of the commercial property panel of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'The transitional arrangements are
unjust and will damage the competitiveness of central London in the European
context.'
Even winners in the north felt that the arrangements were too harsh on those
in the south of the country.
Mr David Wilkinson, director of Bradford chamber of commerce, said: 'Our
view has been consistent for five years. Losers should be cushioned against
increases, paid for by the Treasury. Gainers should get all of the benefit
now.'
Property values in London and the south-east have plummeted since 1988, when
the last rating revaluation was carried out, so occupiers in these areas
should, in theory, see their rates fall by up to 60 per cent.
Yet in central Birmingham, which has the biggest concentration of offices in
the Midlands, there was a surge in values between 1988 and 1993, when office
rents rose from Pounds 10 a sq ft to slightly less than Pounds 20. In
theory, rates should double.
The chancellor clearly felt that companies should not be saddled with big
one-off increases. Rate rises for occupiers of large properties - with
rateable values of more than Pounds 10,000 outside London - will therefore
be limited to 10 per cent next year in real terms.
This 'phasing' of increases will be paid for partly by the Treasury - which
is providing Pounds 605m next year to keep rate rises low - and partly by
companies which will not be allowed the rate reductions they expected.
For big buildings rates reductions are being restricted to 5 per cent in
real terms. Occupiers of smaller buildings will be allowed maximum
reductions of 10 per cent in real terms.
Most occupiers and property advisers expected the government to introduce
some form of phasing, as it did when the uniform business rate was
introduced.
Gainers in the north and Midlands were allowed only a 10.5 per cent
reduction in 1990-91, 13 per cent the next year, 22 per cent in 1993-94, and
the rest this year.
But the extremely slow phasing of rate reductions announced in the Budget
prompted property professionals to question why the government had bothered
to revalue buildings at all.
Mr Mark Henderson, rating director at DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the surveyors,
said: 'The details of the transitional relief system undermine the whole
purpose of the revaluation.'
Companies located in and around London will certainly be paying more next
year than expected.
The average central London office occupier currently pays business rates of
about Pounds 16 per sq ft. Based on property values at April this year, that
liability should have fallen by about 58 per cent to Pounds 6.75 per sq ft.
Under the transitional arrangements outlined in the Budget, however,
occupiers will still be paying Pounds 15.55 per sq ft next year - a saving
of only 45p.
The wider question is whether central London occupiers paying more than they
expected in rates next year will be less able to pay high rents.
If so, the property market in the capital, which was devastated by
recession, will recover much more slowly than expected.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Gilt repo market proposals criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few UK government bond market participants were surprised by the Bank of
England's proposals on Tuesday for an open repurchase - or repo - market for
gilts.
Some were disappointed, however, that the plans were less specific than they
had hoped and were not accompanied by a change in gilt dividend taxation.
This, they argue, would facilitate the efficient functioning of a fully
fledged repo market.
Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at securities house Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, said: 'A lot of people had hoped to see clear outlines of the planned
repo market and a definite starting date.' Instead, a lengthy consultation
process lies ahead, raising concern that implementation could be delayed
beyond July 1995, the earliest possible starting date suggested by the Bank.
A repo is a loan agreement between two parties in which bonds act as
collateral. The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the
counterparty and in return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the
original bond owner agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back
sum will be higher than the original cash amount, the difference reflecting
the rate of interest on the loan.
Many big bond markets have well-developed repo markets. The UK authorities
are hoping that a gilt repo market will increase the gilt market's liquidity
and efficiency, thus attracting increased investor interest and reducing
yields.
In the next two months, the central bank and gilt market practitioners will
flesh out the Bank's outlines. After spending the last year in close
consultation with gilt-edged marketmakers, Stock Exchange money brokers,
banks and investment institutions, the Bank on Tuesday presented its
long-awaited discussion paper setting out the framework for such a market.
It has asked market participants for comments by January 31.
Since a move to an open gilt repo system may have significant tax
implications, the Inland Revenue is to consult market participants.
Gilt market operators have been calling for the abolition of the 25 per cent
withholding tax on gilt coupons, which would allow interest to be paid gross
rather than net of tax. Although a move to gross coupon payment is not a
prerequisite for establishing a repo system, many say it would make it much
more efficient.
'Most other markets incorporate gross paying coupons,' said Mr Daniel
Corrigan, head of repo trading at NatWest Markets. 'If the authorities move
in this direction, whilst it may be costly in terms of forgone revenue, it
will attract new investors and should support the gilt market.'
However, a move to gross dividend payment could mean further delay, some
warn. 'If the Revenue decides to move to gross payment of gilt coupons, it
can only do the switch at the beginning of a tax year, which would probably
take us to April 1996,' says Mr Adams at BZW. The Bank could, of course,
start a repo market before any tax changes were made, he says. 'They could
take a piecemeal approach, but it would seem a bit silly to do it that way,'
Mr Adams adds.

Bank of England.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Inefficient budget management leading to
deprivation for schools
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inefficient budget management is depriving schools of Pounds 800m each year
which should be spent on resources and employing extra teachers, a teachers'
union leader said yesterday.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said that in primary schools
7.33 per cent of funds delegated to them by local education authorities
remained unspent at the end of the year.
He claimed that local management of schools, which forces authorities to
delegate more funding decisions to schools, had 'forced every school to act
as its own insurance company', while some were guilty of the 'squirrel
mentality'.
He cited research by the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog,
which predicted that local management would lead to an overall increase in
costs.
Other teachers' unions said that Mr de Gruchy was exaggerating the problem.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said Mr de Gruchy was 'playing into the hands of politicians by
giving the impression of large amounts of money being held back which ought
to be spent on pupils'.
The Department for Education indicated that no change in regulations on
school budgets was likely, although heads and governors should 'think
carefully' about the amount kept in balances.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Boost for specialist colleges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government hopes to convert 250 secondary schools into specialist
technology and modern language colleges over the next three years using
Pounds 60m released by the Budget, it was announced yesterday.
Fifty schools have become technology colleges since the scheme was piloted
earlier this year, with government expenditure of Pounds 6m. Funding will
expand to Pounds 15m in 1995-96 and to Pounds 25m in 1996-97.
The new scheme represents a sharp expansion, however, as it will be open to
all local authority schools in England to apply for funds. Until now funds
have been restricted to grant-maintained schools which have opted out of
local authority control and voluntary-aided schools - usually church
foundations.
Teachers' unions criticised the scheme as a thinly disguised financial
incentive for schools to opt out of their local authorities.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, said the government had offered 'a bribe which was not working'
and welcomed the move to offer funds to local authority schools.
Sir Cyril Taylor, of the City Technology Colleges Trust, which has
co-ordinated fund-raising for the initiative, said the relaxed restrictions
would allow technology colleges to be established in Manchester and
Liverpool for the first time.
He added that he hoped to provide a specialist college in every local
education authority in England, and that schools would compete for the new
status. 'We will be able to choose the best schools, not just from academic
ability, but from their motivation to be specialists in maths, science and
technology,' he said.
Under the scheme, schools must raise at least Pounds 100,000 from the
private sector to put towards extra technology facilities. This triggers
government matching funds on a pound for pound basis, plus an extra Pounds
100 per pupil in annual maintenance grants for seven years.
Donations in kind, such as computer equipment, also qualify for matching
funds, and Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer, has provided two Derby schools
with working aircraft engines for use in technical demonstrations.
Mr Robin Squire, schools minister, said the scheme set an 'attainable
figure' for business sponsorship, following the disappointing response to
the 1988 City Technology College initiative, where businesses were asked to
provide more funds. Only 15 city technology colleges were opened.
Detailed proposals for modern languages schools will be published in
January. However, organisers expect that schools will be required to show
that they are offering intensive tuition in at least three languages,
including one 'hard' language - taken from a list likely to include Chinese,
Japanese and Russian.
Sir Cyril said Dartford Grammar School, in Kent, had already expressed an
interest in becoming a language college and he predicted strong interest
from exporters in sponsoring them.
The Confederation of British Industry strongly welcomed the plan, it said it
would encourage members to sponsor language colleges.
Further plans for creating specialist sport colleges are being handled by
the Department of National Heritage and the education department.

The reinsurance arrangements of life insurance companies are among the
targets of the government's drive to close more tax loopholes. The aim is
that from next year reinsurance should not be a way for life companies to
protect investment returns from tax, but should be confined to reducing
their exposure to particular death risks.
Tax officials will consult the life insurance industry before setting out
how the rate of return will be calculated and which types of reinsurance
will be affected.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Tax loophole on share gains closed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A tax loophole allowing investors to make unlimited tax-free gains from UK
shares was closed yesterday, just a few weeks after it became generally
known.
The chancellor announced plans to ensure that gains from securities linked
to share indices could not escape the tax net. Up to now this has been
possible if the securities were structured as both qualifying corporate
bonds, which are capital gains tax exempt, and qualifying indexed
securities, which are exempt from income tax on gains.
Most qualifying indexed securities are linked to the retail prices index, or
some other measure of inflation, but the current rules also allow for
linkage to a UK equity index.
The loophole was spotted and exploited earlier this month by Fidelity
Investment Management, with loan stock issued by Fidelity Special Values, a
new investment trust.

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Investors warned of higher risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are likely to be faced with higher risks under the Budget's
venture-capital proposals, according to fund managers in Manchester, Ian
Hamilton Fazey writes.
They were also sceptical about whether Mr Clarke's proposals could work in
the long term, although up-front tax relief would attract investors.
'The headline figures astound me,' said Mr Peter Folkman, chief executive of
the Manchester-based North of England Ventures, which is backed by Schroder,
the merchant bank, and Rickitt Mitchell, the corporate financiers.
'We as an industry invest about Pounds 1bn a year in around 1,000 projects.
Less than half is genuine development capital or start-ups. Most are
management buy-outs. The problem is not finding money to invest in projects,
but in finding good projects to invest it in,' Mr Folkman said.
He added: 'The chancellor envisages an extra Pounds 2.5bn of venture capital
investment over three years and a doubling in numbers of companies
supported. The proposals may prove very good for swelling venture capital
funds but may not yield the returns people hope.'
Mr Malcolm Edge, head of taxation for the north-west office of KPMG Peat
Marwick, said: 'The tax benefits of venture capital trusts look very
attractive - but people are going to have to choose their venture capital
fund manager very carefully.'
Mr Mike Masters, finance director of Trinity International Holdings, the
Chester-based regional newspaper publisher and a former senior manager with
the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: 'There are not enough worthwhile projects
around.
'There are plenty of projects, but venture capital managers have to look
hard to find good ones.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Rail upgrade 'to cost Pounds 800m' - West Coast
main line modernisation set to cover whole London-Scotland route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Coast main railway line between London and Scotland should be
upgraded over its entire route at a cost of Pounds 800m-Pounds 1bn, a team
studying the project said yesterday.
This would represent a more radical modernisation of the 550-mile line than
originally planned but was justified by the large savings which would be
made on maintenance costs, Mr Gil Howarth, Railtrack's director of major
projects, said.
The original proposals for the line envisaged a Pounds 500-Pounds 600m
upgrade concentrating on the oldest section between London and Crewe, with
the section to the north improved at a later unspecified date.
However, with annual maintenance costs of Pounds 150m for the line - and
track renewals costing a further Pounds 60m a year - a thorough upgrade of
the entire route would achieve an overall cost saving of 10 per cent over 20
years.
South of Crewe, the line and signalling are 30 years old while, to the
north, equipment is 20 years old.
The West Coast Main Line Development Company, which has been carrying out a
feasibility study of the modernisation plan, will put its final proposals to
the government and to Railtrack before Christmas.
They are expected to take a decision on the extent of the upgrade early next
year after consultation with the 17 train operating companies using the
line. Bidders will then be invited to tender for the project, which will
involve both private and public funds. Work is due to start next year.
The West Coast main line is an important part of the government's private
finance initiative designed to get private sector funds and expertise into
large infrastructure projects.
A basic upgrade costing Pounds 800m would provide a line capable of running
trains at up to 125mph, though some stretches would be restricted to 60mph.
If Railtrack and the train operators wanted higher speeds on some sections
of track, they would have to spend up to a further Pounds 200m, Mr Howarth
said.
The project team believes the entire upgrade could take place within the
existing track corridor. Higher train speeds to match the French trains a
grande vitesse, which reach 186mph, would require the track to be
straightened and would push up costs. However, the line will be designed to
accommodate tilting trains now in use in Italy and Sweden, which can travel
at up to 160mph.
Although the modernisation is not designed to accommodate very high-speed
trains, the upgrade would still reduce journey times between London and
Glasgow from five to four hours and London to Manchester or Liverpool from 2
3/4 to two hours.
The study team believes these journey times would compete with the airlines
over longer distances and attract more passengers to the route  - which is
one of the busiest in the UK.
Modern in-cab signalling systems would mean the entire route could be
controlled from a single centre.
The upgrade envisages installing an advanced train protection system
recommended in a recent safety inquiry to reduce the risk of accidents.
Pilot systems are at present being used on two routes in Britain - but this
would be the largest application of the system.
In Tuesday's Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the
specification study for the West Coast main line refurbishment would be
finished by the end of the year. The transport project was one of a number
announced in the last year's Budget.

Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, was last night accused of
removing a crucial safety net from millions of home-owners by announcing
cuts in mortgage interest relief for people on benefit.
In a statement that caused deep concern to mortgage lenders and housing
pressure groups, Mr Lilley said current home-owners would not be able to
claim interest repayments in the first two months if they lost their jobs
and took up state benefits.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced in Tuesday's Budget
that, from October next year new mortgage holders would not receive interest
rate repayments for the first nine months that they took out Income Support,
the principal welfare benefit.
The regulations are among a list of measures designed to reduce the Pounds
1.2bn annual spending on home-owners drawing income support.
Mortgage lenders said yesterday that Mr Lilley had considerably extended the
effect of the measure.
Mr Lilley said that in the subsequent four months50 per cent of mortgage
interest relief would be paid to the lender rather than the borrower to
ensure proper use. He confirmed that the mortgage ceiling for applications
would be reduced from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 100,000.
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, Halifax building society, said that
removal of the safety net would force more people into subsidised rented
accommodation.
Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager, said the restriction
would 'make borrowers more cautious and make lenders more cautious about
lending at the margin'. He added: 'The growth of home ownership from the
mid-19th century had been through lending to people at the margin.'
The housing charity, Shelter, described the decision as 'appalling' and
predicted a rise in repossessions. 'Ministers are effectively telling every
home-owner to go out and get private insurance to cover themselves,' it
said.
In his statement Mr Lilley said poor credit decisions by mortgage lenders
were partly to blame for the spiralling costs of the benefit, which is
claimed by more than 500,000 people. 'Since Income Support cover is paid
direct to lenders, the scheme is simply bailing them out for their bad
lending practices,' he said.
Social security officials said that the reforms would reduce the
department's budget by Pounds 200m over several years.
Mr Lilley also announced that, under proposals to be introduced next
October, new claimants for housing benefit would only be entitled to the
full repayment of a defined average rent in their area.

FT  01 DEC 94 / TSB chief in reform call to societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to increase the accountability of building societies to their
members were proposed yesterday by Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the
TSB Group.
Sir Nicholas urged that this accountability be brought closer to that of
public limited companies' to their share-holders.
Giving evidence to the cross-party Commons Treasury committee, he put
forward proposals to require societies to give more financial information to
the millions of members who own them, and to reform voting arrangements.
He said that instead of the 'one member one vote' system currently operated,
voting powers should reflect the relative stakes of members in an
organisation.
If societies were concerned that this would be unfair to smaller investors,
just as there was a minimum investment which entitled a member to a vote, so
there could be a maximum which would put an upper limit on the weight of an
investor's vote.
His comments came towards the end of the committee's inquiry into financial
regulation. The MPs are due to meet today to decide whether to issue an
interim report before Christmas on the supervision of societies.
They are aware that if they leave their conclusions until a final report on
financial regulation generally - which could not be published until next
year - they would probably miss the opportunity to contribute to the
Treasury's review of societies' powers and accountability.
The committee has yet to take evidence from the Building Societies'
Commission, the sector's statutory regulator. This is likely to be arranged
soon.
The future of the commission has been called into question by some of the
committee's witnesses, and some MPs have expressed support for the idea of a
single supervisory regime, probably located within the Bank of England, to
cover both banks and building societies.
Sir Nicholas said yesterday that having a single regulator would reduce
confusion because the businesses carried out by the two types of
organisation were converging.
He said that while he had 'no rooted objection to the concept of mutuality',
he was not convinced that this was an appropriate form of ownership the more
complex an organisation became.
If societies were to be given more powers, he said, they should be obliged
to make clear to members the greater risks they were incurring as they
developed into new areas of business. They should also give members annual
and half-yearly reports, and report any serious merger approaches promptly.
He welcomed the guidance issued to societies after the Cadbury report on
corporate governance, but regretted this had not included the setting up of
nominations committees.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Island trader runs out of puff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A small cargo ship said to be worth Pounds 200,000 is being offered free to
anyone prepared to continue using it to provide a service to the islands off
north-west Scotland.
The 66ft, 230-tonne Eilean Eisdeal is the last working Clyde puffer - a
class of boat which once traded along the north-west seaboard and among the
islands. It can carry 132 tonnes of cargo and has a top speed of eight knots
unladen.
Mr Chris Nicholson is being forced to end the service after losses of more
than Pounds 660,000 since he restored the 'Easy' in 1983.
Most of the hundreds of puffers went to the scrapyards on the arrival of
roll-on, roll-off services operated by state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne in
the late 1960s.
Mr Nicholson's company, Easdale Island Shipping Line, spotted what it
thought was a gap in the market in the 1980s. The government awarded the
company tariff rebate eligibility in 1986 which it thought would make it
competitive against the CalMac's largely lorry-based delivery services.
But the business lost money from its inception and has been forced into
voluntary liquidation.
The puffer's last run was between the island of Eriskay, in the Outer
Hebrides, and Tobermory on Mull, where it was laid up, the crew was laid
off, and a wake held in the public bar of the Mishnish Hotel.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Farmers 'fail to reap tree profits'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers in some parts of the country could earn up to Pounds 300 a hectare
more from forestry than from agriculture, says a study published yesterday
by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain.
The report of the committee, which represents timber processors and private
woodland operators, highlights the West Country and a section of the country
running north from Cheshire to the Cumbria border as the most cost-effective
regions for converting farmland to forests.
It is based on an analysis of crop gross margins on a range of land classes
and soil types in England and Wales. It shows that forestry can be more
profitable than dairying and grassland, but cannot usually compete with
arable farming.
Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where the government plans to
encourage the planting of 200 square miles to create the National Forest,
shows up as a particularly uncompetitive area in which to plant trees
because farming is so profitable.
Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive of the Timber Growers Association, which
represents commercial forestry companies, said: 'No rational person would
convert farmland into forestry in that area unless a great deal of money is
available as an incentive.'
The committee wants its study to be used by planners and policymakers to
promote planting of woodland in areas which are most suitable and where it
would be most profitable.
Britain imports the bulk of its timber and in spite of government targets
aimed at encouraging the planting of 33,000 hectares of forestry a year,
actual plantings are running at about half that rate.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Cabinet divided over Euro poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government remained divided yesterday over whether to hold a referendum
on Britain's future in Europe, in spite of signs that the prime minister is
willing to back the idea.
As the government prepares for a tough fight with Euro-rebels over the next
stage of European Union integration, Mr John Major is understood to be
considering the offer of a referendum to avoid another damaging dispute in
the Conservative party over Europe.
However, leading members of the cabinet yesterday failed to agree whether to
hold a referendum on the outcome of the EU's inter-governmental conference
(IGC) in 1996.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is one of the most pro-European
members of the cabinet, made clear that he viewed the issue as hypothetical.
Asked whether the government should offer a referendum, he told BBC radio:
'We don't know what the agenda at the IGC will be, so it's even less on the
agenda than next year's Budget.'
But Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, added to indications that he
could be shifting his stance towards a referendum, amid fears that the
Labour party might make this pledge at the next general election. At a
session of the Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday, Mr Hurd said:
'We have a sceptical view about referendums. But we have not said 'never'
about 1996 or about a single bank or a single currency.'
In recent days a number of Eurosceptic Tory MPs have indicated that they
backed the government in Monday night's crucial debate over the EU finance
bill following strong hints from ministers that a referendum was likely.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday wrote to the prime
minister seeking clarification on the matter.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Tories may lose committee strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night facing the possibility of having fewer Tories
than it expected on the committees examining this year's legislation. MPs
last night failed to agree how the removal of the whip from nine
Conservatives should be reflected in the bodies' composition.
The Commons selection committee broke up without agreement having been
reached. It is expected to meet again next Wednesday.
Opposition parties argue that the wiping out of the government's paper
majority by the removal of the whip from nine Tory Eurosceptics should mean
that it is no longer entitled to a majority on standing committees.
Last night's meeting came after Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told MPs
that the outcome of deliberations on the issue would not please all MPs but
would satisfy most.
The government's majority of 14 technically disappeared when eight
Eurosceptic backbenchers were stripped of the Tory whip after failing to
back the government over the European finance bill on Monday. A ninth MP
resigned the whip in sympathy with them.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Island trader runs out of puff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A small cargo ship said to be worth Pounds 200,000 is being offered free to
anyone prepared to continue using it to provide a service to the islands off
north-west Scotland.
The 66ft, 230-tonne Eilean Eisdeal is the last working Clyde puffer - a
class of boat which once traded along the north-west seaboard and among the
islands. It can carry 132 tonnes of cargo and has a top speed of eight knots
unladen.
Mr Chris Nicholson is being forced to end the service after losses of more
than Pounds 660,000 since he restored the 'Easy' in 1983.
Most of the hundreds of puffers went to the scrapyards on the arrival of
roll-on, roll-off services operated by state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne in
the late 1960s.
Mr Nicholson's company, Easdale Island Shipping Line, spotted what it
thought was a gap in the market in the 1980s. The government awarded the
company tariff rebate eligibility in 1986 which it thought would make it
competitive against the CalMac's largely lorry-based cargo delivery
services.
The tariff rebate subsidy scheme enabled Easdale Island Shipping Line to
claim top-up grants of 40 per cent of most of the delivery cost of freight
to the islands and 30 per cent on freight being taken away from the islands.
But the business lost money from its inception and has been forced into
voluntary liquidation.
Mr Nicholson said he suffered unfair discrimination through having to
compete against CalMac, which will receive a subsidy of Pounds 5.7m this
year.
He said the puffer still had a role. Its size and shallow draught allowed it
to deliver to the smaller piers the CalMac ferries were unable to get into,
and it could even be beached to unload goods.
Mr Nicholson said at his Midlands base - which boasts a skull and crossbones
nailed to the door: 'It's outrageous that CalMac should be in receipt of an
annual Pounds 6m while I am denied a mere Pounds 100,000 a year to provide
an irreplaceable service to a vast number of communities.
'This puffer's no anachronism, she offers a low-cost flexible service and is
the only craft small enough to deliver bulk goods to the tiny piers on
islands such as Eigg, Rum and Muck.
'Without the puffer these vulnerable communities will be unable to bring
anything ashore from the big steamers unless it is strongly pre-packaged and
manhandled on to small launches that have to come out to meet the big boats
in the worst of weathers.'
Rather than see the puffer rot, Mr Nicholson said he was prepared to give
the Eilean Eisdeal to anyone who would give an undertaking to continue the
service to the islands.
He was not interested in selling her for conversion for recreational use.
The Scottish Office has expressed regret about the loss of the puffer
service. It is soon to change the way freight services to the islands are
subsidised.
The puffer's last run was between the island of Eriskay, in the Outer
Hebrides, and Tobermory on Mull, where it was laid up, the crew was laid
off, and a wake held in the public bar of the Mishnish Hotel.

Three of the four main high street banks were today accused by the
Consumers' Association of providing worse services than other banks and
building societies, Alison Smith writes.
On the basis of almost 4,000 replies from readers of Which? magazine, the
association found that Barclays Bank, National Westminster Bank and Midland
Bank achieved the lowest scores for overall customer satisfaction.
The British Bankers' Association challenged some of the findings. It said
that separate polling undertaken by MORI showed customers reporting fewer
difficulties than in the Which? survey.

FT  01 DEC 94 / NHS systems 'at risk of fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some National Health Service systems depend heavily on trust and carry
inherent risks of fraud, the Audit Commission says in a report today.
The commission says, however, that incidences of detected fraud and
corruption are very low in relation to the size of NHS expen-diture.
A survey of 460 trusts and health authorities revealed 960 cases of
malpractice involving losses of Pounds 6m in the past three years, compared
with spending of Pounds 80bn on NHS services in England and Wales in the
same period.
The report says attention should be focused on minimising risks. These are
greatest in the primary health services area, where 25 per cent of NHS
spending takes place.
It says areas where existing systems leave public money at risk include the
potential inflation of practice lists by family doctors, false claims for
sight tests by opticians, failure by pharmacists to remit prescription money
and false claims for services and allowances by dentists. Fraud by patients
is also possible.
The commission says that in one family health services authority area
patients may have falsely claimed exemption from prescription charges worth
Pounds 560,000.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Manufacturers hit by price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price pressures are increasing in manufacturing, with more businesses
reporting rising material costs, the Purchasing Managers index from the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply suggested yesterday.
This month the seasonally adjusted price index rose to its highest level in
its three-year history. The findings for November are likely to fuel City
concerns that inflation may begin to rise again.
But with surveys such as the purchasing index painting a slightly different
picture from the pattern seen in recent official government data, economists
are increasingly at odds about which indicators are providing the best guide
to future inflation trends.
In recent months the Bank of England has been expanding the list of
indicators it uses to assess inflationary pressures, to include not only
monetary aggregates but also factors such as commodity prices.
This week's Budget indicated that the Treasury was also paying closer
attention to a broader scope of data because the Red Book cited for the
first time wage costs and material input prices as factors that would
influence interest rate decisions.
Some City analysts - such as Mr Robert Barry, economist at brokers BZW  -
believe that this implies that the monetary authorities are giving greater
weight to business surveys.
Although the purchasing index has not yet achieved the credibility of the US
purchasing managers index, the pricing component of the Confederation of
British Industry survey is being closely watched by the Bank of England.
Other City institutions are now exploring ways to measure inflation through
a composite index - rather than through single indicators. The Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply has said that it will launch a new index
of leading indicators of inflation next month.
In September Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, launched the first leading
inflation indicators in the City.
Although the Bank of England and Treasury have no plans as yet to introduce
their own leading indicators, officials say they are watching the
developments 'with great interest'.
Part of the reason for the new interest in composite indicators is that
different surveys and data have been diverging slightly in recent months.
Yesterday's purchasing index suggested that input prices rose quickly in
November, after a strong increase in October. This broadly tallies with the
CBI's survey, which showed that a growing number of businesses planned to
raise output prices, partly in response to rising raw material costs.
Nevertheless, recent Central Statistical Office data has suggested that
price pressures are more muted, with the pace of monthly growth in input and
output prices slowing in October.
One reason for the discrepancy may be sectoral differences. The purchasing
index survey shows that the chemicals sector is reporting much faster prices
than other sectors.
Mr Chris Williamson of NTC research, which compiles the data, suggested that
another reason might be that the purchasing index data included prices paid
by domestic manufacturers for purchases from other manufacturers, while the
CSO data netted out transactions from one sector to another.
A third factor that might affect the CSO data is that companies tend to
report list prices to the government, rather than actual prices.
The discounting that occurred in the recession might not have been recorded
 -and conversely the reduction in price discounting that purchasing managers
might now be reporting as the economy recovered was also not always
reflected.
Reported output rose slightly last month, and delivery times lengthened,
suggesting that capacity problems might be developing in some sectors.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Boost for inner city police candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A novel scheme to prepare underprivileged candidates for the job application
process has resulted in the induction of 10 recruits into the Merseyside
police force today.
The programme, run by the Industrial Society, helped disadvantaged and
unemployed adults from the Granby and Toxteth areas of Liverpool - the scene
of race riots in 1981 - to gain confidence and skills required to apply for
jobs with the police.
Merseyside police has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified
candidates from inner city areas and ethnic minority groups.
The Industrial Society, with funding from the Granby Toxteth Task Force,
Merseyside Training and Enterprise Council, the Employment Service and the
police authority, selected 15 candidates.
During the 10-week, full-time course, Industrial Society trainers helped the
candidates improve their reading and maths skills, practice interview
techniques, and prepare for police fitness standards.
None of the candidates was guaranteed a job although all were granted an
initial interview.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Power regulator defends his record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, said yesterday that regional electricity companies could raise
dividends by 6 per cent to 9 per cent annually in real terms in the next few
years.
He said in a strong defence of his record as regulator that criticism of the
price controls he announced on the companies' distribution businesses this
summer was misplaced.
His remarks on dividends surprised the City. Although the stock market is
expecting average dividend rises of about 8 per cent in the next few years,
analysts said it was unusual for a regulator to discuss dividend projections
in public.
Speaking at a London conference, Prof Littlechild said criticism based on
dividend projections failed to realise that the projections reflected the
profitability of the companies' unregulated businesses and the effect of
profits derived from existing controls.
Confiscating past profits would undermine the present basis of regulation
and reduce the incentive to improve efficiency, he said.
Prof Littlechild said part of the criticism resulted from 'misleading'
rumours about a confidential letter sent to the companies in April. The
significance of the letter had been misunderstood since it was not even a
preliminary proposal and 'did not reflect my view about what the proposal
should ultimately be'.
He said that in future price reviews he would consider making more
information public at intermediate stages of reviews, including a range of
price controls. The price controls, he said, were as severe as those of any
other utility and more severe than most.
The review, accepted by all the companies in England and Wales, will force
distribution price reductions of between 11 per cent and 17 per cent next
April.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Procter set for rap on soap advert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority is to censure Procter &amp; Gamble over
advertising claims in its 'soap wars' with Unilever, according to a leaked
draft of an ASA adjudication.
While the draft's focus is the 'knocking copy' produced by Procter attacking
Unilever's Persil Power soap powder, the document contains damaging
criticism of Persil Power itself. The draft describes the product as 'more
harmful than any other detergent on the market'.
The authority said yesterday that the draft was 'still very much under
discussion and subject to further change'.
It said it was not uncommon for the authority's council to reverse draft
views before adjudications were published. The council is not expected to
discuss the issue until next month.
Newspaper advertisements placed by Procter in July said 'only Ariel
(Procter's soap powder) washes so clean yet so safe'. The advertisements
contained warnings that the manganese 'accelerator' ingredient, which is at
the centre of the controversy about Persil Power, could leave residues on
clothes and continue to cause fading, even if users switched to another soap
powder.
Unilever, which has always said that there is no such 'carry-over' effect
from the accelerator and that Persil Power is not damaging under normal
usage, complained to the ASA about the advertisements.
The ASA draft criticises Procter's advertisements for 'concentrating on
vulnerable fabrics and dyes and not mentioning that the accelerator products
were intended for low temperature washes' and for giving 'an exaggerated
overall impression of the damage caused by the complainants' products'. It
dismissed as not proven Procter's claims of manganese 'carry-over'.
However, the draft, which is published in today's edition of the trade
magazine Marketing Week, says that Procter is entitled to present its
product as a safer alternative to Persil. It adds: 'The authority sought
expert advice and concluded that all detergents damaged clothes to a certain
extent. It further concluded that Persil Power was more harmful than any
other detergent on the market.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Revamped think-tank worships widgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Design Council's own radical redesign from a 230-strong quango to what
it is hoped will be a lean, fast-moving think-tank of just 40 people is due
to be unveiled tonight by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
The transformation, carried out over 35 weeks, is described by Mr John
Sorrell, the Design Council's chairman, as 'one of the fastest turnarounds
of a public organisation - or any organisation - that's ever been achieved'.
The familiar shopfront in London's Haymarket stands empty, regional offices
have been disbanded and services privatised or transferred to other
organisations. The old council's main activity - dispensing design advice to
industry - will be taken over by the network of Business Links being set up
by the Department of Trade and Industry to provide 'one-stop shop' help.
The newly formed Design Council team, which is as yet without a chief
executive, occupies one room at the top of the old Haymarket building,
although it is likely to relocate eventually. It is described by Mr Sorrell
as 'a national think-tank, which develops and disseminates new knowledge,
sets agendas, focuses debate on design and inspires action' as part of the
'drive to improve competitiveness in the UK economy through design'.
It has eschewed new logos and the usual corporate identity trappings in
favour of a set of mottoes for use on letter headings, envelopes and
business cards. An example is: 'Widgets aren't born, they're designed. The
new Design Council is here to inspire innovation.'
Initiatives include:
A student competition to redesign the Houses of Parliament and the setting
up of an all-party group on design.
Research programmes on design effectiveness, investment policy and
management.
A programme to bring design into schools and business courses.
The launch of 'Project 2045', which will involve designs for the future, as
visualised by children, businesses and design professionals, being buried in
time capsules for 50 years.
The relaunching of the British Design Awards and the council's magazine,
Design.
The shake-up started in September last year when the government announced
that it wanted the council, which had been receiving a grant of Pounds 7.5m,
to refocus its activities. Mr Sorrell, who is himself a designer, carried
out a review, the findings of which were accepted by the DTI in March. Staff
have been made redundant or redeployed and the organisation has been
restructured into four teams covering research, communications, design, and
education and training.
The process, which has been welcomed by the design world, is due to be
completed tonight, when Mr Heseltine launches the new council at a reception
which also marks the organisation's 50th anniversary.
The main question which remains concerns the operation of the government's
new Business Links. The aim is for 200 one-stop shops, but so far there are
fewer than 80.
Mr Sorrell expects there to be about 15 to 20 design counsellors installed
in Business Link offices by early next year, but concedes that 'inevitably
there are some seams' in the transfer of design advisory services.
The Design Council's biggest project remains government itself. Mr Sorrell
said: 'It's very much on our agenda to look at the way government buys, uses
and manages design. It would be crazy to think there wasn't room for
improvement.'
Mr Sorrell said government spending on items which are at some point
designed - from the screw that goes into a plug, to an aircraft carrier -
amounted to Pounds 74bn a year. 'Imagine if those things could be designed
just 1 per cent better, with 1 per cent saving in cost.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Watchdog expects flexible deals on rail network access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack and train operating companies will be expected to negotiate
flexible access agreements so that the privatised railway network can
respond to changing market conditions, Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator
said yesterday.
He warned against the danger of inflexible long-term agreements inhibiting
improvements in efficiency and preventing the railway companies from
providing in-novative services and timetables.
The regulator's proposals were contained in a policy statement on access
charges published after several months of consultation. A statement on the
level of the charges will be published next month.
The regulator's rules will set the framework for the access agreements due
to come into effect next April and to apply for six years.
Mr Swift said Railtrack, which operates the signalling network, stations and
rail track, would be required to provide train operators with more
information about its costs.
The access charges agreed with passenger train operators also had to reflect
income from other sources such as freight train operators and property
income, he added.
The train operating companies were particularly concerned that under
existing temporary access agreements with Railtrack they would bear the
brunt of any economic downturn without being allowed to reduce service
levels. They wanted to share this risk with Railtrack, Mr Swift said.
They also wanted to be able to negotiate adjustments in access agreements if
market conditions changed because more than 90 per cent of their access
charges relate to shared general costs and were fixed.
Mr Swift said: 'Present arrangements do not help them identify changes in
access rights and charges which increase efficiency. My decisions will
greatly increase the information which is available to operators about what
they pay.'
The regulator is also to encourage Railtrack and the train operators to
agree adjustments to the initial package of access rights and charges which
they have signed 'where it is in both their interests to do so'.
Railtrack will have to change access agreements if these are sought by train
operators and do not put Railtrack at a disadvantage but there will be no
corresponding obligation on operators.
Only 9 per cent of the access charges vary directly with use depending on
the number of trains which run, time of day, and amount of electricity used.
Mr Swift said that since only a small percentage was directly variable this
should be made to reflect as accurately as possible the costs incurred.
One way of achieving this would be to base charges on the actual mileage run
by an operator.
Operators will be encouraged to fit meters to measure electricity use.

Police were unable to cope with reports of suspected money laundering from
bank and building societies last year, even before tighter reporting
requirements were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act, a Police
Foundation study has found.
The study said that staffing limitations at the National Criminal
Intelligence Service meant that the 12,736 reports of possible money
laundering received last year did not receive due attention and
investigation.
City of London police said changes had been made since the study. A backlog
of reports was due to be cleared soon.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Taxi monopoly likely to be kept
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Black taxi cabs appear to have won the fight to protect their 300-year-old
monopoly to pick up passengers on London's streets, according to a leaked
government report
The report, which is believed to be addressed to Mr Steven Norris, the
transport minister, recommends that taxi drivers should continue to have the
sole right to ply for trade in public. It also says that minicabs, which
must be pre-booked, should be licensed in London to conform to stricter
regulations.
But taxi drivers are today preparing to protest against the plans, which
they say will undermine 'the knowledge' - a three-year entry test. The TGWU
general union said: 'The plans include extending the so-called two-tier
system of licensing which would spread the use of untrained drivers.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / MMC to probe Performing Rights Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is mounting an investigation into
allegations of unfair practices and administrative inefficiency at the
Performing Rights Society, which collects royalties for composers and
songwriters.
The investigation follows long-running complaints from composers to the
Office of Fair Trading concerning the level of the society's administration
fees and claims that its method of royalty collection is unfair to less
successful composers.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, yesterday said he had 'grounds for
concern that the society may not be operating in a fully efficient and
properly accountable manner'.
The society, founded by a group of music hall composers in 1914, has a
monopoly of the collection of royalties for musical performances in the UK.
It raises more than Pounds 150m in royalties each year for 26,000 members.
Royalties are collected for radio and television broadcasts, as well as live
performances and the use of music in public places such as pubs and shops.
The level of royalties varies from Pounds 200 for a song performed on BBC1's
Top of the Pops, to a few pence if a society inspector spots music being
played in a supermarket.
The society has for some time come under fire from the music industry. U2,
the successful Irish rock group, earlier this year started legal proceedings
to challenge the society's right to collect royalties for live performances.
Mr Paul McGuinness, U2's manager, yesterday welcomed the MMC's
investigation. He described the society as 'superlatively inefficient',
saying that U2 often waited four years to receive royalties on songs
performed outside the UK.
The less successful end of the music industry has also criticised the
society, complaining to the OFT that its practices favour successful acts,
such as U2, to the detriment of obscure composers.
Chief target for their criticism is the introduction of a new system for
collecting royalties on live performances. This collects royalties on music
played in 550 big venues, whereas the old system levied them on any music
referred to in concert programmes. Some classical composers have complained
that their earnings have since been halved.
Both sides of the industry have been critical of the service provided by the
society and its overheads.
The society said yesterday that it had cut costs in real terms, with the
proportion of annual income spent on administration falling from 19.8 per
cent in 1991 to a projected 17 per cent next year.
Mr Wayne Bickerton, chairman, added that the society had 'already made great
strides' at addressing the issues due to be examined by the MMC.
Mr McGuinness called for it to be reformed. He advocated abolishing its
monopoly in favour of a US-style free market system of competing commercial
concerns.
Mr McGuinness said: 'The situation must be resolved before the development
of the new digital system of music diffusion.
'Otherwise we'll still be dependent on the PRS and it will do its job the
same way as it does it now - appallingly badly.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / BSkyB in partnership talks with Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting is in detailed talks with Reuters, the news and
information group, over the possibility of a partnership between Sky News
and Reuters Television.
Reuters, which has been expanding its broadcasting interests, appears to
have taken over the running from Independent Television News in the long
search for a partner for the loss-making Sky News.
For some time Mr Sam Chisholm, the BSkyB chief executive, has been looking
for a way of reducing the Pounds 30m a year cost of the 24-hour television
news service while improving quality.
Talks with the BBC several years ago foundered on the issue of editorial
control.
In the past few months BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, owns 17.5 per cent, has had extensive negotiations with ITN
involving Mr Chisholm, Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN, and Mr Rupert
Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation.
The possible deal involves ITN providing Sky News under contract.
When the negotiations first became public last month Mr Chisholm said: 'We
have plenty of suitors who want to get involved with us in a whole range of
areas. ITN is but one.'
The emergence of Reuters as the preferred partner is ironic because Mr
Green, chairman and chief executive of Carlton Communications, is also a
non-executive director of Reuters.
It is not clear precisely what kind of relationship is likely to emerge
between BSkyB and Reuters but it will probably go beyond a news supply
agreement. A full contracting-out of Sky News has been ruled out.
The discussions centre on a partnership or possible merger between Sky News
and Reuters Television, the leading world television news agency.
BSkyB's emerging preference for Reuters is based on the depth of its
international resources and the number of bureaux around the world.
Apart from its specialist television correspondents Reuters is increasingly
installing cameras in bureaux so that non-television reporters can provide
television coverage.
A deal with Reuters would almost certainly lead to a rekindling of BSkyB's
ambition to make Sky News more international, possibly even taking a variant
of the channel to the US on DirecTV, the recently launched American
satellite television service.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Pension fund in tax test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank Pension Fund, one of the country's biggest, faces a special
assessment by the Inland Revenue. The move will be a test case on whether
pension-scheme profits earned by underwriting new share deals ought to be
taxed.
Barclays is the first pension scheme to face a formal assessment. Yet it is
understood that as many as 10 other big schemes have been issued so-called
'protective assessments' in respect of their underwriting profits in recent
years.
The Revenue issued those assessments saying it believes underwriting new
share issues is a trading activity not covered by the tax exemption which
applies to profits earned on pension schemes' ordinary investment
activities.
Barclays' pension scheme, which has close to Pounds 7bn in assets, was
assessed last summer by the Revenue in respect of the 1989-90 fiscal year.
Barclays is contesting the assessment and a hearing is expected before the
general commissioners for such tax cases early next year.
If Barclays loses, it may appeal to a panel of special commissioners. If
such an appeal were lost, many pension schemes are likely to face requests
for back taxes on underwriting, forcing schemes to reconsider whether they
wish to continue the exercise.
The move to review underwriting income comes as the fixed commissions earned
by pension funds are under attack from other quarters. In November the
Office of Fair Trading released a study which concluded that fund managers
generally - including pension schemes - earned profits on underwriting which
were far in excess of the risks taken.
The OFT inquiry focused on whether there was enough competition in the
underwriting of new share issues.
UK insurance companies, which are also significant underwriters of new share
issues, are taxed on their underwriting profits and have shown no signs of
withdrawing from the business. Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the National
Association of Pension Funds' investment committee, said that while it was
not clear that schemes would no longer underwrite, 'there would be some
quite large funds which would decide it wasn't worth the trouble'.
The association has long argued that there is no difference between
under-writing a new share offer for a four to six-week period - at the end
of which it could own the shares - and making a long-term investment
decision and that it should con-sequently be free of tax. The Revenue has
argued that it is short-term trading.
Meanwhile, Bacon and Woodrow, consulting actuaries, say that a client, a
mid-size UK industrial pension scheme, has been asked to provide the Revenue
with details on any profits earned by short-selling - the sale of shares it
does not already own.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Wessex Water fights metering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wessex Water yesterday launched a campaign against universal metering for
water charges and announced plans to appoint two customer directors to the
board of its utility business.
Mr Colin Skellett, managing director, said customers in the Wessex region
had 'made it very clear they do not want metering'.
Wessex will be lobbying the government to allow water companies access to
information on council tax bands. Mr Skellett said this could be used in
conjunction with a metering option to provide a fairer system of charges.
However, such a move would require government legislation.
At the moment, water charges are based on the old system of rateable
property values. However, water com-panies must come up with alternative
methods of charging customers by the year 2000.
Mr Ian Byatt, the industry regulator, is known to favour metering. But some
water companies feel this method is expensive to install - Wessex estimates
the cost at about Pounds 140 per household - and that it would hit the
poorest sections of society hardest.
Mr Skellett said combining the council tax bands with metering would allow
Wessex to tailor its charges to lessen the impact of abandoning the rateable
system on the poorest customers.
The campaign was launched as part of Partnership 2000, a series of
initiatives aimed at improving customer service. Wessex has appointed Mrs
Lesley Bennett and Mr John Lofts, respective heads of the company's two
customer-liaison panels, as non-executive directors to the utility board, as
opposed to the main company board.
The move appears to be unique in the sector. It follows the controversial
bid by former regulator Mrs Diana Scott to join the Yorkshire Water main
board. The issue divided Yorkshire's small shareholders from institutions,
which overwhelmingly rejected Mrs Scott's nomination.
Wessex has pledged to devote savings on its capital investment programme to
funding issues such as sewerage flooding, which were not allowed for in the
summer price review.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Magnet advisers agree out-of-court settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers and bankers to the failed 1989 management buy-out of Magnet, the
fitted kitchen retailer, yesterday formally announced an out-of-court
settlement to end their large-scale legal action.
The terms of the settlement remain confidential but it is understood that
Arthur Andersen, the adviser to the Magnet management, has, as anticipated,
agreed to pay less than Pounds 50m to Bankers Trust which had originally
claimed damages of about Pounds 600m.
Bankers Trust, the US bank which headed a syndicate of banks which financed
the buy-out, had said Arthur Andersen was negligent in failing to provide it
with an objective report on Magnet's financial health. Arthur Andersen had
denied negligence, saying its duty was to Magnet, not Bankers Trust.
GE Capital had also sued Bankers Trust for Pounds 70m, claiming it had
failed to discharge its responsibilities as syndicate leader.
The Magnet buy-out proved one of the most conspicuous City disasters of the
late 1980s. It cost its backers, led by Bankers Trust, a total of Pounds
629m, making it the largest buy-out ever staged.
Lower-than-expected profits, the recession and high interest rates meant
that the highly-borrowed company rapidly ran into trouble. It was sold
earlier this year for just Pounds 56m.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Labour votes for Clause IV rewrite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's National Executive Committee yesterday decided to press ahead with
plans to rewrite the party's constitution, including the commitment to
public ownership enshrined in the 75-year-old Clause IV.
A document outlining Mr Tony Blair's plans to update the party's guiding
principles was endorsed by its ruling body by 20 votes to four on what the
Labour leader described as a 'historic day for the Labour party'.
The move sparked an angry response from leftwingers, who regard scrapping
Clause IV as tantamount to declaring war on the heart of socialism.
Mr Dennis Skinner, the MP for Bolsover who voted against the changes at
yesterday's meeting, said: 'The Tories are on the run and for the life of me
I cannot understand why we have to start meddling with the constitution.'
Ms Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said: 'The same
people who want us to drop Clause IV want us to break decisively with the
trade unions.'
Mr Blair's document accepts the market economy and calls for tougher
regulation of the privatised utilities instead of re-nationalisation.
Some union representatives on the executive joined the leftwing MPs in
raising objections to Mr Blair's efforts to have a rapid consultation period
followed by a special conference to endorse the new constitution next April.
The NEC will meet in two weeks to decide the timetable for consulting
Labour's grass roots and the trade unions before a new clause is drawn up
for agreement either at a special conference or at the party's annual
conference next autumn.
Mr Blair is said to be confident that he will secure agreement on an
accelerated timetable through the convening of the special conference.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's traditionalist deputy leader, has also been
working on the new document. Clause IV appears on Labour membership cards
and commits the party to 'common ownership of the means of production,
distribution and exchange'.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Rover to build engineering and design centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK vehicle maker, is to invest Pounds 25m to build a new
design and engineering centre at Gaydon, Warwickshire.
From 1997 the Gaydon site will become Rover's main engineering centre and
the location for all its new vehicle design and development operations with
a workforce of close to 2,000.
The 900-acre former RAF airfield was acquired by Rover in 1979. It already
includes Rover's main vehicle testing facilities with 36 miles of proving
roads and test track.
The new design and engineering centre at Gaydon will house 700 to 1,000
people, most of whom will be transferred from the vehicle design site at
Canley, Coventry, which is being redeveloped as a commercial and retail
park.
Rover has already developed a full range of vehicle test facilities at
Gaydon including climatic wind tunnels.
Rover, which has an overall engineering staff of about 2,500, said it had 'a
complete capability' to design and develop both cars and four-wheel-drive
vehicles in the UK, which was unaffected by the group's takeover by BMW of
Germany.
Rover said the combination of vehicle development testing with its product
design and development operations at one site would help shorten development
lead-times and reduce costs.
Rover is engaged in a five-year, Pounds 1.5bn investment programme for the
development of new models, which began this autumn with the launch of a new
generation Range Rover.
The renewal and development of its car operations includes the launch next
year of replacements for the existing Rover 200/400 range as well as the
revival of the MG sports car marque.
It is working on the development of a new range of smaller Land Rover
four-wheel-drive vehicles for launch in the late 1990s, which will be
positioned below its Range Rover and Discovery ranges.

The independent Labour Research Department found that employers sought older

FT  01 DEC 94 / General Accident wins Post Office insurance deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, ANDREW ADONIS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office will next week presage a possible move into selling general
insurance products by announcing a deal with General Accident, the composite
insurer, to sell travel insurance at many of its 20,000 branches.
Details about the Post Office's hopes of diversifying into selling insurance
 -including household policies - coincided with news that it has suffered a
serious defeat in a battle with the Treasury over the government levy on
post service profits.
Post Office Counters, the division of the postal service responsible for the
branch network, will announce trials starting early next year for travel
insurance, with the intention of the scheme being extended nationwide later
in the year.
The arrangement is likely to be structured so the Post Office earns a
percentage on every policy or block of policies sold. Three insurance
companies are understood to have been on the shortlist for the deal.
At the same time, Post Office Counters is expected to confirm it is
investigating extending the insurance products it can offer, enhancing the
value of what the government has described as the largest chain of shops in
Europe.
Earlier this month the government was forced to abandon plans to privatise
Royal Mail, the Post Office letters division, after opposition from some
Tory backbenchers.
But Post Office managers are keen to exploit new government guidelines on
the range of transactions that can be handled through the organisation's
retail network.
They believe travel insurance complements existing Post Office services,
including bureau de change facilities. The sale of other insurance products
would require approval from the Department of Trade and Industry.
Separately, it emerged yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has
rejected pleas by the Post Office board for a Pounds 100m reduction in next
year's Pounds 213m levy.
The Post Office campaigned for the reduction when privatisation plans were
shelved. Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's chief executive, said that a
cut in the levy was essential to boost capital investment. But Mr Clarke
announced in the Budget that next year's levy would remain unchanged and
would fall only to Pounds 178m by 1997-98.
With pre-tax profits last year running at Pounds 306m, the Treasury levy
takes the lion's share of the Post Office's spare cash and has been rising
sharply - up from Pounds 182m last year to Pounds 226m this year.
Mr Clarke's decision bodes ill for the success of efforts by Royal Mail  -
the largest of the Post Office's divisions - to gain greater commercial
freedom within the public sector. Senior managers want to be able to form
joint ventures and foreign alliances, arguing that foreign competition will
otherwise force the Post Office into decline.
The Post Office said yesterday: 'We are very disappointed at the
government's failure to cut our levy: if they continue bleeding us white, we
will not be able to deliver a first-class postal service.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Wider Revenue powers planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday published a report which recommends giving the
Inland Revenue new limited powers of access to accountants' files to gather
evidence of tax evasion.
Earlier plans to give Revenue officials sweeping powers to demand access to
accountants' papers were dropped from legislation in March after fierce
opposition.
As a result, a report was commissioned by the government from Mr Philip Ely,
a former Law Society president, on the Revenue's powers to call for
accountants' papers.
Yesterday Sir George Young, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said in
answer to a parliamentary question that the Inland Revenue had been told 'to
consult with the main representative bodies to seek the best way of
implementing the report's recommendations with a view to further
legislation'.
A statement from the Inland Revenue said: 'The inquiry found that there are
limitations in the Inland Revenue's powers which prevent them from gaining
access to the evidence of accountant involvement in tax evasion which falls
short of serious fraud, even where they have a reasonable belief that such
evidence exists.
'Mr Ely recommended new limited powers to give the Inland Revenue access to
the evidence in such cases.'
The original legislation, which would have allowed seizure on suspicion, was
designed to counter the problem of rogue accountants and tax practitioners.
But it was broadly opposed for its sweeping powers and the suggestion that
once the tax official had gained entry to the system all of a firm's files
might be vulnerable to scrutiny.
The accountancy profession was also unhappy with what it saw as the bias of
the original recommendation against accountants while it did not mention the
legal profession.
At the time Mr Peter Wyman, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'If the
Revenue needs additional powers they should have them, but there must be a
way to provide adequate safeguards.'
Mr John Whiting, a tax partner with Price Waterhouse, said he welcomed the
fact that the new powers were limited but said they would have to be studied
carefully.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water companies should focus on reducing their costs once they have invested
to meet their obligations, according to Mr Ian Byatt, the director-general
of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, David Lascelles writes.
Following the completion of last summer's price review, Mr Byatt said he
would be switching his attention to several issues of public interest. These
include levels of charges for different water and sewerage services,
comparative efficiency between water companies, and an emphasis on
achievement rather than expenditure.
He said: 'Significant changes have already taken place, notably in relation
to the balance between charges for measured and unmeasured supply. But more
remains to be done.'
At the next price review, he said, the regulator should take account of
whether companies have pursued charging policies which have sufficiently
controlled the resource costs of meeting the demand for water.

South Korea yesterday served notice it may challenge US implementing
legislation for the Uruguay Round when the World Trade Organisation is set
up next year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Seoul is angry that the legislation gives the US trade representative the
right to designate which countries count as developing in applying the new
subsidies accord. South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore have thereby been
excluded. Raising the issue at a meeting of the WTO preparatory committee in
Geneva, South Korea said the US had not challenged its developing country
status during the Uruguay Round negotiations. Hong Kong said the US
legislation was contrary to the practice of 'self-selection' for such status
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, told the meeting that 36
countries had now ratified the Uruguay Round trade pact. None of the Quad
group of leading traders - the US, European Union, Japan and Canada - have
yet done so.

report

<TEXT>
High trade barriers and lack of competition in domestic markets are
hindering growth of Indonesia's economy, the secretariat of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in an unusually critical report
published yesterday.
In particular, it highlights concentration of decision-making on trade and
industrial policies in the hands of President Suharto and highly
discretionary use of policy, including financial assistance, to aid certain
industrial sectors.
Indonesia, host last month to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit,
which endorsed regional free trade by 2020, remains one of the most
protected economies in south-east Asia. Though average tariffs have been cut
from 37 per cent to 20 per cent over the past decade, recent reforms have
been inadequate 'to overcome the anti-export bias of the trade regime and
stimulate domestic competition'.
Choosing its words carefully, Gatt echoes criticism of widespread cronyism
in the presidential circle. Trade policy-making, directed by the president,
'is highly informal and centralised' while 'close ties also exist between
the government and large business groups or conglomerates'.
Details of government assistance to strategic industries 'remain obscure'
while 'transparency is undermined by the substantial off-budget funding
apparently provided by the government to aid certain public enterprises'.
The report singles out aid to PT IPTN, the state-owned aircraft company,
'which also benefits from interest-free loans financed from a reforestation
fund'.
Though Gatt does not say so, the company is managed by Mr B J Habibie,
minister of research and development and a close friend of President
Suharto. Use of reforestation funds is subject of a legal challenge by
environmentalists.
Gatt also criticises Indonesia's widespread use of export controls which
affect more than half the country's non-oil exports, especially wood
products. The industry has benefited from cheap logs but Indonesia's
processing of plywood - the second biggest non-oil export after textiles -
'is technically inefficient by world standards, wasting timber and appearing
to contribute little to forest conservation'.
While Indonesia has made 'great strides' in lowering import barriers, the
report says tariffs vary widely; up to half all imports enter at
concessional rates for specific projects or for exporters.

Continued disagreement over diplomatic perks is delaying completion of the
formal headquarters agreement between the Swiss authorities and the future
World Trade Organisation. Trade officials say the accord may now not be
finalised before the WTO comes into effect on January 1. At a meeting
yesterday of the WTO preparatory committee, Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's
Gatt ambassador, said progress had been made on such issues as
accommodation, conference facilities and car parking. However, there had
been little headway on the treatment of WTO staff and country delegations in
Geneva. Last summer Geneva won the WTO headquarters site in a contest with
Bonn after promising more generous treatment of diplomats. The Swiss
authorities deny they are backtracking on these pledges but say the matter
of diplomatic perks should be separate from the WTO accord.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andean countries are fighting a rearguard action against proposed revision
of the European Union preferential tariff regime which would impose tariffs
on their exports to Europe of shrimp and tuna. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru have enjoyed benefits under the EU's generalised system of
preferences since 1990 to encourage them in the fight against drugs. Under a
new regime of preferences, expected to come into force over the next month,
Venezuela is expected to be added to the list. An Andean customs union
incorporating all five countries is due to go into effect on January 1.
The regime, as proposed, would raise from zero the tariff on tuna to 24 per
cent and on prawns to 5-18 per cent. Governments from Ecuador, Colombia and
Venezuela have argued this will have a big impact on a sector that generates
much employment, often in poor regions. Mr Humberto de la Calle, Colombian
vice-president, is in Europe this week to press for concessions. He said the
industries employed 20,000 people in his country. The tariffs are being
urged largely by France, but also by Italy. Paris wants to protect its own
small tuna fishing fleet, but also the shrimp and tuna industry in French
Guyana.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Bhutto seeks Dollars 5bn power sector
funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan is seeking additional foreign investment worth about Dollars 5bn in
its power sector to improve transmission and the supply of fuel to power
stations, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in London yesterday.
Pakistan had received 'an overwhelming response' to its efforts to attract
foreign investment in power generation, receiving applications for four
times the country's needs, she told a meeting of businessmen at the
Confederation of British Industry.
Now it needed investment in power transmission, oil pipelines and terminals
and dedicated railway tracks as part of its effort to ensure that power
shortages were not a constraint on growth.
Ms Bhutto was at the CBI to sign agreements covering more than Pounds 1bn
(Dollars 1.56bn) of UK investments in Pakistan's energy, chemical and
tourism sectors. Among these are a letter of intent from ICI to build a pure
terephtalic acid plant costing Dollars 400m at Port Quasim.
Other agreements signed by Lasmo, British Gas, Shell and Premier
Consolidated Oilfields cover exploration and development of Pakistan's oil
and gas fields.
British Gas' initial investment with partners including Monument Oil and Gas
will be Dollars 15m, but the figure could rise to Dollars 250m if its
exploration in the Sulaiman mountain range of Baluchistan is successful.
Businessmen say the rush of investment in Pakistan reflects its liberal
approach, under which there is no limit on foreign ownership of any
production facilities. All restrictions on repatriation of principal,
interest, dividends and profits have been lifted and the domestic currency
is fully convertible on current account.
Although Pakistan has received a large number of investment commitments in
power generation, some businessmen believe that fresh opportunities could
arise if financing on existing deals falls through. Investment in power
transmission could prove more difficult than in generation, not least
because of the difficulty in ensuring supplies are paid for, they add.
Pakistan is also seeking to privatise two existing power stations at Kot
Addu and Jamshoro. National Power, which yesterday signed an agreement
covering its Hub River power project, is bidding for these stations. Other
companies involved in yesterday's signing were Midlands Electricity,
Greyhound House, which is involved in tourism, and Biwater, which plans to
build a Dollars 30m hydroelectric power station near Gilgit.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Hualon grants to be challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European textile and clothing manufacturers yesterday launched a challenge
in the European Court to a Pounds 61m (Dollars 95m) UK government grant made
to Hualon, one of Taiwan's biggest industrial groups, to build a textiles
plant in Northern Ireland.
The case alleges that the European Commission broke its own rules by
approving the aid earlier this year. European manufacturers argue the Pounds
157m plant will add to capacity and threaten jobs in an already over
supplied sector.
The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, which is responsible for
the project, said last night that it could not comment until the court had
formed a view on the case. Hualon was unavailable for comment at its
headquarters in Taipei. Hualon has recently reaffirmed its commitment to the
proposed plant, which it says will create 1,800 jobs in Belfast. However,
the filing of the case raises further uncertainties about the project.
The start of the project has already been delayed several months to allow
time for appeals to the Commission's decision. It is unclear whether Hualon
will wish to proceed until the court rules, which is not expected for at
least 18 months. The IDB said yesterday building work on the proposed plant
had yet to begin, and it had disbursed none of the grant to Hualon. The
European Court case has been brought by Aiuffas, an organisation of European
filament weaving companies, and the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance,
the lobbying arm of the British Textiles and Apparel Confederation.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US Senate starts Gatt debate -
Administration cautions against over-confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate yesterday began debating the Uruguay Round trade pact, one day
after the House of Representatives voted by a margin of almost 2-1 for
passage of the accord.
Vote counters yesterday said the administration was just a few votes short
of the 60 out of 100 votes needed in the Senate. However, in a morning
meeting, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Senate leaders
cautioned against over-confidence and urged business groups to lobby 'until
the last vote is counted'.
Both sides in the debate acknowledged that the outcome of the Senate vote
would be crucial to the US economy and US international status. Opponents
warned that it would cost jobs. Senator Ernest Hollings, whose delaying
tactics prompted today's special session, warned of the collapse of the US
economy as jobs in industry were replaced by services.
Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, said the agreement would
benefit the average US family of four Dollars 1,700 for every year of the
next 10.
'How often are we able to put Dollars 1,700 in a family's bank account and
reduce the budget deficit at the same time?' he asked.
The voting dynamics are complex. The Senate may take a lead from Tuesday's
convincing vote of approval in the House, but those up for re-election in
two years are cautious. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, and Senator Hank
Brown, a Republican, both usually in favour of trade liberalisation and both
up for re-election in 1996, have come out against the pact.
In the implementing legislation, the administration strove to address
concerns of various constituencies; in the view of some it tried too hard.
The 10-year phase out of protection for textiles and apparel - one of the
great concessions for the developing countries - gives virtually no
liberalisation for the first few years and little until the end of the
transition period.
The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, which usually seeks
protection, issued a statement yesterday acknowledging but not condemning
the House vote. Passage of the legislation 'is just the beginning of major
changes we will see in international trade policies and practices,' said Mr
William Armfield, ATMI president. 'Much is still undecided and unexplored,
but opportunities will exist for our industry, along with new problems'.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Mazda clinches deal on Fiesta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and Mazda have reached agreement in principle for Ford to supply its
European-built Fiesta small car to Mazda for sale through the Japanese
group's European dealer network. The deal is a breakthrough for Mazda, which
is the last of the leading Japanese carmakers to secure a European
production source.
Ford said yesterday that production of the Mazda-badged version of the
Fiesta would begin in about 12 months with an output of around 25,000 a
year.
The cars will be produced at one of Ford's three Fiesta assembly plants in
Europe but Ford said it had not yet been decided which one would be
selected. The plants are at Dagenham, near London, at Cologne in Germany and
at Valencia in Spain.
The current Fiesta, which was launched in 1989, is due to be replaced in the
second half of next year with an extensively modernised range. This will
include a new engine, code-named Sigma, developed in co-operation with
Yamaha of Japan. The engines will be built at the Valencia plant.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford, will receive a version of the
updated Fiesta with slightly differentiated exterior and interior styling.
Ford faces a complex task of allocating future Fiesta-based production
between the three European plants because of an ambitious new product
programme.
This includes the launch of the modernised mainstream Fiesta range, the
addition of a new coupe and the introduction of a range of smaller cars
derived from the Fiesta but designed to compete with rivals such as the Fiat
Cinquecento in the mini segment of the European market.
The deal for Ford cars to be sold under a Mazda badge in Europe is a
reversal of the two groups' long-established arrangement in Asia, where some
Mazda cars such as the Mazda 626 and the Mazda 323/Familia are sold
respectively as the Ford Telstar and the Ford Laser. In the US Mazda is to
sell a version of the Ford Ranger pickup.

FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Air travel incentive agreements under fire
 -UK watchdog warns about damage to competitiveness of smaller airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Action should be taken against large airlines which offer financial
incentives to companies to use their flights, the UK's Civil Aviation
Authority said yesterday. The authority said supervisory bodies should keep
a 'watchful eye' on frequent flyer programmes and code-sharing agreements to
ensure they were not being used to keep smaller airlines from competing.
In a report on competition on long-haul routes to and from Europe, the
authority said that bilateral airline agreements remained the most serious
obstacle to competition.
Mr Christopher Chataway, the authority's chairman, said: 'Aviation is a
mature industry and policies based on nationality and an equal division of
benefits between airlines are increasingly out of touch with modern
economies.'
He added: 'There is intrinsically less scope for competition from smaller
airlines on long haul routes than on short haul. Given this, the major
airlines' commercial strategies must not be allowed to threaten the
continuation of such competition as there is.'
The report said deals between large carriers and companies, under which the
companies received financial incentives in return for using the airlines'
global network, had anti-competitive effects.
The authority said any action against such agreements 'would need to be at
supra-national level, involving at least the European Commission and the US
authorities and probably others'.
Frequent flyer programmes run by large airlines had the potential to be a
substantial barrier for smaller carriers with fewer routes, the report said.
It concluded, however, that intervention against frequent flyer programmes
would be premature.
This was because smaller carriers could benefit from alliances which allowed
frequent flyer points to be transferred from one airline to another. The
authority said, however, that the effect of the programmes on smaller
carriers should be closely monitored.
The report added: 'If it proves necessary to intervene in the future this
might be achieved by requiring larger airlines to accept smaller carriers as
members of their frequent flyer programmes or by making awards
transferable.'
The issue of code-sharing was less clear cut, the authority said.
Code-sharing is when two airlines use a single flight number to market a
route. Passengers might begin the flight on one of the airlines and change
to an aircraft belonging to the other during a stop-over.
The report said code-sharing was sometimes used to benefit smaller airlines,
enabling them to compete more effectively with large carriers. The
difficulty occurs when code-sharing results in the withdrawal of an existing
service by one of the airlines involved. However, the authority did not
recommend immediate action.
The report said ways were needed to be found to promote competition between
European and non-European airlines, particularly on routes where competition
was weak. Bilateral air agreements hampered competition, but these were
likely to come under pressure in future, the report said.
Among developments likely to weaken the bilateral agreement system were the
growth of cross-border airline shareholdings and the need for carriers to
have access to wider sources of capital.

Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they are now the minority
party, yesterday re-elected Mr Richard Gephardt as their leader, AP reports
from Washington.
Brushing aside conservative pressure for a shake-up after the Democrats'
defeat in the mid-term elections, Mr Gephardt beat Mr Charlie Rose of North
Carolina, by 150 votes to 58, to keep the post he has held since 1989. The
outcome ensures that he remains leader for the next two years.

FT  01 DEC 94 / NBC seeking ruling over Fox ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rivalry between the established US television networks and Mr Rupert
Murdoch's nine-year-old Fox network intensified yesterday when NBC filed a
petition with federal regulators challenging Fox's claim that it is
American-owned.
Under US broadcasting industry regulations, foreign interests are prohibited
from owning more than 25 per cent of a US network. When Fox was established
in 1985 the Australian-born Mr Murdoch satisfied this requirement by
adopting American citizenship and putting 76 per cent of Fox in the control
of a company owned by himself and Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment
industry executive who was chief executive of Fox at the time.
NBC, however, argues that Fox's ownership has changed since 1985, and claims
that only 1 per cent of the network's equity is now owned by Mr Murdoch,
with the remainder controlled by News Corporation, Mr Murdoch's Australian
media group.
In its petition to the Federal Communications Commission, NBC asks the
regulatory agency to review Fox's ownership structure. Mr Richard Cotton,
NBC's general counsel, said the FCC must force Fox to abide by the laws
restricting foreign ownership, or allow the other US networks to seek
foreign investment. 'We are saying to the FCC: either enforce the law or
change it.'
Fox responded by describing NBC's petition as an attempt to abuse FCC
processes to delay and impede competition. Mr Preston Padden, head of
network distribution at Fox, said NBC's real complaint was that competition
from Fox was costing NBC money.
Although by law the FCC has to respond to NBC's filing, the agency is
already conducting a review of Fox's ownership. This was launched earlier
this year at Fox's request after a complaint to the FCC by the National
Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the civil rights group.
The association has long argued that foreign ownership of television
stations denies minorities the opportunity to own a stake in the domestic
broadcasting business.
The first review is due to be published soon, and while analysts do not
expect the FCC to revoke Fox's broadcasting licence, it could fine the
network and/or force Mr Murdoch to change the financial structure of his US
broadcasting interests.
There was no comment from Mr Murdoch yesterday but he has said that this
could be done relatively simply if required.
NBC and the other established networks, ABC and CBS, have been increasingly
frustrated by Fox's aggressive expansion and what NBC claims is preferential
treatment of the network by the regulators.
In the past year Fox has embarked on an ambitious growth programme, luring
affiliate local television stations away from other networks and outbidding
its rivals for the rights to broadcast American football and other sports.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Zedillo names reformists to join new Mexican cabinet: Large
number of technocrats raises concern about government's political
inexperience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, who today will be inaugurated as Mexico's president, has
named a series of reform-minded officials to senior positions in his
cabinet, indicating his commitment to economic and political change.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the 43-year-old former trade minister in the
administration of President Carlos Salinas and a committed free-marketeer,
was named finance minister.
The top political post went to Mr Esteban Moctezuma, a youthful 40-year-old
who is believed to be a cautious advocate of further political reform. Mr
Luis Tellez, 36, a US-educated economist and principal architect of Mexico's
recent agriculture reforms, was appointed the president's chief of staff.
In a signal of his decision to move ahead with reform of the judicial and
legal system, Mr Zedillo named Mr Antonio Lozano, a member of the opposition
National Action party, as attorney-general.
Mr Lozano is expected to take charge of the troubled investigation into the
assassination of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the party's former second
most senior official.
The large number of foreign-trained technicians in the cabinet has led to
concern that the new government lacks political experience and fails to
reflect different interests in the ruling party.
One of the few old-style politicians to be rewarded was Mr Ignacio Pichardo,
PRI president, who was named energy minister.
Mr Pichardo has vigorously denied allegations that he conspired with other
senior officials to block the investigation into the murder of Mr Ruiz
Massieu, made by the dead man's brother, Mario.
Mr Serra, who like Mr Zedillo has a doctorate in economics from Yale
University, negotiated the free trade accord with the US and Canada.
He is likely to deepen the economic reforms that characterised the
presidency of Mr Salinas. In a recent interview, Mr Serra expressed his
unequivocal support for continuation of current exchange rate policy,
arguing that devaluation would feed inflation and raise interest rates.
Mr Moctezuma, an economist who has little political experience, has
established good relations with some senior opposition figures in recent
months. While his views are not widely known, he is considered more open to
further democratic reform than the other candidates mentioned for the post.
He is personally close to Mr Zedillo, and can be expected to be a loyal
lieutenant.
Mr Jose Angel Gurria, the loquacious former debt chief, becomes foreign
minister, in a move that is bound to shake up Mexico's cautious foreign
office, and lead to a more aggressive foreign policy. As expected, Mr Pedro
Aspe, the former finance minister, decided not to accept a position in Mr
Zedillo's cabinet; after taking some time off, he is expected to look for a
position in an international bank.
Other professional economists were given senior positions indicating Mr
Zedillo's strong support for intensified economic and social reform.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the former deputy finance minister, was given the
communications and transport portfolio, suggesting that rules limiting
private investment in infrastructure will be further loosened.
Mr Herminio Blanco, a former under-minister in the trade ministry, was
appointed its minister. Mr Oscar Espinosa, formerly head of Mexico's
state-owned development bank, becomes mayor of Mexico City.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Growth in US revised upward to 3.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew faster than previously reported in the third quarter as
businesses invested more heavily in new equipment, the Commerce Department
said yesterday.
Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent
during the third quarter, the department said, rather than the 3.4 per cent
rate it had announced a month ago in its advance estimate.
This indicated only a modest slowdown from the 4.1 per cent pace of growth
in the second quarter, although economists caution the number could still
change substantially by the time the Commerce Department issues its final
third-quarter GDP figure next month.
Most of the change from the earlier figure was accounted for by a rise in
the estimate of non-residential fixed investment, which rose at an
annualised rate of 14.4 per cent in the third quarter, more than twice as
fast as originally reported.
Within this investment figure, capital equipment purchases by producers rose
at an 18.0 per cent rate, which should have favourable implications for
future productivity, and thus reduce the risk of inflationary pressures.
Although the pace of inventory building slowed from the second quarter, it
remained rapid and has added more than a percentage point of growth to GDP
in the first three quarters.
One of the difficulties economists have had in assessing the path of the US
economy this year has been determining the extent to which producers have
been increasing their inventories voluntarily, or have simply found
themselves stuck with excess stocks.
In another report that slightly eased worries about the build-up of
inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve issued revisions to its
statistics on industrial production and capacity utilisation over the last
three years.
The new data, which incorporate additional information from trade
associations and new estimates of industrial capacity, show that industrial
production grew more strongly in 1991 and 1992 than previously reported, but
slower in 1993 and 1994. This slower rate is attributed largely to the
introduction of new weights assigned to the computer industry to take
account of the sharp drop in the price of computing power over the years.
After the revision, the rate of industrial capacity utilisation in October
drops to 84.6 per cent, from the 84.9 per cent originally reported, while
the capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector drops from 84.7 per
cent to 84.0 per cent.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Chile realigns its currency against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IMOGEN MARK and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chilean peso revalued by 3.5 per cent yesterday against the US dollar
after the central bank announced measures to realign the band in which the
currency is allowed to trade.
The new revaluation came on top of a effective appreciation of 13 per cent
in real terms already this year. The dollar was trading at 402-403 pesos
yesterday among banks - compared with Tuesday's 416.50, then its highest
permitted level.
The Chilean peso is allowed to fluctuate 10 per cent either side of a
reference rate and the central bank measures moved this reference rate to
about 418 pesos to the dollar, from 462.7 a day earlier. Bankers estimated
the new ceiling rate for the peso to be around 376 to the dollar.
Technically, the central bank adjusted the weightings of the three
currencies which are used to calculate the reference rate, with the dollar's
weighting reduced to 45 per cent from 50 per cent, the yen's rising to 25
per cent from 20 per cent, and the D-Mark unchanged at 30 per cent.
The peso had been at the top of its permitted range since the beginning of
November, despite repeated dollar purchases by the central bank calculated
by some bankers at well over Dollars 1bn (Pounds 637m). The central bank was
reported to have intervened again yesterday, after the peso opened at 396 to
the dollar.
This year has seen record inflows of capital, with more than a dozen Chilean
companies now trading on Wall Street after share issues in the New York
market. Direct foreign investment also rose by 60 per cent, to Dollars
2.2bn, the foreign investment committee announced yesterday.
In addition, export earnings have recovered as prices for several of Chile's
main exports, chiefly copper - which this week reached a record high - and
wood pulp, have improved strongly during the year. As a result the trade
balance is showing a Dollars 400m surplus, compared with an expected deficit
of Dollars 900m.
Bankers said more central bank dollar purchases would have worsened problems
in managing the money supply, and that the revaluation made it more likely
that Chilean inflation, which fell below 10 per cent this year, would remain
in single digits next year. The revaluation is likely to hurt exporters, and
benefit importers.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Rao may face defeats in close state polls: Congress party
faces acid test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, is entering his biggest
electoral test since he took office and launched his economic reforms more
than three years ago.
Today and next Monday, voters are going to the polls in his home state of
Andhra Pradesh, in southern India, to choose a state assembly. Similar
elections have already been held in the small states of Goa, on the west
coast, and Sikkim, in the north, and are being completed today in the large
southern state of Karnataka. Counting in all four polls will start on
December 9.
Despite his 73 years, Mr Rao has summoned up the energy to campaign
personally in all four states, saying the elections are an acid test for the
ruling Congress (I) party and its policies, including economic reform. 'The
stakes are high in these elections for everyone; the people, the government,
the country,' he says.
The indications are Congress, in power in all four states, could fare badly,
not least in Andhra. The wily premier has thus been trying to distance his
(as opposed to his party's) reputation from the results saying the polls are
'no referendum on me'.
Strictly speaking the prime minister may be right. The issues which have
dominated campaigns in all four states have been local - the performance of
state governments, corruption, and rival promises to deliver free rice and
other goodies to the voters.
His record is rarely mentioned, while the premier's economic reforms barely
reg-ister in the minds of most voters.
However two national issues have had a bearing on the elections. One is
inflation, which has been running recently at about 9 per cent a year.
Although this is considerably lower than the 13 per cent recorded in Mr
Rao's first year, prices are still rising uncomfortably fast for many
voters.
Congress has also suffered from the prime minister's handling of the sacking
of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992 by militant Hindus. Angry Moslem
voters, traditional Congress voters, have turned elsewhere, particularly in
Andhra.
If Congress fares badly in the state polls, the prime minister seems bound
to run into criticism in Delhi. As the man from Andhra Pradesh and the only
southerner at the top of a party traditionally dominated by northerners, he
will have to accept some responsibility for defeat in the south.
He seems strong enough to withstand any attempts to oust him until the next
general election, due by mid-1996. But a poor showing in these state polls
may undermine his authority. Northern Congress leaders such as Mr Arjun
Singh, the deputy prime minister, who have criticised Mr Rao before, might
try again.
With state elections due in four more big states early next year -
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa and Bihar - and with the general election on
the horizon, it is probably too late for Mr Rao's rivals to risk an all-out
attack. The threat to party unity would be too great.
But if Congress does as poorly as expected in the polls, the party could
face a period of sniping and back-stabbing.
Whether he likes it or not, the prime minister's fortunes are most closely
tied to Andhra.
A rich agricultural state with a small but fast-growing industrial base,
Andhra has done well during his rule. But the Congress-run state has seen
two chief ministers ousted in the past five years because of alleged
corruption and intra-party quarrelling and the incumbent chief minister also
faces allegations of nepotism and bribe-taking.
The challenge to Congress comes from one of India's most colourful
politicians - Mr N T Rama Rao.
A 72-year-old former film star universally known as NTR, he entered state
politics 12 years ago. With the support of a young new wife, Lakshmi
Parvathi, NTR has been drawing huge crowds at rallies.
His promise of subsidised rice at the low price of Rs2 (4 pence) a
kilogramme has been the single biggest vote-winner of the campaign.
A Congress party counter-offer of free rice for the poor has been met with
widespread scepticism.
But memories of the last NTR administration in the 1980s, also hit by
charges of corruption, incompetence and internal dissent, may persuade some
voters to stick with Congress.
Recent opinion polls however show NTR's regional party, the Telugu Desam
party, could wrest the state from Congress.
In Karnataka the ruling Congress party also faces the likely loss of a clear
majority. But with three other groupings all expected to garner reasonable
shares of the vote, the outcome could be a hung assembly with seats split
between Congress, a rebel Congress faction, the left-leaning Janata Dal and
the rightwing Bharatiya Janata party.
In Goa the main political issue is whether the BJP has been able to
capitalise on an alliance it has formed with a local party - the MGP - to
help overthrow a rather jaded Congress government. The opposition alliance
is expected to win but it is not clear how much national benefit the BJP can
derive from victory in such a small state.
In Sikkim the fight is on to fill a vacuum created by the overthrow in May
of Mr Nar Bahadur Bhandari, who ruled the state for 15 years in the name of
the Sikkim Sangram Parishad, a local party, indirectly supported by
Con-gress.
Mr Bhandari is battling to return to power, with his main competition coming
from Congress and another local grouping.

South Africa's ANC-led government has released a draft policy document on
mineral and energy affairs which calls for the unbundling of mining
conglomerates and the expansion of public ownership of mineral rights to
facilitate the growth of small-scale, black mining. When presenting the
document in Johannesburg yesterday, Ms Cheryl Carolus, the ANC's head of
economic policy, emphasised that the proposals represented a basis for
discussions with the industry and other stakeholders and would probably be
revised substantially before becoming official party policy, let alone the
basis of new legislation.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Japan's industrial output falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese economy is in the early stage of a below-par recovery, as shown
yesterday by a larger than expected decline in industrial production in
October. Output fell by 0.3 per cent from September, the second month of
decline, as a result of a temporary build-up of unsold stocks as demand fell
back from a summer spurt. Production was up by 0.7 per cent on average when
taken over the three months to October.
That puts output on track to rise by 1.1 per cent this calender year, based
on estimates by the ministry of international trade and industry. If
achieved, this would be the first annual rise since 1991, when production
went up by 1.7 per cent. One encouraging sign is that stocks of unsold goods
and materials started to fall back again in October, by 0.1 per cent from
the previous month, or down 4.7 per cent year-on-year.

Two US Navy helicopters took food, water and medicines to nearly 1,000
passengers and crew rescued from the burning Italian cruise liner Achille
Lauro off the east coast of Africa, a Navy spokesman said yesterday. The
anti-submarine helicopter from the cruiser Gettysburg lowered the supplies
to the Panamanian tanker Hawaiian King and the Liberian bulk oil carrier
Bardu, which had picked up the survivors from life rafts earlier in the day.
All 979 passengers and crew had been accounted for, according to Italian
coastguard officers co-ordinating the rescue. The Naples-based owner of the
23,478-tonne vessel said two men, a German and a Briton, had died in the
below-decks blaze and eight people had been injured.
The Achille Lauro was insured for Pounds 11.5m with about half the cover
provided by the London insurance market, Lloyd's of London said. The vessel
made international headlines when it was hijacked by Palestinian guerrillas
in the Mediterranean nine years ago.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Top court acts in Indian bribes scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's Supreme Court yesterday ordered the government to explain delays in
the investigation of a Rs520m (Pounds 10.6m) scandal involving illegal
foreign exchange deals and payments to top politicians and bureaucrats.
The court called for an explanation why the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI), the main criminal investigation agency, and the income tax and
foreign exchange authorities had not dealt 'appropriately' with a case
dating back to May 1991.
The court order comes amid mounting public concern about corruption,
especially bribes paid by businesses, including foreign companies, to secure
public contracts. Allegations of corruption have figured prominently in four
states which are currently holding local assembly elections.
The court case stemmed from a public interest petition filed last year by Mr
Vineet Narain, a leading journalist, asking the court to examine the CBI
investigation into the affairs of Mr Surendra Jain, a New Delhi businessman
with extensive political contacts who specialised in arranging power station
contracts.
The investigation began in early 1991 with a probe into black market foreign
exchange transactions involving armed militant groups in the troubled
northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. Investigators tracing a trail of
suspicious-looking deals came across Mr Jain's name. In May 1991, the CBI
raided premises belonging to Mr Jain's family and seized cash, and receipts
for undeclared foreign exchange transactions totalling Rs520m.
To their surprise, the investigators also found diaries detailing alleged
payments to leading politicians and bureaucrats totalling just under Rs500m.
According to the petition presented to the Supreme Court, the alleged
recipients included Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the late prime minister, and other
leading figures of the ruling Congress (I) party, among them Mr Bhajan Lal,
the former agriculture minister, and Mr Kalpanath Rai, who was Mr Gandhi's
energy minister and is now food minister.
Two other alleged recipients were Mr Mohammed Arif Khan, another former
power minister, and Mr LK Advani, leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata
party.
Payments were also allegedly made to bureaucrats dealing with the
electricity industry and to others, including the Delhi police chief. While
some alleged recipients are named in full in the diaries, others are
referred to by their initials.
Virtually all those allegedly identified have denied to Indian journalists
that they received any money from Mr Jain.
Mr Narain, the petitioner, told the court that the CBI did nothing to
investigate the case between May 1991 and July 1993, when he started his own
inquiries. In an extraordinary admission, the solicitor general told the
court the delay was caused partly by the fact that the CBI officer
supervising the case was caught demanding bribes from Mr Jain to halt the
investigation.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Donors pledge budget aid for Palestinians

Donors, under pressure to give credibility to the Middle East peace process,
yesterday agreed to plug a Dollars 125m (Pounds 76.2m) budget deficit and
boost employment for Palestinians, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Jan Egeland, Norway's deputy foreign minister, said after chairing a
two-day meeting of donors in Brussels that Dollars 102m had been pledged so
far to cover the Palestinian budget gap until the end of March 1995. The
remainder would be found soon.
'All three sides (Israelis, Palestinians and donors) pledged to work towards
one common goal - to fill the Dollars 125m gap,' Mr Egeland told a news
conference.
The donor conference, which included delegates from the European Union, the
World Bank, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Russia and the US, committed
an additional Dollars 23m to create thousands of new jobs in the area. The
employment programme would be defined within two weeks.
The three sides earlier signed an accord detailing Palestinian budget needs,
anticipated revenue from taxes and Israeli refunds.
The new funds come at a critical time because of rising discontent among
Palestinians who say peace has not brought any financial rewards.
'There was a feeling that unless we provided economic dividends for peace,
the situation would become more serious,' said Mr Nabeel Shaath, minister of
internal co-operation for the Palestinian authority.
'Stability has two legs - one economic and one political,' Mr Shaath told
reporters.
The donor conference also agreed to form a co-ordination committee to assess
how aid was being channeled.
In October last year, donors pledged more than Dollars 2bn over five years
for projects to support Palestinian self-rule, with Dollars 700 million
earmarked for this year.
A senior World Bank official said on Tuesday that only Dollars 200 to
Dollars 240m would be disbursed by this year and delays in implementing the
peace process had set back economic projects.
The EU pledged Dollars 48m of the total needed to plug the deficit.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Australian growth surges to 6.4%: Queensland drought fails
to halt biggest output increase since 1985

Australia's annual growth rate surged to 6.4 per cent during the September
quarter, the highest level since 1985. This is also the strongest
year-on-year increase in gross domestic product being reported by any
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country.
The figure would have been even higher, at around 7.3 per cent, had it not
been for the impact of the severe drought on the farm sector in News South
Wales and Queensland, and was far above both market and official government
forecasts. The market had anticipated a rate of about 5.5 per cent, while
budget forecasts had assumed the Australian economy would grow at about 4.5
per cent during the 1994-95 financial year.
With the data revealing that growth in gross domestic product was fuelled in
large part by a surge in private consumption spending, local economists
quickly concluded that a rise in interest rates before Christmas was now a
strong possibility. Earlier in the week, statistical data showing a better
performance by Australian exporters in October and a decline in the monthly
trade deficit had appeared to make this less likely.
The Australian dollar rose sharply on the GDP figures, hitting a 31-month
high at one stage. By late afternoon, it had gained almost half a cent and
was trading at about USDollars 0.768.
In Canberra Mr Ralph Willis, federal treasurer, said the government expected
the growth rate to slow with and recent interest rate increases moderating
demand. He did not rule out a mini-budget in the new year.
Mr Willis said the current level of growth might prompt the government to
consider adjustments to fiscal policy.
Mr Willis' softening of the government's stance comes less than 24 hours
after Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, urged it
to consider using fiscal policy to rein in the budget deficit and prevent
any serious rise in inflation.
Opposition parties accused the government of losing control of the economy.
Mr Alexander Downer, leader of the coalition opposition said: 'We now know
that the Labor government's real agenda is to increase taxes and higher
taxes are going to damage Australian families and businesses.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Stock market bar to China pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has banned pension schemes from investing in the country's volatile
stock markets, insisting that funds go into approved government securities.
A finance ministry decree stated that pension funds must not be used to
purchase stock or for any kind of direct investment. It stipulated that 80
per cent should be spent on treasury bonds, with the balance held in bank
deposits.
'These funds, an important ingredient of a fledgling social security
network, should be risk-free and not be used for other purposes,' said a
joint circular issued by the ministries of finance and labour earlier this
week.
China has recently accelerated steps towards a national social security net
for urban dwellers. A national superannuation scheme is part of this plan.
The decree follows speculation that the authorities were about to relax
restrictions on pension fund investment in the country's stock market.
But Beijing has clearly decided that for the time being China's stock
markets are too risky. The markets have followed a rollercoaster ride this
year.
The Shanghai composite index peaked at 1,052.94 on September 13, up from the
year's low of 325.89 on July 25. The composite index stood yesterday at
683.59, down about 40 per cent since September.
The finance ministry directive also laid down rules for the investment of
unemployment insurance funds and health funds, insisting that the bulk of
these be used to purchase government securities.
China is becoming more dependent on treasury bonds to finance its budget
deficit and huge infrastructure requirements. More than Yn100bn (Pounds
7.5bn) of treasury bonds were issued this year and there are plans for a
similar amount next year.
Stock market officials have been calling for the establishment of Chinese
unit trusts, but the government has been unwilling to approve the move
because of concerns about its ability to regulate them.
Official attitudes to the markets range from the sceptical to the downright
negative. Mr Lu Heping, deputy director of the finance ministry department
of social security, reflected these negative views in remarks published
yesterday by China Daily.
'The high-risk stock market is by no means the right investment option for
the funds, especially with the absence of a sound legal framework,' Mr Lu
said. 'The safest instrument for the funds is state bonds, which have an
interest rate about 2 percentage points higher than bank deposits.'
The finance ministry decree follows reports of misuse of pension fund money.
The circular said that 'misused money' should be retrieved within six
months.
Funds are believed to have been channelled into the stock market and real
estate projects, some of which have not been successful.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Summit push in Aids war: Paris talks seek 'more unanimous'
attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political leaders from 42 countries will today meet in Paris at an Aids
summit to pledge their moral and financial solidarity to combat the HIV
virus that afflicts at least 17m people around the globe.
Although it is the highest-level gathering convened on the issue, the
presence of only a few heads of government testifies to the discomfort
politicians retain over a disease that has sex and drugs as its two main
means of transmission.
Mrs Simone Veil, the French health minister, said France had, in partnership
with the World Health Organisation, sponsored the summit to galvanise
politicians as well as medical experts into a 'more resolute, more
sustained, more unanimous' attack on the disease, identified nearly 15 years
ago and still spreading fast.
The French organisers say the summit is not just a 'consciousness-raising'
exercise but also an effort to put new resources into the battle against
Aids, particularly in developing countries. At present, only 8 per cent of
the money devoted to combating Aids is spent in developing countries where
92 per cent of those affected live. However, some of the much larger amount
spent in developed countries goes on research into treatments or cures that
would be of general benefit - if they were made affordable.
The 42 countries participating in the summit are represented by a mix of
prime ministers (mostly from Africa), health ministers and other officials.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, is also due to
attend. They are to issue a declaration expressing solidarity in the Aids
battle, stressing the rights of individuals afflicted by Aids or the HIV
virus, committing themselves to better prevention and safety procedures in
blood transfusions, and promising more resources.
The draft declaration recognises that the disease 'is hindering social and
economic development' and calls for 'national and international partnerships
between the public and private sectors, in order to accelerate the
development of prevention and treatment technologies . . . and to provide
for the measures needed to ensure their accessibility in developing
countries'.
Mrs Veil said the annual international Aids conference held in Yokohama in
August this year showed that Aids was spreading to virtually all categories
of the population and that the search for a cure was going to be 'a long
haul'. France is to provide FFr100m (Pounds 11.9m) next year to help follow
up initiatives taken at the summit, in addition to its regular budget for
research into Aids of FFr230m in 1995.
France's sensitivity to the world Aids crisis is heightened by its own
problems. Despite the fact that France's Professor Luc Montagnier pioneered
the discovery of the HIV virus in 1983, France is the worst sufferer in
Europe from Aids, with 32,722 cases reported since the start of the epidemic
and a further 100,000-120,000 thought to have been exposed to HIV. Half
these cases are in the Paris area, where Aids is the chief cause of death
for 20- to 34-year-olds.
One of the main themes of the Paris summit, which will also be addressed by
people living with Aids, is the need for safer procedures in blood
transfusions, an issue the French are well aware of after the infection of
several hundred haemophiliacs by Aids-contaminated blood in the early 1980s.
Two doctors have gone to jail and Mr Laurent Fabius, a former prime
minister, and two of his health ministers have been charged with 'poisoning'
their fellow citizens.
Canada's Mr Jean Chretien will be one of the few western prime ministers
attending the summit. A national commission of inquiry in Canada is
investigating the safety of blood supplies after the infection of hundreds
of blood-transfusion recipients in the mid-1980s.
Some farther-flung countries, such as Brazil, will be represented merely by
their Paris ambassadors. Brazil aims to highlight links between intravenous
drug use and Aids as well as criticise discriminatory laws, such as in
Russia where all visitors are required to be tested.
Japan will field a former foreign minister, Mr Taro Nakayama, who is a
doctor. It placed greater importance in hosting this summer's international
Aids conference, which was opened by Crown Prince Naruhito and Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, prime minister.
The UK is sending Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, who is expected
to announce spending plans on HIV-related services for next year.
Accompanying her will be Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence
Higgins Trust, the leading British Aids charity. Last year she imposed a 65
per cent cut over three years in the trust's grant, but today the ministers'
declaration will stress their support for the activities of non-governmental
organisations in fighting the pandemic.

Iberia's pilots union yesterday refused to accept an accord reached by
management and representatives of the carrier's two largest unions. After a
second day of talks, the union's chief negotiator said: 'The only viability
plan the company has put forward is one based solely on reducing salaries.
This is important, but it will not save the company. The company has to be

FT  01 DEC 94 / Ruling sets back Italian graft inquiry: Milan's crusading
magistrates ordered to hand over their investigations to others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crusading anti-corruption investigations of Milan's magistrates that
have helped change the political face of Italy suffered a serious reverse
yesterday as a result of a decision by the country's appeal court.
The decision switches to neighbouring Brescia magistrates the investigations
and subsequent trials of all those involved in Milan's inquiries into
corruption in the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. This has become
one of the most sensitive investigations in the past six months and last
week involved Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, at the time that he
was running his Fininvest business empire.
The full judgment of the appeal court has yet to be published and it is
likely to be challenged in the courts by the Milan judiciary. But the
immediate effect will be to slow down investigations and trials - not least
the questioning of Mr Berlusconi which was postponed at the weekend and is
due to take place this week. Brescia magistrates said yesterday they were
hopelessly understaffed to cope with the extra workload.
Members of the government welcomed the decision as a sign that public
concern that Milan magistrates were abusing their authority had finally been
recognised. However, the opposition expressed grave concern over what it
perceived as a deliberate move to undermine the principal judicial team in
the 'clean hands' anti-corruption drive. Mr Eugenio Scalfari, editor of the
daily La Repubblica, insinuated in an editorial that Mr Berlusconi had
delayed his interrogation to benefit from this impending decision.
The appeal court action stemmed from a case brought by General Giuseppe
Cerciello, who has been in a military prison since July 9 on charges of
allowing a well organised system of bribes over company tax inspections
within the Guardia while he was head of tax inspection. The investigation
has led three members of the Guardia di Finanza to commit suicide, and the
general was due to go to trial on December 5, along with 48 businessmen and
policemen.
Gen Cerciello complained he could not obtain a fair hearing because the
Guardia di Finanza was being used to investigate corruption allegations
inside the corps. He further highlighted the unusual circumstances in which
members of the Guardia di Finanza, used by Milan to investigate other cases
of corruption, were now being accused of corruption. At least one Guardia di
Finanza member used heavily by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known
anti-corruption magistrate, is in prison having admitted taking bribes over
company tax inspections.
These complaints were rejected on two occasions by civil liberties courts.
However, they are the subject of a current inspection of the conduct of the
Milan judiciary ordered by Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister.
Meanwhile, Gen Cerciello's lawyer is himself under investigation for
allegedly putting pressure on one of the accused Guardia di Finanza
officials to retract accusations against the general.
Although the appeal court judgment appears to be founded on sound legal
argument, in the present highly charged political climate it is
automatically seen by the government's opponents as directed against the
Milan magistrates. Over the past three decades Italian justice has seen many
cases removed from one magistrature's jurisdiction to waste time and confuse
issues. The government will be hard pressed to demonstrate the contrary now.
Mr Berlusconi himself has been open in his attacks on the politicised nature
of the Milan judiciary, which is investigating him for alleged corruption
relating to the payment by Fininvest companies of bribes totalling L330m
(Pounds 130,000) to the Guardia di Finanza between 1989-92. It is also
unusual that a government should order an inspection of a branch of the
judiciary about its conduct of investigations while those same
investigations are still continuing.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Spanish airline looks to Brussels to keep it aloft: Without
aid, Iberia faces bankruptcy within three months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Iberia hurries, it will just have time to hand to Mr Marcelino Oreja its
request for a fresh injection of large amounts of public money. The European
Commission's outgoing transport commissioner, like most Spaniards, is a
frequent user of the beleaguered national airline.
Any delay will mean that Iberia's bid for a Pta130bn (Pounds 640m) aid
package will land in the in-tray of Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour
party leader, who replaces Mr Oreja in January.
A sympathetic hearing in Brussels is vital for Iberia. Unless the Commission
authorises its urgent recapitalisation, the airline could be bankrupt in
three months' time. But the issue is likely to prove even more controversial
than Brussels' recent approval of a much larger subsidy - Pounds 2.4bn
(Dollars 3.9bn) - to Air France, a move which is being challenged by other
airlines in the European Court.
The first problem Iberia will face is that its request runs counter to the
'one time, last time' policy on state aid that governs the Commission's
efforts to liberalise the airline industry by 1997. Brussels authorised a
Pta120bn capital injection into the Spanish airline just two years ago.
Iberia will accordingly plead that it faces 'exceptional circumstances,
unforeseen and external to the company' as the Commission's subsidy
guidelines state. One such circumstance would be the three devaluations the
peseta suffered between September 1992 and last June.
The second problem is that the effectiveness of a viability plan for the
airline which will accompany the request is certain to be questioned by the
Commission's more hawkish members. Mr Karel Van Miet, commissioner
responsible for competition policy, is one such, and he has clashed recently
with Mr Oreja over airline subsidies.
Details of the viability plan have still to be finalised but the signs are
that it will fall far short of the management's original hopes. A wildcat
strike on Monday, which paralysed air traffic in Spain and cost Iberia more
than Pta1bn in lost revenue , forced a drastic revision of cost-cutting
plans.
Bowing to union pressure, the airline agreed to lower wages by 8 per cent
rather than 15, promised to make up back pay which it had said it could not
honour, and agreed to stagger 3,500 redundancies, through incentives and
early retirements, over three years instead of two.
Before Monday's strike, the carrier's management had said that failure to
agree on a 15 per cent wage cut would mean the immediate firing of 5,000
employees, 20 per cent of its labour force, and the break up of the company
in order to raise capital through disposals.
The climbdown is unlikely to impress those who believe that baling out
Iberia, which has debts of Pta424bn, half of which are short term, is the
equivalent of good money chasing bad.
Added to that, under the terms of the post-strike settlement, the leaders of
the airline's two main unions, which organised Monday's strikes, will now
join Iberia's four-man management committee.
The increased union power is an unsettling development for Iberia's dismal
balance sheet, which is to a large extent the consequence of over-manning
and low productivity.
Although salaries have been technically frozen over the past two years, the
wages bill grew by nearly 7 per cent last year and could increase by 4 per
cent this year. The company has 156 employees per aircraft; in comparison
with competitor Air Europa's 46. Air Europa is one of two private sector
domestic carriers which now compete with the state airline on domestic
routes and have prompted a sharp reduction in fares.
Iberia's cost problems have been highlighted by ambitious expansion in Latin
America that started in 1989, a year when the company last reported profits.
That year profits tumbled to Pta6.2bn from a record Pta24.2bn.
Within three years, which coincided with the devasting impact of the Gulf
War on the airline business, Iberia bought into Aerolineas Argentinas,
Austral, the domestic Argentine carrier, Venezuela's Viasa, and Chile's
Ladeco. The Spanish company's debt shot up from Pta147.6bn in 1989 to
Pta371.5bn in 1991, a year when it posted losses of Pta35.8bn and when it
began to request the Pta120bn injection of state aid that was finally
authorised by Brussels in 1992.
Last March, as part of a complex rescue plan for Aerolineas agreed with the
Argentine government, Iberia raised its stake in the airline from 30 per
cent to 83.4 per cent in a Dollars 400m debt-for-equity swap. Iberia also
chipped in a further Dollars 100m that had been put aside for emergencies
when it first bought into Aerolineas.
It was ironic that just as the Spanish company was pouring money into the
Argentine airline earlier this year, lack of traffic was forcing it to close
a hub in Miami which it had begun operating in 1991. The hub was part of
Iberia's grand strategy to become the European link with Central and South
America.
The closure of Miami has been planned by Mr Juan Saez who became managing
director of Iberia in a boardroom shake-up that brought in as chairman Mr
Javier Salas, who is president of INI, the public-sector holding that owns
the airline.
The outgoing chairman, Mr Miguel Aguilo, was blamed for last year's losses
of Pta69.7bn, which were double those of 1992. Mr Aguilo, who became
chairman in 1990, had inherited the Aerolineas Argentinas project from his
predecessor, Mr Narcis Andreu, who left in 1990 at the beginning of a
dizzying series of top management changes at Iberia.
Mr Saez, together with Mr Salas, will now be responsible for drawing up the
viability plan that will be taken to Brussels by Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray,
the industry minister, perhaps as early as next week.
Yesterday, Mr Eguiagaray said he was 'absolutely convinced' that the
Commission would approve an aid package. He is probably reassured by the
precedent set by Air France and by the presence in Brussels, at least for
the next two months, of Mr Oreja.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Telecom Italia seeks to pay government less
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications company, wants
to reduce the fee it pays to the government, to offset the consequences of
increased competition in the lucrative area of mobile phone services.
Late on Tuesday, the government gave the formal go-ahead to a consortium
headed by Olivetti, the Italian computer company, to build the country's
second pan-European digital mobile phone network.
The Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium won the licence on the eve of the March
general election, but it has taken until now for the new administration to
agree the detail of the deal.
Telecom Italia is demanding that the government liberalise tariffs on the
existing analogue network, which already has 2m subscribers. The company has
a monopoly over this network, but claims that if prices are regulated it
will be at a disadvantage when competing with Omnitel's more sophisticated
GSM network.
Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, telecoms minister, has agreed that the relevant
ministries will discuss the problem, probably next week. But if Telecom
Italia persists, it is likely to aggravate its already tense relationship
with Omnitel.
Telecom Italia also wants to pay a smaller fee for having a monopoly over
other phone services. It would like the fee to come down from 3.5 per cent
of turnover to 0.5 per cent, over two to three years, and says the previous
government had agreed to reduce the fee.
The issue is particularly sensitive because the consortium defeated in the
bid for the new GSM licence included Fininvest, the media company owned by
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, now prime minister. Mr Berlusconi deliberately took no
part in Tuesday's cabinet discussion of the licence.
Tempers frayed at the weekend when Mr Francesco Caio, chief executive at
Omnitel, warned that the whole deal would be at risk if Telecom Italia, or
its state parent companies, Stet and Iri, attempted to delay government
approval.
Olivetti and its partners, which include Bell Atlantic of the US, will have
to invest heavily over the next few years to build a new GSM network. In the
past two years, Telecom Italia has built a minimal GSM network, but has been
prevented from marketing the service actively pending the arrival of a
second operator.

European Union member states must match their political commitment to the
single market with concrete action, by rapidly adopting outstanding
legislation and correctly applying those measures already agreed, Mr Raniero
Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, said
yesterday. Presenting a report that will go to the heads of state meeting in
Essen next week, Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said: 'We're telling the European
council that the news on the single market is good, but must be improved.
The effects of the legislation adopted are beginning to feed through to the
market place but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.' One of the
worries currently taxing the Commission is that harmonisation legislation,
designed to complete the internal market, is being badly transcribed on to
national statute books. Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said the council of ministers
had so far this year failed to make significant progress in the elimination
of border controls on people. Also in certain areas, adopted measures were
not being implemented in national legislation in accordance with the agreed
timetables and their application in practice leaves something to be desired.

Greece's Socialist government yesterday proposed a budget for 1995 that
relies on a fresh crackdown against tax evasion to boost revenues. The
budget provides for an 18.5 per cent increase in revenues to Dr7,400bn
(Pounds 18.4bn) but does not impose any new taxes. The bulk of the revenue
increase is projected to come from broadening Greece's tax base and curbing
tax evasion among the 800,000 self-employed workers. With an early election
possible next spring, the Socialists have decided against making spending
cuts. The budget projects an overall rise in expenditure of 9.7 per cent to
Dr9,925bn, including increased outlays on defence, health and education.
However, wage restraints will continue, with rises for public sector workers
being held below the inflation rate, projected to fall to 7.9 per cent by
the end of 1995. The general government deficit is projected to drop to 9.8
per cent of gross domestic product from 12 per cent of GDP this year.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has said he will not run for the
presidency next spring. The ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement must now
find an alternative candidate. Parliament is due to vote for a new head of
state by May when President Constantine Karamanlis, 87, is due to step down.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government and union leaders were close to agreement late last
night in talks designed to head off an eight-hour general strike tomorrow.
Both sides appeared anxious to avoid the inevitable increase in social
tension that would ensue from the general strike, which was called to
protest against pension cuts in the 1995 budget. Mr Clemente Mastella, the
labour minister and chief proponent of a deal with the unions, threatened to
resign if the talks - which had begun at 10am - failed.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was mandated on Tuesday to
negotiate with the unions on the basis of a broad-ranging document. This
sought to address union concerns not only about cutting pension benefits but
also on a wide range of issues including new incentives for job creation in
the south and more help for research and development projects. In the run-up
to yesterday's meeting the government had given conflicting signals over its
willingness to compromise. But the bottom line, according to the treasury,
would have to be the maintenance of the principal 1995 budget objectives in
holding down the deficit to L138,000bn (Pounds 54.6bn), equivalent to 8 per
cent of GDP.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist politician and tycoon, yesterday won a
reprieve in his struggle to secure his financial and political future when a
Paris commercial court ruled that his remaining business interests should be
placed in receivership rather than wound up. The ruling, which freezes Mr
Tapie's assets for six months and allows a court-appointed administrator to
try to rescue his businesses, removes the prospect of imminent bankruptcy
for the left-wing Euro-MP and French deputy. Under French law, bankrupts
cannot stand for election to public office for five years, dashing his
political career.
Mr Tapie has set his sights on becoming mayor of Marseilles in elections
next year. He has also indicated that he might run for next spring's
presidential elections following the strong showing of his Radical Energy
list in last June's European elections. Mr Tapie welcomed the court's
decision. 'I am very satisfied because my companies and their employees will
survive,' he said. He accused his creditors of seeking to end his political
career.
Yesterday's ruling was the most important of a series of legal disputes
which have dogged the flamboyant French deputy. He faces a spate of suits
from creditors, in particular Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned
bank which funded his rapid business expansion in the 1980s and which is now
attempting to recoup loans estimated at FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m).

FT  01 DEC 94 / Germany agrees to toe line on Bosnia: Chancellor puts unity
before his 'moral' position against blanket arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured France yesterday that he would continue to
restrain his 'moral' sympathy for the Bosnian Moslems in the interest of
maintaining a show of European unity for the arms embargo and support for
new peace efforts.
At a news conference concluding the Franco-German summit, Mr Kohl said it
was vital to intensify the search for a political solution led by the
international contact group, which includes Germany and France. Both
countries reiterated their appeal to the United Nations and Nato to ensure
respect of security zones around Bihac and elsewhere.
But Mr Kohl, who earlier this week voted with his Christian Democrat (CDU)
party to approve a resolution urging a conditional lifting of the embargo,
warned that time was running out for international diplomacy. 'It is one
minute to twelve,' he said, adding that 'what has happened in Bihac is
really the last warning'.
He appeared to indicate that, if diplomacy did not produce results soon, he
would revert to what he described as his 'moral' position against the
blanket arms embargo in a war 'in which one side (the Bosnian Moslems) is
not armed and the other (the Serbs) is'. At last year's European Union
summit in Copenhagen he said he had undertaken to follow loyally the EU's
support for the arms ban. But President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman said
France understood 'where the chancellor's heart really is on this matter'.
Mr Kohl and Mr Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, explained to worried
French leaders that the CDU resolution did not change the German
government's position in favour of the embargo. The French side will also
have been grateful for Mr Kohl's advice to his own countrymen not to lecture
France about a conflict in which the lives of French military peacekeepers,
but not German, were at stake. 'Despite all the moral indignation, we must
be sparing in our reproaches,' he said.
During the overnight meeting the two sides also agreed to finalise details
about their proposed co-operation on spy satellites. France is already
involved in the Helios II project, a joint venture with Italy to launch an
optical satellite, but is eager to have Germany on board. The two countries
said that by March they would decide whether to go ahead with the Osiris
radar satellite. The Germans want a closer look at the amount of money
involved in both projects before making a decision.
Leaders of the two countries also decided for the moment to minimise their
differences on the future course of the EU. Mr Edouard Balladur, French
prime minister, said he had come out against a 'federal' Europe because he
did not want the EU debate in France to become mired in a sterile quarrel
about federalism.
Mr Kohl agreed that such ideological debates should be avoided. He had been
brought up like many in the Adenauer era to believe in the 'united states of
Europe', but had come to see that Europeans did not want to merge their
states into another America.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Kohl invites eastern states to EU summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday came off the fence and invited
six leaders from central and eastern Europe to attend the closing session of
next week's European summit in Essen.
The invitation - coupled with likely agreement on a more generous market
access package for the east Europeans - raised hopes that the Essen summit
would reinforce the German-led strategy to build a wider Europe.
Mr Kohl's decision to invite leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania to Essen followed a 'strategic bargain'
between France and Germany aimed at balancing the priorities of eastern
Europe and the Mediterranean, specifically North Africa, with regard to
trade concessions and financial benefits from the Union.
Under an understanding reached at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Brussels earlier this week, EU funds allocated to the Mediterranean over the
next five years will rise but not quite keep pace with spending on eastern
Europe. The Commission has bid for Ecu5.5bn and Ecu7bn respectively between
1995 and 1999, though ministers have yet to agree final totals.
Germany, which hands over the rotating presidency of the EU to France on
January 1, has also won agreement for a progressive weakening of
anti-dumping provisions against the six associate EU members. The EU
concession is tied to east European price undertakings and steps to modify
laws, standards, and competition policy to the single European market.
Separately, the European Commission agreed yesterday to submit proposals to
ministers for phased modification of rules of origin (which affects
eligibility for trade concessions) in order to stimulate trade and
investment in eastern Europe - a move hitherto opposed by countries such as
Portugal which fears its textile industry might be undermined by cheap east
European labour. Details of the proposals are expected shortly, said a
Commission official.
Mr Kohl, who had delayed issuing an invitation until he was sure of an
internal EU consensus on Essen, said in Bonn yesterday that the central
Europeans would be informed of the results of the Essen meeting. The message
was that the EU was not a 'closed shop', he said.
Some central Europeans had hoped to attend the summit in full so as to
enhance the impression of being consulted about the outcome, but other EU
member states are nervous about moves to concede membership through the back
door.
Mr Kohl said: 'We want to show that these countries will be welcome if they
want to join (the EU) and if their domestic and economic situations permit
that.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / German hopes for Europol dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cherished German plans to build up Europol, the embryonic pan-European
police agency to fight organised crime in the EU's border-free single
market, ran into determined opposition from France, the UK and Spain
yesterday.
The German presidency of the EU had hoped to get long-delayed agreement on
the Europol convention finalised yesterday at a meeting of the Union's
justice and interior ministers in Brussels, ready to unveil at the Essen
summit of EU leaders on December 9-10.
The dispute over Europol's role and scope, in which Germany and France, the
driving axis of the EU, are on opposite sides, is unlikely to be resolved
until next year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl conceded in Bonn yesterday at a
pre-Essen Franco-German summit with President Francois Mitterrand. France
takes over the EU presidency in January.
France insists that national police officers attached to Europol must have
access not only to standardised data pooled in Europol, but also more
sensitive intelligence. The latest German proposal, backed by all its other
partners, would restrict access to sensitive data except where Europol and
national liaison officers attached to it, were directly involved. The German
position reflects concerns that national police forces do not lose control
of the security of their most delicate operations.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the hard-line Gaullist French interior minister, is
determined to keep the Europol project firmly under national government
control, and in this general aim he has strong support from Britain and
Spain. Mr Pasqua did not attend yesterday's meeting, in what some French
officials hinted was a message that police force co-ordination is a matter
for intergovernmental co-operation rather than joint EU action.
France and the UK also rule out German ambitions for Europol to develop an
eventual operational cross-border role. In a vain attempt to salvage some
sort of agreement last night, the German presidency argued for the
short-term expansion of Europol's only functioning body, the anti-drugs unit
in the Hague, to cover issues like cross-border car theft networks,
plutonium trafficking, and illegal immigrant smuggling. Germany's partners,
however, rejected any move until a common philosophy and legal framework for
Europol is agreed.
Spain wants Europol to have counter-terrorism within its remit from the
start. Madrid's preoccupation with terrorism also blocked any advance
yesterday on controversial new EU measures defining the right of asylum,
which Spain wants limited to nationals from non-EU countries, following an
acrimonious dispute with Belgium over the granting of temporary refuge to
alleged Basque terrorists.
Including politically sensitive terrorist operations in Europol's
cross-border duties would, however, provide additional arguments against
France's demand for fuller national police access to the agency's files and
data base.
Underlying these rows are sharp differences over the Maastricht treaty's
'Third Pillar' on co-operation in internal security affairs, which allots a
still undefined role to EU institutions. The UK and France are against the
majority view that the European Court of Justice should have an appeal and
adjudication role, that the Court of Auditors should be responsible for
Europol's accounts, and that the European parliament should oversee the
agency.

France saw its biggest monthly fall in unemployment in six years in October,
with the number declining by 17,700 to 3.33m. This follows sharp rises in
August and September, which took the unemployment rate to a record 12.7 per
cent. In October, the rate declined to 12.6 per cent. Government officials
said the rise in unemployment was now being reversed with faster than
expected economic recovery and the number of jobless could be cut by at
least 150,000 next year. Private sector economists, many of whom had
forecast a slight increase in unemployment in October, warned of the
volatility of unemployment statistics and said an expected slowdown in
economic growth since the autumn could limit improvement in the labour
market.
Spain's trade deficit in October was Pta224.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn), down from
Pta315.3bn in September and Pta244.4bn in October 1993.
Turkey's GNP shrank by 8.6 per cent in the third quarter against the same
1993 period. GNP contracted by 10.6 per cent in the second quarter after
rising 3.5 per cent in the first.
Finland's GDP rose 4.4 per cent year-on-year in September after a 4.0 per
cent rise in August.

The Patronat, France's employers' federation, yesterday called on French

In its report on corruption and business ethics, the Patronat proposed
several further reforms, including increased transparency in the award of
public contracts. It also advocated a strengthening of defences for
companies, including greater judicial secrecy and a separation of the
responsibility of directors and their companies. The chairman of a group
should not be held legally responsible for malpractice in a subsidiary
unless he was directly involved, the Patronat argues.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Russian forces mass for push against breakaway regime
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia was on the threshold of military action last night against the
breakaway republic of Chechnya as the deadline loomed for President Boris
Yeltsin's ultimatum that the rebel leadership lay down its arms.
The crisis, building since Chechnya's declaration of independence late in
1991, has been intensified by Mr Yeltsin's deadline of 6am today for
compliance by the Chechens.
Detachments of interior ministry troops were massed at the base of Mozdok,
across the border from Chechnya in the neighbouring republic of North
Ingushetia. Women, children, and the elderly were told yesterday to leave
the Chechen capital Grozny, 1,500km south-east of Moscow.
A report in the Moscow daily Sevodnya said that a further detachment of
officers based in Khabarovsk, in the Russian far east, had been awaiting
orders for several days to fly to Grozny to police a state of emergency.
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president who declared the north
Caucasian republic independent, has said that any attack by Russia will be
met with armed resistance. Chechnya has a population of 1.2m.
Grozny airport was bombed for the second day in succession yesterday, with
reports suggesting that at least 10 aircraft had been set ablaze on the
runway. Russian bases surrounding the republic denied ordering a bombing
mission.
Fighting has ceased between the Chechen forces loyal to Gen Dudayev and the
Russian-backed opposition provisional council - which brought opposition
troops to the gates of the presidential palace at the weekend. The council
declared a ceasefire following Mr Yeltsin's ultimatum on Tuesday.
The Chechens are seen, especially in Moscow, as violent and
disproportionately involved in organised crime. They carried on resistance
to Russian imperial rule in the 19th century more bitterly than any other
Caucasian people and were repressed by Stalin during the war for alleged
collaboration with the Germans.
Because of that reputation, strong fears have been voiced of a campaign of
retaliation in Russia if the intervention goes ahead. The guard on Mr
Yeltsin has been strengthened, as has security at nuclear power stations.
While preparing for war, Russia is also making overtures for a peaceful
settlement. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was reported last
night as telling a group of journalists that 'we are ready for talks with
anyone - but I hope the people of Chechnya understand that they cannot play
games and that this cannot go on'.
Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian parliament's defence committee,
is to fly to Grozny today to attempt to negotiate the freedom of as many as
70 Russians captured in the weekend fighting. An aide to Mr Yushenkov said
last night that Gen Dudayev had agreed his safe passage and to hold talks on
the prisoners' fate, although an earlier statement from the Chechen press
service denied that they would be freed.

FT  01 DEC 94 / British Gas chairman defends pay rise for chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 75 per cent salary increase awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, the chief
executive of British Gas, still leaves him underpaid compared with many
executives holding similar jobs in British industry, according to Mr Richard
Giordano, the company's chairman.
In a letter in today's Financial Times, Mr Giordano justifies Mr Brown's
Pounds 205,000 increase to Pounds 475,000 as necessary to bring British Gas
pay scales into line with the 'median of a large sample of UK plcs'. Before
the increase, Mr Brown was the most underpaid senior executive in the
company, earning less than the finance director, he says.
The letter marks the first top-level support from fellow directors for Mr
Brown who found himself at the centre of a row after news of his salary
increase was leaked last week. Mr Giordano says: 'The board has decided that
he is the right man to lead British Gas and we fully support him.' It is
understood that Mr Brown intends to keep all the increase. Last week he was
reported to be considering handing part of it back.
Mr Giordano also rejects suggestions that Mr Brown runs 'a cosy monopoly
earning easy profits and high returns'. The company faces increased
competition in deregulated markets, and manages a worldwide business. It is
also engaged in a large-scale restructuring. 'Any knowledgeable observer
must surely realise that Cedric Brown's task in leading British Gas is
hardly easy sailing,' he says.
Mr Giordano makes clear that the salary increase was part of a wider
reshaping of remuneration for senior executives in which rolling contracts
were shortened from three years to two, and share options replaced by a
long-term incentive scheme which rewards executives according to British
Gas's share price performance against that of other blue chip UK companies.
The higher cash payments were agreed in part to allay executives' concerns
that they would lose out financially from changes. Under the old incentive
scheme Mr Brown would have received a 37 per cent bonus this year. Mr
Giordano says that shareholders have nothing to gain by underpaying Mr
Brown.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Clarke drive to avert fuel tax revolt: Labour leader calls
on Tory rebels to join Commons vote to block VAT increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night launched a post-Budget
campaign to head off a Tory rebellion on the planned increase in value added
tax on domestic fuel.
Amid signs at Westminster that this week's Budget had calmed the recent
panic on the Conservative back benches, Mr Clarke was preparing a series of
one-to-one discussions to persuade rebel MPs to drop their opposition.
Mr Clarke told colleagues he was confident, though not certain, that the
government would defeat a Labour attempt next week to reopen the issue of
whether the VAT rate on domestic fuel should rise from 8 per cent to 17.5
per cent.
The febrile atmosphere at Westminster was eased also by confirmation that Mr
John Major's opponents on the right of the party had failed to muster enough
support to force a challenge this year to his premiership.
The annual deadline for nominations for the party leadership passed without
a rival contender being named. The main figures who had been seeking to
mount a challenge conceded they had failed to muster the required signatures
of 34 MPs.
But the emergence of a cabinet split on whether Mr Major should offer a
referendum on the next stage of European integration provided a reminder of
the tensions beneath the surface over Britain's relations with Brussels.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Major have both recently softened
opposition to the idea of an eventual referendum.
But it is thought Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary,
are implacably opposed to the idea of offering a commitment now. The
cabinet's two leading pro-Europeans are thought to judge that a referendum
pledge would not solve the central problem of finding policies to win the
support of a broad majority in the Tory party.
Mr Clarke's initiative on VAT came after Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader,
published details of a Commons motion for next Tuesday which would allow MPs
to vote during the passage of the Finance Bill on whether to freeze VAT on
fuel. The Labour leader appealed for support from more than half a dozen
Tory MPs who have indicated they were considering rebelling against the
government on the issue.
But the chancellor plans to warn would-be rebels that Labour is seeking a
platform to wreck the Finance Bill. Defeat for the government in next week's
vote would provide a dangerous precedent for future Budgets, giving the
opposition much greater leverage over the government's fiscal policy.
At a briefing for economic journalists, Mr Clarke said the government had
announced cumulative compensation for value added tax on domestic fuel and
power of Pounds 1.3bn. The payments - through increased pensions, benefits,
the home heating efficiency scheme and cold weather payments - compared with
expected revenues of about Pounds 3bn in this financial year and 1995-96.
Mr Clarke said he found the position of those opposing the VAT levy 'faintly
incredible'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, urged Tories worried about the move
to 'wrestle with their consciences' and help defeat the government on the
issue.

FT  01 DEC 94 / EC fines cement groups after claims of rigging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday imposed record fines on 33 European cement
producers, accusing them of using secret agreements to rig the market for
more than 10 years.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said the producers, eight
national associations and the European Cement Association which masterminded
the illegal operations, had three months to pay penalties totalling Ecu248m
(Pounds 193m).
The biggest producers in Italy, France, Britain and Germany said last night
that they would appeal against the decision to the European Court in
Luxembourg. Most of the other companies are expected to follow suit.
Companies will have to pay the fines, or provide equivalent bank guarantees,
pending the outcome of the appeal.
The stinging fines reflect the Commission's determination to clamp down on
producers which infringe EU competition law. They were the third such
penalties to be imposed on cartels so far this year.
'I hope now everyone has got the message,' said Mr Van Miert. 'There are
still cartels out there that will do everything they can to stop us finding
the evidence . . . but we will continue, and we will upgrade our means for
tackling cartels.'
The biggest fine, of Ecu32.5m, was imposed on Italcementi of Italy, Europe's
biggest cement producer. The Swiss company Holderbank was fined Ecu5.3m. La
Societe des Ciments Francais, controlled by Italcementi, was fined Ecu24.7m.
Italcementi said the Commission's charges were unfounded and that it would
appeal, adding that the system of cement pricing in Italy meant it would
have been impossible for the company to be part of a pan-European cartel.
Lafarge Coppee, the largest French producer, which was fined Ecu22.8m, and
Blue Circle, the largest British producer, fined Ecu15.8m, also intend to
appeal, as does Heidelberger, the largest German producer.
Blue Circle said it could take 18 months to two years before the appeal
would be heard with judgment likely to take a further six months. Cement
producers from all 12 member states of the EU were affected.
Earlier this year Mr Van Miert levied fines totalling Ecu100m on steel beam
makers and Ecu132m on cartonboard producers.
The principle accusation against the cement companies and associations is
that from 1983 they colluded to reduce price differences between EU member
states plus Norway, Sweden and Switzerland so as to remove any temptation to
export and to get those producers which did export to align their prices
with those of local producers.
They thus blatantly breached the principles of the single market by
maintaining artificial frontiers on the basis of domestic markets in an
industry with an annual turnover of Ecu7bn.
The producers could not hope to deny their illegal activities, said the
Commission. It alleged that at a meeting of the European group, the chairman
stated that 'needless to say there will be no minutes of this meeting'.
The Commission said that it had taken into account the fact that EU
companies had been faced with a surge in cement imports, just as they were
struggling to emerge from recession.

FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Merck decides to reverse course
 -Richard Waters looks at how the US drugs group is running Medco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just months after beginning to merge parts of its operations with those of
Medco Containment Services, the pharmacy benefit management group for which
it paid Dollars 6.6bn last year, Merck has reversed course.
The change in approach is the clearest sign yet that, in spite of the image
of stability it projects on the surface, the biggest US drugs maker is going
through something of an upheaval. It signals what Mr Raymond Gilmartin,
Merck's new chairman and chief executive, calls his 'number one priority':
to make the Medco acquisition pay.
In the spring of this year, Merck said it would integrate parts of Medco
with its own businesses. This echoed the logic advanced by the company for
mounting the acquisition in the first instance. Managed care buyers were set
to become an ever-more significant force in the US drugs market, forcing
Merck to combine with a sales channel as powerful as Medco to retain and, if
possible, boost its market share.
That strategy was the brainchild of two men: Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck's
charismatic chairman, who retired at the beginning of November, and Mr
Martin Wygod, the entrepreneur who created Medco and, until his abrupt
departure earlier this year, a man seen as a possible successor to Mr
Vagelos. Mr Gilmartin - who until this summer was chairman of a medical
supplies company, Beckton Dickinson - has now inherited the job of making
the vision work.
The first step has been to run Merck and Medco operations entirely
separately. 'One of the risks in vertical integration is that you can lose
sight of where you make money in the (production and distribution) chain,'
he said. 'We unbundled a little bit as well,' he adds, referring to the
initial steps at merging operations which have now been reversed.
The change in approach became clear earlier this week, as Mr Gilmartin made
his first presentation to analysts since taking over as chairman at the
start of November.
Perhaps not coincidentally, this is an approach that is likely to appeal to
US regulators, who have begun a review of both Merck and SmithKline Beecham,
the Anglo-US drugs group which has also acquired a pharmacy benefit manager.
In its first action in this area, the Federal Trade Commission recently
required Eli Lilly, the third company to buy a PBM, to establish some
operating barriers between its drug-making and PBM businesses. Mr Gilmartin
says, though, that the new direction at Merck precedes the FTC's interest,
and that anyway the company already satisfies the sort of concerns expressed
by the regulators during their review of Lilly.
The decision to run Medco separately will help to highlight in future how
successful the acquisition proves. So far, little evidence has emerged.
Merck said this week that the number of people in Medco pharmacy plans has
risen to 40m, from 33m when the deal was announced. Also, it said Merck's
drugs now make up 12 per cent of Medco's sales, up from 10 per cent before
the acquisition.
To make the Medco deal pay, Mr Gilmartin hopes to demonstrate that he can
boost the earnings of both Merck and the PBM. This represents a subtle
change of emphasis from the logic expressed by Mr Vagelos at the time of the
deal. The former chairman outlined a plan to grow market share at a time
when price pressures were depressing growth for drugmakers generally. Mr
Gilmartin, though, says that Merck will defend its profit margins and
reassert itself as a growth company.
Much will depend on how well Merck and Medco can work together. In Mr
Gilmartin's version of the future, Medco will help Merck to penetrate
markets far more effectively than it has in the past. As an example, he
takes Vacotec, a treatment for hypertension: in the past three years, this
drug has achieved a penetration of only around 25 per cent of its potential
market, he said. Broader-ranging clinical studies which establish the
efficacy of drugs will lift these levels.

The Quantum Group, managed by international financier Mr George Soros, is to
set up a new India fund, underlining recent growth in investor interest in
the country.
Mr Purnendu Chatterjee, who already advises Quantum, is assembling a team to
manage the fund, which is expected to be capitalised at Dollars 1bn.
'With the move by India away from government regulation and towards
integration into the world economy, a favourable investment climate has
emerged,' said Mr Soros in a letter to shareholders of Quantum Industrial
Holdings, an existing Quantum fund.
Quantum India will reserve 20 per cent of its assets for so-called 'macros
trading', in currencies, bonds, stock indices and commodities.
The Quantum Group, based in the Netherlands Antilles, consists of a number
of open-end and closed-end investment funds. New York-based Soros Fund
Management has been appointed investment adviser.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Tapie gains a breathing space: Court orders attempt to
rescue populist politician's companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist politician and tycoon, yesterday won a
reprieve in his struggle to secure his financial and political future. A
Paris commercial court ruled that his remaining business interests should be
placed in receivership rather than be wound up.
The ruling, which freezes Mr Tapie's assets for six months and allows a
court-appointed administrator to try to rescue his businesses, removes the
prospect of imminent bankruptcy for the left-wing French deputy and European
MP.
Under French law, bankruptcy would have rendered him ineligible for elected
public office for five years, dashing his political career.
Mr Tapie has set his sights on becoming mayor of Marseilles in elections due
in the middle of next year. He has also indicated that he might run in the
presidential elections next spring following the strong showing of his
Radical Energy list in last June's European elections.
The pro-European list, which called for radical measures to reduce
unemployment, won 12 per cent of the vote.
Mr Tapie welcomed the court's decision. 'I am very satisfied because my
companies and their employees will survive,' he said. He accused his
creditors of seeking to end his political career.
Yesterday's ruling was the most important of a series of legal disputes
which have dogged the flamboyant French deputy. He faces a spate of suits
from creditors, in particular Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned
bank which funded his rapid business expansion in the 1980s and which is now
attempting to recoup loans estimated at FFr1.2bn (Dollars 225m).
The ruling was greeted with some surprise in France, where Mr Tapie divides
observers between admiration for his charisma and anti-establishment
credentials and resentment concerning his rise to prominence, partly through
the financing of his businesses by state institutions.
It comes as a blow to Credit Lyonnais which believes that some of the
businesses should be placed into liquidation.
Mr Tapie's legal battles are far from over, however. The Paris Tribunal de
Commerce called for a hearing on December 14 to determine whether to uphold
his claim that Credit Lyonnais is partly responsible for the management of
his companies.
Yesterday, a separate court rejected Mr Tapie's appeal against a fine of
FFr1m for giving false information about the state of one of his companies.
The future of Mr Tapie's indebted and loss-making businesses is also
insecure. Should the court administrators fail to rescue or find buyers for
the various businesses they will be liquidated.
Financiere Immobiliere Bernard Tapie, which owns his 17th century mansion
and his FFr74m luxury yacht are seen as vulnerable. The other businesses
placed in receivership include Groupe Bernard Tapie, which controls three
weighing-machine businesses and a chain of health food stores.
Mr Bernard Tapie (right): ruling removes the imminent prospect of
bankruptcy, which would have dashed his political ambitions

The European Commission yesterday proposed that member states introduce laws
giving businesses the right to charge interest on late payment of trade
debts. Representatives of small businesses believe the proposal will do much
to banish the practice of late payments which strain the finances of
Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. Other recommendations for
tackling the problem of late payments include a commitment to guarantee
enterprises simple and cheap access to the courts and shortening the time in
which government contracts are paid to a maximum of 60 days. The
recommendations have yet to be presented to member states. Mr Raniero Vanni
D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for enterprise policy, said a wide
consultation by the Commission had shown that late payments were at the root
of serious problems for small enterprises struggling to balance their books,
and that differences in national legislation constituted an obstacle to the
smooth functioning of the single market.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Verdict on the single market: could try harder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Member states of the European Union must match their political commitment to
the single market with concrete action, by rapidly adopting outstanding
legislation and correctly applying those measures already agreed.
That was the message from Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner
responsible for the single market, presenting a report that will go to a
heads of state meeting in Essen next week.
'We're telling the European Council that the news on the single market is
good, but must be improved,' said Mr Vanni D'Archirafi yesterday. 'The
effects of the legislation adopted are beginning to feed through to the
market place but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.'
The Commission has recently stepped up pressure on member states to adopt
all the legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services, and
capital within the Union's frontiers.
The focus is now switching to a concern that some harmonisation legislation
is being badly transcribed on to national statute books, thereby distorting
the single market. At a Council meeting in Brussels next week, this issue
will be tackled. The Commission also plans once again to publish detailed
lists of which member states are the worst offenders.
Yesterday's report emphasised that the completion of the single market was
crucial to the political credibility of the Union. 'The single market
remains at the heart of our efforts to safeguard the competitiveness of our
industry, to create jobs and to stimulate economic growth,' it said.
Mr Vanni D'Archirafi had specific criticisms of the council of ministers.
So far this year it had failed to make significant progress in adopting the
few, but important, legislative measures that were still before it. In
particular, no progress had been made on the elimination of border controls
on people.
Furthermore, in certain areas adopted measures were not being implemented in
national legislation in accordance with the agreed timetables and their
application in practice was inadequate.
The Commission said it was 'vigorously pursuing legal proceedings' against
member states that have fallen behind on implementing single market
legislation.
It added: 'There is now clear evidence that many benefits are already being
widely felt from the 1992 legislative programme' (which set up the single
market). It cited the elimination of border controls for goods, the opening
up of public procurement markets, the removal of fiscal barriers and mutual
recognition of diplomas as areas where progress had been marked.
Key issues to be tackled over the next few years included giving full
freedom of movement of people and ensuring speedy and effective redress for
consumers. The Commission also intended to press ahead with adoption of a
definitive VAT regime. Progress also needed to be made on liberalising
energy and telecommunications.
Also on the agenda is the need to create a coherent regulatory framework for
the provision of new cross-border information services. Next week ministers
will discuss Commission proposals to harmonise data protection regimes
across the Union, a move which is being resisted by the UK.

<TEXT>
The Quantum Group, managed by international financier Mr George Soros, is to
set up a new India fund, underlining recent growth in investor interest in
the country.
Mr Purnendu Chatterjee, who already advises Quantum, is assembling a team to
manage the fund, which is expected to be capitalised at Dollars 1bn.
'With the move by India away from government regulation and towards
integration into the world economy, a favourable investment climate has
emerged,' said Mr Soros in a letter to shareholders of an existing Quantum
fund.
Quantum India will reserve 20 per cent of its assets for so-called 'macros
trading', in currencies, bonds, stock indices and commodities.
The Quantum Group, based in the Netherlands Antilles, consists of open- and
closed-end investment funds.

<TEXT>
American Brands said it had reached an agreement to sell Franklin Life, its
life insurance business, for Dollars 1.17bn, and that the proceeds would be
used mainly to buy back shares and pay down debt.
In connection with the sale, made to financial services group American
General, the company said it would buy back up to 10m of its shares.
Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, also said yesterday that the
company intended to look for further 'strategic acquisitions, focusing on
our long-term growth businesses - hardware and home improvement products,
office products and golf and leisure products - and on distilled spirits'.
The sale of Franklin Life would result in a book loss of Dollars 220m,
American Brands said. This results in part from a provision for net income
to cover the period before the sale is completed, when the company will be
accounted for as a discontinued business.
American Brands paid Dollars 645m for Franklin in 1979. Since then, it said
it had received some Dollars 650m in cash dividends from the company.
The sale comes in the wake of American Brand's plan to sell its US tobacco
businesses to BAT Industries, which is being challenged by US regulators,
and the sale of Dolland &amp; Aitchison, an optical company, for Dollars 146m.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Bank of Canada resists pull of higher US interest rates: The
Canadian dollar has fallen steadily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Canada is fighting a quiet but intense battle to prove that
Ottawa is not a hostage to US economic policy.
Since the US Federal Reserve raised its Fed funds rate from 4.75 per cent to
5.5 per cent in mid-November, Canada's central bank has resisted a similar
tightening of monetary policy.
It has raised the key band for its overnight call rate by only one-quarter
of a percentage point to 5-5.5 per cent. This relatively modest rise has
helped Canadian banks maintain their prime lending rate for the time being
at 7 per cent, where it has been for the past 10 weeks.
The gap between US and Canadian interest rates, which is closely watched by
financial markets, has narrowed markedly. Yields on three-month Treasury
bills are currently only 0.12 percentage points higher in Canada, the
smallest spread in a decade, and down from more than 2 percentage points
last June.
The burden so far has fallen on the Canadian dollar, which has steadily
slipped from almost 74 US cents at the beginning of November to around 72.55
cents yesterday.
Although selling pressures have been relatively light, the Bank of Canada
has intervened in the past two weeks to slow the decline in the currency.
The central bank hopes to convince markets that economic trends in Canada
justify an accommodative monetary policy. 'The fundamentals in Canada are
significantly better than the US,' says Mr David Adamo, who heads the
fixed-income research department at ScotiaMcLeod, a Toronto securities firm.
Growth is strong north of the border. Statistics Canada said yesterday that
gross domestic product expanded at an annualised 6.7 per cent in the second
quarter and 4.7 per cent in the third. But inflation is non-existent.
Canada's consumer price index fell by 0.2 per cent in the year to October.
The central bank's policy is almost certainly supported by Mr Paul Martin,
finance minister. By raising debt-service payments, higher short-term
interest rates would complicate Mr Martin's efforts to bring down the budget
deficit to his target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product by early 1997.
Economists are divided on whether the bank will succeed in holding down
rates, and whether the dollar will continue to slide.
Mr Andrew Spence, economist at Citibank Canada, predicted that a rally in
commodity prices could help push the Canadian currency higher next year. But
Mr Daniel Kelly, vice-president for financial markets research at CIBC Wood
Gundy, said that nervousness could increase ahead of next February's budget.
Speculation has grown in recent days that commercial banks will soon lift
prime lending rates.
Foreign investors have signalled their concern by substantially lightening
their Canadian portfolios in recent months. Foreigners sold CDollars 9bn
(USDollars 6.5bn) of Canadian bonds in the first nine months of this year,
compared with a CDollars 7bn inflow in the same period of 1993.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Donors pledge budget aid for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International aid donors yesterday pledged to plug the budget deficit of the
embryonic Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho until the spring,
winning breathing space for Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and bringing
new life to the year-old Israel-Palestinian peace process.
Following a two-day meeting of donors in Brussels, Dollars 125m (Pounds
79.6m) will be made available between now and the end of March to finance
the authority's running costs and create almost immediately 20,000 jobs in
public works programmes.
Mr Terje Larsen, UN under-secretary general for the Palestinian territories,
said: 'I leave this meeting with relief and hope, because that (financing)
gap was bridged.'
Mr Nabil Shaath, representing the authority, said the short-term financing
deal 'signals a continuing of the peace process' and 'opens the road to our
elections'.
The postponed Palestinian elections and delayed Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank form the centrepiece of negotiations between the two sides which
restart in Cairo next Monday.
Senior officials from both camps were optimistic yesterday that the Brussels
talks signalled an emerging rapprochement. Mr Uriel Savir, director-general
of the Israeli foreign ministry, said he believed the meeting had moved
toward a position 'whereby Palestinian economic development becomes an
Israeli interest, and Israeli security becomes a Palestinian interest'.
Mr Savir hinted that Israel was looking for ways to reopen its borders with
Gaza, which were closed after recent attacks by Islamic fundamentalists.
About half the money pledged yesterday will come from a World Bank
administered fund to support the Palestinian budget, and includes Dollars
18m earmarked for the operating costs of the authority's police force. A
further Dollars 23m is for public works programmes, which officials said
would be started within weeks.

<TEXT>
Greek prime minister Mr Andreas Papandreou has said he will not run for the
presidency next spring. The ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement must now
find an alternative candidate. Parliament is due to vote for a new head of
state by May when President Constantine Karamanlis, 87, is due to step down.
But Pasok will be forced into an early general election unless it can find
another 10 votes from other parties to reach the 180 needed to elect a
president. The Socialists, together with a progressive faction in the
centre-right opposition New Democracy party are keen to avoid derailing
Greece's economic stabilisation programme by holding a fresh election. Names
being floated of compromise candidates for president include Mr Christos
Lambrakis, who runs Greece's leading media group, and Mr Odysseus Elytis, a
Nobel prize-wining poet.

<TEXT>
The World Bank has agreed to extend a Dollars 58m credit to Palestinian
authorities to support self-rule projects, an official at the multinational
institution said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) officials, in Brussels for meetings
with Israeli officials, the World Bank and wealthy donors, said there had
been an agreement.
The deal will be signed in Brussels today by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman. Mr Arafat and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, also in
Brussels, said they would put pressure on donors, who are to begin a two-day
meeting today, to pay out urgently money already promised to the
Palestinians.
The donors' last meeting broke down in a row over the Palestinians'
inclusion of Jerusalem in projects to be backed.
Palestinians consider Arab East Jerusalem the capital of a future state, but
Israel says that East and West Jerusalem are united and remain its 'eternal
capital'.
In October last year, aid donors pledged more than Dollars 2bn over five
years for projects to support Palestinian self-rule, with Dollars 700m to be
paid out this year. Mr Arafat said only about Dollars 60m in credits had so
far been received because some countries had not honoured their promises.

FT  30 NOV 94 / New Delhi restaurateur finds corruption put on the menu: A
story of enterprise and bribery in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Francis Kuok, a second-generation Chinese living in New Delhi, thought he
had mastered the fine art of bribery or, to put it more politely, getting
around Indian red-tape when he decided to open his third Chinese restaurant.
The 30-year old entrepreneur, his elder brother Gregory, and two friends, Ms
Anu Bakshi and Jerry Wong run two successful take-away shops in a
middle-class Delhi suburb.
They thought they knew the ropes well enough to start a small sit-down lunch
and dinner place.
Mr Kuok and his team had already learnt that the best way to stay in the
restaurant business was to keep the grease out of the noodles for the newly
converted health-conscious middle classes and to spread it instead on the
palms of petty bureaucrats and police officials.
But he claims that what they encountered when they started setting up a
restaurant in the heart of the city was a web of institutionalised
corruption that threatened to stall their enterprise if they did not bribe
government officials every step of the way.
'Once you get used to the broad daylight robbery, it's a dream,' says Mr
Kuok, whose restaurant started on September 5 and is already doing well.
He says he has had to pay more than Rs200,000 (Dollars 6,370) in bribes over
the last three months, about 10 per cent of his Rs2m investment in the
restaurant.
'It's the initial shock of discovering how well organised the set-up is that
throws you,' he says.
Finding a defunct printing plant in a stylish part of town and transforming
it into a pretty restaurant in shades of green and white with gurgling
water, swaying bamboos and soft piped music was the least of their problems.
The plant had not been painted in more than 50 years, and drastic renovation
was required. The eight-year lease with the owner allowed for the tearing
down of walls, but he alleges that municipal officials suddenly appeared in
the middle of construction work and told the masons to lay down their tools.
'Permission' to renovate the plant was needed and this could easily be
obtained by visiting Mr X, the official concerned, after seeking an
appointment at his office.
'There is a fixed price for each 'permission' or licence needed, but I tell
you it works, it's not money down the drain,' claims Mr Kuok. 'Though there
is no paper-work involved, and nothing on the record, it's all very
above-board when it comes to actually delivering what has been promised you
for a certain non-negotiable sum.'
The only time there could be a problem is when a particular official being
dealt with is suddenly transferred, and the bribing process has to be begun
again.
There is an acute water shortage in the area but he says the authorities
allowed a tubewell to be dug - for a price.
There was no toilet or connection to the sewer in the printing plant so the
extra digging called for a further bribe. The kitchen could be extended
after still more money was paid.
'They keep an eye on our every move, and there's no option but to pay your
way through,' says Mr Kuok.
He is amazed at the apparent transparency with which deals are concluded,
and the nonchalance of officials accepting illegal pay-offs. They are often
part of India's elite civil service and the system is so well entrenched,
and involves such a lot of money, that even the gate-keeper at the door of a
bureaucrat's office is part of the game and knows exactly what the boss
inside will deliver for what sum.
'I can bet there is no restaurant in Delhi that hasn't paid all the
departments concerned,' says Mr Kuok.
A 'fastidious' health inspector could point out a cockroach in your kitchen
to close down your restaurant if he were not paid. Health officials certify
that kitchen staff is not suffering from a communicable disease such as
tuberculosis.
A fire certificate is required and even a death-trap could be certified safe
for a fee. Quite separately, the police will extract their pound of flesh
for turning a blind eye to that small encroachment on the pavement, for
allowing customers to park where pedestrians are supposed to be walking and
for registering the restaurant in case of a law and order problem.
'We think nothing of policemen walking in on a daily basis, ordering chilli
chickens and Cokes or whatever else strikes their fancy on the house,' says
Ms Bakshi, who was a journalist before she ventured into the food business.
'It's a very lop-sided value system here,' says Ms Bakshi. 'These are no
gentlemen you are dealing with, and yet, they keep their promises.'
An official once told them helpfully: 'We hold the gun to shoot you, but you
have the bullet.' The bullet of course, is money, and once you've coughed
up, you're home and dry - until you need to get your licence renewed next
year, that is.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Yeltsin issues ultimatum to Chechnya: Russian leader
threatens breakaway Caucasian republic as civil war intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian authorities yesterday sharply raised the stakes in the civil war
in the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya - which has broken away from
Russia - by threatening to use 'all means at the disposal of the state' to
quell the conflict if the republic's government did not disband its forces,
hand over all weapons and release Russian prisoners.
President Boris Yeltsin said yesterday the hope of an independent solution
had been exhausted. He gave the Chechen authorities until 6am tomorrow to
comply with the conditions.
In an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency, President Dzhokar Dudayev
of Chechnya - who has claimed independent status for the republic since the
end of 1991 - said the conflict which brought opposition forces to the doors
of his palace in the capital, Grozny, on Sunday had been quelled. He said
that no 'repressive action' would be taken against Russian soldiers captured
in the fighting - which Chechen sources put at 70 but which independent
sources say number no more than 12.
The Chechen authorities have claimed that Russia is supplying weapons and
men to the opposition forces, one of whose leaders is Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
former speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet until its suppression by
President Yeltsin last October.
President Dudayev said that there were no forces to disband - but that
'there is only the people with weapons, and only the people can give an
answer to Yeltsin's statement'. The Chechen foreign minister, Mr Shamsedin
Yusef, rubbed the point home by saying: 'Moscow is nobody now, but it wants
to have another Afghanistan ..I think Yeltsin was drunk when he said this.'
However, most of the signs pointed to a cautious policy on Russia's part.
Though General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said Grozny could be
taken 'by a battalion of parachutists', he added that a solution should be
found through negotiation. The Interfax news agency, citing 'reliable
sources' in the defence ministry, reported that no troops were being sent to
the area.
Western diplomats in Moscow say any Russian move against General Dudayev,
long a thorn in the Russian flesh, would not attract any international
condemnation unless it was attended by atrocities or was of long duration.
They also do not believe it would have immediate consequences in other
Caucasian republics - except possibly in the Abkhazian region of Georgia,
where Russian units are already engaged in controlling a ceasefire and the
return of refugees.

European Union energy ministers yesterday edged closer to breaking a
two-year deadlock on opening Europe's energy networks to competition, but
there will be no final decision on how to proceed until at least the middle
of next year.
At a meeting in Brussels, energy ministers agreed to investigate whether a
French proposal for liberalising energy markets would bring the same
benefits to consumers and industry as the Commission's plans for allowing
power companies access to other countries' transmission systems, so-called
negotiated third party access.
Although the idea of a study looks like yet another stalling tactic, it at
least breaks the deadlock that has prevailed on energy liberalisation for
two years. Mr Tim Eggar, the UK energy minister, said he detected a strong
shift in sentiment towards the idea of liberalised energy markets.
'There has been a very major change in the attitude taken by the Council,'
said Mr Eggar. 'It was only about a year ago that it was only the UK and
Portugal arguing for liberalisation and the other countries either being
very strongly opposed or not taking a firm stand.'
Under the French proposal for liberalisation - known as the 'single buyer'
proposal - power companies would negotiate access to transmission systems in
other member states via an operator in the buyer's country. The operator
would be responsible for running the system and meeting new demand for
electricity.
The idea was criticised earlier this week by Mr Karel Van Miert, the
commissioner responsible for competition policy, who argued that it would
allow power companies in certain member states to preserve a monopoly on
imports and exports.
However, the French argue that it is important to look at alternatives to
liberalisation, and that there is no reason why its system should not
coexist with third party access.
'The conclusions of the council show that there is a real desire on behalf
of member states to move ahead so there is no need for the commission to
take matters into its own hands,' said Mr Pierre Mandil, a senior French
diplomat.
The ministers also agreed that energy companies should be required to
'unbundle' themselves by separating the financial accounts of their
production, transport and distribution arms. This will make it harder for
companies to subsidise loss-making parts of their businesses out of the
profits from their monopoly over distribution of energy.

Estonia's last communist prime minister, Mr Indrek Toome, now a powerful
business figure, has been detained for allegedly attempting to bribe a
police officer, it was reported yesterday. Mr Toome, 51, was arrested on
Monday for allegedly offering Dollars 2,400 in bribes to secure fraud-ulent
passports for Russian business associates. During a search of his apartment
on Monday, police also found a large box of machine gun bullets, which they
said he possessed illegally.
Mr Toome, who served as prime minister from 1988 to 1990, is expected to
remain in prison for 10 days while investigators gather evidence. If
convicted of bribery, he faces a maximum two-year prison sentence. Earlier
this year, Mr Toome and Finnish business associates bought the 22-story Viru
Hotel for Dollars 1m at a state-run auction. The sale price of the Viru, one
of Estonia's most sought-after properties, was criticised for being too low.

<TEXT>
French state tobacco group SEITA, maker of Gauloise and Gitanes cigarettes,
is to be sold in the second half of 1995, if not earlier, budget minister Mr
Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday. Mr Sarkozy said the government had adopted a
draft bill that would allow the sale of the 300-year-old monopoly whose
products are a special part of French culture. He said the legislation would
seek to safeguard the labour rights of SEITA's 6,000-strong workforce as
they would no longer be civil servants. SEITA's labour unions staged a
strike last month to protest against the privatisation plans. Mr Sarkozy
said it was possible that some of the shares would be earmarked for
employees.
Financial analysts said SEITA could be worth FFr7bn (Dollars 1.36bn). The
government is expected to retain a 10 per cent stake. French economy
minister Mr Edmond Alphandery announced last week that Credit Lyonnais had
been appointed as the state's adviser. SEITA could even be sold before the
1995 presidential elections in the spring. A successful sale of the
profitable company, coming after the sale of part of carmaker Renault, could
boost the ruling conservative coalition's chances.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Review levels the rules on measuring profits -
Life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anomalies and difficulties in the taxation of life assurance business were
amended after a review of existing rules.
The measures changing the tax rules for life insurance companies will allow
annuities and some interest to be deducted when it is necessary to measure
the trading profits of a life insurance business and prevent a loss being
used more than once. The rules also amend the way income and gains are
attributed to different classes of business to minimise the distortions
which can occur when a company changes its valuation basis; and to ensure a
closer fit with commercial reality and make it clear when capital allowances
are available.
The measures also introduce other measures relating to dividends and
distributions adapting existing legislation to the circumstances of life
assurance companies and prevent UK residents taking advantage of the tax
treatment given to business written at overseas branches with non-
residents.
Companies generally cannot deduct annuity payments or some types of annual
interest in arriving at their Schedule D Case I trading profit for tax
purposes. Instead these are deducted as 'charges on income' in computing the
total income and gains chargeable to corporation tax. For some of them it
can result in a much larger than intended proportion of profits being
charged at the normal corporation tax rate of 33 per cent rather than the
special 25 per cent rate that applies to the profits accruing for
policyholders.
Other companies have found that the rule gives them an advantage. The
Chancellor proposes to allow these charges to be deducted in arriving at a
life insurance company's trading profits so that the calculation represents
the profit from operating the business.
Where an insurance company writes more than one kind of business within the
same fund, it will be required to apportion the total investment return
arising in the fund between the different kinds.
The apportionment rules may also require a life assurance company with
overseas branches to compute the amount of capital gains arising on those
assets even though they are tax-exempt.

FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil gains 6.2%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities ended 6.2 per cent up in moderate trade on the Sao Paulo bourse
after domestic and foreign investors returned to the market and caused a
technical rebound from steep losses registered earlier in the month. The
Bovespa index gained 2,749 at 46,737, taking November's loss down to 2.6 per
cent from the 8.3 per cent seen at Monday's close.
Analysts said lower nominal interest rates combined with forecasts of
falling inflation in December improved the short term economic scenario,
encouraging investors to buy again. Brazil's central bank intervened in the
money market earlier, repurchasing securities in a forward operation for
settlement on December 5 at 5.45 per cent. Brazil's overnight call money
rate is 5.95 per cent. December inflation is seen as around 2.5 per cent.
Mexico
Stock prices ended stronger but off the day's best after a session marked by
optimistic bets on a smooth political transition this week, and a fall in
domestic interest rates. The IPC index closed 33.33 or 1.3 per cent higher
at 2,596.16.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Texaco sells interest in smaller
US operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US oil group, reached an agreement to sell its interest in a
group of small oil and gas fields in the US for Dollars 600m, signalling its
intention to concentrate on bigger, more profitable exploration and
production projects.
The properties are being sold to Apache, an independent energy company based
in Houston, Texas. With net proven reserves of 81m barrels of oil and 220bn
cubic feet of gas, the fields are roughly half as big as Apache's total
reserves at the end of last year. The sale should be completed in the first
quarter of next year, the two companies said.
Texaco said the sale price amounted to Dollars 5.08 per barrel of oil
equivalent.
Texaco's move echoes steps taken by big US oil groups in recent years. Most
have moved to shed smaller US fields, which they are often not able to
develop and run as profitably as can smaller independent companies with
lower overheads.
Texaco said in July that it intended to dispose of a collection of smaller
US fields which contributed 'zero to earnings and less than 10 per cent' of
the company's cashflow from exploration and production activities in the US.
The 300 properties being sold to Apache are spread throughout Texas, as well
as Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky mountains and 'the
mid-continent' area of the US. Still for sale are properties in California
and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano will improve
bid proposal for bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credito Italiano, the Milan-based bank, last night promised to improve the
terms of its proposed bid for Credito Romagnolo, but did not indicate
whether it was prepared to offer more for the Bolognese bank's shares.
Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) said it was happy that its shares, suspended on
Monday, would begin trading again today. A more detailed judgment on the
outline of a new Credito Italiano (Credit) bid is unlikely until after
tomorrow's Rolo board meeting.
Credit first revealed a month ago that it was planning a L2,000bn (Dollars
1.2bn) offer for 48 per cent of Rolo's shares, which would give it control
of the bank's quoted holding company Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo.
However, since then its plans have been overtaken by Rolo's proposal for a
defensive merger with CAER, the parent of another local bank, Cassa di
Risparmio, in Bologna. The merger has won Bank of Italy approval and will be
put to shareholders on December 19.
The Milan bank's original plan to offer L19,000 for each Rolo share,
compared with the suspension price of L17,096, has been rejected.
Credit yesterday dismissed as untrustworthy recent press reports, some of
which have suggested an improved offer could be worth L23,000 a share,
although the bank declined to reveal further details of the offer it is
preparing.
The rest of the statement, issued after two days of intense discussion
between the banks and Italy's stock exchange authorities, is an attempt to
woo Rolo's local shareholders, and convert a hostile offer to a friendly
one.
Credit said it would insert a clause into the Rolo statutes which would
prevent the Bologna bank being absorbed into another company without the
support of 80 per cent of the shares, for four years.
It will guarantee Rolo's management autonomy, and board representation for
minority shareholders. The Milanese bank is planning to recommend a dividend
of at least 55 per cent of Rolo's profit until 1997.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Central London will be hardest hit - Rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The central London property market is expected to suffer at the expense of
other regions following the chancellor's announcement of plans for phasing
in the new uniform business rate from March 1995.
The new rates will be based on property valuations at April 1993, whereas
current rates are on the basis of April 1988 valuations.
Changes in property prices between these dates means that many central
London offices should see their rateable value halve, whereas the rateable
value of buildings in areas such as the West Midlands will more than double.
However, the chancellor said these changes will be phased far more slowly
than the property market had expected.
Rates reductions next year for occupiers of larger buildings will be
restricted to a maximum of 5 per cent in real terms, and 10 per cent for
smaller premises.
This downward phasing will help subsidise regions where rates should rise.
For large properties, rates increases will be restricted to 10 per cent next
year and 7.5 per cent for smaller buildings.
Despite this subsidy, the chancellor said that phasing of rating increases
will cost the exchequer Pounds 605m in 1995-96.
Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, which expected top City of London rents
to rise to Pounds 50 per sq ft in three years, was looking again at its
forecast.
It had expected the chancellor to allow rates reductions of at least 20 per
cent next year.
Mr Rodney Clutton, joint managing director of Wates City of London
Properties, the property company, said: 'The chancellor's statement is not
encouraging and much less generous than we had been expecting.'
Mr Clutton added that slow downward phasing would increase the
attractiveness to tenants of new office buildings.
The chancellor also announced that the uniform business rate in England for
1995-2000 will be 43.2p, up slightly from 42.3p which applied this year.
Despite the wide regional fluctuations in property values since the last
rating revaluation was carried out, the average rateable value in England
has barely changed.
In Wales, where rateable values have generally increased, the business rate
will fall to 39p from 44.8p.
In Scotland, which moves to a uniform rate from a system of regional rates
for the first time, businesses will also pay 43.2p.

Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace companies, are to join forces
in bidding for the next generation of space shuttle. The contract for the
initial development phase of the new vehicle, the X-33, is expected to be
awarded before the year-end, writes Tony Jackson in New York.
The 13-month contract will seek to design a vehicle which can be turned
round as quickly as an aircraft between missions and does away with costly
and complex ground support, the companies said. It is unclear whether the
X-33 will ever go into production. If it does, the choice of manufacturer is
expected to be made by NASA in 1996.
The companies, both of which are already active in space programmes, said
they would share costs and profits on an equal basis. The programme manager,
Dr William Gaubatz, will be supplied by McDonnell Douglas.

Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, said it had agreed the sale of Ivac, one of
its medical devices and diagnostics businesses, and that it remained on
track to float most of the remainder on the stock market by the year-end,
writes Richard Waters.
Ivac, which makes drug infusion and vital-signs equipment, is being bought
by an investor group led by a buy-out fund run by US brokers Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Though the value of the deal was not disclosed, analysts
estimated that Ivac was worth a multiple of its sales last year, which are
understood to have been about Dollars 200m.
Lilly also said the company had received tax clearance for the flotation of
Guidant, a company formed out of five of its devices businesses, with total
sales last year of of Dollars 800m. Guidant, which analysts have valued at
Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn, should still make its debut on the stock market
in the current year, as originally planned, Lilly said.

Mr Raymond Gilmartin, the new chairman of Merck, the biggest US drugs group,
outlined a cost-cutting programme yesterday and said the company would
continue to concentrate on revenue growth to drive earnings in the years
ahead, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Mr Gilmartin, who was appointed chief executive of Merck this summer and
took over the chairman's job in November, was making his first public
comments since arriving at the drugs maker.
Speaking at an analysts' meeting, he said Merck intended to reduce its
manufacturing costs by Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m by the end of 1996, and its
selling and administrative expenses by Dollars 100m. The more important
tasks, he indicated, were to make Merck's Dollars 6.6bn acquisition of Medco
Containment Services last year pay its way, and to ensure revenue growth
through a series of new product launches.

Best Travel, the UK's seventh largest tour operator, ceased trading
yesterday on the instructions of the Civil Aviation Authority.
The collapse of the group is the biggest to hit the UK travel industry since
the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group in 1991.
The CAA said yesterday that it did not yet know how many of Best Travel's
customers were on holiday abroad. The company is fully bonded, however, and
any travellers will be brought home.
The development followed the announcement yesterday morning that Ambassador
Airways, Best's Gatwick-based charter airline, had gone into liquidation
because Best could no longer provide it with financial support.
Airtours, the UK's second largest travel group, is believed to have had
discussions with Best about taking it over, but these talks appear to have
come to nothing. Airtours had no comment yesterday.
Ambassador Airways' four Boeing 757s and two 737s were grounded yesterday.
The airline employs 350 staff, who are likely to lose their jobs
immediately. As the collapse comes after the end of the summer holiday
season, the number of passengers affected is believed to be relatively
small.
The airline specialised in flying holidaymakers to Cyprus and Greece.
Mr Nick Lyle, a partner with Touche Ross, the airline's liquidator, said he
believed 'several hundred passengers' would be affected. Mr Lyle said
passengers on Ambassador flights should contact their travel agents or tour
operators.
Mr Lyle said that all Ambassador Airways' aircraft were leased. 'Ambassador
was dependent on Best Travel for financial support. When it became clear
Best could no longer provide that support, management had no alternative but
to cease flying. Unfortunately, most of the staff will lose their jobs
immediately,' he said.
The airline was formed in 1992 by Mr Takis Shacalis, the owner of Best
Travel. Best Travel carried 353,360 passengers in the 12 months to March
this year, a 21 per cent fall on the previous year, according to CAA
figures.
Mr Shacalis was a non-executive director of Inspirations, the tour operator
which was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market in December 1993, but
resigned last week. Last month Inspirations said it would form its own
airline next spring, to be called International Airways.
International Airways will be capable of carrying all Inspirations summer
and winter customers. Mr Vic Fatah, Inspirations' chief executive, said
yesterday, however, that he did not believe the formation of the new airline
would have had a damaging effect on Ambassador. Mr Fatah stressed that there
was no remaining link between Inspirations and Ambassador or Best Travel.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Unit trust investment falls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment in unit trusts last month fell for the second consecutive month
this year to a net Pounds 302.2m, almost 36 per cent lower than September's
figure of Pounds 470.7m and the lowest monthly investment figure this year.
Institutions were net sellers of unit trusts last month but retail investors
bought a net Pounds 330.9m, of which almost 75 per cent - Pounds 245.6m -
was in the form of tax-free personal equity plans.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, said he was not surprised by the low sales. He attributed
it to an unattractive stock market performance and a faster rise in consumer
spending than in earnings, leaving people with less money to save.
'The counteracting influence is the continuing Pep sales, where regular
savings plans and sales direct to the public and through sales forces are
growing in importance,' he added.
Retail investors continued to invest in less risky funds and those offering
income. The most popular last month were fund of funds, UK general, UK
growth and UK equity income. The least favoured markets were North America
and Europe.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Lottery draws 20m BBC viewers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty million people tuned in to see the BBC's first lottery programme,
more than twice as many as were watching ITV, according to viewing figures
published yesterday by Barb, the audience research group.
The figures showed ITV's Blind Date with about 9m viewers, a fall of 4m from
the previous week.
After the lottery draw, most viewers stayed with BBC1 to watch hospital
series Casualty - which had 17m viewers, up from fewer than 14m the previous
week and almost double the 8.8m who watched Diana: Portrait Of A Princess,
on ITV.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Du Pont closures questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report by consultants on the decision by Du Pont, the world's largest
nylon maker, to close recently acquired plants on Teesside says it could not
detect any unexpected change in market conditions which would have prompted
the move.
The report, by chemical industry consultants Chem Systems, says the
recession from which the petrochemical industry is now emerging started well
over two years ago, so nothing 'new' had taken place. The research was
commissioned by Cleveland County Council because of the controversy over Du
Pont's plans, announced in June, to shut five plants and shed 520 jobs.
It will be discussed by councillors tomorrow. It will also be submitted to
the European Commission as part of its investigation into Du Pont's plans to
shut down the Teesside plants and invest in new adipic acid production in
Chalampe, France, in a joint venture with Rhone Poulenc.
Du Pont took over the former Imperial Chemical Industries' Teesside nylons
capacity, and 920 former ICI Teesside employees, as part of a deal with ICI
announced in 1992 and finalised in July last year.
Under that deal, approved with conditions and modifications by the European
Commission, ICI swapped its European nylons interests for Du Pont's US
acrylics business, plus potentially Pounds 235m in cash.
Since then Du Pont has announced two rounds of jobs cuts in the former ICI
nylons business.
The Chem Systems report says Du Pont would have had free access to ICI's
technical and commercial information on adipic acid during the long and
detailed discussions. It adds that demand for adipic acid, used to make
nylon polymer, is unlikely to recover to early 1990 levels.
Mr Wayne Barnacal, Du Pont's Teesside site manager, said the report was
wrong to suggest the company had used unexpected market deterioration to
justify the closures. The key reasons were the continuing downturn and the
big benefit of the joint venture.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Charities receive phone guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guidelines on telephone fundraising, including bans on calls after 9pm or to
children under 16, were issued by the Institute of Charity Fundraising
Managers yesterday.
The guidelines come as charities are increasingly turning to telephone
fundraising - 65 charities raised almost Pounds 11m last year through 1.4m
calls. Some 63 per cent of the charities used an outside agency for the
calls.
The institute's code of practice states that charities:
Should not use random digit-dialling by computer.
Should have clear contracts with agencies.
Should ensure that calls are 'pleasant and honest' and that callers accept
the ending of a conversation without argument.
Should send a letter before the call where possible, giving the option to
refuse the call.
Mr Karl Holweger, chairman of the institute's telephone working group, said
use of the phone by charity fundraisers was set to increase.
'This should be welcomed as a cost-effective and efficient way of matching
donors to causes,' he said.
But the growth had to be 'mirrored by a responsible attitude by charities
and their agents'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Imposters prey on business rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bogus rating consultants are defrauding small businesses in the run-up to
next year's business rate revaluation, professional rating bodies said
yesterday.
Mr Colin Farrington, director of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and
Valuation, said unqualified people were setting themselves up as
'consultants', and in some cases 'absconding with clients' money'.
The institute says the Serious Fraud Office is investigating a company which
has ceased trading after taking Pounds 400,000 in advance fees. Trading
standards officers are investigating five or six companies who have
allegedly misrepresented their competence.
He said opportunities to 'leech' off companies were increased by the 'panic'
affecting businesses during evaluations. Some Pounds 7bn was raised from
business rates this financial year, and this total may increase after the
revaluation comes into force in April. The new rateable values will be
published in January.

FT  30 NOV 94 / OECD ends wrangling over top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A protracted dispute over the leadership of the OECD was resolved last night
with an agreement to renew the mandate of Mr Jean-Claude Paye of France
until June 1996, when he will be replaced by Mr Donald Johnston, former
Canadian finance minister.
The agreement was announced after a late night meeting of the Council of the
OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The
council is the top decision-making body of the 25-member Paris-based
organisation.
The solution is a compromise between the French government, which had pushed
for a further five-year mandate for Mr Paye, and non-European members of the
OECD. The US, in particular, had sought to put a non-European at the head of
the organisation.
The dispute grew over the past 10 months, causing deadlock and resulting in
appointment of an interim secretary general after the expiry of Mr Paye's
second five-year term on September 30. The mandate of Mr Staffan Sohlman,
the Swedish ambassador to the OECD who was appointed as temporary head of
the organisation, expired at midnight last night.
Diplomats yesterday expressed dismay at the wrangling and at the way a
compromise was reached between France and Canada.
'It was a messy business and we have reservations about the way in which the
deal was reached,' said a diplomat from one member country. 'We had to end
the hiatus but this cannot happen again.'
At the centre of the dispute was the desire by several countries, including
Canada, the US and Japan, to end the European dominance of the top post. 'It
is time for a change. We need new ideas and an acceptance of the growing
economic role of non-European countries,' said one official.
The Netherlands had resisted the Franco-Canadian compromise and had
considered Mr Ruud Lubbers, the former prime minister, as a possible
candidate.
The stalemate was linked to jockeying for top jobs in other international
bodies, including the head of the World Trade Organisation, successor to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Diplomats indicated that another five-year term for Mr Paye would have
strengthened the position of non-European candidates for the post. These
candidates include Mr Kim Chul-su, the South Korean trade and industry
minister, and Mr Carlos Salinas, Mexico's departing president.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Gatt reforms win strong House backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives yesterday approved legislation implementing
the Uruguay Round of trade reforms by 288 votes to 146, bringing the
proposed World Trade Organisation with its stronger rules and lower tariffs
one step closer to enactment.
The strength of the vote in favour was expected to provide momentum in the
Senate where the outcome is likely to be closer. The Senate vote on the
124-nation pact, concluded last year under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, is scheduled for tomorrow with debate beginning today. Vote
counters among both the Republicans and Democrats said they were confident
of passage. The outcome in the House had not been in doubt although the
margin of victory was at the top end of expectations.
A few hours before the vote, Ms Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, one of the
Round's most bitter opponents, described the vote 'one more example of
business as usual in Washington'. She said the 'rubber stamping' House had
held only one hearing since submission of the implementing legislation in
October and that was 'not even on the substance of the agreement but on its
pork barrel deals'.
She said: 'It is a disgrace that the House only scheduled four hours of
debate on one of the most important votes this decade.'
Both opponents and supporters suffered hits yesterday. Senator Max Baucus,
chairman of the Senate trade sub-committee and a free trader, came out
against the deal.
Mr Laurence Tribe - an eminent constitutional scholar, whose conclusion that
the WTO 'would entail a significant shift of sovereignty from state and
local governments' was widely publicised by opponents - changed his view
after listening to arguments from the Clinton administration which has
worked hard for approval of the legislation.
The broad outlines of the Gatt deal have been known for months, as was
reflected by the debate. Most of the opponents cited worries about lost jobs
and US sovereignty. The supporters said it would provide the largest tax cut
in history.
In a speech typical of the opponents, Congresswoman Nydia Velaquez, a New
York Democrat, said she could not 'in good conscience vote for an agreement
that encourages companies to continue their exploitation of low paid workers
the world over'.
Congressman Bill Zeliff, a New Hampshire Republican, said: 'Free trade is a
proven job creator. Gatt will be good for New Hampshire and good for
America.'
The political factors behind the vote were complex.
Since the mid-term congressional elections earlier this month, in which the
Republicans trounced the Democrats, Republicans no longer worry about the
effects of denying President Bill Clinton a victory.
The 85 'retired and fired' members were free to vote according to their
consciences. But they had future jobs to consider, some as lobbyists,
lawyers or consultants in Washington.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UN chief tries to salvage Bosnia peacekeeping: Boutros Ghali
to visit Sarajevo in 'critical high stakes' mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, will today meet the
leaders of the warring sides in Sarajevo in a bid to salvage the battered
credibility of his organisation.
In what a UN official decribed as a 'critical, high-stakes' mission, Mr
Boutros Ghali will meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and lay out the conditions for the continuation of
the UN operation in Bosnia.
He will try to broker a ceasefire in the war-torn territory, and, in
particular, around Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, where infantry
clashes yesterday were reported to the west of the UN 'safe area'.
Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to meet an angry reception in Sarajevo, where
many resent the UN's failure to lift the 32-month Serb siege.
His last visit in December 1992 is remembered bitterly for his remarks that
he could think of a dozen places even worse than Sarajevo.
His visit coincides with intense diplomatic efforts to overcome deep splits
in the international community over Bosnia and to resume the peace process.
In a bid to get the Bosnian Serbs to return to the bargaining table,
meanwhile, envoys from the five-nation contact group yesterday also
travelled to Sarajevo, for talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian government.
The representatives - from the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK - were
also due to meet Bosnian Serb leaders for the first time since they rejected
a western peace plan - a partition of Bosnia - in July. This meeting
followed talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade on
Monday.
Despite diplomatic strains placed on the contact group by criticism from the
US of the efficacy of the UN's military role in Bosnia, the international
mediators appear to hold out hope of reviving their peace plan to divide
Bosnia roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian
Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country.
The peace process will get an additional boost when Serb rebels from Croatia
sign an agreement on Thursday on restoring economic links with Zagreb, the
Croat capital.
A close associate of Mr Milosevic yesterday said Belgrade would maintain a
direct link with Serb-held territory in Croatia, which would step up
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace deal.
But the Bosnian Serb leadership, which over the past two weeks has revelled
in the eruption of a serious transatlantic feud over Bosnia, is waiting for
territorial concessions.
Mr Milosevic this week has signalled that he is pushing for Bosnian Serbs to
negotiate land swaps on a bilateral basis.
Mr Mirko Pejanovic, an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia's collective presidency,
disclosed in London that he had been in touch with aides to Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.
Mr Pejanovic - who contests the right of Mr Karadzic to speak for Bosnian
Serbs - said he had put to Russian officials the concerns of the 200,000
Serbs who live in Bosnian government-controlled territory.
Russia has strong traditional ties with the Serbs and big diplomatic
presence in Croatia, but until recently its lines of communications with the
Bosnian leadership have been weak.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Chancellor fails to excite cautious markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets yesterday gave a lukewarm response to a Budget widely
described as unexceptional.
Good news about the state of UK public finances was tempered by concern that
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, might cut income tax in the run-up to the
next election.
Because the Budget was in line with market expectations there was little
response in terms of price movements. Traders found little fresh information
overall on which to base new business.
Analysts cautioned, however, against attributing falling bond prices to the
Budget, saying that UK markets were taking their lead from Wall Street. A
stronger than expected US consumer confidence report reawakened fears of
higher US interest rates.
UK government bonds fell by more than  1/2 a point on the day, while the
FTSE index rose 14 points to close at 3061.1. Equity prices fell marginally
after the Budget announcement: brokers fear that UK interest rates could
rise after the meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank
of England a week tomorrow. Sterling showed little response to the Budget.
It rose half a pfennig to DM2.4550 after Mr Clarke's speech, before
steadying. Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at the broker Smith New Court
commented: 'It would be unfair to describe the Budget as boring, but there
was nothing exceptional in it. It was very much as expected, and there is no
reason to alter your view if nothing changes.'
There was a mixed response to the downward revision in the public sector
borrowing requirement. Some observers were disappointed, while others said
it was as good as could be expected. There were also worries that the
chancellor was laying the ground for future tax cuts.

FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BTR active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diversified industrial group BTR was the most active Footsie stock with 16m
shares changing hands following a trading statement aimed at clearing the
air after the company's disappointing interim results.
A clear two-way pull developed as several lines of stock in excess of 1m
shares passed through the market at prices ranging from 290p to 287 1/2 p.
At the close, BTR, which has underperfomed the market by 22 per cent over
the past three months, was up 2 at 287p.
The trading statement was modestly upbeat, with BTR expecting profits this
year to improve, but analysts said their briefing supplied little new
information, with the company staying tight-lipped about potential
management changes.
A flurry of tax-related trades known as bed-and-breakfasts appeared on the
trading screens ahead of the Budget. The trades were fronted by a large
block of shares in insurer Legal &amp; General. A line of 6.7m shares were
placed at 410p, significantly below the market price, which subsequently
rose 10 to 430p on closing volume of 8.3m. The sudden jump in turnover
prompted a flurry of rather spurious bid speculation. But the rise in the
stock was mainly a reflection of recent underperformance, and some dealers
said Robert Fleming Securities was discussing the company's prospects.
Oil major BP, up 4 at 422 1/2 p, was heavily traded after the company
announced senior management changes. The move of Mr David Simon from chief
executive to chairman and of Mr John Browne from head of BP Exploration to
chief executive was not a dramatic surprise. But analyst Mr John Toalster,
historically negative on the company, said it signalled a continuation of
the trend of debt and cost reduction. And Mr Brendan Wilders of Hoare Govett
said the moves represented a 'natural succession which ensured a smooth
transition of power'.
Shell Transport responded to the strength of its Dutch arm, which has been
recommended by some leading US investment houses and has attracted retail
demand in the US. The shares ended the day 10 better at 706p.
British Gas rose 6 to 302 1/2 p in spite of the chancellor's refusal to back
down on the increase in VAT in fuel. Agency broker James Capel was said to
be recommending the stock.
The rest of the utilities were marked by profit-taking and continued
nervousness as dealers and analysts waited to hear if the chancellor would
make a much feared announcement on imposing a windfall tax. Powergen
surrendered 6 to 544p and Eastern Electricity gave up 8 to 783p. Midlands
eased 6 to 745p, while Northern Ireland Electricity rose 4 to 366p on
reports that the group is to increase its supply in the province. With the
threat of a windfall tax now removed, market watchers expect the regional
electricity companies to advance strongly over the next few sessions, as
several companies in the sector report interim figures.
Regional water and sewage company Severn Trent reversed an earlier advance
to end a penny lower at 540p, after it reported interim figures in line with
market expectations.
Mr Douglas Falconer at Yamaichi advised clients to switch into North West
Water, which last week cheered the market with an announcement of a link-up
with US group Bechtel. NWW gained 4 at 535p.
Hopes that the government would not raise excise duty - confirmed in the
Budget speech - powered the brewing sector. Whitbread added 12 at 552p,
while Bass advanced 8 to 539p, aided by a recommendation from SG Warburg.
Highland Distilleries rose 11 to 436p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which
reports interim figures on Monday, closed 10 ahead at 517p.
Argyll Group hardened 1 1/2 to 272p ahead of today's interim figures. The
range of market forecasts is between Pounds 199m and Pounds 219m.
Analysts took a gloomy view on waste disposal groups after the chancellor
said that he would be raising 'several hundred million pounds' from a tax on
landfill. One analyst suggested that the tax could add Pounds 5 a ton to the
cost of disposal, which is sometimes as low as Pounds 15 a ton at present.
Shanks &amp; McEwan fell 3 to 89p and Leigh Interests 3 to 174p.
Yorkshire Chemicals suffered as a result of what one analyst described as
'muted comments' from the company on trading prospects. Yorkshire has been
in the City talking about the effect of high raw material prices and the
problem of passing on costs, and forecasts have been coming down to below
Pounds 15m for the full year. The shares declined 12 to 362p.
Eurotunnel slipped 7 to 246p as news of a row between the company and a debt
trading house served to focus attention on the apparent disparity between
so-called debt and share price discounts.
The Channel tunnel operator's bank debt trades in the secondary market at a
discount of 40 per cent (60p in the pound), whereas the shares are within 30
per cent of their 1987 flotation price of 350p.
Submarine maker VSEL continued to improve on hopes of an increased takeover
offer from GEC, extending its three-day advance to 50 with a rise of 10 to
1545p. GEC was marginally firmer at 275p, while rival bidder British
Aerospace shed 7 to 448p.
News of the appointment of a new chief executive put fresh life into
Aerostructures Hamble, leaving the shares 5 better at 31p. They stood at
126p earlier this year.

FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call worries hit T&amp;N

<TEXT>
News of a jump in the cost of asbestos-related claims at motor parts group
T&amp;N pushed the stock market's rights issue fears back to the very top of the
agenda and sent the shares tumbling in heavy 7.1m turnover. They closed 35
lower at 186p, a drop of 15 per cent.
It also led analysts to downgrade profits forecasts. NatWest Securities
sliced back its T&amp;N estimate for 1994 from Pounds 112.5m pre-tax to Pounds
108.5m and said the claims experience put a clear question mark against the
group's earnings and dividend prospects for some years to come.
The rise in claim provisions was totally unforeseen and it led to a clear
deepening of the market's rights issue concern. This surfaced init-ially in
September when T&amp;N took an option to buy 52 per cent of German pistons group
Kolbenschmidt.
The worry for the market is that if taken up the option would cost some
Pounds 118m, while an outright bid for Kolbenschmidt, including debt, could
involve outlays of more than Pounds 350m - 35 per cent of T&amp;N's market
capitalisation.

FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares make modest progress ahead of
Budget - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market, in good form throughout yesterday's trading session, was
virtually unaltered throughout the chancellor's Budget speech, and settled a
net 14.0 higher at 3,061.1. Immediately prior to the speech the index was
standing some 16.4 up. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 0.8 off at 3,489.2.
'Shockingly boring,' was the initial response from one senior marketmaker,
'at first glance, there is really nothing for the equity market to get its
teeth into.'
And the head of trading at one of the UK securities houses said he expected
the continued gyrations on Wall Street to play a much greater part in
determining trends in the market after the UK Budget.
'There were no changes to ACT, the market got its gilts repo story, and the
public sector borrowing requirement has been taken as good news by the debt
products people, so there does not seem to be much in the way of bad news,'
he added.
Gilt-edged stocks, which were marginally firmer ahead of the Budget, began
to fall away in the middle of the afternoon, under the influence of US bonds
and German bunds. The key US long bond saw keen selling pressure during the
afternoon following a much higher than expected US Confidence Index, which
burst through the 100 level to reach 101-plus per cent, against last month's
87.6 per cent.
That figure put the skids under US equity and bond markets and reignited
fears that a rapidly expanding US economy may need another interest rate
increase to cool inflationary pressures.
Wall Street, up some 31 points on Monday, opened under pressure yesterday in
the wake of the consumer index news, and was showing a fall of more than 20
points at one point, before staging a good rally and moving into positive
territory two hours after London closed.
Equity market strategists put on a brave face in view of the general lack of
enthusiasm towards the Budget. Mr Richard Jeffrey, equity market strategist
and head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said the
chancellor's Budget held out 'a positive promise for next year'. Mr Jeffrey
said the Budget 'provides a good background for the gilts market which,
longer term, will help the equity market'.
Answering the question as to whether the Budget was disappointing, he
continued: 'Who would want a Budget injecting more vigour into an economy
expanding at 4 per cent per annum?'
Mr Edmond Warner, head of strategy at Kleinwort Benson Securities, said:
'Financial markets must now focus on the next UK interest rate increase; the
chancellor's punchy inflation target will need higher base rates.' He added
that the gilt-edged market may be disappointed by the Budget and said he was
recommending a switch out of gilts and into equities, pointing out that
gilts have outperformed equities by 10 per cent in the last three months.
At Strauss Turnbull, economist and market strategist Mr Ian Harnett
described the chancellor's proposals as 'a Budget for the future', and said
that by reducing the public sector borrowing requirement Mr Clarke would
achieve two main things: 'He frees cash for the institutions to invest
outside of gilts, and provides scope for tax cuts in the years ahead. You
could say we needed more for the corporate sector, but it was pleasing that
the chancellor did not introduce any headline grabbing measures.'
The Budget brought a subdued ending to an uninspiring session. Earlier,
dealers reported a barrage of bed and breakfast, or tax-related, trades
estimated at around 100m shares and accounting for more than 16 per cent of
the day's turnover. This was 609.5m shares, an encouraging figure for Budget
Day. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks was about 400m. Customer business on
Monday was worth some Pounds 1.11bn.

FT  30 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved higher for the fourth trading day in a row, but
activity remained low and most traders closed their books early in order to
concentrate on the Budget, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,068 at the end of pit trading, up 13
points for a four-day advance of 44 points. The premium to the cash market
was seven points, or two points over fair value.
But dealers said the market was again mostly on hold, waiting for the chance
to get to grips with the contents of the chancellor's Budget Box. Contract
numbers again failed to breach 10,000.
There was a certain amount of 'respectable' buying during the morning
session, but by the early afternoon the local, independent traders had the
market largely to themselves and little real business was transacted.
On balance, the Budget statement was thought by futures traders to be
suitably neutral, and in late screen-based trading the December contract
edged up to 3,072.
Option trading improved to 25,991 lots from Monday's 17,732, with call and
put volume evenly matched. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for just
under 15,000 contracts.
TSB was the most active stock option, turning over 1,050 lots, followed by
Hanson (924 lots) and HSBC (881).

FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retrieves initial fall on
consumer data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were mixed yesterday, after bouncing back from declines made
in the morning on the heels of falling bond prices, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 1.01 off at 3,738.55. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.01 at 455.17, while the Nasdaq composite
stood out with an advance of 5.74 to 751.47. New York SE volume totalled
287m shares.
For the first time in more than a week, the stock market acted in tandem
with the bond market, which was off sharply in the morning after a stronger
than expected report on consumer confidence.
The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence hit 101.3,
substantially higher than economists' expectations of about 89.
While some economists immediately wrote off the figures as an aberration,
others pointed to them as an indication of strong inflationary pressures in
the economy. Thus the market is worried that the Federal Reserve might raise
interest rates in the short term, causing an erosion of corporate earnings.
Initially share prices fell as sharply as the bond market, with the Dow off
more than 20 points in the morning, but prices pushed back up towards the
afternoon. The Dow passed briefly into positive territory before slipping
back into slightly negative ground.
Santa Fe Pacific put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 16 3/4 after the railroad
company put off a shareholders meeting in order to negot-iate with Union
Pacific, which had made a hostile bid for Santa Fe.
Union Pacific also rose, by Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 , on the news
because it increased the likelihood that the larger railroad would complete
its bid.
American Brands firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 after confirming that
it was holding 'serious discussions' regarding the sale of its Franklin Life
Insurance unit with financial group American General. The latter eased
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 26.
Shares of the aerospace division of General Motors gained Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 33 1/8 on news that GM's Hughes had signed an agreement that would
allow it to offer more than 400 professional basketball games in the 1994-95
season over its satellite television service DirecTV. GM was down Dollars
1/8 at Dollars 38 1/4 .
Both National Medical Enterprises and American Medical Holdings gained
ground on news that a Congressional waiting period required before the two
companies could merge had passed without requests for more information.
National Medical firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 7/8 and American Medical
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 .
Retailers posted another strong day, buoyed by early reports that consumer
spending should be higher this holiday season. Dayton Hudson rose Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 80, Sears Roebuck Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 and Dillards
Department Stores Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/2 .
Canada
Advances in heavily weighted metal and industrial products shares lifted the
Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index to a modest gain on the day, in
spite of weakness in bond markets. The overall performance for Toronto
stocks was mixed.
The TSE 300 closed 15.23 up at 4,103.72. Falls led rises by 404 to 302 after
volume of 50.6m shares valued at CDollars 668.9m, but 10 of the 14
sub-indices were higher, led by transportation, metal, industrial products
and conglomerate stocks. Real estate, financial services and oil issues
posted the biggest declines. The golds group added 1.05 per cent, although
the New York spot bullion price eased 40 US cents to USDollars 382.95 an
ounce.

FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei makes progress in
subdued trading volume
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small-lot arbitrage buying supported share prices in low volumes, and the
Nikkei 225 average advanced for the second consecutive day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 115.13 ahead at 18,926.49 after a day's low of 18,826.37
and high of 18,928.59. Overseas investors continued to sell large-capital
steels and shipbuilders, while individual investors, who had bought shares
on margin, were also sellers.
Volume remained subdued, at 160m shares against 184m.
The life assurers' half-year results released on Monday revealed that
investments during the first six months to September had remained
conservative, with assets allocated to bonds, and a decline in the ratio of
assets in domestic stocks and foreign securities.
Although the top eight life assurance companies, the leading institutional
investors, saw a 2.4 per cent rise in their combined unrealised gains on
assets, analysts reckoned that their ability sharply to increase high risk
investments remained limited.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 11.40 at 1,502.82, while
the Nikkei 300 moved ahead 2.48 to 276.64. Rising issues outpaced declines
by 655 to 299, with 210 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
was just 0.19 firmer at 1,238.06.
Traders said worries over the December 9 futures settlement were declining
as an increasing number of investors were rolling over their positions into
the March contract.
Steel companies were actively traded. Sumitomo Metal Industries, the busiest
issue of the day, dipped Y3 to Y320 on selling by overseas investors, while
Nippon Steel put on Y3 at Y379. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries improved Y3 to
Y729 in spite of selling by foreigners.
Nippon Soda, a chemical company, appreciated Y7 to Y594 in active trading as
individual investors were encouraged by the company's glass which cleans
itself using ultraviolet rays from the sun.
Hoya, a contact lens maker, rose Y90 to Y2,570 on the liquid crystal display
theme, while Nippon Paint, which is developing liquid crystal colour
filters, climbed Y21 to Y700.
Japan Airlines, heavily sold on Monday on fears over its unrealised foreign
exchange losses, regained Y19 at Y700. Sanyo Electric was Y14 higher at Y577
on hopes of strong earnings. Toshiba ended Y8 up at Y691.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 87.51 to 20,898.23 in volume of 7.5m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, moved forward Y130 to Y5,400.
Roundup
The Pacific Basin markets were mixed yesterday.
SEOUL turned higher in cautious trading on the back of a strong rebound in
blue chips and steady bargain hunting after the recent declines.
The composite index improved 11.78 or 1.1 per cent to 1,081.26 amid hopes
that overseas demand for blue chips would pick up after the ceiling on
foreign ownership is raised tomorrow.
Korea Mobile Telecom and Samsung Electronics went limit up to Won129,400 and
Won523,000, gaining Won3,000 and Won12,000 respectively.
HONG KONG remained inhibited by the prospect of higher US interest rates,
the Hang Seng index closing 4.11 off at 8,658.26 after a day of narrow
trading. Turnover picked up to HKDollars 2.9bn from Monday's HKDollars
2.2bn.
Companies being removed today as constituents of the index were lower.
Jardine Matheson receded 50 cents to HKDollars 52.25, Jardine Strategic
HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 23.80, Lai Sun 15 cents to HKDollars 11 and
Winsor 10 cents to HKDollars 10.05.
Their replacements were mostly higher. China-related Guangdong Investment
gained 15 cents at HKDollars 4.50, Oriental Press put on 5 cents at
HKDollars 4.20 and Johnson Electric firmed 50 cents to HKDollars 20.30,
while Amoy was unchanged at HKDollars 7.85.
HSBC again dominated the most active list and put on 50 cents at HKDollars
86.50. Its Hang Seng Bank unit followed, adding 75 cents at HKDollars 58.50,
and HK Telecom was 10 cents higher at HKDollars 15.45 after rising 30 cents
on Monday.
TAIPEI drifted firmer in slow trade amid caution ahead of elections this
weekend. The weighted index gained 3.90 at 6,388.10, after a day's low of
6,355.08. Turnover amounted to TDollars 27.9bn.
Food shares saw the best gains, with President Enterprises strengthening
TDollars 2 to TDollars 57 on news that the Investment Commission had given
approval for seven foreign companies to invest Dollars 120.4m to buy 20 per
cent of its affiliate President Chain Store.
Financials also rose: Farmers Bank was up by the daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 51.
Slight profit-taking was seen in textiles and steels, while papers and
construction issues were also easier.
SYDNEY was weaker in good volume after October balance of payments data
showed a narrowing in the current account deficit.
The All Ordinaries index surrendered 20.3 or 1.06 per cent at 1,891.3, after
registering an intraday low of 1,884.2.
Stocks finished mostly lower, with resources issues taking the brunt of
selling pressure. Dealers said major mining shares were adversely affected
by falls in base metal prices on the London Metal Exchange on Monday. Golds
ended slightly softer after the bullion price weakened in New York.
Industrials also lost ground, with transport, media and diversified
industrial stocks slipping the most.
BANGKOK made headway, although profit-taking surfaced during the day. The
SET index finished 11.21 up at 1,353.34, having touched 1,357.52 at one
stage. Turnover was thin at Bt3.59bn.
The index fell back after opposition parties submitted a no-confidence
motion against a government minister and his deputy.
The banking sector was the most active, rising 1.2 per cent in Bt804.6m
turnover.
MANILA was given a boost by strength in the US. The composite index rose
12.20 to 2,691.19. Volume came to 7.8bn shares worth 6.08bn pesos. The
market is closed today for a national holiday.
Petron recouped Monday's decline to close 0.75 pesos better at 21.25 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was marginally softer in light trade, but with selective buying
by foreign brokers supporting the market in late trade. The composite index
ended 1.54 lower at 1,003.69 in volume of 90m shares.
KPJ Healthcare made its debut at MDollars 3.20 and finished at MDollars
5.75, against its offer price of MDollars 1.70.
WELLINGTON, after an early rally, slipped back on weakness in forestry
sector shares. The NZSE-40 capital index was finally 2.16 down at 2,004.65
after opening 11 points ahead.
Enerco moved up 5 cents to NZDollars 2.55 after selling its 20 per cent
stake in EnergyDirect to TransAlta Energy, of Canada, but EnergyDirect
closed 3 cents down at NZDollars 1.70 on concern over the fate of its merger
plans with Auckland-based Power New Zealand.

FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico gains 1.7%

<TEXT>
Equities advanced sharply in early trade, buoyed by an unexpected decline in
domestic interest rates. The IPC index moved ahead 43.11 or 1.7 per cent to
2,605.94.
The 28-day T-bill primary rate eased 10 basis points to 13.85 per cent in
the central bank's weekly auction.
Traders said that more foreign than domestic investors were behind the rise
and that gains by Telmex had been a key factor.
Telmex 'L' shares appreciated a further 2 per cent, while its ADRs on Wall
Street were Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 54 3/8 .
Argentina
Shares on the Buenos Aires stock exchange gained ground in active early
trading.
The Merval index was 14.62 or 3 per cent ahead at 500.48.
Traders attributed the jump to a technical rebound following a recent bear
run that brought the Merval to new lows for the year.
The telecommunications sector was among the biggest gainers, with Telefonica
climbing 3.1 per cent to 5.40 pesos and Telecom advancing 16 cents to 5.28
pesos.

gold bullion.
Traders said volumes had been low, indicating the lack of interest in the
market.
The firmer financial rand also impacted on rand prices of key stocks and
helped to slow trade.
The overall index shed 84 to 5,749.9, the industrial index was 47.4 down at
6,886.8 and the gold shares index lost 98.5 or 4.8 per cent at 1,957.5.
De Beers relinquished R2.25 at R91.25 in line with losses in New York
overnight, while Anglos dropped R4 to R228.
Vaal Reefs tumbled R14 to R365 and Kloof moved down R2.75 to R56.75.
Rusplats declined R2 to R109.50.
SAB weakened R2 to R96 and Sasol R2.25 to R31, but Engen rose 50 cents to
R33.75 and Hiveld R1 to R36.50.

FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volkswagen slips a further
3.5% in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer confidence data had a marked effect on late-closing bourses
across the Continent. The 'no' vote in Norway's EU referendum was already
largely discounted.
FRANKFURT weakened in slow trade, the DAX index losing 14.17 at 2,044.28. In
the Ibis the index fell to 2,036.24, pressured by the US data.
Volkswagen again came under selling pressure, dropping DM15.60 to DM425.60,
even though the vehicle manufacturer said that its worldwide sales had risen
by 5.5 per cent in October.
Smith New Court has turned positive on German retailers, arguing that while
1994 results were liable to be unexciting, a recovery in domestic
consumption in the second half of 1995 would trigger a rerating of the
sector. The broker noted that the sector had underperformed the market by
some 20 per cent since 1991.
'Our preference within the sector is to stay away from food retail (too
competitive) and department stores (declining market shares) and prefer
larger retail formats or specialist retailers which have further scope for
expansion or exhibit more cyclicality.'
In the sector yesterday, Asko rose DM10 to DM725, Douglas lost DM6 to DM409,
Karstadt put on DM0.60 to DM550 and Kaufhof added DM2 at DM41.
PARIS was also affected by the news from New York, and the CAC-40 index
dipped 12.41 to 1,939.97 in turnover of just under FFr3bn.
Renault eased FFr1 to FFr180 as some investors took profits following the
recent privat-isation. The government said the offer of shares to Renault
employees had been 95 per cent oversubscribed.
Cap Gemini Sogeti eased FFr8.30 to FFr180.90 following reports that
Daimler-Benz might reduce its stake.
MILAN was on hold, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's marathon session of
the cabinet, and the Comit index edged 0.25 lower to 626.96 in a second day
of very low volumes.
Attention continued to focus on Credito Italiano, L12 off at L1,560, as the
chairman met the head of the stock market regulator, Consob, amid mounting
speculation that Italiano was about to make an announcement over its bid for
control of Credito Romagnolo.
After the market closed, Italiano said details of its proposal would be
released once it had the go-ahead to proceed from the necessary authorities.
The Consob said Romagnolo's shares, suspended for the last two days, would
resume trading today.
Ferruzzi picked up L39 or 3.1 per cent to L1,294 amid rumours that Serafino,
the Ferruzzi family holding, might renounce some of the credits owed by
Ferruzzi.
AMSTERDAM could not maintain Monday's progress and the AEX index receded
1.70 to 406.74.
Unilever, up 90 cents to Fl 195.80, attracted a positive note from James
Capel following the company's recent third-quarter results. The broker
commented that 'a better than forecast underlying performance should offset
the likely currency negative, and we have retained our full-year forecast of
Fl 4.144bn net income'.
Nedlloyd firmed 40 cents to Fl 51.60 ahead of today's third-quarter results,
which are expected to show net profits of between Fl 30m to Fl 40m.
ZURICH edged higher in quiet trade, with the market supported by demand for
heavily weighted index stocks. The SMI index rose 5.3 to 2,584.7, with the
easier dollar and lower bond futures acting as restraining influences.
Roche certificates firmed SFr65 to SFr5,840 and Nestle added SFr9 at
SFr1,215. Both were said to be targets of large foreign buy orders. UBS
bearers continued to recoup some of their recent loss, rising SFr8 to
SFr1,138.
MADRID was lower across the board and the general index gave up 3.10 or 1
per cent to 299.76. Repsol fell Pta60 or 1.6 per cent to Pta3,775, still
suffering from reports earlier in the week that a Pta2 cut in petroleum
products prices was still being considered by the government.
Endesa ended Pta120 lower at Pta5,860 amid local press reports that the
state-run electric utility was a candidate in the possible purchase of a 20
per cent stake in Cepsa from Banco Central Hispano.
OSLO finished slightly higher after the country voted against joining the
European Union in Monday's referendum. The All-share index gained 2.0 at
610.6 in brisk turnover of NKr479m, after dropping early in the day in
immediate reaction to the vote.
Analysts noted that interest rates slipped and the crown firmed against
European currencies as uncertainties vanished and the government said it
would maintain a tight economic policy.
A 'no' note had been largely factored into the market as opinion polls in
recent months had shown EU opponents leading comfortably, with supporters
apparently gaining ground only over the last week.
Orkla 'B' rose NKr12.50 to NKr205 and the 'A' NKr11 to NKr215. The company
was among the few blue chips to campaign against EU membership, because the
heavily protected domestic food and drink market had a particular importance
for it.
STOCKHOLM was mixed, having tried to resist rising debt market yields and a
fall by Ericsson in late trading. The Affarsvarlden index finished just 1.4
ahead at 1,504.2.
A SKr7.50 fall to SKr417.50 in Ericsson 'B' was attributed to the
cancellation of a SKr100m contract to supply a high capacity optical fibre
transmission network.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Sterling stays firm after predictable UK
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling traded steadily on the foreign exchanges yesterday after a UK
Budget in line with market expectations, writes Philip Gawith.
Analysts said the Budget, which was described as cautious and prudent,
provided a marginal boost to sterling. The pound was trading around DM2.4535
at 17.30 GMT, compared to DM2.4470 before the Budget. It ended on Monday at
DM2.4453.
The dollar was firmer on the expectation of higher US interest rates, after
consumer confidence rose to 101.3 in November, up from 89.1 in October, and
the highest level since July 1990. It finished in London at DM1.5612, but
later rose to DM1.57, compared to Monday's close of DM1.5643. It ended New
York trading at DM1.5701 and Y98.975.
Earlier in the day the market had focused on Norway, with the initial
response to the referendum vote against joining the European Union positive.
After touching a low of NKr4.3850 per D-Mark, from NKr4.36 at Monday's
close, it recovered to end at NKr4.356.
The krone's upward move was a function of the removal of political
uncertainty, and a belief that in the short term a No vote could actually
improve the state of Norway's public finances.
Sterling firmed slightly during Asian trading, after the successful passage
of the controversial EU finance bill, but then traded steadily until the
time of the UK Budget.
Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, described the
Budget as 'reasonably positive' for sterling, but added that 'an awful lot
of it has already been discounted'.
Likely to be more important, he said, was the forthcoming parliamentary vote
on VAT, where the possibility of a government defeat will reignite political
uncertainty, and the December monthly monetary meeting. 'The base rate
outlook will still be the most important factor,' added Mr Griggs.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said the
chancellor's commitment in the Budget to a low inflation strategy had
'clearly heightened expectations of an early interest rate rise'. He
predicted a 50 basis-point increase, around the December 7 meeting, and said
this would support sterling. UK core inflation remains around the lowest in
Europe, so raising interest rates would be favourably interpreted as a
pre-emptive strike against inflation.
Mr Persaud further added that he expected sterling to rise to DM2.46, 'but a
move beyond that depends on a further monetary tightening'.
Commenting on the Norwegian EU referendum, Mr Kjell Tangen, head of trading
at Christiana Bank in Oslo, stressed that the market's response was a short
term one, 'because the short term outlook is even better with a No than a
Yes'.
This was a function of a large issue of political uncertainty being removed
from the market. Also, the government had given indications ahead of the day
that a No vote might require it to make enhanced effects at reducing the
budget deficit. Some traders also felt that not being an EU member would
mean Norway avoided a net drain of finance.
Mr Tangen said that in the short term Norway's good economic fundamentals -
better external balances, an improving budget deficit and low inflation -
might support the krone. Good economic prospects were also seen as likely to
attract inflows of foreign capital, supporting the krone.
For investors to be convinced that this was sustainable, though, would
require Norway to develop more of a track record of economic probity, said
Mr Tangen.
In the longer term, he said, it was more difficult to assess the economic
impact of staying outside the EU.
Mr John Torklet, senior currency analyst at Den Norske bank in Oslo, said
one factor behind the currency optimism was the expectation that interest
rates would fall. He predicted that Mrs Gro Harlem Bruntland, the prime
minister, would anyway 'succeed in conducting a typical EU economic policy'.
One factor which may cause the krone to weaken in the months ahead will be
the narrowing interest rate differential with Germany. Currently around 175
basis points, in Norway's favour, Mr Torklet predicts that this could shrink
to 75 basis points as Norwegian rates fall.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan sets out its stall for
oil investment - Efforts to present a more welcoming aspect to foreign
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan will try to attract new British investments in the petroleum sector
this week, stressing the benefits to investors of the country's recent
reforms.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, opens a Pakistan investment
conference in London today at which investors in various sectors, including
petroleum, will be urged to step forward with new investment plans.
Among the important developments in the petroleum sector this year, the
government has committed itself to processing all requests for exploration
from foreign companies within three months. Previously it could take more
than two years before a company was granted an exploration licence. Foreign
investors have also been assured full freedom to repatriate capital and
profits, and will be allowed full ownership of local companies.
Pakistan has an important stake in the success of this effort, in particular
for the improvement of its balance of trade. Last year, the country imported
oil worth over USDollars 1.8bn, about a sixth of its total import bill. It
requires up to 280,000 barrels of oil a day but produces just under 60,000.
Aside from encouraging investors to become more active in exploration, new
agreements have been signed recently for the setting up of six new oil
refineries. At present Pakistan has capacity to refine up to 140,000 barrels
a day at three plants. These plants, however, are in need of large scale
repairs and modernisation, senior officials say.
The government estimates that it will receive investments worth over Dollars
1.9bn for oil refineries from private investors by the end of this decade.
Its optimism over the success of its effort is based largely on estimates of
over 197m barrels of crude oil in reserves. These are mainly located in the
south-western province of Baluchistan and the southern province of Sindh.
'We hope to further accelerate these activities,' says Mr Anwar Saifullah
Khan, minister for petroleum and natural resources. 'We take weeks in taking
a decision rather than years,' he says, adding that the new measures have
given fresh encouragement to oil companies.
Mr Khan is encouraged by recent agreements with Occidental Petroleum and
Union Texas to drill more exploratory wells. He expects Shell and Omani oil
company also to be given exploration licences and claims that in addition to
the 18 foreign oil companies doing business in Pakistan, at least 30 more
have shown an interest in examining the possibilities of exploratory work.
The petroleum minister is convinced that developments in this sector will be
crucial for the success of the country's effort to set up new power
generation plants, especially oil-fired thermal units. 'With the setting up
of all these thermal units, you'll need a lot of oil' he says.
Despite the government's commitment, some analysts are still nervous over
possible setbacks. Concern is running high that law and order problems could
affect the work of oil companies, especially in remote parts of Sindh and
Baluchistan. These could include armed robberies and demands for huge
pay-offs from tribal chiefs before allowing exploration work to begin.
Recent reports that the government of Baluchistan and the federal government
in Islamabad have still not agreed on important issues, such as the division
of royalties, has added to such concerns. Mr Khan denies, however, that
there are any disagreements.
Nevertheless, Mr Wazir Ahmed Jogezai, a former deputy speaker of the
parliament in Islamabad and a politician from Baluchistan, warns that such
'bottlenecks' must be removed before the new incentives can succeed. 'The
foreign investor has got to be given an assured law and order situation.
What would you do in the wilderness of Baluchistan if you have an area and
you can't really get in there?' he asks.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian alumina refinery planned
to produce 1m tonnes a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An USDollars 800m alumina refinery is to be built in India to produce 1m
tonnes a year of the essential raw material for aluminium production.
Output should begin at the turn of the century, a time when a serious
shortage of alumina 'is a strong possibility', according to the CRU
International consultancy group.
The Indian plant will be located in the eastern state of Orissa, a region
with plentiful reserves of bauxite, the raw material for alumina.
At present ownership of the project is equally shared by Indian Aluminium
Company (Indal), Tata Industries of India and Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk
Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group. Indal, in turn, is 40 per cent
owned by Alcan of Canada. The partners plan to widen the ownership by
arranging a stock market floatation for Utkal Alumina International, set up
to operate the plant. Utkal will use technology supplied by Alcan and
Alusuisse.
A Dollars 5m feasibility study suggested that the refinery could produce
superior grade alumina for Dollars 80 a tonne compared with the present
world average of Dollars 142.
Most of the output will be exported, mainly to smelters in the Middle East
and North America.
Meanwhile, CRU, in its latest five-year outlook for alumina, suggests that
construction must start on four or five big new projects in the second half
of the 1990s to avoid capacity shortages.
However, in the short term, the outlook for alumina prices is not good. A
price recovery from present depressed levels might not begin for up to 12
months, says CRU.
There are no signs that those companies that temporarily shut down primary
aluminium smelting capacity following the international trade agreement
early this year are gearing up for early re-starts. Fixed prices for
one-year alumina contracts have drifted down to Dollars 125 to Dollars 135 a
tonne for 1995 delivery, while spot prices range between Dollars 110 and
Dollars 120 fob, depending on origin.
But CRU is forecasting strong demand growth for alumina - by 4 per cent a
year starting in 1996 to the year 2000, compared with only a 1 per cent
increase in refining capacity. It says this will lift alumina prices above
Dollars 300 a tonne within three to four years.
London Metal Exchange aluminium prices yesterday recovered Monday's losses,
the three months position closing Dollars 39.50 up at Dollars 1,889.50 a
tonne.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agricultural research group
tackles financial crisis - Problems caused by 'a false complacency about
food security'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A financial crisis affecting a world-wide network of 17 agricultural
research centres is being tackled by plans to make investment in research
more attractive to governments and international banks.
The centres are funded by the Washington-based Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research, which is made up of over 40 aid
organisations and private sector investors. Most of the funds come from aid
budgets; Britain last year contributed Dollars 9.5m.
The 17 centres, which include the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Centre in Mexico and the International Rice Research Institute in the
Philippines, account for only 4 per cent of worldwide spending on
agricultural research. But they have developed most of the high-yielding
varieties of rice, maize and wheat, and are widely regarded as having an
influence on national research and agricultural development much greater
than their size would suggest.
In the past few years they have changed from being centres concerned with
increasing food output at virtually any cost and are now stressing the
protection of the environment and the sustainable increase of food output.
But funds for agricultural research have declined in recent years, in line
with cuts in aid from Western countries. In May this year, the World Bank,
the CGIAR's largest donor, offered extra funds for 1994 and 1995 which
reversed the decline, giving the centres about Dollars 270m a year, in both
years. This is Dollars 40m a year higher than seemed likely six months ago,
when many of the centres were making cuts.
At the CGIAR's recent annual meeting in Washington the group's chairman,
World Bank Vice-President Mr Ismail Serageldin, pointed to radical changes
that were needed for the centres to secure funding beyond next year.
Mr Serageldin said the centres had 'a tremendous success record', but had
suffered 'from the general reduction of attention to agriculture and
agricultural research everywhere in the world. There is, in our judgment,
But he said the financial crisis that had affected the centres had 'unmasked
some problems about how decision making had been done'.
At present, donors give the centres both 'core funding' for their general
work and money for specific programmes. In future, donors will be able to
chose to fund a project or part-project, but will have to build in a certain
amount for overheads.
'It would then be clear where the money has come from, and where it's going,
and this would be more popular with donors,' said Prof Eric Roberts of
Reading University, who is chairman of the board of the International Crops
Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India.
Under the revamped system, the international centres will also try to forge
stronger links with national agricultural programmes.
The centres have attracted criticism for not getting the results of their
research into farmers hands. Prof Roberts said that the centres would now be
trying to attract on to their boards more representatives of national
research programmes.
A new research agenda is needed, said Mr Serageldin, 'to address the
problems of tomorrow. The changes we are making are to enable them (the
centres) to be even more effective'. The centres are broadening their work
to take entire farming systems, the environment and population pressures
into account, he said 'but they are not abandoning the effort to consolidate
the gains of the past as regards production'.
The CGIAR network will be streamlined at the start of 1995 when two
international livestock centres, in Ethiopia and Kenya, will integrate their
activities into a new body, the International Livestock Research Institute,
based in Nairobi.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World wheat production estimate
reduced further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's world wheat production estimate has been revised down again to
526m tonnes - 32m tonnes below last year - with stocks estimated to be at
their lowest level for 15 years, the International Wheat Council said
yesterday.
It put global wheat output 4m tonnes lower than last month's estimate, the
latest in a steady downgrading since the start of the year, when it forecast
a crop of 562m tonnes.
The further fall is blamed mainly on reduced output in Russia and Ukraine.
The Russian harvest is estimated to be 7.6m tonnes lower than last year's at
35.9m tonnes. The planted area was down because of a chronic shortage of
inputs, and harvesting was hampered by poor weather in central Russia and
the Urals. Early frosts may have meant that 6 per cent of the crop was not
harvested.
In Ukraine, the harvest is put at 15.3m tonnes, down 5.7m tonnes from last
year, because of an unusually hot summer.
World wheat stocks are 2m tonnes lower than last month's estimate at 104m
tonnes, the smallest figure since 1979-80.
However, overall grain production for the year is estimated to be 42m tonnes
higher than in 1993 at 1.39bn tonnes because of an increase in coarse grain
production, mainly in the US. Output of coarse grains is put at 864m tonnes
 -up 10m tonnes on last month's forecast and 74m tonnes higher than in 1993.
The estimate for the record US maize crop has been raised again to 254.3m
tonnes, up 93.1m on last year. Coarse grain crops were also bigger in
central Europe and the Balkans, India and Morocco.
The IWC tentatively expects wheat production to recover to 560m tonnes next
year. Cereal growers in the European Union and the US have responded to
higher prices resulting from tightening supplies and declining stocks, it
says.
But it warns that continued economic problems in central Europe, the Balkans
and much of the former Soviet Union could inhibit growth in output.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Budget package fails to provide support
for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds fell by more than  1/2 point yesterday as Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, presented his 1995-96 Budget.
A heavy drag on gilts came from US Treasuries which fell steeply on a sharp
rise in a consumer confidence index there.
However, the chancellor's downward revision of the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) for the current financial year to Pounds 34.5bn, from the
earlier estimate of Pounds 36bn, also damped market sentiment. 'This was a
bit of a disappointment. We had been hoping for Pounds 30bn,' said Mr Huw
Roberts at NatWest Markets.
The Budget contained some market-friendly news, including plans to set up an
open market for gilt sale and repurchase agreements (repos) and a downward
revision of the PSBR in 1995-96 to Pounds 21.5bn from the current estimate
of Pounds 28bn. The PSBR was set at Pounds 13bn for 1996-97 and at Pounds
5bn for 1997-98, down from original estimates for Pounds 21bn and Pounds
12bn respectively. These forecasts gave gilts a small lift in after-hours
dealings.
However, dealers said so much good news had been discounted in the run-up to
the Budget that the actual package provided no support. 'The market held in
very well during the morning on hopes for a good Budget, but when it turned
out to contain few positive surprises, weakness in the other markets pulled
gilts lower,' said one dealer. He also said that supply, in the form of taps
of existing bonds being sold by the Bank of England and next week's gilt
auction, was weighing on gilts.
The December long gilt futures contract on Liffe was down  21/32 at 102
27/32 .
Fresh indications that the US economy has a full head of steam, in spite of
efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow it, pushed down Treasury prices
yesterday.
At the close the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/16 at 93
15/16 ,yielding 8.032 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/8 at 99 21/32 , yielding 7.421 per cent.
A report from the Conference Board that consumer confidence for November hit
101.3 - a four-year high - sent the price of the 30-year Treasury down
nearly three-quarter points early in the afternoon. The price decrease drove
the yield higher than 8 per cent for the first time in three sessions.
On Monday the long-bond yield touched 8 per cent briefly, but did not hold
on to that level. Economists had expected consumer confidence to be closer
to 88 per cent.
Trading was extremely slow in the afternoon as investors waited for a host
of economic figures due later this week.
Some economists expressed scepticism about the consumer confidence figures,
but those comments did nothing to calm investor fears that the Fed has not
done enough to rein in inflationary pressures despite increasing interest
rates six times this year.
Early reports indicate that retail sales will be strong this holiday season,
and several recent reports have shown underlying strength in the economy.
Earlier this month, the Fed reported that the US economy was using 84.9 per
cent of its capital stock for the production of goods, the highest level
since February 1980.
Thus, economists fear that even though some figures, such as the producer
price index, show the economy to be slowing, there is substantial pressure
at points in the economy that could lead to inflation in the near future.
Also upsetting the market were comments by two Fed governors who would not
rule out another interest rate increase in the near-term if there were
continued signs of inflation.
Mr John Laware and Mr Alan Blinder told Market News Service that, despite
some signs of slowing, they see the economy as quite strong and would act to
stem that if trends continue.
Although a further interest rate increase would benefit bonds by slowing the
economy, interest rate instability generally keeps investors out of the
market because of its tendency to undermine prices.
German government bonds fell yesterday, pulled down by US Treasuries, and
the December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 90.88, down 0.38.
Norwegian bonds reacted positively to the referendum rejection of European
Union membership. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell from 8.39 to
8.26 per cent.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Dealers in Russian trading
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International debt dealers are to form a trade association as a means of
bringing greater order and stability to the Russian dollar-denominated bond
market.
Their initiative, which is linked to the broader New York-based Emerging
Markets Traders Association, follows recent volatility in the market for
so-called 'Minfin bonds', Dollars 7.9bn of which were issued by Russia's
ministry of finance in May 1993.
'All we are trying to do is make it more investor friendly,' said Mr Peter
Bartlett, vice-president of France's Banque Indosuez, which co-sponsored a
conference on the market earlier this week.
Banque Indosuez, together with other institutions - including two which
co-sponsored the conference, BCEN-Eurobank and the US-based New Alliance
Corp - are backing the trading association.
Daily volumes rose earlier this year to as much as Dollars 100m a day - with
the sharp decline in the rouble in early October leading to a surge in
activity, putting heavy pressure on the trading infrastructure.
More recently volumes have dipped to as little as Dollars 15m a day,
partially reflecting a more general lack of enthusiasm for emerging market
debt.
Mr Bartlett insisted that the market had been workable and efficient but
that it was now necessary to bring greater order by formalising practices.
'High volumes mean that the settlement system began to show signs of
fatigue,' said Mr Bartlett.
Settlement of trades can also be awkward, as unlike many hard currency bonds
issued from emerging economies, the Russian bonds must be held and
transferred within Russia.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Strong retail demand for Dollars 300m
Walt Disney deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney made a rare and successful appearance in a busy eurobond market
yesterday, launching a Dollars 300m offering of three-year bonds which met
strong demand from European retail investors.
The issue, which was increased from Dollars 250m, was priced to yield 25
basis points over US Treasuries and offered a coupon of 8 per cent.
Lead manager Merrill Lynch said the bonds were bought by Benelux and Swiss
banks in particular and by some European institutional investors. However,
syndicate officials said they expected the bonds to end up in the hands of
European retail investors.
'It is the 8 per cent coupon that is driving the strength of retail demand
on this deal, even though the spread is aggressive,' an official at Merrill
Lynch said.
'The success of this issue shows that the retail market is currently in a
very healthy state,' he added.
Walt Disney launched a Y30bn offering in the Samurai market earlier this
year, he added.
With the sterling market in effect closed for the UK Budget, most eurobond
issuance yesterday was in dollar-denominated bonds.
The Republic of Austria launched a Dollars 400m offering of 10-year bonds
priced to yield 25 basis points over US Treasuries. Lead manager JP Morgan
said the issue met demand from institutional investors in Asia, the Middle
East and Europe.
Retail investors provided some demand, 'although they are still focused on
the two to five-year area,' a syndicate official said.
'Since the (US Federal Reserve) raised interest rates, there has been a
better bid in the 10-year sector,' a trader said. 'The rise was seen to be
anti-inflationary, which boosted the long-end of the euromarket. There is
now much more institutional money coming back into the 10-year area.'
Also in the dollar sector, the European Investment Bank launched its
expected two-tranche offering of five- and 10-year bonds.
The Dollars 300m tranche of five-year paper was priced to yield 7 basis
points over US Treasuries; the spread on the Dollars 300m tranche of 10-year
paper was 15 basis points over US Treasuries.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said volatility in the US Treasury market
hampered initial placement of the bonds but it expected the offering to be
placed with investors over the coming days.
The five-year tranche was likely to be placed with retail investors in
Switzerland, Belgium and Asia, while the 10-year tranche would go to
institutional investors in the UK and Japan, Morgan Stanley said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Hillsdown Holdings steps up
size of syndicated loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings, the UK food manufacturing group, is increasing the size
of a syndicated loan arranged by Kleinwort Benson and Barclays from Pounds
600m to Pounds 700m due to demand from participating banks, Kleinwort Benson
said yesterday. The loan is expected to be signed on December 9.
The loan is to refinance Hillsdown's existing Pounds 275m loan, launched in
1992, at 45 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). It
also replaces a CDollars 120m facility launched in 1991.
The facility fees on the deal are 12 1/2 basis points for the first five
years and 15 basis points for years six and seven. The margin on the deal is
15 basis points over Libor for the first five years and 17 1/2 basis points
for the remaining two.
Finnish Export Credit, the state-owned export-financing vehicle, has
launched a Dollars 180m three-year loan arranged by Chemical Bank. The
revolving credit is priced at 12.5 basis points over Libor and replaces a
Dollars 100m credit facility signed in January 1993 at a price of 55 basis
points over Libor.
Volvo, the Swedish motor group, has launched a Dollars 750m seven-year loan,
arranged by Enskilda Corporate and Svenska Handelsbanken. The facility is
priced at 15 basis points over Libor for years one to five and 20 points
over Libor for years six and seven.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer to continue property
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Disgruntled shareholders at Coles Myer's annual meeting yesterday were told
by the Australian retailer's chairman that the company would continue to
review its property holdings to improve earnings.
Mr Solomon Lew told the Melbourne meeting that the yield on commercial
property was only about 7 per cent, excluding capital gains, and that it did
not add to earnings because it went directly to reserves. By comparison, the
return on retail investments was about 18 per cent.
The statement followed Monday's announcement that the group had sold
ADollars 500m (USDollars 382m) worth of retail property. Mr Lew confirmed
that the proceeds would fund the ADollars 1.26bn buy-back of the more than
21 per cent of Coles' issued capital owned by Kmart of the US. 'Since these
proceeds were not expected, or indeed needed, to fund our ambitious capital
expenditure programme, the company will have the option to use these funds
to reduce debt incurred in the Kmart buy-back - should it be deemed
desirable to do so,' he said.
Mr Lew faced questions about earnings and dividend performance. The
questions included the company's performance compared with Woolworth;
executive salaries; possible conflicts of interest arising from
director-supplied goods; and the Kmart buy-back. Organised shareholders,
represented by the Australian Shareholders' Association, queried the level
of goods supplied to Coles by companies controlled by Mr Lew and another
director, Mr Lindsay Fox.
The association's Mr Julian Stock said that goods bought from Mr Lew's
companies rose 44 per cent over the last three years while the value of
transport services provided by Mr Fox's companies have increased by 64 per
cent.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: 'Worst is over' for Japanese
brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The long slide in the fortunes of the Big Four Japanese securities companies
is over, according to a report to be published later this week by Moody's,
the US credit-rating agency. But growing competition, a lack of
diversification by the brokers and a failure to cut costs sufficiently
sharply will continue to present difficulties in the next few years, the
agency said yesterday.
'The worst is over' for Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko, Moody's said, and
the ratings outlook is essentially stable. 'The industry environment has not
deteriorated over the past two years, but it has not improved either. Nor do
we expect it to recover to anywhere near the levels experienced in the late
1980s,' said Ms Deborah Kinzer, a Moody's vice-president.
In 1989, the favourable operating environment enabled the brokers to enjoy
ratings on unsecured debt as high as AAA, the highest, but the agency
currently rates debt at the top-ranked broker, Nomura, at just A1.
In that five-year period, the volume of equity trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the brokers' core business, has fallen by more than two-thirds and
the decline has hurt firms' earnings. The four brokers' combined pre-tax
profits have collapsed by more than 80 per cent since 1990.
The principal threat to the Big Four in the next few years is the arrival of
the subsidiaries of Japan's leading banks into the securities market. Banks
are now permitted to issue and sell bonds - an activity which has been one
of the few bright spots in the securities market in recent years. They have
already begun to erode the dominance of the leading brokers, and are
expected to take an even larger slice of the business in the years ahead.
Moody's also says the brokers have not yet adjusted to the decline in share
trading volumes by cutting their costs. Personnel costs and staff numbers
peaked about three years ago, but have fallen only slightly since then,
returning to the levels of 1989, a year when equity trading volumes were
three times their current level.
The report says the Big Four also face risks associated with weak affiliates
and closely-related companies. However, the agency points out that the
brokers are all well-capitalised. 'In fact we view capital as their major
credit-quality strength,' said Ms Kinzer.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Anglo American rises to R794m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A broadly-based improvement in both trading and investment income helped
Anglo American Corporation, the world's biggest gold producer, to announce a
27 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R794m (Dollars 189m) for
the six months to September, up from R629m a year earlier.
Pre-tax profits rose 29 per cent to R1.23bn from R959m and earnings per
share to 341 cents from 270 cents.
The interim dividend was increased to 110 cents from 95 cents previously.
Investment income remained the biggest contributor to earnings, rising 20
per cent to R828m as the company benefited from higher dividends from mining
financial and gold interests. At the same time, an improved export
performance and good working cost containment in coal mining subsidiary
Amcoal helped trading income to improve by 24 per cent to R265m from R201m.
The company greatly improved its surplus on the realisation of investments
to R149m, up 96 per cent from last year. This was a result of the purchase
of the group's interest in Argus Newspapers by Irish publisher Mr Tony
O'Reilly and the sale of some gold holdings.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was greatly encouraged by the
economic upturn in the South African economy, noting it was driven by
investment rather than consumption for the first time in decades, and
expected the company to continue its improved performance over the next six
months.
However, he warned that labour regulations which prevented work on mines on
Sundays and granted excessive public holidays could severely damage the
industry's international competitiveness.
'If South Africa is to be internationally competitive, it cannot at this
stage of its development adopt the labour practices of the world's richest
and most productive countries,' he said.

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, is to invest Y100bn (Dollars 1.01bn) in
southern Japan to mass-produce 256-megabit dynamic random access memory
chips (D-Rams).
The move, the third substantial semiconductor capital investment by the
company, strengthens NEC's bid to beat the competition in the race to
dominate the market for future generation D-Rams.
In the past three months, NEC has announced an Dollars 800m investment in
Scotland to manufacture 64-megabit D-Rams and a Dollars 50m expansion at its
Roseville plant in the US.
The latest announcement comes as NEC unveiled a new facility built at a cost
of Y950bn at its plant in Kyushu, the southern Japanese island.
The new investment will expand production at Kyushu and is expected to
result in the most advanced facility in the world, which will start
mass-producing 256-megabit D-Rams by 1997.
These memory chips are at the leading edge of semiconductor technology,
which will only become widely used towards the end of the decade.
The new facility will have the capacity to produce 30,000 8-inch diameter
silicon wafers per month at the smallest width of circuitry possible, of
0.25 microns.
NEC's aggressive move into the higher end of the market reflects its need,
which is shared by other Japanese manufacturers, to keep moving on to
advanced technologies to maintain its position in the highly competitive
semiconductor market.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thailand PVC venture plans to
raise Bt1.3bn

<TEXT>
Vinythai, the Thai polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joint venture controlled by
Solvay of Belgium and Thailand's Charoen Pokphand group, is planning to
raise about Bt1.3bn (Dollars 52m) with a public flotation of one-sixth of
its shares on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
Mr Thada Savetsila, a senior Vinythai executive responsible for marketing
and sales, said the main reason for this public offering by a Thai
petrochemical company was to refinance Vinythai's domestic debt.
Some of the proceeds will also be used to fund Vinythai's Dollars 200m
second phase. This will produce chlorine and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), a
raw material for PVC, and should be completed by the end of next year. VCM
is currently imported.
Vinythai says its Dollars 300m first phase, completed two years ago,
produces 150,000 tonnes of PVC a year and has a Thai market share of 38 per
cent.
Shares are being sold at about Bt30 to Bt35 each. Some 75 per cent will be
reserved for Thai buyers and the remainder for foreign investors. The
company is publicising the offer this week with a roadshow in Hong Kong and
Singapore. Baring Brothers is international leader manager.
Among the lenders to Vinythai is the International Finance Corporation, the
private sector funding arm of the World Bank.

A much lower provision for depreciation following changes in accounting
procedures has helped the Steel Authority of India, India's biggest producer
of steel, to register a five-fold increase in net profit to Rs3.53bn
(Dollars 112.5m) for the six months to November 30.
Gross profit rose to Rs6.11bn from Rs4.63bn, on sales up to Rs61.19bn from
Rs51bn a year earlier.
Mr MRR Nair, the chairman, said that SAIL had also benefited from 'an
all-round reduction in costs, changes in the product mix and higher sales'.
Interest and finance charges fell to Rs3.53bn from Rs3.83bn.
SAIL and other Indian steel producers have been able to raise prices as
demand has strengthened, but Mr Nair said that much of this additional
revenue had been swallowed up by dearer fuel and freight.
A SAIL spokesman said: 'The richer bottom line is due to the improved
operational efficiency and a higher degree of value addition.'
The company's income rose to Rs61.19bn from Rs51bn.
Tata Chemicals, part of the Bombay-based Tata conglomerate, India's largest
business house, yesterday announced an increase of 18.5 per cent in net
profits to Rs1.04bn for the half-year to end-September, writes Shiraz Sidhva
in New Delhi.
The company, which is the country's largest producer of soda ash and
manufactures cement, detergents and fertilisers, reported a rise in net
sales to Rs2.63bn from Rs2.35bn in the corresponding period last year.
Gross profits increased to Rs1.15bn from Rs1bn last year. Interest and
depreciation fell to Rs261.3m from Rs288m, and to Rs105.6m from Rs117.8m
respectively. There was no tax liability.

issue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank in which Hill Samuel of the
UK is the largest minority shareholder, is in discussions with shareholders
over a possible stock market flotation. A decision will be taken next year.
'We are in the process of discussions with a number of our shareholders but
no decision has yet been made,' said Mr David Clarke, chairman, in Melbourne
yesterday. The bank is owned by more than 40 institutions, although
management and staff also have a significant minority interest.
Mr Clarke's comments came as Macquarie unveiled a sharp drop in profits
before tax for the six months to end-September to ADollars 34.5m (USDollars
26.3m) from ADollars 43.5m. A significantly lower tax charge of ADollars
1.3m against ADollars 12.3m left after-tax profits at ADollars 33.2m, up
from ADollars 31.2m in the same period of 1993 - 94.
Macquarie said the fall in pre-tax profits was due to the tougher conditions
faced by its securities businesses - declining prices, less volatility and
smaller trading volumes. It said the operations remained in the black but
profits were modest.
Elsewhere, the bank said that there were 'strong earnings contributions'
from the non-securities businesses. In the corporate banking group, loan
loss provisions were negligible, and offset by write-backs of previous loan
losses.

Calgary-based Ranger Oil has agreed to sell its 10 per cent stake in an
undeveloped block in the central North Sea to Shell UK and Esso Exploration
for about USDollars 42.5m, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The block, known as 29/5b, contains the Franklin gas and condensates field
and part of the Elgin field due east of Aberdeen, Scotland.
Mr Fred Dyment, Ranger's chief executive, said the company was concentrating
on projects which could be developed within the next five years with 'an
attractive balance of risk and reward'.
Proceeds will be reinvested in Ranger's exploration and development
programmes, which are centred on western Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and the
North Sea.
However, changes in UK tax laws and the decline in world oil prices have
made North Sea projects less attractive in the past 18 months.

Net profit for Thai Airways International surged 206 per cent in the year
ending on September 30, climbing to Bt3.117bn (Dollars 124.5m) from
Bt1.02bn, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The national carrier's
president, Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, said the improved profits showed that a
campaign to improve efficiency was starting to bite.
Earnings per share rose from Bt0.73 to Bt2.23. Mr Thamnoon admitted that
Bt792m of that profit was derived by recognising discounts on aircraft
purchases as income, although he said this widely-criticised method of
boosting profits would not be used again.
He said next year's profits would not suffer because the company had decided
to extend the depreciation period on new aircraft from 12 to 14 years. This
'almost cancels out' that loss of so-called commission fee income, he said.

Swedish automotive group AB Volvo said its aero-engines unit Volvo Aero
would participate in a new jet engine project by Germany's BMW Rolls-Royce
for the BR715 engine intended for use in passenger aircraft, Reuter reports.
'The project is reckoned to give Volvo Aero sales of about SKr1bn (Dollars
133m) at the same time as 100 new jobs are created. If the engine is
successful, sales might be twice that volume,' the Swedish company said.
It did not specify the time period over which it calculated the sales. Volvo
will make one component, the intermediate compressor case, for the BR715.
The BR715 is Volvo's first engine project since the 1980s, although between
the late 1970s and 1989 the company was involved in eight civilian engine
programmes.

<TEXT>
Union Pacific, one of the seven biggest US railways, yesterday appeared to
be heading for victory with its Dollars 3.2bn hostile takeover bid for Santa
Fe Pacific, another of the big seven railway companies, after the federal
regulatory authorities removed Santa Fe's main objection to the offer.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates mergers in the US
railway industry, said it accepted Union Pacific's plan to buy Santa Fe's
shares immediately and put them in an independent trust pending the ICC's
consideration of the takeover.
Earlier Santa Fe had rejected Union Pacific's bid, saying it was not clear
whether the ICC would accept the trust arrangement.
The ICC's decision puts Union Pacific at a significant advantage over
Burlington Northern, the friendly bidder for Santa Fe, because Burlington's
agreed Dollars 3bn bid would not take effect unless and until it had
received ICC clearance.

into restructuring

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Union, the struggling US supermarket chain, is being forced into
financial restructuring by a cash crisis. The company has long-term debt of
Dollars 1.4bn, mostly in the form of junk bonds.
Grand Union, which was the subject of a Dollars 1.2bn management buy-out
from the Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith six years ago, said cash
from operations would be insufficient to meet interest payments due early
next year.
Mr Gary Hirsch, chairman, said he expected the company to remain in
compliance with its debt agreements until January 15, by which time it would
propose a restructuring plan. Goldman Sachs and BT Securities have been
engaged as advisers.
Mr Hirsch said: 'We intend to move quickly in our discussions with our
debt-holders, but will endorse only a restructuring plan which provides for
continuing full and prompt payment to all of our trade creditors.'
Grand Union, which has sold a number of stores in recent years, still
operates 246 in six states in the north-west. In its second quarter to
October 15, it made profits of Dollars 17.7m before cash interest payments
of Dollars 31.7m.
There was a net loss of Dollars 35.9m against a loss of Dollars 20.2m the
year before, on sales down 1 per cent at Dollars 557m. Same store sales were
down 3.6 per cent.
The company said it was re-examining its capital expenditure programme and
had reduced its forward buy inventory. It said these actions could have an
adverse impact over time, but were necessary to maintain liquidity during
the restructuring process.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Argentina seen as an appetiser
for Brazil - Foreign entrants in Latin America's food sector are far from
sated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies are gorging themselves on Argentine food producers. The
purchase last week of Bagley, an Argentine biscuit maker, by French group
Danone, is the latest in a series of foreign forays into the Argentine food
sector.
'When foreign investors think of Argentina, they often think of food,' says
Mr Marcos Devoto, a Buenos Aires-based analyst with Santander Investment.
'It is considered the sexy sector.'
The Danone deal, in which France's biggest food group paid Dollars 240m for
a controlling stake in Bagley, comes only months after the Dollars 250m
purchase by RJR Nabisco, the US group, of 70 per cent of Terrabusi. Between
them, Bagley and Terrabusi control about half the Argentine biscuit market,
the tenth largest in the world.
In September, Cadbury Schweppes gobbled up 80 per cent of Stani, a
privately-owned Argentine confectionery group. It plans to use the local
company to distribute its own brands and as a foundation from which to
attack other regional markets, notably Brazil.
Among other important foreign entrants have been Kraft, part of the Philip
Morris group of the US, which bought ice-cream manufacturer La Montevideana;
Italy's Parmalat, which purchased La Vascongada; and Chile's Ambrosoli,
which took over the Bonafide confectionery and coffee company.
Nestle, which had also been wooing Bagley, has joined the fray with the
purchase of La Serenisima, a powdered-milk company, and two local cheese
producers.
Part of the strategy of such foreign newcomers has been to bring new
products as well as modern management and marketing techniques to local
companies that, until the start of the 1990s, had been accustomed to
operating in a cosy world behind high tariff walls.
Since the opening up of the market, Argentines have developed a taste for
high-quality, well-packaged items - triggering fierce competition to upgrade
local brands.
Recent arrivals such as Danone and Cadbury will join the fight for market
share in a sector that has 'exploded', says Mr Devoto. The end of
hyperinflation and the return of economic stability has revived purchasing
power - especially for relatively cheap items like food - leading, for
example, to growth of 125 per cent in biscuit and cracker sales since 1991.
Analysts say such rapid progress is tapering off, and that the sector will
now grow more in line with general economic expansion.
'The market has reached a point of equilibrium. One can't hope to continue
at those sort of rates,' says Mr Jorge Lorenzo, general manager at Bagley.
Mr Christopher Ecclestone, an analyst at brokers Interacciones, sees the
Danone deal as 'a breakthrough in Argentine mergers and acquisitions'.
Unlike other takeovers realised at bargain prices, he says, Danone's was
fully priced, showing that Argentina is now viewed as moving towards greater
economic maturity. The Dollars 240m price-tag valued Bagley at Dollars 4.80
a share, more than Dollars 1 above the price being fetched before the sale
was announced.
'The Danone deal is part of a major restructuring of the food sector which
will, as a result, become much more efficient,' says Mr Ecclestone. 'Bagley
had run out of things to do and was shaking at the prospect of Terrabusi
under Nabisco control. This was a deal made in heaven for Bagley's owners.'
Although the Argentine food market is big in its own right, the real prize
for foreign entrants may well be Brazil. From next January, Brazil's 150m
consumers will, in market terms, be integrated with Argentina's 31m as the
Mercusor customs union between these two countries - and Paraguay and
Uruguay - comes into effect.
Easier access to Brazil will be bolstered by the recent success of the Real
Plan which has, temporarily at least, strangled Brazilian hyperinflation and
created a consumer boom.
The plan has also fuelled further appreciation of Brazil's currency against
Argentina's dollar-pegged peso, making Argentine goods more competitive.
'Our feeling is that what is happening in Brazil today is what happened in
Argentina in 1991,' says Mr Devoto.
Argentina's climate provides it with several comparative advantages -
especially in wheat and dairy production - which should enable it to take
advantage of this situation, he says.
Mr Neil Perry, head of Latin American research at Baring Securities, agrees
that many foreign companies have come to Argentina with the Brazilian market
in mind. 'Danone clearly has not invested in Argentina for the Argentine
market alone. This will definitely be part of a Mercusor strategy.'
Danone already participates in the Brazilian biscuits and yoghurt sector,
leading to speculation that it will try to create synergies between
operations in both countries.
Mr Devoto believes the best-run Argentine companies will have great success
in Brazil. 'They have had three years of stability that have enabled them to
reach more sophisticated levels of production.'
As a result, they will be well placed to compete at the top end of the
market, he says.
'In this new, competitive environment, the Argentine companies that can
adapt will have very strong sales,' says Mr Devoto. 'But the ones that can't
will fall by the wayside.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: American General in talks to buy
Franklin Life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American General, the Houston-based life insurance group, is in talks to buy
Franklin Life, a subsidiary of American Brands, in a deal understood to be
valued at about Dollars 1.2bn.
The deal could be the first in a series of acquisitions by American General,
which last month outlined a plan to double its market capitalisation by the
end of the decade.
Mr Harold Hook, chairman, said the company, which is currently valued at
Dollars 6bn and has total assets of Dollars 44bn, planned 'two or three'
significant acquisitions.
American General is already locked in a hostile Dollars 2.6bn all-cash bid
for Unitrin, another US life company.
The proposed purchase price for Franklin - which neither company would
comment on, but which was confirmed by one person close to the deal - would
value Franklin at slightly less than its book value, which stood at Dollars
1.3bn at the end of 1993. At this level, the deal would be very attractive
to American General, said Ms Margaret Alexandre, an insurance analyst at
Salomon Brothers. Other insurance companies have generally been sold at
between 0.9 and 1.5 times book value.
Franklin, with assets at the end of 1993 of Dollars 7.1bn and operating
profits last year of Dollars 228m, is among the most profitable and
best-capitalised companies in the industry.
At nearly 13 per cent at the end of last year, its capital/assets ratio was
ahead of most competitors, according to Mr Patrick Finnegan of Moody's, the
US rating agency. The average ratio for the life companies tracked by
Moody's was 8.8 per cent.
If successful, American General is expected to use some of Franklin's extra
capital to reduce the purchase price of the deal. This echoes its plan to
take capital out of Unitrin, which is also heavily-capitalised by industry
standards.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hungary to privatise energy
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's new socialist-led government has announced sweeping privatisation
plans for its energy sector. They will transform the sector from full state
ownership to one of the most privately-controlled and liberalised in Europe
over the next three years.
The government is to sell off 100 per cent - minus one golden share - of its
five regional gas suppliers. It will also sell the non-nuclear electricity
generation and power supply companies held by MVM, the state electricity
monopoly.
MVM, which had a book value of Ft671.8bn (Dollars 6.67bn) at the end of
1993, will retain full control of the Paks nuclear plant and the national
grid, but will sell off 50 per cent, minus one vote, of its national
distribution centre.
In addition, it aims to sell off 30 per cent of MOL, the oil and gas
monopoly, to strategic investors and to reduce state ownership to 25 per
cent plus one vote.
The government's decision marks a significant change from the previous
conservative administration, which aimed to keep a majority stake in most
companies in the sector. The government hopes the sales will help it raise
between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn over the next year.
The gas companies, which together have registered capital of Ft44.5bn, are
expected to come up for sale first. The government, which is being advised
on the sale by UK merchant bank NM Rothschild, aims to sell 50 per cent,
plus one vote, to strategic investors via an international tender due to be
held early next year.
The remainder would later be sold to institutional and local investors and
floated on local and international stock exchanges.
A similar strategy is expected for MVM. The first tenders for stakes in six
regional power supply companies are likely in the first half of next year,
according to Schroders, the UK merchant bank advising on the sale.
While the decision to sell off majority stakes is expected to boost the
price of companies, the government has yet to agree on politically-sensitive
price increases in the sector.
Domestic electricity and gas prices are well below world levels and would
need to rise significantly to make the companies competitive and provide
funds for modernisation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seita, the French state-owned tobacco company which manufactures Gauloises
and Gitanes cigarettes, will be privatised next year, the government
announced yesterday, AP reports from Paris.
The sale will probably take place in the second half of the year 'or even
earlier if possible,' Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a government spokesman, said after
the weekly Cabinet meeting.
The cabinet adopted a draft law setting in motion several reforms necessary
before Seita can be brought to the market.
The decision followed an announcement by Mr Jose Rossi, the industry
minister, on Monday that the government intends to privatise the Renault
vehicle group in the second half of 1995.
Seita is the world's foremost manufacturer of dark-tobacco cigarettes and
one of the leading cigar manufacturers. It also makes pipe tobacco and
matches. Its total revenues in fiscal 1993 were Dollars 2.39bn.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rudloff group begins operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, former head of CS First Boston in London and one of
the founders of the euromarkets, said his new venture, MC Securities Geneve,
would begin operations tomorrow in Geneva.
It will conduct advisory work in Europe with a particular emphasis on the
former communist states of eastern Europe. It will be pitted against CS
First Boston, which dominates eastern Europe's securities business.
'We are no more vulnerable than before,' said Mr Ian Molson, co-head of
investment banking in Europe for CS First Boston. Mr Rudloff said of his
recruitment drive: 'CSFB is not the target company'.
However, the opening of MC group for business coincides with the disclosure
that another leading CS First Boston executive had joined the five or more
that have defected to their former manager and the MC group.
Mr Charles Harman, head of investment banking for Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary and other former Soviet satellites, will become head of
corporate finance at Mr Rudloff's new company, which is backed by Banque
Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium.
Mr Harman's move raises the prospect of further departures from CS First
Boston's east European operations.
Mr Zdenek Bakala, former head of CS First Boston in Prague has left to set
up Patria Finance, a domestic securities house, and Mr Rudloff said he and
some friends had backed the venture and taken a 25 per cent stake.
Other east European executives have strong personal loyalty to Mr Rudloff,
stemming from his role as the force behind CS First Boston's move into
eastern Europe.
The strategy was derided at the time, but executives say the region is
contributing significant profits in a year in which falling bond markets
have hit the international business.
Mr Rudloff was moved to CS Holding, CS First Boston's parent, and left the
group last year.
However, the most lucrative area of all for CS First Boston has been
securities trading in Russia, and Mr Boris Jordan, head of the Moscow
office, is not thought to be close to Mr Rudloff.
Further defections, if any, are only likely to take place after executives
receive their annual bonuses early next year. Mr Harman has forgone his
payment.
Mr Rudloff said he would hire about 150 staff over 15 months for offices in
Geneva, and in London, where MC is seeking the relevant licences.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fall in net financial income
hits Carlsberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carlsberg, the Danish brewery group, recorded a 10 per cent fall in group
net profits, to DKr885m (Dollars 145.1m) from DKr982m in the year ended
September 30.
The decline was attributed almost entirely to a fall in net financial
income, to DKr124m from DKr465m in the previous year. This reflected
unrealised losses on holdings of Danish bonds and shares.
The group proposes an unchanged dividend of DKr3 per share.
Operating profit rose 6 per cent - 'slightly more than anticipated' - to
DKr1.15bn from DKr1.08bn, on sales up to DKr16.91bn from DKr15.59bn.
The group said total beer sales (which include the Tuborg as well as the
Carlsberg brand) were up 10 per cent to 30m hectolitres, of which 82 per
cent was sold outside Denmark.
The market reacted by knocking DKr17 off the Carlsberg A share, which fell
to DKr263.
Brewing associates outside Denmark - including Carlsberg-Tetley in the UK,
and breweries in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Malawi, Malaysia and Hong Kong -
showed an overall improvement in operating results. Results from Danish
operations were unchanged.
The group anticipates 'a very high level of activity in years to come', as
it consolidates its position as a leading presence in international brewing.
Mr Poul Svanholm, group chief executive, said Carlsberg was still
considering acquiring breweries abroad, but had no immediate plans.
International sales are expected to continue to expand. Asian markets,
including China, are particularly solid for the group. However, it warns
that substantial investments will be required in marketing and distribution.
'These investments are not expected to have a positive effect on earnings
until a later stage,' it said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Babcock hopes to pay
dividend this year

<TEXT>
Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering group which has been battered by
the recession, reported preliminary gross profits of about DM90m (Dollars
57.7m), up from DM62m last year, and said it hoped to be able to pay a
dividend after a six-year break.
'We have a profit which is more or less the required size (for a dividend
payment),' Deutsche Babcock said after the company reported preliminary
figures for the year ending September 30.
Ordinary shareholders last received a dividend, of DM6.50, in 1988. A final
decision about this year's dividend depended on the agreement of the
supervisory board, the company said.
Fierce competition in all areas of its business - which range from
power-station turbines to environmental technology - had put the company
under intense pressure, the company said.
Turnover for the year was unchanged at DM8.2bn while new orders fell 9 per
cent to DM8.5bn, down from DM9.3bn.
German clients, who are still feeling the effects of the recession, ordered
16 per cent less during the review period.
However, the company was able to keep its foreign orders, which represent 45
per cent of new business, steady at DM3.8bn.
Deutsche Babcock said the new orders figures did not include a DM1.2bn
contract for a brown coal fired power station in eastern Germany where
planning approval has not yet been given.
Deutsche Babcock said it did not know when work would begin on the project
but said there was no risk that the project would not go ahead.
The company said it would be shedding a further 1,200 jobs over the coming
year, bringing the workforce down to 35,000.
Deutsche Babcock will have to spend a further DM50m on redundancy pay and
other restructuring which has already cost the group DM355m over the past
three years.

Finnair, the Finnish national carrier, plans to raise about FM500m (Dollars
103.3m) through an offer of up to 12m new shares to domestic and
international investors.
Proceeds will be used to buy second-hand McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to
replace its DC-9 fleet. The five-year investment programme is worth about
FM1.7bn.
The state will not participate in the issue, cutting its holding to 60.9 per
cent (57.5 per cent after full dilution) from 71.5 per cent (66.9 per cent
after dilution). Kleinwort Benson is global co-ordinator for the issue.
Neste, the Finnish oil and petrochemical group, is also selling part of its
stake in Finnair.
In the half-year to September 30 the airline reported a better than expected
pre-tax profit of FM298.9m, up from FM95.3m last time.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs, the privately-owned Wall Street investment bank, has secured
Dollars 250m in equity capital from a Hawaiian institution, in a deal that
boosts outside ownership of the firm above 20 per cent for the first time in
its 125-year history.
The injection of fresh capital comes at a crucial time for Goldman. This
year, its earnings have dropped sharply because of unfavourable conditions
in investment banking and trading businesses worldwide.
The bank has also seen a larger-than-normal number of partners retire,
including several senior executives.
The bulk of Goldman's capital comes directly from the pockets of its
partners, so any dilution of its partnership base has serious long-term
implications for the firm.
Goldman, like other Wall Street investment banks and securities houses,
needs a large reservoir of capital to conduct much of its business. Partly
to shore up its capital base, Goldman named a record number of new partners
earlier this year.
The Dollars 250m investment by the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, a
Hawaiian educational trust, will entitle it to between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent of Goldman's annual profits.
The trust, which was established in 1884 on the death of a Hawaiian
princess, mainly comprises land holdings throughout the Hawaiian islands. It
made a similar investment in Goldman Sachs two years ago.
The Kamehameha deal marks only the fifth time that non-partners have
invested in Goldman, and lifts outside ownership of the firm to 20.5 per
cent from 16.5 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metall Mining has bought back from Germany's Metallgesellschaft, the
Toronto-based company's former parent, a 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche
Affinerie, which is Europe's biggest custom copper smelter.
Metall will pay the ailing German industrial group CDollars 152m (USDollars
110m), including CDollars 40m in cash and the return of a CDollars 112m
promissory note.
The deal stems from Metallgesellschaft's disposal earlier this year of its
51 per cent stake in Metall. As part of the sale, Metall was obliged under
an agreement with Norddeutsche's other two shareholders to transfer its
stake in the copper smelter back to Metallgesellschaft.
Metall said that the other shareholders, MIM Holdings, the Australian mining
group, and Germany's Degussa, had agreed not to exercise their right of
first refusal on Metallgesellschaft's stake.
Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall's president, said yesterday that the repurchase of
the Norddeutsche stake 'removes the last element of uncertainty arising from
Metall's former relationship with Metallgesellschaft'.
Metall's share price gained 38 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday to CDollars 11.50.
Norddeutsche produced 350,000 tonnes of copper cathode in the year to
September 30 1993, most of which was further processed into various shapes
and rod for manufacturing copper products.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MY rights for Pounds 22m purchase - Pounds
24m cash call will fund pharmaceuticals packaging expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY Holdings, the acquisitive packaging group, yesterday announced the Pounds
22.1m purchase of PropharmaPak, a manufacturer of cartons for the
pharmaceuticals industry.
The deal is to be funded by a Pounds 24m rights issue which will increase
MY's market value by more than 50 per cent.
MY spent Pounds 24m on four acquisitions last year, and made no secret of
its desire to increase further its market share in niche sectors within the
packaging industry.
It is offering 47m new shares at 53p, on an 8-for-15 basis. This represents
only a small discount to yesterday's 55p closing share price. Malbak, the
South African conglomerate which owns 65 per cent of MY has agreed to take
up 95.6 per cent of its rights.
About 70 per cent of PropharmaPak's sales are to the pharmaceuticals
industry and the company has about a 12 per cent market share. MY already
accounted for 6 per cent of the market, but there is only one overlapping
customer between the two groups.
Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the takeover would provide improved
purchasing power, a key factor as packaging materials account for almost
half of costs. It would also benefit from improved capacity utilisation and
pooling funding for technological improvements.
Following the acquisition, about 40 per cent of MY's revenues will come from
the food and beverage industry, and 25 per cent from healthcare and
cosmetics. Four years ago it had minimal sales to the food sector and no
healthcare sales.
PropharmaPak made operating profits of Pounds 2.8m in 1993, aided by some
one-off items, on turnover of Pounds 10.1m. MY is paying a maximum Pounds
22.1m (on a debt-free basis), but Pounds 800,000 of this will be held in
escrow, to be released if the company makes operating profits of Pounds
2.8m. MY said the purchase price represented less than 12 times after-tax
earnings.
Its net debt at the August 27 year-end was Pounds 2.9m, gearing of 16.3 per
cent.
The purchase is expected to have a neutral impact on earnings per share this
year.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cherry picking by Conrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conrad, the sports and leisure company, is strengthening its team, paying up
to Pounds 1.03m for SLP Consultancy, writes Nigel Clark.
The move adds the defensive capabilities of Mr Trevor Cherry, the former
Leeds United and England fullback, to the attacking brilliance of Mr Bobby
Charlton, the former Manchester United and England forward.
SLP, of which Mr Cherry is managing director, is a marketing and corporate
hospitality company which will link closely with Conrad's Bobby Charlton
International, the soccer consultancy and promotions business.
Mr Ian Townsend, Conrad's finance director, said there would be overlap
where the two companies could help each other.
To help fund the transfer Conrad is raising Pounds 900,000 through the
placing of 25m shares at 4p.
There is an initial signing on fee of Pounds 450,000, satisfied by shares
and Pounds 300,000 cash and a further performance-related payment up to
Pounds 575,000.

<TEXT>
Neepsend, the Sheffield-based engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits 7
per cent, from Pounds 472,000 to Pounds 506,000, in the half year ended
September 30.
Turnover of continuing operations was 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 9.46m
(Pounds 9.01m) and the pre-tax figure was after lower interest charges of
Pounds 89,000 (Pounds 141,000).
Earnings per share came through at 1.6p (1.52p) and the interim dividend is
held at 0.5p.
Mr Nicholas Jeffrey, the chairman, said that while current trading across
the group remained uneven, recent orders had been good.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leigh Interests advances 3% to Pounds 5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased earnings from dry waste collection and landfill operations helped
Leigh Interests, the waste management company, to raise interim pre-tax
profits by 3 per cent.
Profits rose to Pounds 5.2m, against Pounds 5.06m, in the six months to
September 30, but were held by falling margins in liquid waste disposal.
Total turnover was also 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 58m (Pounds 56.4m).
Profits were affected by an operating loss of Pounds 670,000 on two new
waste plants in the Midlands.
The Four Ashes incineration plant has now been completed and is expected to
contribute to profits in the second half.
Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said that customer demand in the dry waste
sector had grown and landfill prices at some sites in the country had
increased by 20 per cent.
Coal extraction and processing also showed 'small but useful' increases in
profitability and turnover. Margins in the liquid waste sector continued to
decline, because of greater competition. The company hopes to benefit from
tighter regulations, including the yet-to-be implemented EU Landfill
Directive, which requires liquid waste to be disposed of at treatment
plants.
Earnings per share and interim dividend were both unchanged at 5.5p and
2.46p respectively.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Singer sets up 55% offshoot to buy Carnegie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, is setting up a new Swedish
subsidiary, Sifrig, to takeover over Carnegie, the international broker
owned by Nordbanken of Sweden.
Singer will hold 55 per cent of Sifrig with the balance owned by Carnegie
staff. Through Sifrig it will pay Pounds 45m for its share in the company
and as Singer &amp; Friedlander Group it will give an additional Pounds 8.5m,
payable over nine years, for the name and goodwill. It is not buying
Carnegie's Swedish and Norwegian bonds business.
Mr Sven-Ake Johansson, Nordbanken's deputy chief executive, said the bank
would receive a total payment of SKr1.23bn (Pounds 104m). 'The kind of
international stockbroking business in which Carnegie specialises is not a
core business for us,' he stated.
Singer is raising Pounds 49m to fund the investment. It intends to make a
Pounds 29m placing of 15-year convertible stock to qualifying shareholders
with an open offer on the basis of Pounds 3 nominal for 19 ordinary. The
stock carries an 8.5 per cent coupon convertible at 112.9 shares for each
Pounds 100 of stock.
It has also taken out a Pounds 20m multicurrency bank loan. The financing
and placing will be carried out by Singer's broker, BZW.
Mr John Hodson, Singer's chief executive, said: 'This is a continuation of
the policy we have been building up of taking controlling stakes in key
businesses which we think will be earnings enhancing.'
The group already has a majority stake in Collins Stewart, the broking
house, and sizeable stakes in Associated Nursing Services, Edgar Hamilton,
the Lloyd's of London broker, and People's Phone, a provider of mobile phone
services.
Carnegie Fondkommission was established in 1932 in Stockholm to provide
stockbroking to Swedish investors. It has 400 staff and offices throughout
Europe and the US. It was acquired by Nordbanken in 1988.
It made operating profits of Pounds 20m in the first half, although the
figures were inflated by exceptionally high trading volumes in the first
quarter.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave BDA with deficit of Pounds
545,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BDA Holdings, the property investment and development group whose former
chairman, Mr Brian Duker, was ousted from the board in August, swung into
the red with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 545,000 for the six months to July
31.
The outcome, against profits of Pounds 28,000, was struck after provisions
for a number of items including professional costs in respect of an abortive
merger and costs associated with the removal of Mr Duker.
Mr Richard Wollenberg, BDA's new chairman, said the group had achieved a
break-even trading position. However provisions left an operating loss of
Pounds 499,000.
Turnover was Pounds 711,000 (Pounds 1.03m) and interest costs were Pounds
46,000 (Pounds 47,000 credits). Losses per share emerged at 3.01p (0.15p
earnings).

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tunstall advances 16% despite difficult
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tunstall Group, market leader in emergency communications systems for the
elderly, lifted pre-tax profits by 16 per cent from Pounds 6.47m to Pounds
7.53m in the year to September 30.
Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said this had been a 'satisfactory performance
in difficult markets'. Turnover grew 12 per cent to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds
44.8m) and operating profits rose to Pounds 7.21m (Pounds 6.24m). The
acquisition of a Dutch subsidiary contributed Pounds 1.55m to the former and
Pounds 51,000 to the latter.
The core Tunstall Telecom supplies and maintains hardware, software and
emergency systems to the public sector, since the transfer of the Care in
the Community programme from local authorities to social services.
Mr Dawson was pleased with PiperNet, the group's management information
systems which he sees as the main engine of growth in the UK. While Tunstall
has competitors in the emergency communications field, PiperNet - into which
it has invested some Pounds 3m - is unique and under application for
patents.
Tunstall Electronics used to make electronic devices - such as satellite
decoders, test equipment for the telecoms industry and products for virtual
reality systems - for external manufacturers. This company now only
manufactures for other Tunstall companies, while Mion Electronics was
created as a contract manufacturing business.
Mion and Tunstall Electronics up to January made only Pounds 236,000 (Pounds
495,000 from the previous Tunstall arm) after heavy start-up costs. Turnover
was Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 3.58m). Demand increased for the non-UK companies
and they turned over almost Pounds 11m. However Germany was the exception
and manufacturing there is being relocated in the UK.
Interest receivable slipped to Pounds 246,000 (Pounds 263,000) and the cash
pile fell to Pounds 3.72m (Pounds 6.42m). Earnings rose to 15.2p (13.5p
adjusted for January's 1-for-1 scrip) and a raised final dividend of 2.5p
(2.25p) gives a total of 3.85p (3.5p).

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hampson turns in Pounds 2.57m at halfway
stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hampson Industries, the West Bromwich-based group whose interests include
engineering, furniture and cleaning, reported a 3.7 per cent increase in
first half profits and promised further improvement in the second.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 2.57m on
turnover of Pounds 46.2m, compared with Pounds 2.48m on sales of Pounds
43.5m in the 1993-94 first half. Last year's figures, however, included
losses of Pounds 97,000 from discontinued operations.
The results are in line with a company statement made last month, when
Hampson said that although second-half profits would increase, they would be
unlikely to meet brokers' expectations. Then market forecasts were that
Hampson would make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6.5m in the full year.
Brokers' predictions have since been reduced to about Pounds 5.7m, while
Hampson contents itself with the comment that 'there will be an increase in
profits earned in the second half' compared with the those of the first
half.
But the directors have given what they call 'an indication of our confidence
in the future' with an increase in the interim dividend to 0.55p from 0.5p
last time, when total annual payments came to 2p.
First half earnings per share were 2.3p against 2.22p in the 1993-94 first
half.
Operating profits in the period were static at Pounds 2.86m. Sluggish UK
consumer spending is hurting furniture operations, although the group holds
its market share.
Aircraft refurbishment has been held back by falling defence orders, but
Hampson is repositioning to obtain more civil orders; this could take 18
months.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rise in beer sales helps Marston to Pounds
12.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in beer sales volumes in spite of a fall in the overall market
helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based regional brewer, to
lift interim profits by 6.5 per cent.
For the six months to September 24 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 11.5m to
Pounds 12.3m, while sales grew from Pounds 70.1m to Pounds 76.6m.
The latest figure was struck after charging a Pounds 43,000 loss on property
disposal and Pounds 251,000 costs for the share ownership scheme.
The shares fell 12p to 292p as the group warned of volatile trading
conditions. It was 'relatively cautious' about second-half prospects.
Volume sales of beer rose by 3.3 per cent in the first half, compared with a
claimed fall of 1 per cent across the industry. Sales of the group's
Pedigree bitter were 1.6 per cent ahead, while sales of the Low 'C brand of
low calorie bottled beer were up by 16 per cent.
Mr David Gordon, managing director, said the results showed 'steady growth.'
The group was outperforming the market in beer sales, and the managed houses
and food sales were doing well.
Sales in the 240 managed houses were 16.2 per cent higher, while food sales
increased by 18 per cent. However, sales from the tenanted estate of 640
pubs were down 4.5 per cent.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 304,000 to Pounds 761,000, reflecting
increased borrowings after the purchase of 46 pubs from Bass in September
last year. Gearing has risen from 8.8 to 10.2 per cent.
The group said the results from the former Bass pubs, many of which had been
closed for refurbishment, had more than covered the cost of borrowing. So
far three have been fully developed, and a further 13 are expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
Earnings per share rose from 8.71p to 9.91p and the interim dividend goes up
from 1.6p to 1.76p.
COMMENT
While these results were at the bottom of City expectations, it was the
cautious trading statement that knocked the shares back. Operating profits
were up almost 13 per cent to Pounds 13.3m, reflecting the underlying
soundness of the business. It has reciprocal agreements with the big
breweries, a strong portfolio of managed houses, and it is probably ahead of
the game in its approach to the tenanted sector, where it has a good
investment programme. Profits for the full year look like coming in at
Pounds 25.5m, giving a prospective multiple of just over 14 - a little too
high following the cold water poured on the second-half outlook.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Avesco losses higher after demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avesco, the broadcast equipment and services group, yesterday announced an
interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.94m, mainly reflecting the cost of spinning
off VideoLogic, the multimedia company.
It also announced the acquisition of Tontel, a TV animation group trading as
Excess, for Pounds 625,000.
The group now consists of three divisions - television studios producing
programmes for both the BBC and independent television; giant TV screens for
use at concerts and sporting events; and video/audio support systems for
presentations.
The pre-tax loss for the half-year to the end of September was struck after
charging Pounds 6.4m for the demerger, and compares with a loss of Pounds
2.32m previously. Total turnover was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 10.9m).
The pre-tax profit from the continuing services operations was Pounds
250,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.03m, compared with Pounds 704,000 on Pounds
4.61m previously.
Shareholders will vote on December 23 on the adoption of a new share option
scheme, an increase in the authorised share capital, and a reduction in the
share premium account.
Mr Murray said yesterday that he had invested his own money in Excess
because it was apparent that Avesco could not do the deal while in the
throes of the spin-off.
The loss per share for the half was 9.19p (2.97p loss), a and earnings were
0.29p (0.93p).

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kode selling computer lossmaker for Pounds
1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kode International, which fell into the red in the first half of this year,
yesterday announ-ced the sale of its lossmaking computer services division,
DCM, for an expected Pounds 1.5m.
Mr Stephen Day, chief executive, said conditions in the computer maintenance
market had been very difficult for more than a year. DCM made interim losses
of Pounds 881,000 this year after being hit by a sudden fall in prices in
the third party maintenance market in the latter part of 1993.
In August, Kode saw its market value halved after it fell into pre-tax
losses of Pounds 515,000 (Pounds 710,000 profits) - there was also an
exceptional charge of Pounds 350,000 against its computer services side.
The shares hit a low of 38p, but yesterday continued their recovery with a
9p rise to 71p.
Mr Day said that the DCM sale would enable Kode to concentrate resources on
the development of its profitable printed circuit board businesses 'where
trading continues to be strong'.
DCM is being sold to Tellus Holdings. Kode will receive Pounds 1.5m, of
which Pounds 900,000 is payable in 13 monthly instalments, subject to a
reduction of up to Pounds 250,000 following a review of completion accounts.
The proceeds will be used to reduce bank borrowings.
Kode plans a capital reorganisation to replenish holding company reserves
following the sale.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Waste services behind Shanks &amp; McEwan rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by the waste services division offset further
disappointing results from the Rechem hazardous waste business and helped
Shanks &amp; McEwan report a 5 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 increased to Pounds 9.82m
(Pounds 9.35m) on turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 63.2m).
Earnings per share were slightly ahead at 3.6p (3.5p).
The group, which announced a sharp reduction in its dividend in June after
unveiling a full year pre-tax loss, is paying a 1.1p interim dividend in
line with its new dividend policy, down from 2.24p a year earlier. The
shares closed down 2p at 89p.
Mr Michael Averill, who took over as chief executive after his predecessor,
Mr Roger Hewitt, stepped down in January, highlighted the group's first half
net cash receipts of Pounds 9m which enabled the group to reduce its net
debt from Pounds 30.9m at the year-end to Pounds 21.9m. Gearing has fallen
from 46 per cent to 30 per cent.
Overall operating profits increased by 8.2 per cent to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds
10.3m) with a 49 per cent increase in profits from the waste services
division offseting lower profits environmental services and a Pounds 840,000
loss (Pounds 722,000) in construction services.
Waste services, which mostly deals with the disposal of household,
commercial and industrial waste, increased to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 7.69m) on
turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 45m (Pounds 37.3m). The profit improvement
mainly reflected higher volumes and margins and the re-appearance of
significant contaminated spoil contracts in the south of England.
In contrast environmental services, including Rechem, which specialises in
hazardous waste incineration, and technical services, which concentrates on
the handling, treatment and disposal of special and difficult wastes,
reported a fall to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.58m) on turnover lower at Pounds
16.7m (Pounds 19.8m).
Rechem was responsible for the bulk of the decline with profits falling from
Pounds 3.3m to just Pounds 200,000 and turnover dropping by 23 per cent.
Price pressures at Rechem's Fawley and Pontypool incenerator complexes,
reflecting both a lower level of higher margin imports and competition from
cement kilns, were blamed.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, noted that there is, 'unfortunately no material
improvement in prospect for either, despite the encouraging statements on
government policy'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent falls 26% after redundancy
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent yesterday announced plans to cut 750 central office jobs,
bringing the total number of redundancies announced in the water sector in
recent weeks to almost 3,000.
Severn Trent is taking an exceptional charge of Pounds 55m to pay for the
job cuts and other moves to reduce central support costs, such as investment
in systems and technology.
The news follows similar announcements from Yorkshire Water, Welsh Water and
South West Water in the first reporting season after the summer price
review.
The exceptional charge depressed Severn's pre-tax result for the six months
to September 30. On turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 533.6m (Pounds
489.8m) pre-tax profits fell by 26 per cent, from Pounds 146.9m to Pounds
108m.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, refused to disclose the level of annual
cost savings Severn expects to achieve as a result of the rationalisation.
However, he said he expected 'quite a fast payback' on the Pounds 55m
charge.
The job cuts will occur in the 2,500-strong central office staff in the
utility division, over the next two years.
Severn Trent's profits were also helped by an Pounds 11.5m reduction in the
infrastructure renewals charge. This was offset, however, by the decision to
devote that benefit to mitigating the effects of higher drainage charges to
domestic customers next year. Severn expects to set aside Pounds 23.5m in
the full year for this purpose. As a result, said Mr Paul, domestic bills
were not expected to rise as sharply next year as would have previously been
the case.
Severn also announced plans to spend Pounds 24m on customer service
improvements, particularly in sewerage.
The regulated water business saw operating profits fall by 23 per cent to
Pounds 128.1m as a result of the exceptional charges, on sales 7 per cent
ahead to Pounds 421.9m.
Mr Paul said Biffa, the waste management company purchased for Pounds 216m
in 1991, had performed well. Operating profits were 15 per cent ahead to
Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.6m), on sales 25 per cent up at Pounds 74m (Pounds
59.1m). However, the division was still labouring under onerous financing
costs of about Pounds 24m a year.
The dividend is lifted to 8.23p (7.55p). Mr Paul said that, for the first
time, Severn would not be held to its traditional dividend policy of paying
one-third of the total at the interim stage and two-thirds at the final.
Earnings per share fell from 39.4p to 27.7p.
COMMENT
It is a pity that Severn has tarnished good underlying results with what
appears to be a determined effort to keep the market in the dark. The core
water business is going well, and the cost-cutting is welcome news. However,
the charge seems excessive compared with Severn's peers. Biffa, meanwhile,
is estimated not to have improved on the second half of last year -
disappointing in a business heavily exposed to economic recovery. Forecasts
are for annual profits of about Pounds 317m, before exceptionals, and a
dividend of 24.9p. This would leave Severn with a yield of 5.7 per cent,
slightly less than the sector average of 6. Severn's healthy dividend cover
of more than 3 times could open the way for better than average growth in
the longer term. Yet, so far, there is no clear indication that this
strength will be exploited in the near future.

FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods to sell UK side to Cleanaway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the mineral extraction and waste management company fighting a
hostile Pounds 391m takeover bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US,
yesterday said it had agreed to sell its UK business to Cleanaway for Pounds
125m if the BFI bid failed.
Meanwhile BFI announced it had received acceptances in respect of 120.6m
ordinaries or 42.6 per cent, including the 29.8 per cent holding of Laidlaw,
which agreed to the original offer. Of the preference shares it had
acceptances for 48m or 73.1 per cent, including Laidlaw's 72.9 per cent.
The offer is due to close at 1pm on Friday.
As part of its last-ditch defence, Attwoods has urged shareholders to reject
the revised BFI bid - worth 116.75p per ordinary and 92p per preference
share - and opt instead for its own break-up proposals.
Under these proposals shareholders would receive a cash sum upon the sale of
the UK and European businesses. Attwoods, which claims its proposals would
deliver substantially more value than the BFI bid, would then seek a
potential purchaser or merger partner for its US activities.
Attwoods said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with Cleanaway, a
waste management joint venture between Brambles, the Australian transport
group, and GKN. The offer is conditional on the disposal of the UK quarrying
and mineral assets.
The agreement appears to preclude other bids for the UK business. Earlier
this month Waste Management International, the London-quoted arm of WMX of
the US, confirmed it hoped to buy Attwoods' UK businesses if shareholders
rejected the BFI bid.
WMI had indicated that it would probably offer more than Pounds 100m for the
UK operations. An independent surveyors' report published recently as part
of Attwoods' defence revalued the UK business from Pounds 97m to Pounds
130.6m.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, said: 'The offer price,
representing 1.9 times sales, further underlines our confidence that our
break-up plan will realise greater value than the BFI offer and is
achievable within the timescale we have set for ourselves.
'We continue to urge shareholders to let the BFI offer lapse so that we can
implement our plan for the benefit of shareholders.'
BFI, whose offer values Attwoods at 1.5 times revenue, had earlier
criticised the break-up plan for failing to produce the names of potential
buyers or offers for the businesses.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI has described it as 'a very iffy proposal' and
suggested shareholders could get as little as 56p or 88p a share.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Kleinwort to advise on Chile sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, this week begins advising Codelco
Chile, the state copper producer, on the privatisation of its Dollars 500m
(Pounds 304m) Tocopilla power generating division.
The Tocopilla sale is set to be the largest electricity privatisation in
South America since Argentina completed its sell-off and competition between
advisers was intense.
Kleinwort emerged from a field of 17 investment banks and a shortlist of
three that included its UK rival on electricity deals, NM Rothschild, and CS
First Boston of the US.
Codelco and Kleinwort have to decide on the stake to be offered to outside
investors, expected to be a majority, and the method of sale. The management
of the Chilean state company are understood to prefer an offer for sale but
a trade sale to an international electricity company is also a possibility.
Kleinwort said it expected to complete a review of options by early 1995
with a view to a transaction in the late spring or early summer. An
international offering would have to be timed to avoid clashing with the
sale of shares in the UK's national grid and generating companies, and
several other electricity privatisations scheduled for next year.
The valuation of Tocopilla depends heavily on the contract it strikes with
Codelco, which consumes two thirds of its output. However the coal and oil
fired power station's capacity of 570MW points to a worth of about Dollars
500m.
The outcome of the Tocopilla 'beauty contest' between investment banks
reinforces the dominance of the electricity sector by Kleinwort and NM
Rothschild since they worked on UK electricity privatisation.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Blur between a shaky past and an uneasy future: Attempts at
cheer in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Japan lets its hair down this week for the start of annual
bonenkai, or 'forget the year', celebrations.
Executives have less reason to forget this year than last, when they were at
the bottom of a record four years of profits decline. The Japanese economy
started to pick up early this year as did corporate profits.
However, elements of previous Japanese recoveries, a strong rise in capital
spending and a sustained surge in domestic demand, are absent. So beer
rather than champagne is called for at this year's bonenkai.
Results for the first half were slightly better than many companies
expected. Overall, quoted companies, excluding financial businesses,
reported a 3 per cent rise in recurring profits, before tax and
extraordinary items.
This is the first time listed companies have managed to lift profits on
falling turnover - down 2 per cent in the first half - for 40 years,
according to James Capel Pacific. For the full-year to March, companies
expect 8 per cent growth in recurring profits on a 1 per cent decline in
turnover.
There are two reasons to be cautious. First, the recovery comes from a very
low base, so earnings per share still languish at levels last seen 15 years
ago. Second, it contains a large export component.
'On the strength of these results, it is not clear yet that the domestic
economy has got itself into a self-sustaining recovery,' says Mr Jason
James, strategist at James Capel Pacific.
A look at the interim period's winners and losers explains why. The best
performers were the big integrated electronics firms, whose chipmaking
profits have surged on demand from the US personal computer market.
Steelmakers saw increased losses but predicted a sharp recovery thanks to
demand from China and its Asian neighbours, while airlines were lifted by
healthier overseas business travel.
Losers were companies in commodity-type businesses unable to put up prices,
such as watchmakers and video game producers. Meanwhile, financial companies
continued to be burdened by bad debts and declining domestic loan volumes.
For the most part, the purely domestic companies able to show high growth
over this period are small, unquoted service businesses - such as discount
retailers, mobile telephone groups and business services - whose results are
not generally published.
The patchiness of Japan's corporate recovery invites the question of whether
domestic demand will pick up in time to compensate for an eventual US
slowdown.
The outlook for two big components of demand, corporate investment and
consumer spending, is not bright. Japanese industry, even in the upturn, is
only running at 72 per cent capacity, the lowest since 1976, which does not
bode well for capital spending, now in its fourth year of decline.
The moral of all this is that western fund managers, who have been pouring
cash into Tokyo this year in the hope of getting in on the earnings recovery
early, may need to be more selective than in the past, warns Mr Alan Livsey,
strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.
The market's average price earnings ratio, of 70 times this year's earnings,
a level last seen in early 1987, is more of a function of low earnings than
a sign of high profits expectations, he warns.
At best, recurring profits could double over the next three years,
but there will be a bigger than usual difference between leaders and
laggards.
Fast-growing niches in the service sector, high technology stocks and
exporters to booming east Asian economies, can be expected to outperform,
say analysts. The traditional manufacturers that used to be the pillars of
Japanese industry will have a struggle to raise profits, as they face
competition from low-cost rivals.
For maturing economies, it is a familiar pattern. For equity investors, it
means a longer than usual read through piles of analysts reports before
deciding where to place their cash.

FT  30 NOV 94 / T&amp;N makes Pounds 100m asbestos charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, formerly one of the UK's largest asbestos suppliers, yesterday
announced a surprise Pounds 100m provision against future asbestos-related
claims, just three months after a US court ruling that indicated a declining
trend in claims.
T&amp;N's share price fell 35p to 186p by the close of trade, knocking Pounds
176m off the company's market capitalisation, as T&amp;N's asbestos-related past
continued to overshadow its successful automotive components and engineering
operations.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, yesterday said that T&amp;N had paid Pounds 250m of
compensation before this latest charge. Insurance companies had met around
Pounds 100m of these claims, but T&amp;N had now used most of its cover.
The provisions will come as a blow to the group, which was hoping to put
asbestos behind it, and move forward with the DM300m (Pounds 122m)
acquisition of a majority stake in components manufacturer Kolbenschmidt, a
Metallgesellschaft subsidiary.
The Pounds 100m reduction in T&amp;N's shareholders funds will increase its
gearing from about 50 per cent to more than 60 per cent, increasing the
likelihood that it will fund the Kolbenschmidt acquisition through a rights
issue.
The latest asbestos provisions relate to a rise in the number of
asbestos-related injury claims before the August court ruling.
These claims are handled by the US Centre for Claims Resolution, on behalf
of 20 members, and the share of costs is related to the number of claims
against individual companies.
Since the group announced interim results in early September the number of
cases had dramatically surpassed forecasts.
Mr Hope said this was a result of an increasing number of cases from sectors
where T&amp;N had greater exposure, such as construction and process industries.
He was adamant that this could not have been foreseen.
In addition to the Pounds 100m charge, T&amp;N is likely to carry an annual
provision of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m, compared with a Pounds 21m
provision in 1993. However, Mr Hope said this figure should decline from
1996.

FT  30 NOV 94 / BTR acts as City concern mounts: Forecast of 'satisfactory'
profit lifts share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate whose shares have fallen by more than a
quarter in the past three months, issued a trading statement yesterday which
failed to restore City confidence.
However it did reassure the market that trading has not turned down in the
second half and the shares added 2p to 287p.
BTR predicted a 'satisfactory' operating profit in 1994 with price increases
and buying policies mitigating the impact of raw materials cost increases.
BTR's high margins have been the focus of City worries since September, when
the shares fell 12 per cent on the announcement of disappointing interim
figures. These showed margins falling from 15.7 to 15.2 per cent.
Yesterday BTR said operating margins in the second half would show some
improvement over the first half, though analysts pointed out that this would
be no more than its normal seasonal pattern.
BTR has been putting pressure on its suppliers to cut their prices, in
response to rising raw materials costs and pressure from its own customers.
In a meeting with analysts, Mr Norman Ireland, the chairman, stressed the
company's commitment to improving margins but said it might adopt a more
low-key approach to the issue. He said: 'BTR will achieve (improved margins)
but not by announcing its success with trumpets and drums, but with violins
and clarinets.'
However analysts remain concerned about the outlook for margins in the more
competitive 1990s. 'They are more likely to go down than up,' commented one
analyst.
Analysts also complained that the company gave no further insight into
management succession following the announcement last week that Mr Bob
Faircloth would be retiring as chief operating officer.
In its statement the company predicted increased earnings in the full year
though it pointed out that earnings per share will be diluted by the
exercise of warrants which will increase the average number of shares in
issue by 6 per cent. Analysts are expecting earnings per share to be little
changed.
This year BTR has decided to suspend the annual distribution of warrants
which some institutions have criticised as a rolling rights issue that
dilutes earnings.
The trading statement reported 'buoyant order positions and profit
performance' in a number of BTR's US manufacturing companies, particularly
Fasco Motors, Fexnord, Plastics Packaging and the Meter Group. But these
have been partly offset by the problems of its Denver baggage handling
contract, difficult market conditions at Weavexx and further rationalisation
costs at Allsteel.
In the UK, BTR has seen 'slow growth' throughout the year but most of its
industrial manufacturing, automotive and constructions are up on last year.
In spite of the upturn in continental European car production, BTR reports
difficult markets in automotive, valves and batteries but predicts
'profitable growth' in 1995.
BTR said it decided some weeks ago to issue an annual trading update at this
stage in line with other large companies.
