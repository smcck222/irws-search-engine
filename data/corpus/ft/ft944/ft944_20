FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (9): Custodians face rising demand
 -Derivatives / The growth of the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
The rapidly growing derivatives industry has faced some setbacks this year,
with a string of highly publicised corporate losses and two legal actions
denting its image.
Yet underlying growth in the use of derivatives - both simpler options and
futures traded on exchanges and the more complex swaps and packages bought
over the counter - has continued apace.
As a result the demands on banks to adapt their custodial functions to
accommodate derivative instruments are rising. Global custodians are in
little doubt about the pace of change.
'We have seen a huge increase in interest among certain types of client,
including fund and investment managers who are looking to get the custody of
traditional securities and derivatives in one place,' says Aidan Dennis,
vice-president global securities services at Chase Manhattan.
'Two years ago nobody used to ask about derivatives when they submitted a
'request for proposal' (industry jargon for the detailed proposals made by
clients to their custodians). Every request I have received in the last six
months has contained something on derivatives. It is quite unbelievable.
Everyone is asking for it,' adds Mr Dennis.
'Up to two years ago there was nothing on derivatives. It is beginning to
appear now,' says Dick Feehan, a managing director at Bankers Trust. 'There
used to be a dichotomy between the rocket science grand masters who were
designing the products and the back offices who were reporting on them. That
gap no longer exists,' he adds.
Increasingly fund managers - even at conservative investment institutions
such as UK life offices - are using derivatives, for purposes such as
tactical asset allocation. Bankers Trust estimates that up to 50 per cent of
fund managers with more than Dollars 500m under management are using or
reviewing their use of derivatives.
The pressures on custodians who have traditionally supplied a range of core
services such as settlement, safekeeping, dividend collection and
tax-related services for physical assets are growing.
'Custodians tended to adopt an ostrich approach and duck their heads in the
sand. They can't do that any longer,' says Mr Feehan, who adds that the
demand for derivatives-related services is part of growing interest in other
'value-added' services, such as accounting, valuation, foreign exchange, and
cash management.
Indeed, global custodians can help streamline information gathering,
reporting and accountancy procedures. A custodian, for example, can
facilitate central clearing of all contracts traded on an international
exchange such as Liffe or the Chicago Board of Trade. This can help
consolidate and streamline the payment of margin, the capital needed to
uphold positions.
'The whole idea is to get all your positions with one global clearing broker
rather than with a multitude of brokers round the world. You get all the
information in one place,' explains Mr Dennis. 'Without centralised brokers
you could be paying margin to 16 different places - you could be getting 16
sets of reports back and the back office would be swamped.'
Custodians can also help traders manage their trading positions better by
more effective use of netting off - offsetting different sets of credits and
debits.
'A custodial system can make it easier for investors to manage their
physical and derivative assets in a more effective way for reporting
purposes. If you are long individual stocks in the FTSE and short FTSE
futures contracts - then from an exposure viewpoint you would need to net
the positions off,' adds Mr Dennis.
Mr Feehan also emphasises the value of uniform reporting. 'Some
organisations come to us who are investing in derivatives, but who are
putting their investments out with seven or eight separate fund managers who
specialise in different areas. We can supply a combination of reports to
cover and consolidate the whole portfolio,' he explains.
Again with exchange traded products, investors are moving towards a single
point of settlement and clearing. 'This is for convenience, cost and
reporting,' adds Mr Dennis. 'A single information flow is what it is all
about. It should allow them to make better investment decisions.'
Not all banks are up to meeting the challenge. The complexity of the
instruments involved, and their relationship with the rest of an investment
portfolio, requires more sophisticated reporting than straightforward equity
or bond trades, as well as strong operational support.
Practitioners emphasise two problems in particular. First, the accounting
treatment for derivatives can vary from that of other securities and may
vary from region to region. 'For example, it is very common to account for
securities on an average cost basis, but most customers run their derivative
portfolios on a first in/first out basis,' notes Mr Dennis.
Second, the industry has a considerable amount of work to do and this
suggests the need for standardisation. In the securities business practices
have been partially harmonised and there has been a move towards the use of
international security identification numbers.
Unfortunately there are no comparable standards existing in the derivatives
markets and this is partially because of the life span of derivative
products.
'With the addition of a variety of strike prices and delivery months there
may be more than 50 different contracts available on the same underlying
instruments at any given time.
'Clearly the amount of time and effort required to maintain individual codes
for such a universe would outweigh the benefits of standardisation,' points
our Mr Dennis.
'But the need to standardise the methods of communication remain as does the
need to have a standard method of creating international security
identification numbers,' he adds.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (8): Cash-generating practice -
Securities lending / The value of this bolt-on service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the services global custodians provide, none causes as much interest
as securities lending.
This is the business where an efficient custodian can earn enough cash to be
able to offer a new client a basic service almost free of charge.
'There is only one bolt-on service which is of value to the provider and
that is securities lending,' said John Lee, partner at Lee Schwartz
Associates, a consulting firm specialising in custody. 'There is an
increasing number of custody contracts tendered for on the basis of 'We will
do the custody for free if we get the securities lending bit',' Mr Lee said.
However, some custodians are cautioning against linking pricing decisions
too closely to securities lending. 'Securities lending does influence
pricing decisions,' said Dick Feehan, managing director at Bankers Trust's
European global products division. 'But the structure of a portfolio can
change overnight,' he warned. It may be reconstituted in a way which offers
far less potential for lending than had been thought and the custodian could
be underpricing his service.
Securities lending offers clients a chance to earn not only a rate of return
on the loaned securities, but on the investment of the collateral held
against it.
Yet, custodians say, even after years of successful stock lending in the US
which has enhanced returns and cut operating costs significantly, many UK
pension funds remain wary of the practice.
Demand for loaned securities - both equity and debt - has been driven by the
growing use of derivative instruments by fund managers and securities
houses. These encourage investors to take short positions - that is, to sell
securities they do not own - and there are times when investors need to
borrow stock to fill a short position.
Also, international stock lending has been driven by vastly increased
interest in emerging and less efficient markets by US and UK investors.
Investors willing to lend Spanish securities, for instance, may earn up to 3
per cent of the value of securities loaned reflecting both market
inefficiencies and the reluctance of domestic investors to lend in an
environment of legal ambiguity about the status of the practice.
Inefficient, paper-based markets also offer great potential for lending at
high margins.
Brokers eager to sell shares to clients find they may not be able to obtain
them outright and borrow them from intermediaries to make good delivery.
As more investors become willing to lend, margins come down. In Japan, for
instance, margins have fallen from three percentage points a few years ago
to roughly 0.3 per cent at present.
'Securities lending has become a much bigger part of the business,' said
Charles Cassidy, senior vice-president at State Street Bank in charge of
financial asset servicing in Europe. State Street has roughly Dollars 200bn
in custody accounts which clients have given permission to lend.
'That is a significant increase over the past year when we had about Dollars
30bn in total that clients were willing to lend,' he said. About 25 per cent
is out on loan at any one time, he said. The biggest participants are the
large public sector pension funds whose knowledge and sophistication are
rapidly increasing.
However, in the UK clients are far more reluctant. 'We do very little
lending in the UK,' he said. Partly, that reluctance might reflect the
relatively low returns earned on domestic stock lending. While margins are
also low in the US, volumes are so large that investors who do participate
earn quite attractive returns.
Mark Weeks, marketing director at London Global Securities, an independent
stock lending intermediary, notes that in the UK, the disappearance of more
than Pounds 440m from pension funds formerly controlled by the late Robert
Maxwell had tarnished the image of stock lending and given trustees a
justification for avoiding the practice. 'In a relatively risk-free
environment, you can make a certain amount of money. So why would you turn
it down?' Mr Weeks argues. London Global is one of the few lending
intermediaries which acts as principal in stock-borrowing agreements, a
status which many pension trustees say gives them greater comfort. If the
borrower disappears with the stock, London Global makes good any loss.
Moreover, all stock lending - unlike that allegedly carried on by the
Maxwell-controlled pension funds - is collateralised.
London Global, an unusual outfit in that it unbundles the custody activity
from that of stock lending, passes the collateral it receives back to the
lender, who is then free to invest it as he sees fit.
However, the common practice is for the global custodian to invest the
collateral. This is not a totally risk-free activity as Chicago-based Harris
Trust found out earlier this year.
In the second quarter of 1994, Harris took a Dollars 33m write-off to
reflect more than Dollars 51m in losses stemming from a decision to invest
held against client loans of securities in volatile collateralised mortgage
obligations.
While these offer relatively low counterparty risk, they face significant
market risk and fell sharply in value when interest rates rose earlier this
year. Harris, which says it ranks among the top US-based global custodians,
'made whole' all of its clients which had sustained the losses. Moreover, a
spokeswoman said that Harris has revised its internal risk management
procedures as a result.
Typically, Mr Weeks notes, there are three types of collateral which
institutions regard as acceptable. These are cash, letters of credit and
Treasury bills. Mr Weeks says because client agreements usually promise an
end-client a set rate of return, say 3 per cent, there is an incentive for
custodians to try to earn an extra turn for themselves by investing in
modestly riskier investments.

* The purpose of the settlement benchmark is to provide a means of
comparing the settlement efficiency of different markets and to track
the evolution of settlement performance in individual markets over
time. The benchmark incorporates the four components which, combined
together, reflect the overall cost to market patricipants of failed
trades. These include average trade size, local market interest rates,
the proportion of trades that fail, and the length of time for which
they fail. By converting information back into a base currency,
comparisons between markets become possible. The benchmarks are
expressed as a score out of a maximum 100. The lower the score the
higher the effective operational costs of failed transactions in any
given market.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (13): Striking evidence of regeneration
efforts - Bristol development corporation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the people flocking this autumn to a 14-screen, 3,600-seat Showcase
Cinema at Avon Meads in Bristol will be unaware that only a year ago the
site was derelict.
The American-style development of a 26-acre site at Avon Meads and Castle
Court is, as yet, the most striking evidence of the regeneration efforts of
Bristol Development Corporation on 900 acres near the city centre. Alongside
the Showcase Cinema, opened in August by National Amusements of the US,
there is ten-pin bowling, fast-food restaurants and a parade of stores.
This month, an 85,000 sq ft Cargo Club was opened by Nurdin &amp; Peacock, its
third UK membership warehouse, in which goods are sold off pallets and racks
at low prices. More than 12,000 people had paid the annual membership fee of
Pounds 25 by opening day.
Avon Meads and Castle Court, which have been developed for the BDC by Wilson
Connolly, have free parking and, because of a new spine road, can be reached
without driving through the congested city centre. The road itself, named St
Philips Causeway, was opened in July and links the M32 motorway with the A4
Bath road.
While the leisure and retail complex has won popular approval, the BDC
itself has been, in some quarters, highly unpopular. One of 12 such
corporations in England, it was created by the government in 1989 with
planning powers to regenerate land suffering from dereliction and poor
access. The Labour-controlled city council failed in a court action to stop
it.
The BDC's aggressively market-led strategy did nothing to improve relations
with the council. Critics of the government's concept of the corporations
argue they have a high cost per job created - and poorly targeted benefits.
Relations between the BDC and the city council, although still uneasy, have
improved over the past year and the council's Labour leader, Mr Graham
Robertson, has joined the board. Recently, however, tensions have resurfaced
with the BDC's plans for its flagship site, Quay Point.
Mr Miles Collinge, the BDC's pugnacious chief executive, makes no apologies
for the corporation being a commercial organisation driven by market forces.
He does not disguise his frequent impatience with the city authorities.
'Bristol of all cities has a capacity to emit negative messages,' is a
typical comment.
The BDC concentrated on infrastructure first - notably on St Philips
Causeway, which cost Pounds 47m. The design-build contract was completed by
Balfour Beatty ahead of schedule and on budget. Mr Collinge describes the
road as of 'mega-significance' and says the area it serves 'didn't have a
future without it.'
One scheme, intended to complement the spine road, is for a weir to improve
the appearance of the river Avon, which becomes a muddy ditch at low tide.
But although a parliamentary bill to build it was unopposed, funding has yet
to be found.
Development which has proceeded includes, in partnership with Nationwide
Building Society and five national housebuilders, an urban village called
Avon Riverside. So far, about 300 houses, out of a planned total of nearly
1,000, have been completed. The main office relocation has been by NatWest
Life, which has taken a headquarters building on the waterfront.
The BDC says 2,250 jobs have been created, with another 1,000 expected from
schemes in progress. It forecasts there will be, eventually, 18,800 direct
and indirect jobs and predicts that private investment of Pounds 820m will
be secured.
In May, the BDC, due to be wound up in December next year, published an exit
strategy together with a review by KPMG Management Consulting. KPMG said the
recession had caused developments to come onstream later than originally
forecast, but 'despite this background the BDC has successfully brought
about development and laid the foundations for strengthening interest as the
economy and the property market recovers.'
The review said the BDC had identified opportunities which had not been seen
by the council. The potential had been transformed by improvements to the
infrastructure and environment. Twelve sites already had some development
and a further 13 were being marketed. 'There is no evidence that this
turnaround. . . could have been achieved with the BDC's activities,' KPMG
said.
The most grandiose project is for Quay Point, which the BDC believes will be
a gateway to the city of international status. It is a triangular site of 23
acres next to Temple Meads railway station, the city's ring road and on the
waterfront. The BDC, with Wilson Connolly as preferred developer, hopes to
have a 2m sq ft commercial centre, attracting Pounds 400m of investment.
In addition to offices, the BDC wants a quality hotel, leisure attractions
and, most controversially, 350,000 sq ft of shopping including a department
store and mall. The scheme is attacked by those concerned about the impact
on the city's Broadmead shopping centre, and on a proposed Harbourside
development on the waterfront.
The council's view is that a strategy for central Bristol should be by
devised by agreement, not competition. Mr Collinge's view is that the real
threat to the city centre comes not from Quay Point, but from out-of-town
development.
Despite Quay Point having been marketed for some time, no deal has yet been
struck for a department store. Mr Collinge, while saying that remains the
preferred option, indicates the scheme could be adapted to have less retail
space, more confined to support shopping for office workers. But he
comments: 'We do not believe in mono-cultural development, whether retail,
leisure or office. A development blossoms more in a city if it has a mix of
uses.
'This corporation wants to do nothing but strengthen the heartbeat of
Bristol. Why allow this site to continue to moulder? It is the most
accessible site and why not recognise that, and say it is the central
business district?'
Mr Collinge comments: 'My great sadness is that the vision of the BDC has
not been shared. There has been squabbling argument with third-division
politics trying to kill the BDC. Cities like Birmingham and Manchester have
had a strategic vision in harmony with the private sector.'
He adds: 'Potentially we're a very competitive city and, if we got our act
together, we could knock spots off other cities.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (12): A transformation - Bristol port and
Severnside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists surging down the M5 motorway towards Somerset can hardly fail to
notice, as they drive past the Avonmouth industrial complex beside the
Bristol Channel, that something big is happening.
While the steel structures and vapour clouds of large-scale chemical
processes are still evident, there are also gleaming white buildings, the
size of aircraft hangars, next to acres upon acres of parked new cars.
The transformation is caused by the expansion of Bristol port since it was
privatised three years ago. Its success 'is the best thing that has happened
to Bristol in 50 years,' says Mr St John Hartnell, chairman of property
consultant Hartnell Taylor Cook, which manages the docks' estate of 2,500
acres.
While Mr Hartnell would declare an interest, others have been equally
impressed. The port, together with the second Severn bridge which is under
construction, has become a catalyst for development plans around Avonmouth.
The biggest scheme, being promoted by ICI, covers no fewer than 1,500 acres,
an area stretching for more than 4km.
Even before the new bridge opens in 1996, the docks have the benefit of
direct access to the M5 motorway, near to its junction with the M4, and of a
recently-upgraded link to a main-line railway. 'It is a very well-placed
strategic port,' says Mr Hartnell.
The port, which straddles the river Avon, took over from the old city-centre
docks, where commercial trade died because of the difficulties of navigating
the river and restrictions on the size of vessel.
On the north side of the river is Avonmouth dock, which is used by container
and general cargo ships, and where Bell Lines opened a Pounds 3.5m container
terminal in December last year.
On the south side is Royal Portbury, completed as a deep-water dock in 1978
and capable of handling ships up to 130,000 dwt.
Bristol city council, the then owner, was burdened with debt by its
construction and could not win enough trade to be profitable.
In consequence, the council sold the port in 1991 for Pounds 36m, free of
debt, on a 150-year lease to First Corporate Shipping, a private company run
by Mr Terence Mordaunt and Mr David Ord. They are chairman and managing
director of the operating subsidiary, Bristol Port Company. The council
retains a 12.5 per cent preferential stake and has a seat on the board.
Since the takeover, Pounds 150m has been invested by the port and joint
venture partners in new facilities.
'Everything that happens here, happens at break-neck speed,' says Mrs Julie
Gough, of Bristol Port Company, which has a permanent workforce of 172
including apprentices. Since 1991, tonnage has increased by 2m tonnes to
6.6m tonnes and profits have risen each year. Revenue in the last financial
year grew from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 32.7m.
To date, most of the expansion has been at Royal Portbury which has become,
after Sheerness, the second-biggest UK port for car imports and exports.
These have doubled in three years to about 300,000 vehicles.
Honda, Mitsubishi, Proton, Rover, Toyota and the Fiat company Walon have
parking space which totals 282 acres. Computerised systems enable a car's
arrival to be processed in less than 40 seconds.
In May last year, an Pounds 80m investment in a bulk handling terminal was
made by a joint venture with National Power. Although in its first year the
terminal only handled about 1m tonnes of coal, compared with a capacity of
5m, it is a common-use facility which also carries fertilisers, aggregates
and grain derivatives.
This year, Agricultural Bulk Services, a joint venture between the port and
United Molasses, invested Pounds 6.5m in doubling storage for animal feeds ,
only a year after the facility opened at Royal Portbury. New sheds have been
built for a forest products terminal. Lafarge Plasterboard imports gypsum
for a factory which it opened at the port in 1989.
On the dock estate, infrastructure is nearly completed for Portbury West, a
joint venture with Bryant Properties for a 30-acre distribution park,
intended eventually to have more than 1m sq ft of industrial space. Further
south, Woodspring council has given approval for a 52-acre business park
near Weston-super-Mare and outline consent for a 1.6m sq ft business park at
Weston airfield.
North of the river Avon, another distribution park called Severn Gate is
being developed on a 60-acre green-field site by AMEC Developments and RTZ
Estates.
RTZ is promoting a scheme to build nearby an intermodal rail-freight
terminal which would link to the Channel tunnel.
At Severnside, north of Avonmouth, ICI intends to develop 1,500 acres around
its fertiliser works and Avlon plant, owned by Zeneca since the demerger. At
present, tenant farmers use the land for grazing, but the land has been held
as a strategic reserve and ICI has had outline planning consent since 1957
for industrial and commercial use.
ICI has realised it will never require the land itself although the
fertiliser plant, where 230 people work, remains open and Zeneca is keeping
some acreage for planned expansion. Instead, it has decided the time has
come to unlock its value.
That value, it believes, is enhanced not only by the port but also the M49
approach road to the second Severn bridge, which crosses the land. ICI is
applying for an intersection to give direct access.
One hitch is that agreement has yet to be reached with the highway
authorities for the siting of the slip roads, which will be partly funded by
the private sector. In consequence, the junction is unlikely to be ready
when the new bridge opens.
ICI, with King Sturge as property adviser and planning consultant, has begun
to market the land under the name Western Approaches and is holding meetings
with local people on mitigating the environmental impact.
Planning consent is being sought for a first phase - a distribution park of
2.3m sq ft of warehousing on 130 acres of a landscaped 200-acre site. Future
development could be a mixture of distribution space, industry including
high-tech and research activity, and possibly a leisure complex and some
housing.
The company estimates that over a 15-year period, between 5,000 and 7,000
jobs could be created.
'The capacity for economic development is enormous,' says Mr Andrew Sturt,
ICI's group property manager.
'It will be a major contribution to the industrial and employment base of
the region.'

A strength of Bristol is its geographical location near the motorway
crossroads of the M4 and M5. One can drive directly by motorway to London,
south Wales, the Midlands and north, or to the far south-west, writes Roland
Adburgham.
Bristol also has two mainline railway stations, Parkway and Temple Meads,
with a journey time to London of an hour and 20 minutes.
It has a flourishing port, which is close to the Severn bridge and to the
second crossing which is being built. The one obvious weakness is its lack
of an international regional airport.
While Bristol airport, south of the city at Lulsgate, has established itself
as the south-west's leading airport, there is an irony. The transport links,
which otherwise serve Bristol so well, serve Lulsgate badly. It has no
railway. The road into the city is a single carriageway.
The airport is only a few miles from the M5 motorway, but the roads to it
are tortuous.
It is this issue of location which hovers over a public inquiry being held
by the Department of the Environment. British Aerospace wants to develop the
airfield next to its Filton works in north Bristol into a commercial
airport, with freight and scheduled services.
It has all the transport links which Lulsgate lacks.
Although, under the terms of BAe's application, Filton would not be a
fully-fledged regional airport, business groups such as the regional
Confederation of British Industry regard it as an essential step forward in
the region's economic development.
The inquiry was called after Northavon council, the planning authority,
failed to rule on BAe's application within the statutory period. In recent
years, thousands of houses have been built near Filton, and the council has
been put under pressure by residents worried about noise.
Northavon is now opposing BAe's plan, even though the company argues that it
must make better use of its airfield to safeguard the Filton works, where
more than 5,000 people are employed.
Bristol city council is also opposed to a Filton airport because it owns
Lulsgate, which plans a new Pounds 14m terminal capable of handling 2m
passengers a year but needs private investment.
It is the success of Lulsgate, despite its handicaps, which proves the
demand. It had 1.2m passengers in the year to March 31 and made record
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m. While most of its passengers are for charter
flights, scheduled traffic is growing. In its winter timetable, Lulsgate has
170 scheduled departures a week, including flights to Amsterdam, Brussels,
Paris and Jersey. Although long-haul flights are restricted by its runway, a
daily Aer Lingus service has started to New York. Brymon, the British
Airways subsidiary, uses the airport as its hub.
BAe proposes not more than 350,000 passengers a year at Filton and contends
that the two airports could co-exist, with Lulsgate handling charter
traffic. Bristol council says that Filton, if restricted to BAe's announced
limit, would do little to meet projected demand of about 4m passengers by
2010. This demand would therefore have to be met at Lulsgate, but the
council warns that the necessary investment might be frustrated by a second
airport.
What does seem certain is that any investment will remain on hold until the
outcome of the inquiry, due to end in January.
While this is the most contentious transport issue in the region, it is by
no means the only one. The construction of the Batheaston bypass, north of
Bath, drew national attention this year as objectors camped out in tents and
trees to try to stop the contractors.
While the protestors ultimately failed, they highlighted the dilemma of
striking a balance in satisfying two opposing pressure groups which are
particularly vocal in the west of England.
On one hand, there are the environmentalists and, on the other, business
groups calling for road improvements.
Where there would be agreement is on the need to upgrade rail services,
especially by the electrification of the London line. There are no through
passenger services to the Channel tunnel, although there is a firm proposal
for a freight terminal at Avonmouth which would link with the tunnel.
There is also general agreement that Bristol, where the road network is
overcrowded, needs a rapid transit system, despite the collapse of a
previous scheme for a metro tram system. Avon county council is the lead
promoter for what it calls the Westway network. It is preparing an
application for a government grant to finance most of the estimated Pounds
202m cost for the first stage. Private sector funding would also be
required.
The first line would run from north of the city to the south. Dr Roger
Newport, the project manager, hopes operations will begin by 2002 and the
network could eventually include other routes. While the type of vehicle has
yet to be decided, the council envisages vehicles using electrical overhead
lines. It believes two thirds of the passengers would otherwise be using
cars.
A 'people-mover' system is also proposed by Bristol Development Corporation
to connect its Quay Point scheme by light tram to the city centre. The BDC,
which has complained of 'a lack of urgency' in transport policy, opened a
spine road this summer which keeps some traffic out of the city centre by
connecting the M32 motorway and A4 Bath road. In contrast, the county
council says a proposed extension of the Avon ring road, badly needed to
help to regenerate south Bristol, is only in its 'longer-term ambitions.'
The local authorities have been criticised for seeking to discourage
vehicles in Bristol while doing little to provide an alternative other than
cycle-ways in what is a particularly hilly city. A more balanced policy has
begun to emerge, with bus and taxi priority lanes and the start of
park-and-ride schemes.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman of Badgerline, which operates the City Line
buses in Bristol, says the first park-and-ride scheme, which opened this
year, is being used by 1,000 people a day, 'in advance of expectations.'
One imaginative project being promoted by Mr Smallwood's company is an Avon
Gorge expressway, which would use an old single-track railway as a guided
bus-way between Portishead and the city centre. Linking with two
park-and-ride schemes, it could run as many as 60 buses an hour in the
peak-hour direction of travel.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (10): A change of attitude - A look at the
tourism industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bronze statue of a craggy John Cabot on a Bristol quayside shows him
gazing westwards, towards the American mainland which he discovered almost
500 years ago. If he could look over his shoulder, he would see a wharf
where his ship the Matthew, in which he set sail from the city's harbour, is
being reconstructed.
The new Matthew, being built with oak and traditional materials at a cost of
Pounds 1m, is at the heart of an overdue desire by Bristol to stimulate
tourism. The ship, a square-rigged caravel of 21 metres, will be launched
next September and in May 1996 will be the city's centrepiece of an
international festival of the sea. Then she will sail to Newfoundland to
take part in the province's 500th anniversary celebrations.
The festival, organised by partners including the city council and Bristol
Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, is intended to be the biggest held in
the UK. It is hoped to attract 800 ships from around the world and as many
as 1m visitors. For four days, the quays will be alive with exhibitions,
concerts, other events and visits to the moored boats.
With its cost already underwritten by a property company, the festival is
the most striking example yet of a change of attitude in Bristol towards
tourism. Overshadowed by Bath's status as a world heritage city, Bristol has
until recently appeared to disregard the industry.
This was despite evidence of tourism's importance. The West Country Tourist
Board estimates the city has 750,000 staying UK visitors each year,
contributing Pounds 55m to the local economy. In addition, it has a big
number of day visitors and is a popular place for visiting friends and
relations.
For visitors from overseas, Bristol is the tenth most popular UK destination
 -with Americans and the French leading the way. In 1992, there were 209,000
staying visitors from abroad. In total, tourism is estimated to contribute
at least Pounds 100m a year to the local economy, creating directly or
indirectly 10,000 or more jobs.
A consequence of Bristol's lack of interest in tourism was that the city,
despite being internationally known because of its trading history, failed
to invest in the industry compared with rival UK cities. It has no sports
stadium, concert hall or conference centre of national significance.
The Matthew project and festival of the sea is evidence of a change of mind.
Mr Neil Croucher, chairman of Bristol Tourism Forum, says: 'A few years ago
the private sector was tearing its hair out and asking what the city council
was doing to promote tourism. The answer is that they were doing nothing. It
was not recognised as an industry, nor as an area of potential.'
In the past three years, he says, there has 'been a total turnround and the
city council is nothing short of excellent in putting money, time and
commitment to tourism.'
The forum itself, with representatives from the council, chamber of commerce
and tourist industry, has been reactivated. A new strategy has been adopted
to tackle the weaknesses - visitors, for example, consider Bristol
inhospitable - and build upon the city's strengths of location and maritime
heritage. In particular, it is seen to have more potential as a year-round
destination for short-break holidays and business tourism.
'Now everyone is working towards one goal,' Mr Croucher states. 'We have the
big plus of water right at the heart of the centre. We would like to see
Bristol as a major European city, closely linked to waterside development.
By the year 2000, we should be in the position to promote Bristol as one of
the most beautiful cities in western Europe.'
Mr Croucher is development director of the Exploratory 'hands-on' science
centre which, with nearly 200,000 visitors a year, is the most popular city
attraction after Bristol Zoo. The Exploratory, outgrowing its space at
Brunel's Temple Meads station, may move to Harbourside, a waterfront scheme
which is hoped to include an electronic wildlife 'zoo' and centre for the
performing arts. A separate project is for a museum of commonwealth and
empire at Temple Meads.
Bristol already has the advantage of impressive landmarks, including
Brunel's Clifton suspension bridge over Avon Gorge, the cathedral and St
Mary Redcliffe church. Less well-known is that, despite wartime bombing
damage and consequent ugly office blocks, there are 3,600 listed buildings.
The Old Vic's Theatre Royal is the oldest working theatre in Britain, and
John Wesley's chapel, built in 1739, was the world's first Methodist chapel.
Outside the 18th century Exchange are the merchants' flat-topped 'nails',
the origin of the phrase 'paying on the nail.'
A more recent survivor is Brunel's ship, the SS Great Britain, launched in
Bristol in 1843 and salvaged from the Falklands in 1970. Nearby, the
Victorian buildings of Underfall Yard are being restored. Alongside the
floating harbour, which retains permanent high-water in the city's docks,
there is an industrial museum and Arnolfini art gallery. Events such as the
annual balloon festival and regatta attract thousands of people.
Visitors might well be deterred by the cost of car parking, at Pounds 1 an
hour, and the variety of shopping can not compete with Bath. But one
deficiency perceived by tourists - the restaurants - is less well-founded.
The 1994 Good Food Guide lists 10, three more than Bath and five more than
Birmingham. Outside the city, there are distinguished country house hotels
such as Ston Easton, a Grade I listed Palladian mansion.
The city is also close to some of Britain's finest countryside, including
the Wye valley, Cotswolds and Mendips. In addition to Bath, it is within
reach of Cheltenham, Wells and Glastonbury and the seaside towns of
Weston-super-Mare, Burnham-on-Sea and Clevedon.
With these advantages, Bristol should have captured more business tourism.
Despite having 2,000 four-star hotel beds, it is not among the top 50 UK
cities for the conference trade. This autumn, an initiative was launched to
correct this. Twenty-seven hotels and venues have formed a marketing
consortium called Conference Bristol to promote it as a destination and
provide a central point for bookings. The aim is to bring the city into the
top 10 conference destinations within three years. All the big hotels have
also joined Bristol Hotels Association in what Mr Michael McGahey, chairman
of the West Country Tourist Board, has described as 'a new spirit of
co-operation.'
One area where there should be more co-operation is with Bath. The two
cities, only 12 miles apart, could promote a complementary appeal for
tourism. But there has been mutual suspicion and little common interest,
exacerbated by poor transport connections. Bath, in its cultural identity,
has traditionally looked eastwards towards London. Bristol, like John Cabot,
has looked westward.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (7): Push-button service -
Performance measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing has attracted more excitement than performance measurement in the
search to find new value-added services to package into global custody
services.
Traditionally the domain of independent professional services who glean
information from custodians before translating it into usable form for
clients, custodians are moving into performance measurement with a vengence.
'Custodians were fools ever to let performance measurement go to third-party
providers,' one banker said.
Robert Ross, director of consulting at Frank Russell Associates in London,
said: 'In theory, it could all be done at the push of a button. Custodians
have all the data at their fingertips,' he noted.
Frank Russell, which is active in the performance measurement market itself,
has wasted no time in capitalising on this latest trend. The company is
providing a software package to Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the world's
largest global custodians, which is used by all its clients. The service
will provide measurement and multi-currency performance attribution, helping
clients to pinpoint which aspects of their investment strategy led to the
out-performance or under-performance of a portfolio.
Also, Frank Russell is providing its performance measurement software to a
group of other banks who make it available to selected clients.
According to Ms Laurette Bryan, senior vice-president in charge of
performance and analytics at State Street Bank, says that the role of
custodians in performance measurement is now so pervasive in the US that
'the consultants are almost getting out of the business here because we are
taking over.
'We can do it much faster than they can,' she said, noting that full reports
can be prepared for clients within three to five business days of the end of
each month.
State Street's performance measurement service has three elements; a pure
calculation of total returns, a comparison of returns against various
benchmarks, and performance attribution. The last of the three is
particularly crucial to pension scheme clients, she says.
Ms Bryan says that the particular style of US pension fund management lends
itself to the type of performance measurement which custodians can offer.
For one thing, US schemes are far more willing to use 'specialist' fund
managers and may have as many as 30 or 40 different companies handling bits
of their portfolio. These organisations need to know, for instance, how
their portfolio managers compare against each other as well as how they
performed against their respective benchmarks.
Also, a global custodian for a client's portfolios will be able to spot some
key elements of performance attribution at a glance. 'Sometimes a plan does
well because all their managers have moved in the same direction at the same
time and it turned out to be the right direction,' she said. However, that
sort of 'tilt' in a client's porftolio ought to be pointed out because it
can lead to serious underperformance in future years. Ms Bryan recalled one
former client who had done exceedingly well in the mid-1980s with a
portfolio tilted towards small energy-related companies based in Denver,
Colorado, which not long afterwards collapsed.
What clients really want, she says, goes beyond pure performance
measurement. 'If you can consult and interpret, then clients are willing to
pay for it,' she says.
In the US, fund management styles and the absence of a single, universal
performance benchmark have created a more hospitable market for custodial
banks to make inroads into that market. But in the UK, the 'balanced'
pension fund portfolio where the fund manager, not the client, decides the
asset allocation, is the norm.
For this reason, consultants conjecture, the UK has retained a performance
measurement system which has been able to develop broad benchmarks covering
a high percentage of all market participants. Unlike the US, it is possible
to gain a fairly accurate picture of the achievement of the 'average' fund
manager in total returns and the range of peformance. However, there are few
asset-specific benchmarks making it difficult to learn, say, how the average
international bond portfolio manager performed. Thus, in the UK there has
been little sign of custodians making significant inroads into performance
measurement. Pension schemes simply do not need the service custodians are
offering.
The UK market is dominated by two organisations: Combined Actuarial
Performance Services (CAPS), owned by the four largest pension consulting
firms, and WM Company, owned by Bankers Trust.
Earlier this year, Bankers Trust replaced the long-time chairman of its WM
subsidiary with a senior BT official, Charles Kiley, and said it would like
to obtain better synergy between the service and its global custody
operations.
Mr Kiley acknowledges the differences between the two markets. 'We need to
develop different products and services for the two markets. They want
different things.' US clients 'want to get down to the performance of the
individual securities, not just portfolio measurement'. They want to know
what each stock or bond contributed to overall performance.
WM does have several specialised products, including its new PerFx product
which measures the contribution foreign exchange made to performance. Also,
in the GlobeMaster product, WM does the performance measurement side of the
custody service and WM markets its performance measurement capabilities to
other custodians as well.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (6): Uncertainty over expansion
plans - Swift / A look at the cross-border financial message network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For global custodians, there are few more vital matters than being able to
settle securities transactions on behalf of clients safely and quickly.
Without an efficient method of doing so, custodians face not only high
costs, but the financial risks of settlement failure.
The large US custodians might therefore have been expected to welcome a move
by Swift, the Belgian-based cross-border financial message network, to
provide a computer matching and reconciliation facility which can be used by
all custodians and fund managers to track their transactions.
It was not to be. Instead, SwiftAsset Reconciliation was criticised on its
launch at Swift's Sibos payments conference in Boston last month for being
an inappropriate venture. The idea of easy access to such a tool for all
Swift's 4,000 customers did not please the largest custodians.
Ms Vivian Eversole, executive vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank, argued
that Swift, which is owned by 2,230 banks, should concentrate on its core
service of delivering financial messages rather than producing 'value-added'
products for market participants.
The question of how it can avoid competing with its own shareholders has
become crucial for Swift as it mounts an ambitious push into the securities
market, broadening its roots as a means for banks to exchange payments,
foreign exchange and money markets messages.
There is a clear logic to Swift's securities ambitions. Swift itself
estimates that the growth in global investment means that there will be 1bn
securities messages exchanged annually by 1997. Yet members exchanged only
21m securities messages - a fifth of total traffic - during last year.
Tony Kirby, Swift's director of securities markets, says that falling
settlement times mean that it is increasingly difficult to exchange paper
confirmations of trades. 'You have to be connected electronically, or you
can imagine telexes and faxes blocking the world's financial arteries,' he
says.
This has given Swift an opportunity which it might have found harder to
capitalise on two years ago. The network then had a reputation for
over-spending, and being unresponsive to its users. Although it had admitted
fund managers in 1992, it was still levying relatively high transaction
charges.
Since then, the network has undergone a substantial reform led by top
management. Leonard Shrank, the chief executive recruited from Chase
Manhattan two years ago, has engineered cuts in the entry fees and tariffs
for use of the network because of reduced expenses and higher volumes.
Mr Kirby says there is no conflict between Swift developing securities
services and the interest of members such as large global custodians. He
says that if the maximum number of participants is connected electronically
and can exchange information 'it will reduce the risks for everybody'.
Yet Swift now faces uncertainty over how it should develop its securities
activities. Mr Kirby argues that it can play a pivotal role in lowering the
automation costs of new operators.
Some of this effect has already been seen in the relative enthusiasm of
smaller fund managers for the network.
'The reason we are looking at added-value services is to attract newer
participants. If the maximum number of parties is connected electronically,
it will reduce the risks for everybody,' he says. It would also allow
smaller fund managers and custodians to provide sophisticated services.
Mr Kirby points to two advantages for fund managers in services such as
SwiftAsset Reconciliation. First, he says it will improve the quality of
information they receive on the their trades. This will 'enable them to
alert their bank' if there is a problem rather than waiting to be informed.
A second advantage, he says, is that 'it is crazy for a fund manager to use
every type of proprietary system that a bank comes up with'. If they use
systems which are standard across the whole industry, this means that they
will be able 'to switch custodians fairly cleanly' if they wish.
He combines this ambition with a clear statement that Swift does not want to
'replace the banks' proprietary systems'.
Yet there is clearly a potential for conflict with custodians that provide
high margin services for customers by gathering such information through
their proprietary systems.
The scope for conflict in securities activities is greater than in some of
Swift's potential payment and foreign exchange services because banks wanted
to act as an intermediary there. But plans such as centralised matching of
securities trades by 1997 could threaten the existing role of custodians.
In her Sibos speech, Ms Eversole argued that such value-added products were
not an integral part of its strategy of attending to the needs of its most
important customers - banks. Instead, she said Swift should be 'focused on
building the information autobahn of the financial world'.
Yet the distinction between Swift's different categories of customers is
likely to become increasingly blurred. Its move to admit fund managers in
1992 may be followed shortly by a similar decision to allow limited access
to big corporate users, further diversifying its customer base.
Furthermore, as global custodianship consolidates further, it may be
difficult for the few large banks that specialise in the activity to exert a
controlling influence on Swift. Small banks may in contrast be happy to see
it develop value-added services to lower the cost of entry for such
activities.
Mr Kirby says that Swift's managers 'respect the position of the large
global custodians' but points out that Swift's board decided on the
strategy. He says that Swift wants to 'work with global custodians to define
exactly what we mean by value-added services' now the debate has surfaced.
He argues that 'today's added-value service is tomorrow's commodity' in the
fast-evolving world of custodianship.
This means that Swift should be able to focus on activities which do not
conflict with global custodian shareholders. This is likely to be one of its
largest challenges in the future.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (9): Lack of foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More American companies are based in the Bristol area than any other
foreign-owned businesses, writes Roland Adburgham. An analysis of companies
with a Bristol postcode and a turnover of more than Pounds 1m shows there
are 20 from the US and five from Canada. There are 10 Swedish-owned
companies and five Australian, but only four French, three Irish and two
German.
The analysis was carried out for the FT by Jordan and Sons, the
Bristol-based company information group. It shows the relative lack of
inward investment from abroad in the area. Out of the 664 parent and
subsidiary companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 1m, only 61 are
foreign-owned. Neighbouring south Wales, with the benefit of its government
grants, has been far more successful in attracting overseas companies.
The paucity of quoted companies headquartered in the Bristol area is also
revealed by the analysis. Of leading parent companies, there are only 16
with a full stock exchange listing and another four on the unlisted
securities market. But in this category, there are 219 privately-owned
businesses.
Leading quoted companies, in terms of net tangible assets, include Wessex
Water, South Western Electricity and Bristol Water.
Of the Pounds 1m-plus companies, there are far more engaged in wholesale and
retail distribution than in any other activity. The figure of 27 per cent of
the total compares with 13 per cent in banking, finance and business
services, 12.5 per cent in engineering and 10 per cent in construction.
Chemicals, metals, mining or plastics companies account for another 8.5 per
cent.
Jordans also analysed the overall performance of nearly 500 of the largest
companies (in terms of turnover) in the Bristol area . According to the
latest filings at Companies House, sales year-on-year were up by only 1.6
per cent but pre-tax profits jumped 26.1 per cent.
Companies were helped by a big decline in interest payments of 16.6 per cent
and a reduction in total borrowings of 5.5 per cent. Average gearing fell
steeply from 70 per cent to 39 per cent.
Profit margins improved by 1.1 percentage points to 5.6 per cent and return
on net assets rose slightly by 1.2 percentage points to 11.8 per cent. The
wage bill was up by 3.5 per cent, but numbers employed showed a slight
decline of 0.4 per cent.
Bristol's economic significance in south-west England is shown by the fact
that, out of 5,514 company formations in the south-west in the first eight
months of this year, the city's postcode area accounted for 2,491, or nearly
half. The peak month for Bristol was March with 405 formations, but this had
fallen to 232 in August - or 2.3 per cent of all company formations in
England, Scotland and Wales.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (7): Particularly strong ties - Graham
Bowley takes a look at academic links with industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol is home to two successful universities, both of which enjoy a close
relationship with commercial life in the city, across the UK and abroad.
The University of the West of England, or UWE, the former Bristol
Polytechnic which converted to university status in 1992, has its main
campus in the north of the city.
This area, close to the M4 motorway and Bristol Parkway railway station, is
undergoing rapid development and anyone travelling to the university will
pass through a dramatic landscape dominated by cranes and the skeletons of
new buildings - the headquarters of the Ministry of Defence procurement
operations, and headquarters for Sun Life.
The university is quite comfortable with such rapid change unfolding around
it.
'Being a former polytechnic, we have always had good links with industry,'
said Ms Linda Skinner, director of the university's Centre for Research,
Innovation and Industry, which was set up 18 months ago with the help of a
Pounds 160,000 grant from Department of Trade and Industry.
Its aim is to promote co-operation between the university and industry, to
help local business and to explore ways of putting the university's research
to commercial use.
'What this centre does is act as a middle man between industry and academics
 -the university is very good at coming up with ideas but we do not exploit
what we do as well as we could,' says Ms Skinner. 'Our researchers also work
with companies to develop any unused patents, which the company may have,
into something which is commercially viable.'
Ties are particularly strong between UWE and local business. A quarter of
the university's students come from the south west and 41 per cent of
graduates take up employment in the region. 'We draw many of our students
from the region and we place a lot of our students there, so it is in our
interest to promote Bristol because a thriving regional economy is
absolutely vital to this university,' said Ms Skinner.
The centre has a small-business liaison unit which provides advice and help
to small businesses within a 40-mile radius of Bristol. 'We are continually
asking ourselves how we can interact better with industry in the region and
how we can help businesses to innovate,' said Ms Skinner. She estimates that
of the five businesses a week the centre talks to, 35 per cent end up doing
some sort of collaborative work with the university.
Although it has ties with most industry sectors, the university works
particularly closely with the aerospace industry and Bristol's new
high-technology companies.
UWE works closely with Hewlett Packard, the second-largest US computer
company, which has its European research and development centre on a site
adjoining the university. The two are part of a group developing a new
high-speed communications network for Bristol - an information superhighway
for the Bristol area, called the metropolitan area network, or Bristol Man.
Close by the centre, and also part of UWE, is the Bristol Business School,
which has 3,200 full- and part-time students working for degrees in business
studies, international business studies, accounting and finance and
financial services.
'The latter is particularly relevant, given the growth of the financial
services sector in Bristol,' said Professor Michael Rees, dean of the
Bristol Business School.
Each year as many as 200 students are placed with industry in the UK and
abroad as part of their sandwich year out. The school also offers special
management qualifications for people already at work who wish to take their
training further.
The fastest-growing area in the school - and where the ties with business
are the strongest - are the 'partnership programmes' which the school
offers; courses tailor-made to the needs of a particular organisation. In
this area, the school works closely with Lloyds Bank - which takes about 100
people a year - the Bristol &amp; West building society, NatWest Insurance
Services, and also Avon county council and Bristol city council, to provide,
for example, much of these companies' early in-house training.
Bristol University, one of the UK's leading universities which can boast
several top-class research departments, is situated right at the heart of
Bristol.
Mr Don Carleton, press officer, said: 'The university has both long-term
strategic relationships with local organisations, ranging from very large
multinationals to quite small companies, and at the other extreme short,
sharp relationships of some commercial value.'
He said: 'Agreements are struck at the highest level with companies, ranging
from large multinationals to small local businesses, in acknowledgement that
our futures are intertwined and dependent on each other. Then, at the more
specific level, we have exchanges of staff and of ideas.'
The university has recently won a Pounds 1m grant from the Ministry of
Agriculture of Fisheries and Food to carry out research on applying
processing engineering to food.
The university is heavily involved, along with the UWE, the University of
Bath and commercial partners, with planning for a science park - called
Emersons Green - which is to be located to the north-east of the city. The
aim of the park is to attract new high-technology industries into the area.
'These would create jobs but they would also be consumers of what the
universities do best - there would be a strong demand for our high quality
graduates and research,' said Mr Carleton.
In anticipation of the park, the university is working closely on a Ecu5m
project concerned with advanced computing technologies with Inmos, a
subsidiary of France's SGS-Thomson.
Bristol University offers its own business degree - an MBA in international
business at its international business unit. This graduate course was
introduced in 1991 and is now on its fourth intake of students. The
students, who come from all over the world, can spend time on placements at
businesses in Bristol and have the opportunity of visiting universities
abroad.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (8): Diversity ensures that economy is
resilient - Industry

Bristol, it was recorded by an encyclopedia published in 1813, 'is generally
esteemed the second city in England, for trade, wealth, and number of
inhabitants.'
The encyclopedia listed, among the 'considerable manufacturers,' brass,
copper and lead works, turpentine and sulphur works, and the making of
woollen stuffs, cotton, sail cloth and lace. There were sugar houses and no
fewer than 15 glassworks.
Two thousands ships were annually cleared through the city's docks, but the
encyclopedia noted that, apart from London, Liverpool had become the
greatest sea port in England, 'having exceeded Bristol considerably of late
years.'
The loss of trade to Liverpool was one reason why Bristol steadily slipped
down the league table of UK cities. But Charles Harvey and Jon Press, in
Studies in the Business History of Bristol, published by Bristol Academic
Press, comment that the city has been much more than a maritime centre in
decline.
'On the contrary, Bristol has for a long time enjoyed a diversified economy
which has proved adaptable, resilient, and responsive to national trends.'
Industries have waxed and waned in the city, notably cigarette, chocolate
and footwear manufacture. The Wills company began in the city in 1786, and
when it became part of Imperial Tobacco early this century, had a workforce
of 3,000 people. Today, Imps employs only 600 people at Bristol and
Avonmouth, making cigars.
Other industries, such as railway locomotive and motorcycle manufacture,
have come and gone. The defunct Bristol coalfield at one time produced 1m
tons a year. Aerospace has long been an important industry, but one which
has been contracting. However, the Filton and Patchway works of British
Aerospace and Rolls-Royce still employ a total of more than 10,000 people.
In keeping with the history of industrial diversity, other businesses have
arrived and the city has benefited by never being over-dependent upon a
single industry. The service sector, notably in financial and professional
services, has helped to compensate for the diminution of manufacturing.
In recent times, one expanding industry has been that of media-related
businesses. Bristol is the home of the BBC natural history unit, of the
commercial radio company GWR, and of Aardman Animations, which in March won
an Oscar for its film The Wrong Trousers. HTV, the television company, has
its west of England studios in the city.
United Artists, the US group, has set up a base at Aztec West in north
Bristol for its cable franchise. By late 1997 it will have invested more
than Pounds 320m in a 4,000-mile fibre optical network, cabling Bristol and
Bath and surrounding towns. Its workforce of 350 is expected to increase
further next year.
Another recent arrival at Aztec West is Anderson &amp; Lembke, a
business-to-business advertising agency set up three years ago to serve the
high-tech sector. It chose Bristol, it says, 'because of its easy
accessibility, value-for-money office accommodation and local creative
talent.' Also at Aztec West is Spandex, the supplier of sign-making
materials and computers to the sign-making industry.
Direct mail and telemarketing is a growing business - British Telecom has a
24-hour call centre in Bristol. Colleagues Direct Marketing of Bath has
proved highly successful. In January, NatWest Ventures completed a Pounds 8m
buy-out from ACT Group of Brann Direct Marketing, based in Bristol and
Cirencester. Brann has a turnover of about Pounds 19m and employs 400
people.
Computer-related companies include Systems Team, a systems house set up in
central Bristol in 1982. It has become a leader in providing services to
professional associations and membership organisations.
Hewlett-Packard, the US company, has one of its chief European manufacturing
and technological bases on a 163-acre site at Filton. Its H-P Laboratories
there, employing 270 researchers and scientists, are its largest research
centre outside the group's Californian headquarters.
'We believe that Bristol - with its excellent universities - is an excellent
place to conduct advanced research, and that Bristol has much more to offer
in the area of value-added services than strictly a good place to
manufacture products,' Hewlett-Packard says.
More traditional industries include a Courage brewery and two small regional
brewers, Butcombe and Smiles. The drinks company Hiram Walker, renamed as a
division of Allied Domecq, has its world headquarters in Bristol.
There is also a sizeable printing industry. Oakley Press this year completed
substantial investment in a fully-integrated pre-press and press operation.
But one long-established company, J. W. Arrowsmith, which began printing in
the 19th century, has become a much smaller business.
Arrowsmith was recently the subject of the city's longest industrial
dispute, which ended this autumn after 18 months of picketing. The dispute
began over pay and the plant was picketed after the company dismissed 120
workers and de-recognised their GPMU union.
A related business in the region is packaging, with companies such as DRG
and ASSI, which has a Pounds 30m plant making corrugated packaging at Yate
in Avon.
Other manufacturers include Rotork, the specialist engineer in Bath, which
increased its overseas markets during the recession and exports to more than
60 countries. Engineering company Strachan &amp; Henshaw, part of Weir Group,
designs and supplies handling systems for nuclear power stations. Christies
Panel Products makes fitted bedrooms.
One long-established business is Bryan Brothers, founded in 1913, which has
become one of the UK's largest privately-owned motor groups. Its contract
hire business has a fleet of 8,000 vehicles.
A newer company, in an old tradition, is Architectural Castings, a
management start-up in 1992. It is planning further expansion after an
injection this summer of Pounds 200,000 of equity and loan finance by 3i,
the investment capital group,
To complete the picture of diversity, at least one industry has had a
renaissance since the days of the 1813 encyclopedia: the manufacture of
hot-air balloons (which were piloted, the encyclopedia said, by
'aeronauts.')
Mr Don Cameron, head of Cameron Balloons which he founded in Bristol in
1970, has seen the company become the world's largest maker of promotional
and sports balloons, both hot-air and gas-filled. The company makes about
one a day and exports to more than 30 countries. With a turnover of Pounds
4.5m, it employs 90 people. 'We have never had a redundancy,' Mr Cameron
says, 'and it is our goal never to have one.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (4): Small investors offer big
business potential - Retail financial products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking after the funds of small investors is becoming increasingly big
business for custodians as well as for organisations more directly involved
in retail financial services.
In the US, for example, the mutual fund industry had about Dollars 2,000bn
in assets in 1993, compared with just over Dollars 1,000bn in 1990. More
than one quarter of US households own a mutual fund.
Within the UK market, sales of unit trusts were the striking feature of
retail savings and investments last year. The unit trust industry attracted
a record Pounds 9.14bn of net investment in 1993, and net sales of unit
trusts for the first nine months of this year are higher - at Pounds 7.15bn
 -than for the same period last year.
Many UK investment managers say there is little difference between the
services they require of a custodian for retail financial products compared
with the characteristics they are looking for in a custodian for wholesale
funds.
'There's no difference in pure custody terms,' says Anthony Myers, managing
director of Gartmore's custody subsidiary. The factors he cites as important
include the extent of the network run by the custodian; the way in which it
runs settlement; its general efficiency and electronic capability; and how
good it is at providing reliable intelligence on corporate action.
The differences are, instead, in the additional services provided alongside
custody.
In the UK, financial regulation requires every unit trust to appoint an
independent trustee to look after the interests of unit-holders. This
function - which has no direct equivalent in other forms of investment -
must be fulfilled by an organisation separate from the investment manager,
and it is common for the role to be carried out by the custodian.
So, in appointing a custodian, a UK unit trust manager will look also at the
trustee services available.
Recent changes in unit trust regulation, increasing the responsibilities of
trustees could lead to some changes in trusteeship.
At the beginning of November, the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief regulator, replaced its list of approved securities and
derivatives markets for unit trust purposes with a duty on managers to
ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria.
The change allows unit trusts to invest in a much wider range of emerging
markets, but puts a greater onus on the trustee - which some are reluctant
to accept - as well as the manager.
It could see trustee services move either in favour of the more
broadly-based custodians, which can offer expertise on any given market.
Alternatively, it could lead to fragmentation, so that a manager wanting to
operate a fund in a particular market would go to a trustee with specialist
knowledge of that area.
In America, while no trustee function exists in respect of mutual funds, the
additional services are similarly important in differentiating custodians.
'In the US market, what is most difficult and time-consuming is the daily
pricing of the portfolio: not that many agents can do that as well as the
auxiliary services, and by the time you include fund accounting as well,
there are just a handful of custodian banks,' says Wendy LaBonte, director
of mutual fund marketing for State Street Bank in the US.
The US market is much more highly developed than the UK market in terms of
the auxiliary services offered by custodians, but the UK market is moving in
the same direction.
Last year, SG Warburg set up a new service offering unit trust managers a
combination of trusteeship and administrative services using a single
database.
It has been appointed to handle the administration of the new unit trust
subsidiary to be launched in January by Halifax Building Society, the UK's
largest; and also acts for the newly-created retail financial products
subsidiaries of Leeds Permanent Building Society and for the retail products
business of Invesco, the fund management group.
Though that trend is growing, the impression is still that the banks are
keener to provide the services than many UK investment institutions are to
receive them.
One senior figure in the UK market believes that the reason the market has
not changed more quickly is that UK banks are 'probably a bit behind in
technological development', and US banks do not have a large existing client
base where they can sell the additional services.
The argument for placing administration and custody functions with a
third-party provider is that it reduces costs.
Efficient management of custody and administration increasingly requires
significant investment in technology which is much too large for all but the
largest groups, and expensive even for them.
But the dilemma for the investment institution is whether the third-party is
really going to manage the task better, and how far the task lies within or
beyond its core competences.
'It is hard to see a big insurance company not regarding information
technology and relations with policy holders as a core part of its role,'
one significant investment manager says. 'But a fund management organisation
moving into retail services might take a different view.'
Barry Beale, relationships director of Warburg's custody and investor
services division, draws a distinction between Warburg's services which are
related to the underlying assets and rely on the same database - such as
portfolio administration - and those which are more outward-looking such as
dealing and registration. It is up to the client institution to decide which
facilities it wants, he emphasises.
While the provision of extra services poses a question which will have
different answers for investment institutions, for custodians the picture is
more clearly positive: it is a way of getting further value out of
information which they almost certainly have to have anyway, to carry out
their basic functions.
The extra services, then, are 'added value' both because they can provide
added value to the client, and because they provide a further source of
income in an aggressive market.
'Plain vanilla custody is very, very competitive,' says Mr Beale. 'It's very
difficult to make a serious living out of it. You have always to be looking
to add value.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (5): Empty vaults will bring new
opportunities - Dematerialisation / Crest, the electronic stock market
settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than two years' time Crest, the UK's electronic stock market
settlement system which will largely do away with share certificates, at
least for institutional investors, is due to begin its phasing-in process.
Many other stock markets around the world, both in the developed world and
in the emerging markets, are ahead of the UK in introducing this so-called
dematerialisation.
With no share certificates to look after, are custodians threatened with the
collapse of their business? Not a bit of it. True, their vaults are liable
to be empty.
But the changes bring at least the potential for a significant expansion of
their business opportunities. Plainly, though, custodians will have to be
prepared to adjust their techniques.
'We are very bullish about the whole situation,' says Terry Pearson, head of
external relations at the Royal Bank of Scotland's securities division in
London.
He draws a parallel with the developments seen in the US after stock
certificates were immobilised - that is, were kept in a central depositary
(the Depostitary Trust Company) as a compromise measure falling short of
complete electronic dematerialisation.
'The US restructuring was thought to be the death knell of custody, but it
turned out very differently,' he says. 'The US custodians expanded into many
other areas. The same thing will happen here.'
Thus the American custodian banks developed the Master Trust concept, which
embraces many services including trade reporting, foreign currency control
and elements of performance measurement.
According to Richard Crampton, managing director of the Bank of New York, in
London: 'From a pure custody point of view, dematerialisation won't make
much difference.' Already the UK system is in important respects effectively
dematerialised, he says, because certificates have no validity unless
supported by entries on the company register.
Regular tasks of the custodian, such as handling settlements, transferring
money, maintaining records, collecting dividends and monitoring corporate
actions, will be essentially unchanged. 'The bigger impact will be on the
registrars rather than the custodians,' he says.
Andrew Douglas, a senior account manager with Citibank, offers a similar
view. 'Physical safekeeping of securities is now only a small part of
custody,' he says. 'As the business has developed, the key has been to add
on services.'
In the UK, the original concept of Taurus, the Stock Exchange electronic
settlement system which was expensively abandoned two years ago, was more
worrying for the banks than Crest now is.
Many of the big fund managers were planning to be their own account
controllers and might have taken many processes in-house.
But the failure of Taurus left them with burnt fingers and heavy cost
write-offs. Moreover the successor project Crest is deliberately less
powerful, because ambitions have been scaled down.
Functions not performed within Crest will have to be added on elsewhere.
Accordingly, some UK fund managers - many of whom have offered in-house
custody to pension fund clients in the past - are now thinking about
outsourcing.
Strikingly, the UK's biggest institutional investor, Prudential Assurance,
has this month decided to phase out in-house custody and put the portfolio
administration of Pounds 40bn of UK and international securities out to
tender. Dematerialisation is only one factor behind the decision, but it has
played a part.
According to Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank,
dematerialisation will leave a number of inefficiencies to be tackled.
An institution wishing to be active in the UK investment markets will face
the need to establish interfaces with at least four systems - not only Crest
for equities, but other systems for gilts, money-market instruments and
financial derivatives.
The specialist role for custodians will therefore be secure, says Mr Reid.
'Fund managers have their work cut out competing for their primary business,
let alone competing with their banks,' he observes.
Around the world, Barclays covers some 70 national market places, with two
or three interfaces in each. 'That's our job, not the fund managers'.'
Settlement improvements within the UK are especially focused on increasing
speed, and custodians are looking forward to the indirect benefits this will
bring through the opportunities for expanding their business in securities
lending.
Already UK settlement of equity trades has moved from a fortnightly account
basis to 10-day rolling settlement, and the Stock Exchange recently
announced a move to five-day settlement on June 26 next year.
Eventually, when Crest is running smoothly, three-day settlement will be
introduced.
With time constraints becoming much more pressing, London marketmakers will
have to rely much more on stock lending to balance their books.
'We expect that demand for stock lending will rise fourfold,' says Terry
Pearson, of RBS.
As a result, custodians will have a much greater opportunity to add
responsibilities such as lending on an agency basis on behalf of clients,
and looking after the collateral.
Mr Douglas, of Citibank, also sees plenty of scope here. 'Demand will
increase dramatically,' he says, and from a starting position at which
demand for stock already far outstrips supply. Lending rates may have to
rise if a broad balance is to be maintained.
So there could be scope for expansion of Citibank's specialist lending desk,
which controls stock borrowing and lending around the world.
This is an example of how custodians can aim to develop their expertise in
systems and move higher up the added-value chain. Opportunities could
multiply. For instance, data could be supplied directly to performance
measurement specialists such as WM and Caps.
At Barclays Bank, however, Alistair Reid displays a little more caution.
'Crest does present lots of opportunities,' he says, 'but the institutions
may not wish to pay the appropriate price. Let's wait and see.'
Terry Pearson is rather more forthright. 'The Crest system is deliberately
simple and limited in functionality,' he says. 'Capability has to be added
somewhere else. Custodians are the obvious ones to do it.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (5): Shared strategy devised - Economic
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM

<TEXT>
During the 1980s, Avon was seen as one of the more successful sub-regions in
the UK, with an employment rise of 12 per cent, the biggest increase for any
mainly urban area. The county has 23,000 businesses, employing 400,000
people.
The growth was led by business and financial services with companies
relocating from London and the south-east. This masked the decline in
traditional manufacturing such as tobacco, transport, food, chemical and
mechanical engineering.
By 1991, financial and business services accounted for 16 per cent of the
workforce while distribution, hotels and catering employed 21 per cent.
Manufacturing accounted for only 18 per cent.
The recession braked inward investment from south-east England and jobs were
shed from aerospace and defence industries. Between 1989 and 1991, the
census of employment shows, defence jobs fell by 10 per cent, tourism by 12
per cent and construction by 17 per cent.
An overdue awareness of a need to respond to rapid structural change has
caused the public and private sectors to devise a shared strategy for
economic development. In 1993, they formed the Western Development
Partnership in Avon, an umbrella organisation to pull together previously
unco-ordinated activities.
Its partners include all seven of Avon's councils, Bristol Chamber of
Commerce and Initiative, the regional Confederation of British Industry and
Trades Union Congress, universities and Avon training and enterprise
council.
The WDP, led by Mr Richard Brown, its chief executive, has had a big impact
in stimulating Bristol and Avon to be more pro-active. Taskforces have been
set up for aerospace, high technology and financial services which are
intended to lead to specific initiatives.
A technology and innovation management team, with funding from the European
Konver fund, has been established to advise small businesses to develop new
products and bring them to market.
In September, the WDP produced an agreed strategy for economic development,
including a target of creating 7,000 jobs a year and of reducing
unemployment at a faster rate than the UK average. The strategy seeks to
create a 'marketable and recognisable region' in the west of England.
One of the difficulties for the south-west in promoting its case has been
this difficulty of defining the region, and the multiplicity of development
partnerships which sprung up during the recession. All seven counties have
their own bodies with the result that they often appear to compete rather
than co-operate.
After much lobbying, the Department of Trade and Industry is providing
start-up funding of Pounds 100,000 for a single new agency - the West of
England Development Agency - which will seek to win inward investment for
the five counties of Avon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire.
Devon and Cornwall already have a government-funded development bureau.
A chief executive for the West of England agency, which is chaired by Sir
Michael Lickiss, who heads the Somerset Economic Partnership, is being
appointed and it will be based in Bath. But it is not yet clear how the
relationship between the new agency and the WDP and other county
organisations will evolve.
In Bath, the city council itself decided this autumn it must give more
priority to economic development and to promoting the city as a business
location.
Another initiative is a North American Business Club, set up in February
last year to promote Bristol as a gateway to the UK and Europe. It has
gained members from 100 companies and is the only UK member outside London
of the British-American Business Council, based in Washington, DC.
In the summer, the club hosted a conference on US government procurement
and, this month, a trade mission from the Bristol-Florida chamber of
commerce. More missions are planned next year. Mr Richard Dennery, the
club's president, comments: 'The awareness within the US of Bristol as a
business venue is growing enormously.'
An initiative for Avon's indigenous businesses is the setting up of Business
Link one-stop advice shops, as part of the planned national network. A bid
for funding, backed by Avon Tec and the chamber of commerce, has been made
to the Department of Trade and Industry and it is intended Business Link
should be fully established early next year.
This should help Avon Tec, set up in 1991 and now chaired by Mr Colin Green,
managing director of Rolls-Royce Military Aero Engines, to become better
known. A survey of 820 employers in the county this summer showed the Tec's
main impact had been on large employers with well-developed training
cultures. Among the rest of the business community, it was seen as a
purveyor of government training programmes and had not established its
profile as a business support agency.
The survey showed that most employers recognised the need for change if they
were to grow. They saw the need to improve quality, raise skill levels of
staff and managers, and improve strategic management.
But the report commented: 'A considerable gap still remains between
recognising the need to change and responding to it.' Less than half of the
companies with fewer than 100 employees had sought help in these matters.
Although 68 per cent of the employers provided training, the survey found
that a third of companies - mostly those with 10 or fewer employees - were
unaware of the Tec. Only a small proportion of employers had 'any real
appreciation of the role of the Tec and a detailed knowledge of the
activities it undertakes.'
The report concluded that the Tec needed to work more closely with other
business support agencies through Business Link. 'However, if this
initiative is to make a real impact, it needs to develop a strong portfolio
of services to meet the changing needs of employers, particularly small and
medium-sized enterprises, which all agencies, not just the Tec, have largely
failed to reach to date.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (6): Bristol will regain unitary status -
Local government review is ready to axe Avon council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Avon House, a block of brutal architecture in Bristol which is the
headquarters of Avon county council, the lifts have an automatic voice
intoning: 'Doors closing.'
Soon, the doors will close on Avon council itself. Its abolition is one of
the few near-certainties of the local government review in England. Subject
to parliamentary orders, there will be shadow elections next May to four new
unitary authorities, replacing the existing two-tier structure of six
district councils and the county council, which will disappear in 1996.
Bristol will then regain the unitary status it lost 20 years ago in the last
reorganisation of local authorities.
While there is broad agreement this will benefit the city, there is
disappointment that the government appears to have accepted the local
government commission's recommendation to confine the new council to the
city's historic boundaries.
The conurbation has expanded well beyond those boundaries, notably to the
north. The city council believes that, in strategic and planning terms, the
new authority should have a wider remit.
This view is backed by business groups. Mr Chris Curtis, director of the
regional Confederation of British Industry, says: 'We believe the
curtailment of Bristol to historic boundaries is a serious mistake - a lot
of companies will continue to face a confused planning process, and possibly
worse. Services are still continuing to move out of Bristol, and the
wealth-creating potential of historic Bristol is declining and its capacity
to deal with deprivation is being curtailed.'
Instead, the local government commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has
attached more importance to the views of residents in outlying areas who are
opposed to a Bristol 'takeover.' In consequence, Northavon district council
will merge with Kingswood to form South Gloucestershire, Bath city council
will merge with its neighbouring district Wansdyke, to form Bath and
north-east Somerset. Woodspring, which is based around Weston-super-Mare,
will become North-west Somerset on its existing boundaries.
Uncertainties remain over the transfer of powers. Avon council is by far the
largest employer in the county, with the equivalent of more than 21,000
full-time employees and a budget of nearly Pounds 600m. However, nearly all
the staff are expected to transfer to the new authorities.
In Bristol, there is anxiety that the city council will not be given
adequate resources to cope with its new status. The council argues that its
present standard spending assessment has been inadequate.
It points out that a government-commissioned study ranks the city as the
42nd most deprived district out of 366 district authorities. The combined
assessment of Bristol and Avon councils this year is Pounds 697 per head of
population, compared with Pounds 817 for Coventry, which was ranked the 45th
most deprived.
The city council, supported by many businesses and organisations, is
lobbying for the assessment to be increased. One issue is that Bristol, by
being the regional capital, provides services which those living in outlying
areas use but do not support through their council taxes.
The Bristol Cultural Development Partnership says the city's current
assessment 'is more akin to a minor district than a regional centre.' It
fears the situation could become even more worse when the city takes on
responsibilities at present funded by the county council.
It says the county council is spending Pounds 400,000 this year on
supporting independent arts groups. Nearly all of these arts activities are
Bristol-based. If, under the reorganisation, Avon's budget is disaggregated
on a population basis, then the city would face big problems in supporting
artistic and cultural activities.
Avon council itself is resigned to the fact that the government is
determined to abolish it. Although, in strategic terms, its creation in 1974
made more sense than the restriction this time of Bristol to its historic
boundaries, it is widely regarded as ineffectual and has failed to generate
any popular support. For many years it has been a hung council - the present
make-up is Labour 34, Conservatives 25 and Liberal Democrats 17.
While there is a danger of further indecision in the period leading up to
its abolition, Mr Graham Badman, director of education who has been also
appointed head of external affairs to oversee the handover, stresses that
for months the council has been working with district councils to prepare
for abolition.
One of the internal notes refers to 'wind-down to ensure clean handover.'
Once that has happened, there will be few reminders of the old county except
in such bodies as the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Relatively low risks and
stable earnings - Profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attractions of global custody for the dozen or so banks that are serious
operators in the market stem as much from what it does not involve as from
what it does involve. It is not an activity like lending which requires the
use of balance sheets and ties up capital, nor is it like securities and
money markets, which is profitable in good times but suffers from poor
returns in bad times.
After the lending problems of many banks at the turn of the decade, and the
let-down from 1993's trading annus mirabilis, these advantages are more
firmly instilled than ever in most bankers' minds. Larger banks regard
custody as having an attractive combination of relatively low risks and a
stable annuity-like earnings stream for successful operators.
Furthermore, custody has an obvious allure for many banks because it fits in
well with other activities. Banks that are active in securities and foreign
exchange trading see custody as a means of gaining captive business, so
gaining more volume to pass through existing infrastructures. All have the
basic requirement of being able to clear and settle transactions.
Within the different forms of custodial business, global custody is also
more attractive than domestic master trust and custody work in the US, and
sub-custodianship in other domestic markets because of the growth in the
market, and the potential for higher returns. Most global custodians argue
that prospects are bright because of long-term investment trends.
Ralph Mastrangelo, a managing director at JP Morgan, argues that the
portfolio strategies of US fund managers mean that their need for global
custody services is bound to grow. 'The search for yield is pushing them
into new markets,' he says. This not only means more call for central
management of funds, but the possibility of higher margin work.
One custodian estimates that margins on the ancillary service of stock
lending - one of the most attractive linked businesses - are only 25 basis
points (hundredths of a percentage point) in the London market, but range up
to 300 basis points in some emerging markets. Only banks with a strong
presence in emerging markets as custodians can achieve this return.
Such factors would appear to make global custody a highly attractive
business for all banks. Yet the business remains one of the most highly
concentrated of all banking activities. This is because of the high barriers
on entry, and the intense competition on margins in the forms of custody
which new entrants might be able to perform relatively easily.
Pressure on margins has been a constant of the past five years. Alex
Jablonowski, managing director of Barclays' global services arm, observes
that 'custody is for the birds'. He says that the straightforward activity
of holding securities in safekeeping and collecting dividends on equities
and coupon payments on bonds produces miserly returns.
The forcing down of margins has been accelerated by the sophistication of
the bidding process for the largest contracts. Fund managers have become
used to banks making aggressive quotes for the simplest forms of business to
be allowed to carry out more profitable ancillary services. Basic custodial
work is now done virtually free on the largest contracts.
Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays, argues that banks can 'make
good money by combining different themes' in custodial work even if the core
product has been commoditised. The more profitable ancillary services
include stock lending, foreign exchange contracts and all forms of
derivatives to reduce risk and enter new markets.
Mr Mastrangelo says that most bids are 'based on what a bank can get from
the value-added side. The clients know that they are giving some gravy to
subsidise the basic custody'. Similarly, Mr Jablonowski says that the most
profitable activities are 'across markets and across products. The really
horrible stuff is in a single product in a mature domestic market'.
But the price of entry even to make such bids is also substantial, and
becoming more so. Banks such as Chase Manhattan and State Street which have
concentrated on custody and related businesses since the late 1980s have
large technical infrastructures. At the heart of operations such as Chase's
Infoserve arm are proprietory telecommunications networks.
This has led to a tendency for consolidation among custodians, with smaller
operators in the US selling businesses to those with an established
advantage. Furthermore, fund managers who have undertaken custody are
contracting out, a trend exemplified by Prudential Insurance in the UK to
seek tenders for its global custody.
Despite the pressure on margins in basic forms of custody, the large
operators therefore face the possibility of becoming increasingly dominant
in a growing market, and so being able to reduce their unit costs. The
future of profitability for such operators is likely to centre on their
ability to control the risks of custody, which can be substantial.
One form of risk is credit. Although there is relatively little credit risk
involved in basic custody, custodians have introduced forms of credit risk
in an effort to offer more sophisticated services. One example is the now
common practice of paying dividends or tax rebates to fund managers on set
dates, whether or not the custodian has yet collected the money.
One custodian argues that these forms of risk are not being priced properly
at the moment. Because custodians tend to deal with large creditworthy fund
managers, they have competed for business without taking true account of the
risk of loss. 'The credit risk aspects of this business are not getting
enough attention, and they are not being priced,' he says.
Most custodians believe that an even greater risk is operational: the chance
of failing to complete trades that a custodian has guaranteed, and so having
to make up the shortfall of funds because of movements in securities prices.
The risk can be exaggerated, given that custodians can also benefit from
market movements, but it is particularly acute in emerging markets.
Ms Vivian Eversole, executive vice-president of Chase Manhattan, says that
the biggest risks 'are definitely operational. It is blowing a transaction
or valuing a fund improperly'. Such risks are likely to figure more strongly
in custodians' thoughts if margins on business in emerging markets erode
without corresponding improvements in market infrastructure.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (2): The Pru's move galvanises the
industry - Outsourcing / The implications of the Prudential contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this month, the Prudential, the UK's largest institutional investor,
asked 10 leading international banks to tender for its global custody
business, thus setting off a burst of enthusiasm not seen in the sector in
years.
With Pounds 40bn of global assets to care for, the Pru's contract will be
the largest single slice of new business since the California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers) put its then Dollars 65bn portfolio
out to tender in early 1992.
For those in the global custody business, the implications of the Pru's move
are enormous. It is not simply the thought of a contract to service Pounds
40bn of assets, they say, but the broader question of just who ought to be
in the custody business anyway. If the Pru's vast assets are still too few
to justify it being in the custody business, then surely dozens of other
smaller fund managers in the UK and beyond will also need to consider
outsourcing their asset servicing business.
In making its decision to outsource its custody, David Hanson, a director at
Prudential Portfolio Management, said the company looked long and hard at
its core businesses and decided that custody was not one of them.
'The players who are in here are in for the long haul,' Mr Hanson explained.
'They are investing Dollars 50m a year. Also, you really have to be part of
the banking business to do it well,' he said. 'A bank is capital-hungry. Our
core competence is investment.'
And even if Prudential had decided to make a serious bid for the custody
assets of others - giving it far greater critical mass than it has even now
 -'you're never going to say 'The Prudential - number one in custody',' Mr
Hanson said.
Once that decision had been made, the company, which is the UK's largest
life insurance company, retained a consulting firm to help it find the right
custodian - or combinations of custodians - to suit its needs.
Significantly, the Pru has selected the same firm of consultants which
helped Calpers achieve some of the finest pricing for custodial services
ever seen in the business.
However, the fact that a company the size of Prudential should have decided
to outsource its custody operations is by no means an indication of how much
critical mass a fund manager would need to remain in that business.
Ms Elizabeth Corley, director in charge of custody and investor services at
UK investment bank SG Warburg and Co, says that her company has taken a
different view. At Warburg, which is the custodian for its 75 per cent-owned
subsidiary Mercury Asset Management (MAM), 'custody is a core business'.
MAM began to invest heavily in its custody operations about six years ago
mostly to meet the needs of its fund management clients for whom it offers a
bundled service.
However, because of the significant technology spend that effort required,
MAM began to consider whether it could perform the same service well for
those who are not its fund management clients.
And, indeed, some of its fund management clients, such as the GrandMet Group
Pension Fund, ask MAM to additionally provide the custody for the portion of
assets it does not invest. Recently, it has begun to market its custodial
capacity more widely - earning an added boost from consultants who rate it
highly - and has attracted the business of Invesco, the UK-based fund
manager.
But MAM's recent emphasis on building its own stable of retail financial
products has forced it to invest heavily in information technology not only
for custody but for client record-keeping and other services.
'If you are making that investment, you must ask yourself whether you are
doing it just for yourself, or for others as well, or should you not be
doing it at all,' Ms Corley said. MAM, which is spending Pounds 10m to
Pounds 12m on new systems each year, has decided it wants to do it for
others in addition to itself.
It has succeeded in winning the mandate to manage the new start-up
unit-trust and unit-linked life insurance businesses of the Halifax Building
Society and for Leeds Unit Trust Ltd, the unit trust arm of Leeds Permanent
Building Society.
Also, MAM makes its proprietary retail fund administration system available
commercially.
'I actually think that outsourcing is going to become more important,' Ms
Corley said. 'People are saying 'If I can't do something well and I don't
need to, why should I?''
John Lee, partner at Lee, Schwartz Associates, a consulting firm
specialising in custodial business, agrees that if anything, the trend
towards outsourcing is likely to continue. While news of spectacular new
contracts such as the Pru's may still be rare instances, a far more common
form of outsourcing is occurring under the description of 'white labelling'.
In white labelling, or private labelling, banks which have traditionally
provided custody services find they can no longer afford to do so
efficiently. They may then turn to one of the larger banks to do it for
them, unbeknown to the ultimate client. The client, most likely a fund
manager or insurance company, retains its direct relationship with the bank
which will still be responsible for all reporting and the provision of
administrative services.
Ross Whitehill, senior vice-president, global custody, at Morgan Stanley,
notes that in Europe, where relationship banking remains a key determinant
of who does business with whom, such private labelling relationships look
particularly attractive.
Other banks were inclined to agree. 'We're talking now to two European
institutions who provide global custody. They cannot keep up with the
technology and the big Americans are pillaging all their clients,' said one
banker. Although the banks are asking the custodians whose services they
will 'white label' for non-compete clauses in their respective markets, the
bank believes such agreements will increasingly become a profitable activity
for the largest operators and a hallmark of the custodial business on the
European Continent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (4): Quality is crucial - Professional and
business services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quality of professional services is crucial to Bristol's success as a
financial centre, and from this point of view it is well placed. Accountancy
and law firms are well represented and the standard of service is high.
'The accountancy profession is very healthy in Bristol. The big six national
firms are here as well as some smaller firms,' said Mr Ian Robinson,
managing partner specialising in corporate finance at KPMG Peat Marwick, one
of the largest accountancy practices in Bristol with 17 partners and 260
staff.
'This is a well-fished pond for the client and there is a very good choice
of professional advice available,' he said.
'Regional law firms are winning business from London firms. In Bristol, we
are competing on quality and winning on price to the extent that we are now
a force to be reckoned with,' said Mr Jeremy Phillips, a partner at
Eversheds Holt Phillips &amp; Buck, a recent addition in Bristol to the
Eversheds national network of legal firms.
Mr Phillips is optimistic about Bristol's future and the role the
professions have to play in it. 'Bristol has a bright future as a financial
centre. There are some very encouraging signs and that is one of the reasons
why it was so important for us to have a representative in the city,' he
said.
After years of lobbing, Bristol has recently been granted its own mercantile
court, one of only two outside London. The hope is that it will provide an
opportunity for Bristol to make further headway against London.
Osborne Clarke is probably the leading law firm in Bristol - and probably
also in the whole of the south-west region. It has a staff of 300 in
Bristol, including 28 partners, and acts for, among others, the local
independent television franchise holders HTV, the local electricity company
SWEB and local health authorities.
Osborne Clarke is in a strong position and is expanding - it has an annual
fee income of about Pounds 12.5m, almost double that in 1989.
'The message nationally is that we can offer clients superior access to our
partners, that we have a very high degree of technical skill and we offer
value for money,' said Mr Leslie Perrin, a partner specialising in
litigation .
Second to Osborne Clarke in the region is Burges Salmon, nationally renowned
for its expertise in agricultural law. Bevan Ashford, Veale Wasborough and
Wansbroughs Willey Hargrave are the other leading Bristol firms.
Most of the present growth in the legal profession in Bristol is being seen
in litigation and corporate finance.
Accountancy is also focusing on corporate finance. 'We have seen a very
substantial increase in corporate finance activity since the spring of
1993,' said Mr Andrew Hillman, a partner specialising in corporate finance
at Touche Ross in Bristol, which merged with BDO Binder Hamlyn in October.
'Whereas in 1992 we were doing only two or three transactions, last year we
undertook 13 corporate finance transactions,' said Mr Hillman.
'Audit and tax are also growing, partly because of relationships made
through the corporate finance deals but also because of the economic
recovery.'
He said: 'For three to four years our clients have kept their heads down but
now increasingly they are out looking for business.'
'Business is coming to Bristol,' said Mr Hamilton of KPMG Peat Marwick.
'Incoming firms can get a whole range of professional services including
accountancy, legal advice, venture capital and stockbroking. All of it is
here and it is in good shape.' He estimates that this year his firm will be
doing 50 per cent more business in transactions terms than in 1993.
Solomon Hare is smaller than the 'big six' accountancy firms but is
nevertheless one of the largest of the independent practices in the West
Country. Its client base, says Mr Nicholas Reeve, a partner at the firm, has
tended to be smaller public limited companies with a market capitalisation
of about Pounds 50m 'which are relatively plentiful in this region.'
He said: 'On several of our deals this year we have managed to persuade
clients that the team should be Bristol-based and so we have attracted work
to the other Bristol professions - lawyers, brokers and merchant banks.'
If there is a weakness in the financial support services in Bristol, it is
in stockbroking and merchant banking, which are relatively poorly
represented.
'There is only one local stockbroker to speak of catering for corporate
clients and there is only one merchant bank,' said Mr Hillman. 'That is a
real weakness in the south-west. On the other hand, there is a high level of
actuarial support.'
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, has an office in Bristol with a
staff of seven covering the south-west and Wales area.
On the stockbroking side, there are nine firms operating in the Bristol
area. Probably two of the largest firms are Albert E. Sharpe and Laws &amp; Co.
Albert E. Sharpe, the Birmingham-based broker, took over the private client
operations of Stock Beech in Bristol following the demise of British and
Commonwealth, its parent. Laws &amp; Co., part of Allied Provincial, has a staff
of 24 dealing mostly with private clients in and around the Bristol area.
Rowan Dartington, of which Singer &amp; Friedlander is the largest shareholder,
deals more for institutional corporate clients - the split is 70 per cent
institutional and 30 per cent private clients, according to Mr Barrie
Newton, managing director. He says the firm, which has a staff of 15 in
Bristol, has 20 corporate brokerships and is dealing for 80 mainstream blue
chip institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies.
Despite their general healthy state, there is a wide consensus among those
in the industry that the professions in Bristol face important challenges
over the coming years.
'Historically, many large companies had their headquarters in Bristol and as
a result used the city's financial services a great deal,' said Mr Robinson.
'But many of the decision-makers have now disappeared and been replaced by
subsidiaries and their headquarters in London use London services. In the
last 12 months there has been the beginning of some return of locally-based
companies and it is our job to convince them to use our services here in the
city.'
The professions' success will depend critically on their continuing ability
to offer high quality services at competitive prices and with a high degree
of accessibility compared to their London counterparts.
Mr Martin Warren, a partner at law firm Eversheds Holt Phillips &amp; Buck,
said: 'The rise of the regional firms will continue to depend on being
competitive, providing quality services in specialist subjects and offering
accessibility. Clients want accessibility, despite the age of the fax and
the phone, and however big the London firms are they cannot do that in the
regions.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (3): A more personal service - Private
banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guests to lunch with Coutts &amp; Co's bank in Bristol's Corn Street, the
historic business quarter of the city, are greeted by a frock-coated Mr
Bruce McColl, its manager, and asked to sign the visitors' book with a quill
pen.
While this welcome sets Coutts apart from the usual reception that customers
receive at a bank, it is evidence more of traditional values than its
present-day way of conducting business. Coutts, founded in 1692, is anxious
to show that private banking, far from being outdated, is gaining appeal
with people who want a more personal service. In recent years, it has been
opening branches in several UK cities.
The big banks - and Coutts is owned by National Westminster - have been
coming round to the same opinion. Lloyds Private Banking, second to Coutts
in terms of total funds under management, began as an adjunct to the retail
bank but adopted that name in 1992 to gain a distinct identity. It has 31
offices and, last year, moved its Bristol branch to new premises in Clifton.
For Coutts, Bristol was only its second branch outside London (the first was
at Eton). It opened in 1976 and subsequently a small office was established
in Bath.
The south-west is seen as having a big potential for private banking. Lloyds
says that in the first half of 1994 it gained more than 600 clients at its
offices in the south-west and south Wales and Pounds 145m in additional
funds. This brought the total to more than 8,500 clients and Pounds 1.4bn,
accounting for a quarter of its national business.
Private banking aims to provide a more personal service than the high street
banks. It is, Mr McColl says, about 'getting close to people and
understanding their needs and we have the time to do this.' There is an
increasing emphasis on asset management, with the vast majority of clients
opting to give the bank discretionary management of their funds.
Inevitably, many existing customers are elderly, but Coutts says new clients
tend to be in their 40s and, often, have made large sums in selling or
floating a business.
Mr Nigel Richardson, manager of Lloyds Private Banking in Clifton, says:
'Bristol produces a very high volume of new business. There is a lot of
wealth in the area. It used to be old ladies and widows, but is now tending
to be younger people who have made their way in business but don't have time
to look after their own affairs.' The branch has 1,400 clients with Pounds
200m under management.
In the case of Coutts, which has 1,200 accounts at its Bristol branch, an
average balance of at least Pounds 3,000 must be kept in a current account
to avoid charges. Mr McColl says: 'People are buying a relationship, and are
not terribly excited by what Pounds 3,000 would earn in the Halifax, after
tax at 40 per cent.' For fund management, the usual entry point is Pounds
250,000 and charges are negotiable.
Lloyds has a minimum for fund management of Pounds 75,000 in free assets. Mr
Geoffrey Bailey, chief manager of investment services, says: 'One thing we
don't sell is our own products - if we did, they would have to be better. We
would have a very slim defence if they didn't perform well.' The fee is
determined by the value of the funds - in Lloyds' case, it is an annual 1
per cent and subscription charge of Pounds 140.
Coutts and Lloyds are both anxious to stress that the personal touch is not
at the expense of professionalism. Coutts comments: 'We have a global
expertise and depth of knowledge - we're in 17 jurisdictions around the
world and have fund managers in five key locations investing money.'
Lloyds, like Coutts, cultivates an image to distinguish it from ordinary
retail banking. In Clifton, it occupies a large Victorian house, only
identified by a discreet brass plate. The house, complete with conservatory,
has domestic furniture and aims to create an atmosphere in which clients
feel at home. It is in sharp contrast to most people's main contact with
their bank - a hole-in-the-wall cash dispenser.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (2): Symbol of a resurgence - Bristol as a
financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stand high on Brandon Hill, near the centre of Bristol, and look south over
the impressive city panorama.
This city, the successful, thriving business capital of Britain's south west
in the 1980s, has since suffered a painful recession and the decline of many
of its traditional industries.
Down below Brandon Hill, however, is what many Bristol people believe is a
symbol of a resurgence in the city's fortunes; Bristol's 'jewel in the
crown'. It is large and spectacular, sitting squat on the waterfront at the
heart of the city's docks - the headquarters of Lloyds Bank's UK retail
banking operations.
Lloyds' decision to move its retail operations to the city - where it now
employs about 1,500 staff - in September 1991 is seen by many as the final
seal of approval of Bristol as a leading financial centre. It is on this
role that Bristol people are pinning their hopes for the city's future.
'Bristol has suffered from a severe recession and from its switch from an
engineering and merchant-type background to a more service-orientated
economy,' says Mr John Burke, chief executive of the Bristol &amp; West,
Britain's eleventh-largest building society, which has Bristol as its home.
'But there are now positive signs of recovery and there is a growing
realisation that its attractions now make Bristol second only to London as a
financial centre.'
Bristol &amp; West employs about 3,800 staff, 1,000 of them in Bristol, and has
a network of about 170 branches, 64 of which are in the south-west region.
The fact that many leading national and international companies have chosen
to locate in Bristol over the past few years - Lloyds Bank and the Bristol &amp;
West are not alone in choosing Bristol as a home - is testament to the
qualities the city has to offer as a financial centre.
The insurance industry, in particular life insurance, is strongly
represented here. The most significant insurance start-up in the past few
years - National Westminster Life - chose Bristol as its base; and the UK's
most successful direct marketing company, Direct Line, is shortly to open an
important new operation in the city.
According to a recent report on financial services in the west of England,
by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, about 55,000 people in the Bristol area
are now employed in the financial services sector. If the professions that
provide support for that sector - accountancy and the law - are included,
the number rises to 67,000.
The insurance industry accounts for about 51 per cent of this total, the
report finds. Banking and finance, another important sector, accounts for 22
per cent - the Bristol bank Tyndall, Lloyds' and Coutts' private banking
operations and the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander can all be found
within the city.
Building societies account for 22 per cent; venture capital and other
smaller sectors account for the remainder. The local Chartered Institute of
Bankers has no fewer than 1,484 members.
The report finds that the total assets controlled by financial services
organisations headquartered in the west of England, with Bristol as its
capital, is now in excess of Pounds 190bn.
The qualities that have drawn these companies to the west and to Bristol in
particular are numerous. Mr Michael Edwards, deputy managing director of the
Insurance Service - the direct insurance arm of Royal Insurance - lists most
of them:
'We chose to set up business here because of the good quality and largely
underemployed workforce, the exceptionally good road, rail and air links,
the pleasant environment and the excellent support services such as PR,
marketing, design and print,' he said. 'The people here are fairly lively
and optimistic,' he adds.
The Insurance Service, housed in the futuristic blue Spectrum building, near
the city centre, has been based in Bristol since its start-up in 1987 and
now employs 500 people. The direct insurance sector, which first began in
1985, was hardly touched by the recession, says Mr Edwards. By the end of
last year it had a 20 per cent market share of the UK motor insurance
market. 'It is great for Bristol to have growing industries such as ours
here,' he said.
Add to Mr Edwards' list the strong links that exist between business and
Bristol's two universities and business school, and the large supply of
skilled graduate labour these provide and it is easy to understand why
companies are attracted to the city.
'Bristol is an international magnet for the insurance industry and for
finance,' said Mr Edwards.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (1): Oil for the world's investment
machinery - Global custodians have moved on from the task of merely keeping
securities safe. They are now in the business of asset administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global custody, once a sleepy backwater of the banking industry where clerks
endeavoured to keep securities safe, is no more. Instead, it is a global
multibillion-dollar business which provides the oil for the world's
investment machinery and the glue which holds the system together.
Indeed, custodians say, their sector is saddled with a misnomer. 'We are
really in the asset administration business,' said Valentine Feerick, head
of global trust and custody at Mellon Trust Europe. 'We need to be able to
play a role from the point where somebody agrees to buy a security to the
point where somebody sells it.
For international banks such as Mellon, the core 'master trust' business is
relegated to a mere housekeeping activity. The real business is
up-to-the-minute information provision for clients whose investments are
crossing international borders and time zones at an alarming rate.
In addition to the traditional services of cash and foreign exchange
management, dividend collection, and monitoring corporate actions, clients
want custodians to handle securities lending into esoteric markets,
investment accounting and performance measurement and attribution.
'What our customers will look to us to provide is valuable information that
will help them make the right decisions about their asset strategies,' said
Marshall Carter, chairman and chief executive officer at State Street Bank,
one of the world's largest global custodians. Competition in future years
for banks such as State Street may well come not from other banks looking
for a slice of a lucrative new business but from leading information
providers such as Reuters and Bloomberg which already are adept at sending
information around the world at low cost, Mr Carter said.
Customers will want their custodian not only to collect mountains of data
for them, but to distill it into a readily useable form.
Charles Cassidy, who runs State Street's European custody business, points
out that regulators' efforts to curb risks in securities settlement mean
that clients need even more from their custodian. Earlier this year, the US
Federal Reserve began to charge banks for their intra-day borrowings, a cost
which has now been passed on to institutional investors. 'Money now has a
value during the day and information about money now has a value during the
day,' he said, noting that clients want their custodian to monitor their
borrowings minute by minute to cut the cost of credit.
While clients are demanding an increasingly sophisticated product, they have
been able to exploit fierce competition in the business which is driving
pricing down further. The long-envisioned shake-out has yet to materialise.
However, there are signs that some institutions which provided their own
custody are now re-thinking that strategy - a move which could ease
competitive pressures.
Earlier this month, Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer and a leading
international investment manager, caused a rumble by quietly asking 10
international banks to bid to manage its Pounds 40bn portfolio of UK and
international securities which it handles in-house.
It is the largest single contract since the California Public Employee
Retirement System sought bids for its business in early 1992.
David Hanson, director at Prudential Portfolio Managers, said the Pru simply
made the decision that while it meets its own custodial needs perfectly well
at present, the future requirement for investment in technology had caused a
re-think. Custody, he said, is simply not Prudential's core business and the
insurer would rather concentrate on what it is good at - investment.
However, there are few signs that third-party custodians are retreating from
what is for some a very profitable business. Robert Binney, head of Chase
Manhattan's European custody business, says that custody is the single
largest contributor to Chase's profits for the Europe, Africa and Middle
East regions.
Morgan Stanley, one of the few investment banks to establish a significant
toehold in custody, says that 1993 was a 'banner year' for profits in its
custodial business. In 1994, profits are already up 60 per cent. It is the
fourth most significant contributor to group profits for the bank.
'Everybody is talking about a shake-out in the custody business. But I'm at
a loss to see who is getting out,' said Mr Cassidy. 'But what we do see is a
tiering of the business.'
John Lee, a partner at Lee Schwartz Associates, says that a group of 10
international custodial banks now account for 80 to 90 per cent of the
business worldwide. A further 70 to 80 banks may service significant parts
of individual countries or regions.
Michael Grass, head of global custody at Barclays Bank, predicts that the
degree of annual expenditure on technology and the number of new markets for
which there is a demand for service mean that no bank can afford a
comprehensive service. Instead, 'we will see alliances. Banks will say,
'Look, you offer this service and I'll offer that service and we'll face the
market together'.'
Already, there are signs that Mr Grass's prediction is coming true. Leading
custodians are reporting increasing interest in so-called 'white labelling',
the provision of their service under the brand name of the end-client's own
custodian. The arrangement allows banks which cannot invest in the necessary
technology to retain a long-time relationship with a client while providing
high-technology custodians with an additional source of revenue.
Meanwhile, if there is any trend which has shaped the business in the past
year, custodians say, it has been the pace of expansion into cross-border
investment, particularly from the US which has traditionally been reluctant
to look overseas. That move abroad has taxed the abilities of custodians,
particularly in emerging markets where the flood of foreign investments has
swamped the system in some countries.
According to InterSec Research, a US-based consulting firm, US pension funds
sharply increased their international holdings to 7.4 per cent of all assets
by the end of 1993, up from 4.7 per cent the year before. And despite
weakness in equities markets worldwide, the trend continued into 1994 with
the value of US pension assets invested abroad rising by a further Dollars
22bn in the first half of the year. Most of that went into equities.
And, significantly for the global custodians, there has been a considerable
increase in investment in emerging markets where settlement systems and
custodial services have often been rudimentary.
Baring Securities is predicting that by 2010, roughly 45 per cent of the
world's stock market capitalisation will be in emerging markets.
If there had been any doubts about the need for effective custodial services
in these emerging markets, the example of India would have erased them.
Earlier this year, custodians operating there had to close their doors to
new foreign investment and set limits for existing customers as the
paper-based system creaked to a virtual standstill.
And despite the introduction of a number of reforms intended to ease the
paper crunch, custody in India is still threatening the ability of
foreigners to invest there. GSCS Benchmarks, a publication which tracks the
performance of custodians in each country, estimates that by the third
quarter of 1994, three out of every four trades were still failing to settle
on time. 'Simply stated, the situation in that market has reached a point
where any prudent fiduciary, whether a money manager or a custodian, should
be advising clients not to invest there,' GSCS said in its latest bulletin.
India is not alone, GSCS says. Malaysia is showing signs of proving equally
problematic and even some mature markets, such as Japan, have relatively
high levels of trades which fail to settle on time.
Overall, the pressures on custodians to service arcane markets and meet
increasingly sophisticated needs is taxing the industry's imagination and
its ability to finance further technological development. Long-term, only a
handful of international operators are likely to rise to the challenge.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (1): City in search of a higher status -
Bristol has realised that it must take action if it is to improve its
position in the league table of British cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol is a city in search of a new role. It is the economic hub of
south-west England and in the top 10 of UK cities in population. But two
centuries ago, it was the second city in England. For generations, it
complacently lost ground in terms of status.
The recession of the early 1990s caused attitudes to change. During the
1980s, Bristol and the surrounding county of Avon benefited from business
relocations from south-east England and a rapid growth in the financial
services industry. But the recession not only curbed that growth but
coincided with the impact of the peace dividend on the defence and aerospace
industries, an important part of the local economy. Only last week, another
550 redundancies were announced at British Aerospace's plant at Filton,
north Bristol.
In consequence, the city has realised it must take action, if it is not to
slip further down the league table of UK cities. There is a belated
awareness that it has not fulfilled its potential.
That it has greater potential is undoubted. Mr Brian Leonard, director of
the Government Office for the South West, one of England's new integrated
regional offices, says: 'It should be a top-flight national and European
city. There is absolutely no reason why it can't be those things, because of
its strengths - the strengths are enormous.'
These include its proximity to the M4 and M5 motorway network, the existing
Severn bridge to Wales and the second crossing, due to open in 1996. There
are main-line railway links and a thriving port, although the local road
system is inadequate. The maritime and trading history - the Society of
Merchant Venturers, founded in 1552, is still influential - gave the city
six miles of quayside. There are handsome Georgian and Victorian buildings,
even if the centre is despoiled by unsightly post-war blocks. And the county
includes the world heritage city of Bath.
For employers, Bristol and Avon offer a high standard of education with
three universities and a skilled workforce, especially in engineering and
financial services. The west of England, according to an analysis by Coopers
&amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, is the largest UK regional centre for
financial services in terms of employment. A survey this year of 500
executives, carried out for Management Today magazine and Black Horse
Relocation Services, showed Bristol was the most popular choice for
relocation.
The recession, however, showed up the weaknesses and caused Bristol to
rethink its role. Perhaps because it offers an agreeable way of life, it is
not a dynamic city - the only sense of urgency is at 5pm when people start
heading for home. It lacks other qualities which make a great city. Its
shopping is outclassed by Bath and although it is seen as relatively
prosperous, it has been regarded as a city riven by factionalism.
The business community viewed the Labour-led city council as unwelcoming and
obstructive. Partly in consequence, most recent development has taken place
to the north of the city, in another local authority area. South Bristol, in
particular, has been left with intransigent economic and social problems.
There are other pockets of deprivation and many homeless people.
Government showed its disdain for the city council by imposing a development
corporation in 1989 and rejecting two bids for City Challenge grants. Last
year, the city failed to win European Objective 2 funding for areas in
industrial decline.
The council, under local government reorganisation, will benefit by
regaining unitary status with the intended abolition of Avon county council
in 1996. But the government has not accepted the argument - which is
supported by business groups - that the city should embrace more of the
conurbation.
Avon council, which never won popularity, is resigned to its fate, but the
city council has undergone a conversion in its attitude to the private
sector. 'There has been a sea-change here,' commented one senior officer.
The change began with the sale of the port in 1991 and has been further
encouraged by a new chief planning officer, Ms Diana Kershaw, and chief
executive, Ms Lucy de Groot, who was appointed in March.
There is, Ms de Groot says, 'a very genuine spirit of active partnership.
There are real players to work with - we have a very good relationship with
Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative (the Chamber has merged with a
business ginger group, the Bristol Initiative).
'What's happened in the last year is a recognition that there are problems
which cannot be solved by individual interests doing their own thing, or
waiting for the next cycle of the economy.'
Mr Chris Curtis, director of the south-west Confederation of British
Industry, comments: 'We see at last local authorities realising that
planning and land-use policies have a direct bearing on economic growth  -
at last, that is realised in Bristol.'
Part of the Government Office's role is to ensure the south-west's case is
given a fair hearing in Whitehall, which appears responsive to the evidence
of changed attitudes in Bristol. This month Pounds 6.2m was granted to
improve a deprived estate in Hartcliffe.
The city now has a sponsoring minister - Lord Astor, a national heritage
minister - as a direct link with government.
The most significant outcome of the spirit of co-operation is the Western
Development Partnership, a public and private sector forum set up last year
to co-ordinate economic strategies in Avon and promote the sub-region.
The partnership, together with similar bodies in the four neighbouring
counties, has convinced the Department of Trade and Industry to provide
Pounds 100,000 initial funding for an umbrella agency to attract inward
investment to the west of England.
Within Bristol, another partnership is the Harbourside project for what
should be the city's best waterfront site at Canon's Marsh. Typically, it
had been allowed to decay for decades, apart from the notable recent arrival
of Lloyds Bank retail headquarters.
The council is promoting Harbourside, with other landowners and the chamber
of commerce, as 'the single most significant development in Bristol in the
past 40 years'.
The more positive attitude comes as the local economy shows some resurgence.
Unemployment in the city's travel-to-work area has fallen to 8.1 per cent.
The latest quarterly survey by the chamber of commerce showed 76 per cent of
manufacturing companies and 72 per cent of service companies reported
improvements in turnover, although fewer than 40 per cent were operating at
full capacity.
'Undoubtedly there is a recovery taking place,' says Mr Curtis. 'But the
recovery is not spread evenly - it is only companies with a particular
market position which are doing well, the others are static. Investment is
certainly improving, but employment in manufacturing is continuing to
decrease.'
Mr Donald Merrylees, director of the Bristol and Western Engineering
Manufacturers Association, says: 'Things are looking better - the majority
of businesses are busier than two or three years ago. But there aren't long
order books and margins are still fairly tight.'
Uncertainty about the recovery is reflected in the city's lack of clarity
about its future. Manufacturing has become much less important than the
service sector but, says Ms de Groot: 'It can't just be a professional city
 -there have to be things for the professionals to be doing.'
Mr Leonard comments: 'Bristol can set its sights high - but it has to
mobilise to be successful and that's not easy.' It needs, he believes, to
look for allies and learn from the tactics adopted by other cities and
regions.
One new tactic is the Bristol Regeneration Partnership, formed by the public
and private sectors to bid for project funding from the government's single
regeneration budget. Its first objective is 'to promote Bristol's image as a
vibrant European regional capital'.
The city may not have that image yet, but at least it has the ambition.

VSEL continued to power ahead on rumours of an imminent increased offer for
the submarine maker from electronics giant GEC, rising 15 to 1535p for an
advance over the past two trading days of 40.
The December 7 deadline for a decision from the Office of Fair Trading on
whether to refer either of the two competing bids for VSEL - British
Aerospace is the other contender - to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
is just over a week away.
The odds on Sir Arnold Weinstock and his team at GEC upping the ante before
hand look to have shortened significantly in recent sessions. BAe added 3 at
455p, pushing the value of its all-share offer above 1500p. GEC, which
improved slightly to 274 1/2 p, has an all-cash offer of 1400p on the table
and is expected to lift this to at least 1550p.

<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies (recs) advanced as the market looked beyond
the Budget and to the forthcoming results season, with its possibility of
big dividend payouts.
Analysts said worries about a possible windfall tax on excess earnings had
been discounted. And, although all ears would be on possible comments about
the future of the National Grid, investors were beginning to concentrate on
the interims, which begin with Seeboard on Thursday.
Mr Stephen Doe of Hoare Govett commented: 'We could see outstanding
dividends of up to 40 per cent from some of these companies.' Seeboard,
which has been trading around its all-time high, eased 1 1/2 to 408p.
Northern and Yorkshire, both bought actively by Swiss Bank according to
dealers, rose 22 to 809p and 10 to 721p.

FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market in good shape ahead of
Budget - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market continued its rehabilitation process yesterday, and was
supported by renewed steadiness on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial
Average built on Friday's good performance.
Aiding the domestic market's confidence was a growing feeling that the
government would comfortably get its EU contributions bill through the House
of Commons last night. And with the political wind said to have shifted in
the prime minister's favour, there was also a better feeling around the
markets in terms of the Budget.
Dealers were taking the view that the market's recovery boded well.
'Although you can never be sure, it seems unlikely that there will be many
downside shocks in the Budget, judging by the market's performance today,'
said one.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended only marginally below the day's best and a net
13.6 up at 3,047.1. There was a similarly strong showing from the market's
second-line issues, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settling 9.7 firmer at 3,490.0.
One area of disappointment was the level of business in the market, which
remained depressed after the recent heavy losses and amid persistent fears
of further big retreats by the market.
Turnover, although boosted by at least two programme trades, one very small
and the other of medium size, reached 560.6m shares. Non-Footsie turnover
accounted for 350.8m, or 63 per cent of the total. The Stock Exchange
revealed that customer business last Friday just about crept over the Pounds
1bn level.
The Footsie began the session on a firm note, up 6.4, and moved ahead
steadily as some of the more optimistic fund managers picked up what they
perceived to be cheap stock ahead of the Budget.
Marketmakers, still traumatised by last week's steep falls, were said to
have been running level to short books and were quick to lift their dealing
levels at the appearance of any meaningful demand.
The early wave of buying interest drove the Footsie up to the day's high,
3,049.8, over lunchtime, but interest subsided thereafter, as dealers began
to manoeuvre their trading books to mostly level positions in front of the
Budget.
Wall Street extended last Friday's recovery trend, moving quickly to record
a 30-point gain on the day, before slipping off to show a rise of 20 points
an hour and a half after London had closed.
Although preoccupied with the Budget, equity traders in London will have to
keep a weather eye on Wall Street, which has to deal with a long list of
important economic data this week. The numbers include a final revision of
third-quarter gross domestic product, expected tomorrow, the highly regarded
National Association of Purchasing Management index, due on Thursday, and
Friday's employment report.
Strategists said that any rise much in excess of an expected increase of
225,000 in US non-farm payrolls could bring renewed pressure for a further
tightening of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, which was seen as
the main cause of big falls across international stock markets last week.
The ever-present threat of a windfall profits taxation continued to unnerve
some investors in the utilities areas. There was, however, good support for
some of the electricity stocks, with one of the big European securities
houses chasing issues such as Yorkshire Electricity and Northern
Electricity.
NatWest Securities sounded a note of caution ahead of the Budget. In its
latest Equity Market Commentary, the stockbroker noted that equities have
moved in the opposite direction to gilts over the last week, and pointed out
that this suggested that markets are worrying about the outlook for growth.
'In this context,' NatWest said, 'it is worrying to see downgrades
outnumbering upgrades in November - for the first time since February.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved higher, but activity was low and there was little
real attempt to lead the cash market in spite of the development of a
comfortable premium during the afternoon session, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract had reached 3,055 at the close of pit
trading, up 19 points. The premium to cash equities was around nine points,
or a full four points above fair value.
The steadiness of the premium over the cash market was no real guide to
trading volume, with contract numbers again falling short of 10,000 in a day
that could do little more than consolidate ahead of today's Budget
statement.
There was a small amount of two-way trade during the morning, which pushed
the premium to cash equities down to around two points, but this fizzled out
around midday.
Wall Street opened strongly, but in the thin conditions the December Footsie
future could only drift upwards, with most traders deciding to call an early
halt to proceedings. At the 4.10pm official close it was 11 points under its
best for the day.
Traded options volume was also flat, dipping to 17,732 lots, from 21,025 on
Friday. Call and put volume was fairly evenly matched, while FT-SE and Euro
FT-SE trades accounted for just over 10,000 contracts.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail shares benefit from
Thanksgiving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices bounced back vigorously from last week's declines as
investors looked for good value amid the wreckage of the sell-off, writes
Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.29 up at 3,739.56. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.87 to 454.16 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 3.20 to
745.72. NYSE volume amounted to 265m shares.
The Dow fell more than 140 points in the first three days of last week, and
then posted a 33-point recovery on Friday in extremely low volume. The
market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Some analysts still believe there may be a traditional year-end rally but
most are bearish about the longer term prospects for the market. Statistics
released early in the morning showed sales of existing homes had risen by
0.5 per cent in October, in spite of increasing interest rates, and many
fear such data could prompt the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates again
in the near term, thus depressing corporate earnings.
Most leading retail companies rose after reports from shopping malls across
the country of a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Among the stores, Nordstrom
gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 46 1/4 , Gap Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36, Ann
Taylor Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 3/8 , Dillard Department Stores Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 28, Dayton Hudson Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 78 5/8 , May
Department Stores Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 36 and Wal-Mart Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 23 7/8 . JC Penney fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 3/8 .
RJR Nabisco Holdings was unchanged at Dollars 6 1/4 in spite of news from
the consumer products giant that it was developing a smokeless cigarette.
Campbell Soup held at Dollars 43 3/4 after announcing that it had agreed to
buy Pace Foods, the salsa maker, for Dollars 1.1bn. Campbell said the deal
would probably dilute earnings per share in 1995 and 1996.
Canada
Toronto drifted lower in light, directionless trading, in spite of the solid
advance by the New York market. Analysts said local trading was quiet as
investors remained a bit gun-shy after the sell-offs last Tuesday and
Wednesday.
The TSE 300 composite index closed 10.85 points down at 4,088.40, while
falls outscored advances by 383 to 311 after volume of 36.8m shares. Eight
of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by gold, financial, oil and
communications stocks. Paper, conglomerates and industrial product issues
rose. The golds group fell 1.70 per cent as the New York spot bullion price
lost USDollars 1.50 to USDollars 383.10 an ounce.
Mexico
The bolsa ended sharply higher on mainly local demand as investors bet on a
smooth transition of power later this week. The IPC index climbed 77.66 or
3.12 per cent to 2,562.83.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is due to hand over power to
President-elect Ernesto Zedillo on December 1.
Telmex ADRs rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53 7/8 , while in Mexico its 'L'
shares gained 2.22 per cent. Turnover in Telmex accounted for half the
bolsa's 72.7m shares traded yesterday.
Venezuela
The tone was easier in Caracas as the forthcoming share subscription from
Electricidad de Caracas weighed on sentiment.
The Merinvest composite index slipped 0.60 to 116.64.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses search for inspiration
amid dull trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Continent's bourses mostly started the week with little desire to move
ahead.
FRANKFURT struggled to make progress and the DAX index closed the official
session a scant 6.83 higher at 2,058.45, losing this in the Ibis session to
settle at 2,050.82. Turnover came to DM4bn.
In chemicals, Bayer, up DM4.30 at DM344.30, led the way after reporting a
third-quarter profits rise of more than 30 per cent compared with the same
period in 1993.
The company said that it expected to see a continuation of performance
throughout the rest of the year and might lift the dividend payment from the
DM11 level of 1993. In common with the market, the stock drifted lower in
the post-bourse, to close at DM342.10.
Elsewhere, BASF firmed 20 pfennigs to DM307.50 and Hoechst, which releases
figures tomorrow, rose 50 pfennigs to DM318.00.
The car sector concentrated on Volkswagen, off DM10.60 at DM441.20, and then
to DM43.50 in the post bourse, as Deutsche Bank downgraded its 1995 earnings
per share forecast to DM24 from DM32.
PARIS notched up an unimpressive rise, while turnover was an unexceptional
FFr3bn. The CAC-40 index added 6.49 at 1,952.38.
Rhone-Poulenc sank FFr2.30 to FFr134.50 following what was perceived as
unfavourable comments in the local media by the company.
Carrefour, which benefited earlier in the session from an upgraded opinion
from Merrill Lynch, closed the day just FFr1 higher at FFr2,150. Mr Charles
Allen, European retail analyst at Merrill, said that he had been positive on
the company for some time, given its strong exposure to developing markets
and the prospect of 20 per cent earnings growth over the next five years.
MILAN staged a broad advance, making the most of the calmer political
situation, but Credito Italiano was a heavy loser as speculation grew that
it was about to raise its bid for Credito Romagnolo. The Comit index
finished 4.04 higher at 627.21.
The FIB 30 futures index made a reserved debut, although all three contracts
quoted registered gains. Futures volumes were modest, but dealers said that
this was to be expected as investors waited to see how the index fared
before committing themselves.
Romagnolo, which rallied 3 per cent last Friday, was suspended yesterday,
pending an announcement.
Italiano fell L66 or 4 per cent to L1,572 amid expectations that it would
raise its bid for Romagnolo, and also seek more than the 48 per cent stake
mooted when its bid was launched a month ago.
Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's industrial holding company, appreciated L32 to
L1,801 while Olivetti was L26 stronger at L1,891, amid reports that Mr De
Benedetti was willing to sell his 5 per cent stake in Romagnolo.
ZURICH put in a firm early performance in response to the dollar and bonds,
but edged back from its best levels on a lack of follow-through buying. The
SMI index finished 6.9 higher at 2,579.4.
UBS bearers dipped SFr5 to SFr1,130. After the bourse closed, the bank said
that the Zurich district court had imposed a temporary bar on the
registration of changes to by-laws, agreed by last week's extraordinary
shareholders meeting, which agreed the creation of a single category of
shares. The bank added that it was not surprised by the decision.
Bearer shares in Von Roll picked up SFr31 to SFr230 on the view that the
price had fallen too far last week after news that the technology group was
cutting its equity capital by 90 per cent.
A SFr35 advance in Bank Julius Baer to SFr1,280 was attributed to a buy
recommendation.
AMSTERDAM picked up ground after Friday's loss but activity was slack. The
AEX index gained 1.99 to 408.44.
Royal Dutch strengthened 90 cents to Fl 186.70 with Paine Webber of the US
said to have raised its opinion on the stock.
OSLO finished higher as unofficial estimates of very heavy turnout in the
country's EU referendum, and the last minute opinion polls, raised the
prospect that supporters of membership might win the day. The All-share
index closed 3.75 higher at 608.52 in turnover of NKr304m.
Norske Skog Free, regarded as having much to gain from a 'yes' vote, were up
NKr4 at NKr177.
Dealers noted that a 'yes' could, paradoxically, lead to a sharper market
fall than a 'no', since a majority was unlikely to be wide enough to secure
automatic parliamentary ratification, leading to further weeks of
uncertainty.
STOCKHOLM strengthened in slow dealing, with the result from Norway one way
or the other unlikely to have a significant impact on prices. The
Affarsvarlden general index put on 7.2 to 1,502.8.
MoDo B gained SKr2 to SKr350.50, following an upgrade.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage and public
fund buying helps Nikkei rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage buying and purchases by public funds pushed share prices higher,
and the Nikkei 225 average snapped out of weakness following five
consecutive sessions of declines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 144.43 firmer at the day's best of 18,811.36 after opening
at a low of 18,727.75. Activity, however, was slow and volume totalled 184m
shares, against 260m.
A higher futures market pushed up stock prices, while public funds absorbed
selling by overseas investors. But most investors remained absent due to
continued worries over share price movements on Wall Street.
Traders fear that a fall in US shares will prompt profit-taking in the Tokyo
market by US pension fund managers, who have been active buyers since the
start of the year. A further weakening of the yen could also prompt selling
by overseas investors eager to lock in foreign exchange profits on their
Japanese stock investments.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.40 to 1,491.42, while the
Nikkei 300 put on 1.43 at 274.16. Rises led falls by 656 to 332, with 189
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.13 at 1,226.99.
In spite of the rise in the indices, 63 issues hit lows for the year. The
lack of fresh news on the main market triggered some buying of
small-capitalisation stocks on the second section, the latter's index
advancing 14.76 to 2,069.10.
Nippon Soda added Y17 at Y587 on reports that it was seeking to market a
high-tech glass that cleans itself using ultraviolet sun rays. Speculators
sold Ashimori Industry, which fell Y30 to Y649.
Japan Airlines lost Y29 at Y681 on reports disclosing its huge unrealised
foreign exchange losses. The company said it had around Y176bn in exchange
losses stemming from 10-year forward rate contracts made in 1985 to 1986.
Brokers, which have been weak on fears of poor earnings, rallied. Nikko
Securities rose Y20 to Y1,020 and New Japan Securities Y15 to Y645.
High-technology shares were higher, Oki Electric gaining Y14 at Y693 and NEC
Y10 at Y1,150, but Sony slipped Y20 to Y5,140.
Privatisation issues were firmer. Japan Tobacco improved Y1,000 to Y961,000
and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y5,000 to Y834,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 64.39 to 20,810.72 in volume of 16.8m
shares.
Roundup
A lethargic mood afflicted much of the region.
SEOUL extended early losses on aggressive selling by institutions moving
into cash, and the composite index receded 11.97 to 1,069.48. Volume,
however, was a light 31m shares, compared with a recent daily average of
50m.
Dealers said concern about a liquidity squeeze also cast gloom on the
market, adding that some institutions had been forced to buy corporate bonds
to limit recent yield rises as a result of tight liquidity.
HONG KONG finished little changed, with sharp early gains falling victim to
caution about the future direction of US financial markets. The Hang Seng
index ended 3.54 up at 8,662.37 after touching 8,751.18. Turnover dipped to
HKDollars 2.2bn from Friday's HKDollars 2.7bn.
HSBC topped the actives list and held steady at HKDollars 86, followed by
Hongkong Telecom, which gained 30 cents at HKDollars 15.35, and Hutchison,
unchanged at HKDollars 31.30.
Players noted that index futures had stayed at a discount to the spot index
until very late in the day, adding further to market wariness.
SINGAPORE followed the same course, closing flat after trimming most of its
early gains in a trendless market. The Straits Times Industrial index gained
only 0.22 at 2,237.97, after dropping from the day's peak of 2,254.83.
Singapore Telecommunication, which reported a 13.8 per cent rise in net
earnings, shed 3 cents to SDollars 2.97.
Analysts said funds were only likely to become interested in the stock when
it fell more in line with market val-uations.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted for much of the day before ending weaker as investors
liquidated holdings near the close to trim losses. The composite index
slipped 6.29 to 1,005.23 in estimated volume of 79.8m shares.
Country Heights, the property developement group, rose 90 cents to MDollars
6.90 on good corporate results.
TAIPEI drifted down amid late profit-taking after rises in the previous two
trading days. Brokers said they expected further consolidation before the
December 3 elections.
The weighted index lost 55.45 at 6,384.20 after an intraday high of
6,475.22. Turnover was TDollars 34.2bn.
Profit-taking focused on textiles and steels, which had gained most in
previous sessions: Shinkong Fibres retreated TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 30.80
and steel group Kao Hsing Chang TDollars 1.30 to TDollars 29.30.
Low-priced fund shares which are expected to issue high dividends in early
1995 attracted some buying from institutional investors, with Core Pacific
moving up TDollars 0.10 to TDollars 11.35.
President Enterprises rose TDollars 0.50 to TDollars 55 on news that five
foreign companies planned to invest TDollars 1.9bn to buy 12 per cent of its
unlisted affiliate President Chain Store. Farmers Bank climbed by the daily
7 per cent limit to TDollars 48.10 on its debut.
MANILA fell sharply at the close as investors sold holdings in major issues,
including Petron. The composite index lost 1.6 per cent.
Petron was hardest hit during the market's retreat, falling 4.6 per cent to
20.50 pesos.
Property shares, which in early trade showed resilience, also fell:
Filinvest Land declined 2.12 per cent to 9.20 pesos and Megaworld Properties
dipped 1.5 per cent to 16.25 pesos.
SYDNEY was firmer but sentiment remained cautious as investors looked to the
start of trading in New York. The All Ordinaries index closed 1.6 up at
1,918.0 in turnover estimated at ADollars 312m. The December futures
contract was 7 ahead at 1,900.
Among banks, ANZ lost 6 cents at ADollars 3.98 following recent gains on
better than expected results last week. Other banks were also weak, NAB
losing 2 cents at ADollars 10.72.
BANGKOK fell on a lack of incentives after gaining almost 10 points in the
morning. The SET index closed 7.26 lower at 1,342.13, after fluctuating
between 1,331.87 and 1,358.86, in thin turnover of Bt3.52bn.
Profit-taking, particularly in finance counters, surfaced after the index
moved closed to the 1,359 resistance level, according to brokers.
Buying interest emerged in bank and building materials stocks before the
close. The building materials sector, led by Siam Cement which jumped Bt24
to Bt1,360 on a 34 per cent rise in net profits, was the biggest gainer.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges give sterling the benefit of the
doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pound traded steadily yesterday ahead of the important parliamentary
vote last night on the EU Finance bill, and the UK Budget today, writes
Philip Gawith.
Markets appeared to take the view that Mr John Major, the prime minister,
would weather his current difficulties. Sterling closed in London at
DM2.4453, from DM2.4366 on Friday, and Dollars 1.5632 from Dollars 1.5631.
Market activity was generally very subdued, with UK investors sidelined
ahead of the Budget, and a preponderance of US data at the end of the week.
One market theme was the reversal of last week's shift between bonds and
equities. Yesterday equities were firmer, while interest rate markets lost
ground. The longer dated contracts of Eurodollar interest rate futures shed
10 to 15 basis points.
The dollar ended  1/2 pfennig firmer at DM1.5643, from DM1.5591, but easier
at Y98.575 from Y98.765. In New York it closed at DM1.5665 and Y98.675.
In Norway the krone firmed as opinion polls indicated a possible 'yes' vote
in the referendum on EU membership. It finished at NKr4.36/DM, from NKr4.384
on Friday.
The Italian lira benefited from talk of it possibly re-entering the European
exchange rate mechanism, and closed at L1,031 per D-Mark from L1,038.
In Israel, the shekel weakened against the dollar, but gained against other
currencies when short-term interest rates rose by 1.5 percentage points to
16.3 per cent. The shekel closed the daily tender at Shk3.053 to the dollar,
from Shk3.049. The basket of foreign currencies traded at Shk3.3965 per
basket, from Shk3.3984 on Friday.
Most of the movement in sterling occurred during Asian trading, but traders
said it was significant that there had been no attempt to sell pounds during
European trading.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'Sterling/D-Mark
recovered well, thanks to the perception that Major is going to win the
vote. The market has taken the view that he will still be the prime minister
at the end of this week.'
He said that if politics were removed from the equation, sterling had the
potential to improve another 2 to 3 pfennigs. Mr Cocker predicted that
sterling would probably benefit today from a rally in gilts assuming, as
widely predicted, that the Budget will reveal a sharp fall in the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement.
Analysts said the reversal of fortune in equity and bond markets reflected a
reappraisal of the likelihood of another US interest rate rise this year.
Mr Cocker said that while underlying sentiment towards the dollar had
clearly improved, he found it difficult to predict it moving much higher at
the moment. 'The interbank market is sitting a little bit long of dollars,
and there does not seem to be a desire on the part of external buyers to buy
dollars.'
He added that the dollar was likely to trade in a fairly narrow range ahead
of the jobs report on Friday. 'In employment week, you rarely see the dollar
do much in the first few days, unless other factors come into place.'
In the longer term, many analysts are bullish about the dollar. Goldman
Sachs concluded a recent review, saying: 'Current interest rate
differentials are probably wide enough to support the dollar against the yen
and D-Mark. And the dollar is likely gradually to appreciate further as
Federal Reserve officials tighten monetary policy further over the next
several months.'
Goldman Sachs added: 'We continue to forecast a yen/Dollars exchange rate of
Y103 and a DM/Dollars rate of DM1.57 on a six-month time horizon.'
Mr Mike Rosenberg, manager of international fixed income research at Merrill
Lynch, took a more cautious view. He argued that the Fed is still 'behind
the curve' in combatting inflation, 'and as long as that remains the case,
the dollar is still at risk of moving lower again'.
He added, though, that the recent rise in US rates has bought the Fed some
time. 'If the Fed uses that time wisely, and gets back on the curve, the
dollar will eventually bottom and ultimately move higher; until then, it is
too early to be talking about a fundamental turn in the dollar's value.'
In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds
250m shortage at established rates. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 1/16 per
cent from 6 1/8 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deficit forecast steadies
London coffee futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A forecast from Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation of a
bigger-than-expected world supply deficit in the 1995-96 season steadied
coffee futures in London yesterday.
The January futures position at the London Commodity Exchange, which last
week dipped below Dollars 3,000 for the first time since late June, closed
Dollars 25 higher at Dollars 3,013 a tonne after touching Dollars 3,040
earlier in the day.
Dealers said early buying had been encouraged by the Colombian forecast,
which suggested that demand would outstrip supply next year by 11m bags
(60kg each). Higher green-coffee imports by Germany during August, compared
with July, also helped, a trader told the Reuters news agency.
Last week's Dollars 400-plus plunge to Dollars 2,870 a tonne followed news
that Brazilian coffee stocks were higher than most analysts had estimated.
Over the previous two weeks the January price had slipped Dollars 320 after
Brazil issued an official assessment of its frost- and drought-damaged
1995-96 crop that was broadly in line with market estimates. Speculators,
confident that no further market shocks were imminent, began selling their
long positions; and the resulting lower prices attracted no significant
roaster buying.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm leaders attack set-aside
delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British farm leaders yesterday attacked the European Parliament for holding
up implementation of a cut in the amount of arable land which European Union
farmers have to leave uncultivated as 'set-aside' next year.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said that the
procedural hold-up by the parliament in giving its opinion on the cut was
causing farmers 'delay and uncertainty'.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, agreed that the delay was
'irritating' as it was becoming too late for farmers to make drilling
decisions for next year.
The reduction of 3 percentage points to 12 per cent in the amount of land
that arable farmers have to set aside next year was agreed by EU agriculture
ministers a month ago. But the parliament must pronounce on the move before
it can be implemented by agriculture ministers.
Sir David said there was concern that the parliament might not give its
opinion in time for the last agriculture council meeting of the year, in
mid-December.
'Farmers and growers are consistently being exhorted to move closer to the
market place,' he said. 'But that can all too often turn into a nightmare in
the business sense if the politicians indulge in verbal sparring of a kind
which bears little reality to what is happening in the market place.'
Winter wheat crops should mostly have been drilled by now, and many farmers
are believed to have gone ahead in planting more land than last year on the
assumption that the cut will be implemented.
If they left the decision until late December or January, they would be
restricted to planting lower margin varie-ties of wheat or crops such as
barley.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mineworkers threaten
to disrupt export coal supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian mineworkers have threatened to disrupt export coal supplies
unless companies wring a significant price increase out of the Japanese
steel and electricity industry customers in the annual round of price
negotiations now getting under way in Tokyo, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The threat could herald a repeat of last year's experience when mineworkers
walked out for several days in protest at the coking coal contracts and then
held a second 48-hour stoppage over steaming coal price agreements. Their
action prompted the federal government to agree to an inquiry into the
industry, conclusions of which are due to handed down shortly.
Yesterday, Mr John Maitland, president of the powerful Construction,
Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, said that Australian producers 'should
not think of settling for anything less than (a) USDollars 10 per tonne
(increase)' and that he would not be prepared to guarantee the supply of
export coal if company representatives could not negotiate a good price.
There have been some rumours that producers would be willing to take a rise
of USDollars 6 a tonne, but Mr Maitland said that this 'would represent no
real increase at all in Australian dollar terms'.
Last year, producers accepted price cuts of about 8 per cent in US dollar
terms - with prices of hard coking coals falling by USDollars 4 a tonne.
However, the Australian dollar has gained ground against the US currency
over the past 12 months.
Coal is Australia's largest export category, and the price agreements with
the Japanese - negotiated annually - are used as a price-setter for the
industry. The cuts agreed last year in the wake of big financial problems
for the Japanese steel mills and threats of undercutting by Canadian
producers, represented the fourth successive year in which prices had
fallen.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Nervous selling hits prices at
London Metal Exchange - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bout of nervous selling and liquidation hit all London Metal Exchange
contracts yesterday afternoon and only COPPER found support before the end
of the session.
Three months delivery TIN lost more than Dollars 200 a tonne, while
ALUMINIUM was down Dollars 65 and ZINC Dollars 40.
'They lost some of their upward momentum last week and this was enough to
get some investors to lighten their load. . . it just snow-balled,' a trader
explained.
Aluminium was hit in a thin lunchtime inter-office market by US selling,
which took the three months price below Dollars 1,880 a tonne, triggering
stop-loss selling down to Dollars 1,827.
At the London Commodity Exchange, COCOA futures ran out of steam to close
sharply lower as trade selling in New York triggered mixed selling and
stop-losses in London, dealers said.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian coal industry faces
'critical year' - Efforts to raise productivity and improve labour relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Humphris, the chairman of the Australian Coal Association, describes
this as 'a critical year' for the world's largest coal exporter.
The industry, long hampered by poor labour relations and low productivity,
is trying to shake off the past and protect its share of the booming Pacific
rim coal market.
In the next few weeks, a joint government-industry-labour council will
receive the report of Mr Rae Taylor, a former civil servant who has been
studying the impediments to the growth of the Australian coal industry, and
particularly to its exports. He is expected to highlight high production
costs, poor labour relations, and other obstacles such as the government
monopoly of the railway system.
The employers and mine owners hope that this report will finally clear the
way for the industry after years of labour confrontation. In their
submission to the inquiry, they said: 'Coal industry management has been
trying for years now to break out of these inherited shackles and attitudes,
and to transform the industry into one more befitting the competitive
environment of the 1990s'.
The submission pointed out that Canada and the US had higher productivity
rates for thermal coal than Australia, and were raising it at a faster pace.
At the same time, new producers are entering the market, notably Indonesia
whose most expensive mines are lower cost than Australia's cheapest. In
coking coal, Australia has a stronger position, but the submission warned:
'The North Americans are achieving big gains in productivity, and are in the
market looking to expand tonnage substantially'.
The labour organisations, not surprisingly, dispute these claims. The
mineworkers union blames the Australian industry's high costs on poor
management, and its low profitability on the failure of company negotiators
to obtain the best prices for coal, particularly from the Japanese. Earlier
this year, a dispute on this issue led to walk-outs by miners, and unions
are threatening further disruptions in the latest round of price
negotiations.
Whatever Mr Taylor has to say, however, important changes are already afoot.
In a major departure, the special labour tribunal which has existed for the
coal industry since the last war, is due to be linked to the mainstream
industrial relations tribunal next July. The old tribunal, from which there
was no appeal, was widely seen as an encouragement to mineworkers to
consider themselves 'special'.
Nor is the sense of crisis which the coal owners seem keen to foster
reflected closer to the ground.
Last year, the industry produced a record 180m tonnes, and exports, at 132m
tonnes, were also the highest ever. That made coal the largest single
contributor to Australia's foreign earnings with nearly Dollars A8bn (Pounds
3.89bn).
The coal industry also has some major expansion plans afoot. Shell, the
third largest producer after BHP and CRA, is heading a consortium including
Japan's Marubeni and Showa that is investing Dollars 270m in a new
underground mine at Dartbrook in the Hunter Valley. The mine will produce
about 3.5m tonnes a year, largely for export to foreign electricity
utilities, beginning in 1996.
Shell stresses, however, that heavy investment in Dartbrook is only possible
because it has a very thick seam (an average 3.8m) capable of being mined
with the most modern high-capacity, longwall equipment.
'Margins in coal mining are slim, making investment in new mines difficult
unless you have super geology. We have that at Dartbrook,' says Mr Gordon
Summers, Shell's general manager for coal.
The mine is also strategically located on the railway connected to the
modern coal loading terminal at Newcastle, about 200km north of Sydney. The
government of New South Wales recently agreed to open the line to
competition from private hauliers, a move which it estimated would save coal
producers Dollars 1.80 to Dollars 1.90 a tonne.
Shell is considering two further major investments in Queensland, for which
the final go ahead is unlikely to be given until after the Taylor report has
come out. One is Moranbah, a coking coal mine with a 3m tonnes a year
capacity, where an investment of Dollars 270m is foreseen. If work started
in early 1996, it would be producing in 1999. The second is Theodore, which
would export 4m tonnes of thermal coal.
Ironically, some of the new investment may have been triggered by the
uncertainty surrounding the future of the industry. If big changes are
indeed on the way, they should create new opportunities for those who can
seize them.
Mr Humphris says; 'Before, we all travelled at same rate because of the
restrictions on the industry. Now, the smarter companies are going to do
better'.
But there is also a sense that prices are recovering from a three-year
slump, which took them down by 20 per cent or more, and that long term
demand prospects are good in the region. Large purchasers like Japan and
Korea see demand growing, and new customers such as Thailand and India are
stirring.
According to Mr Humphris, there is no 'Euro-style swing away from coal' in
the Far East and Asia.
Were it not for concerns about 'greenhouse' gases and the environment, he
believes that coal would be 'on the verge of most exciting expansion in
history'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gengold plans Oryx scale-down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South African mining producer Gengold has said that it plans to scale down
underground mining operations at its troubled Oryx gold mine pending further
investigation of the reef.
This follows the announcement earlier this year that the mine would probably
need R950m (Pounds 150m) in new capital on top of the R2bn already invested
if it were to become commercially viable.
According to the company, preliminary sampling has revealed unusual
variability in the grade of the reef. In consequence, the mine will require
an additional 2,000m of reef development to explore the area further and
determine whether there is in fact an exploitable high grade channel within
the main ore body. This development is expected to be completed by December
1995.
As a result of the move, the mine's workforce will be scaled down from 3,200
to 1,200 although Gengold plans to offer most of the workers alternative
employment on other mines in the group.
Gencor, Gengold's parent company, has agreed to underwrite the additional
exploration at the cost of R12m a month. However this excludes financing
costs and Gengold says it will seek further consultation with Oryx's
bankers.
Meanwhile, Gengold says that the initial R979m in interest-free loans
provided by the mine's major shareholders - Gencor, mining house
Anglo-American, investment group Genbel and financial group Sanlam - will be
capitalised in the near future.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Strong Thanksgiving retail sales hit
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell yesterday amid reports of strong retail sales over
the Thanksgiving weekend and the release of figures showing growth in home
sales for October.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 13/32 at
94 17/32 yielding 7.977 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , yielding 7.318 per cent.
The market's mood was not helped by the afternoon auction of three-month
Treasury bills, where in spite of moderate demand the issue's average yield
rose to its highest level for 3 1/2 years. The average yield on the
short-term bills hit 5.44 per cent the highest level since August 1991.
Reports of a busy weekend from shopping malls across the country reawakened
fears that recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve might not
be enough to cool the economy. If so, the Fed might have to raise interest
rates again in the near term, undermining bond prices.
Adding to such concerns were figures from the National Association of
Realtors showing sales of existing single-family homes increasing by 0.5 per
cent from September to October. The head of the real estate association
called the increase 'a vote of confidence in the economy' but added that he
expected rising interest rates would eventually dampen home sales.
Bond market declines came in the wake of gains in most stock indices. For
most of this year, the stock market has taken its cues from increases and
decreases in the bond market, but last week's plunge in share prices created
optimism among bond market players that investors would move assets from
stocks to bonds.
Yesterday's advance in US share prices, however, slowed the development of
any such trend.
UK gilts put in another strong performance, buoyed by hopes for a
market-friendly Budget containing significant cuts in government spending
and public-sector borrowing, and ebbing political worries.
Gilt market participants expect chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget speech
today to contain good news on all fronts.
'The market has got geared up for a good Budget, including a cut in
spending, a reduction in the (public sector borrowing requirement), a cut in
the inflation forecast and an upward revision of the GDP forecast,' said Mr
Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International.
Dealers reported last-minute buying by institutional investors keen to catch
any post-Budget rally. However some warned that good news may already be
discounted and a package in line with expectations could prompt only a muted
reaction or even some profit-taking.
'Clarke will have to deliver something pretty spectacular in order for the
market to go higher,' said a gilt dealer at a large London house, pointing
to supply as a factor that could cap gilts' upside.
The Bank of England yesterday announced sales of Pounds 800m in tranches of
existing gilts; moreover, on Wednesday it is due to announce the terms of
next week's auction.
The December long gilt future on Liffe rose by about  3/8 to 103 17/32 .
German bonds fell in thin volume. The December bund futures contract on
Liffe ended at 91.31, down 0.17 on the day. One analyst said the next data
that might move the market would be the US non-farm payroll figures due at
the end of this week.
The market in Italian government bonds outperformed other European markets
yesterday as the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell 13 basis points to
11.93 per cent.
Analysts said the rise in the price of bonds was due to lack of negative
political influences, and Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said it suggested that
investors now felt the budget was likely to be passed.
The yield on the 10-year Norwegian benchmark bond rose from 8.4 to 8.416 per
cent. Mr Graham McDevitt at Paribas Capital Markets said investors were now
focusing on the referendum on membership of the European Union.
He said: 'A 'yes' would come as a big surprise as the 'no' camp has
consistently been in front.' He added that if there were a majority in
favour of EU membership, the currency would probably rise and bond yields
fall.
However, opposition parties had said they would try to block membership if
there were no decisive result, so a small majority in favour would probably
lead to a parliamentary struggle, he said.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Solid European demand for Exim Bank of
Japan issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exim Bank of Japan yesterday launched a Dollars 300m offering of 10-year
bonds priced to yield 30 basis points over US Treasuries.
Lead manager Bank of Tokyo said that more than 70 per cent of demand came
from European investors - UK investment funds and banks, Swiss pension
funds, German and French insurance companies, and Swiss and Belgium retail
investors.
The remaining bonds were sold to central banks and private banks in Asia and
the Middle East, it said.
In the floating-rate sector, St George Bank, a New South Wales-based
regional bank, launched a Dollars 250m issue of five-year notes, offering 30
basis points over three-month Libor.
The launch coincided with the announcement of a 54 per cent increase in the
bank's after-tax profits to ADollars 102.6m for the year to end-September
and a fall in the charge for bad and doubtful debts to ADollars 8.2m from
ADollars 45.3m.
UBS, which led the offering, said the bonds were sold to UK banks, UK
investment funds and other European institutional investors.
St George Bank is the latest in a series of Australian banks, such as Bank
of South Australia and Challenge Bank, to tap the euromarkets in recent
weeks and to favour the floating-rate dollar sector.
There is strong demand for floating-rate dollar notes, dealers said, and
this offering represented the tightest pricing yet of the recent issues.
Ford Credit Europe launched a Dollars 200m issue of three-year fixed-rate
bonds priced, priced to yield 40 basis points over US Treasuries.
Lead manager ABN Amro said the offering met firm demand from Swiss and
Benelux retail investors, who were attracted by the 8 per cent coupon and
the pricing spread. Institutional investors were also attracted by the
relatively high yield offered by the short-dated bond, ABN Amro said.
'The dollar yield curve has flattened recently and investors can now get a
yield at the short-end close to that on longer-dated maturities,' an
official said. Ford Credit Europe came to the three-year dollar sector in
September with an issue offering a coupon of 6 7/8 per cent.
However, traders said the bonds were priced around three to five basis
points tighter than similar outstanding three-year paper and they struggled
as a consequence.
Market sources said that the proceeds were swapped into floating-rate
sterling.
The European Investment Bank is expected to launch a two-tranche offering of
dollar-denominated bonds within the next few days, dealers said. The issue
is said to be of a Dollars 300m tranche of five-year bonds and a Dollars
300m tranche of 10-year bonds.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Reset feature on John Lewis
loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the UK merchant bank, is to arrange an innovative
five-year loan facility for John Lewis, the UK retailing group.
The structure - known as a 'flexible participation facility' - replaces an
existing Pounds 150m loan signed in 1990 and gives both lenders and the
borrower greater flexibility than a standard revolving credit.
It allows the borrower to lock into market-priced finance at various times
during the life of the loan through a so-called 'reset mechanism'  - a kind
of auction which is managed by Rothschild, in its role as agent.
The loan is split into a core facility of Pounds 35m - priced at 25 basis
points over Libor with a commitment fee of 10 basis points - and two
tranches of Pounds 45m. The terms of one of these tranches can be reset in
mid-1996 and mid-1998; those of the other in mid-1997.
Banks are being asked to participate with individual commitments of between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m.
Commitments for the core facility and both Pounds 45m tranches will be
secured when the deal is signed in the next few weeks but banks can bid to
increase their shares of the two Pounds 45m tranches, with the amounts
allocated on the basis of price.
If banks are prepared to bid more competitively to increase their stakes in
the deal, the borrower can obtain a reduction in its cost of funds. It could
also increase the size of the facility if bids are received for a greater
aggregate amount.
At the same time, however, the banks are obliged to provide finance at the
maximum rate of 25 basis points over Libor.
Mr Paul Tuckwell, director of NM Rothschild, said: 'The facility provides
borrowers with certainty and flexibility of funding and pricing at a capped
cost and banks with the opportunity to actively manage their balance
sheets.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: London SE expects more
emerging market GDRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange expects more companies from the emerging markets
to list global depositary receipts in London - despite a recent lull in
activity.
Five companies - four from India and one from Argentina - have listed GDRs
on the London exchange since the rules were modified in August. The most
recent listing - of India's Bajaj Auto - was in early November.
Mr Robert Murdin, head of capital markets at the exchange, said a number of
other issues were 'in progress and would become public in the near future.'
Potential new issues could come from the Pacific Rim countries, Africa,
especially South Africa, Latin America, Russia, China and the Indian
sub-continent.
The GDR - like the American Depositary Receipt, a proxy for a company's
underlying share - allows companies to avoid potential problems linked to
settlement, foreign exchange and restrictions on foreign ownership.
It is also cheaper to register than a full listing of shares.

Prudential Securities, the stockbroking arm of Prudential Insurance of the
US, is to join the lengthening list of foreign securities companies leaving
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The company announced yesterday that it had notified the TSE of its plans to
relinquish its regular membership of the exchange, transferring it to a
third party.
The decision reflects Prudential's plan to 'substantially downsize' its
operations in Japan, including Japanese equity business, as part of a
wholesale review of the parent's worldwide operations, the company said.
Sale of its TSE membership will enable Prudential to cut operational
expenditures and divert funds for other businesses. But it said it planned
to continue to trade US securities in Japan, as well as Japanese government
bonds.
In the last few years foreign brokers have been leaving Japan as business in
the Japanese securities market has dried up. Equity trading volumes reached
a peak of more than 1bn shares a day in 1989 but then fell to less than 300m
shares a day last year. After a slight increase in the first half of 1994,
volumes have slumped again.
Foreigners flocked to Tokyo in the 1980s as the market was liberalised and
equity trading increased exponentially. The total of subsidiaries and
representative offices grew from 112 in 1984 to 280 in 1991. But since the
slump, many brokers have been leaving the TSE. Prudential's departure takes
the total to below 230.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Pearl Tyre offering takes ASX

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to secure enough foreign
listings to form a special 'Asian board' within its local stock market took
another step forward yesterday when Pearl River Tyre, a Chinese tyre
business, announced plans for a ADollars 45.2m (USDollars 33.4m) share
offering.
Pearl River is a Bermuda-based company formed to hold a 70 per cent interest
in Guangzhou Pearl River Tyre. GPRT, in turn, is based in Guangdong province
and makes tyres for buses and other commercial vehicles. The remaining 30
per cent of GPRT is owned by Guangzhou city, which was formerly the sole
ultimate owner of the tyre business.
Pearl River is planning to sell 45.2m shares at ADollars 1 each. This stock
will represent 86 per cent of the company's issued capital, and the balance
will be held by the government of Guangzhou and professional advisers
involved in the transaction. A group of Malaysian businessmen has already
agreed to subscribe for some 18.4m shares, and a similar amount has been
placed with international institutional investors. This leaves about 10m
shares available for the general public.
The money raised will be used to double the company's production capacity by
1997, from about 1m tyres a year at present.
Sales in 1994 are expected to be about ADollars 60m.
The listing, which is expected to take place early in 1995, will mean that
about half a dozen 'China concept' stocks trade on the ASX, with Pearl River
being the largest.

<TEXT>
Aoki, a Japanese construction company, has sold its shareholdings in the
Westin Hotel group for Dollars 561m to US real estate investors Starwood
Capital Group and a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs.
Aoki sold its shareholdings in two Westin group companies, Westin Hotel and
Westin International Europe, which operate 63 hotels in 11 North American
and European countries and the Westin trademark rights in South America.
Aoki is another company on the list of Japanese corporations struggling with
overseas investments made during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s.
The construction group, together with a group of US investors, bought the
Westin hotel chain of 80 hotels in 19 countries in 1988 for Dollars 1.35bn.
Immediately after the purchase, Aoki and the investors sold off the Westin
Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Plaza in New York for more than Dollars 700m.
Since then the Japanese company has faced mounting interest payments on its
debts and last February attempted to sell the hotel chain to a Mexican
investor.
The company said it would use the income from the sale to repay the group's
outstanding loans of about Y52bn (Dollars 526.5m), which includes funds
borrowed for the initial purchase of the hotel group. The proceeds will also
be used to cover the Y34bn in loan guarantees by Aoki to its resort
subsidiaries.
Westin will own the trademark in North America, South America, Europe,
Africa and the Middle East. In Asia, Aoki will maintain ownership of the
Westin trademark and enter into partnership with Westin there.

Siam Cement, Thailand's biggest manufacturing conglomerate, said that robust
growth in all its five main business areas enabled it to lift consolidated
net profits for the first nine months by 52 per cent to Bt3.91bn (Dollars

Consolidated profits in the third quarter surged 34 per cent to Bt1.38bn on
sales 18 per cent higher.
Cement and construction materials, which account for more than half the
business, were surprisingly strong in the rainy season third quarter; cement
sales alone rose 11.3 per cent over the year-ago figure.
Several Bangkok analysts said they would revise upwards their full-year
profits forecasts for the company in the light of the latest figures.
Miss Sirinuch Tharmapornpilas, at Jardine Fleming Thanakom, said she now
expected full-year net profits of around Bt5.2bn, 10 per cent higher than
the firm's earlier forecast.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer in property sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coles Myer, the large but troubled Australian retailer, said yesterday it
had arranged to sell more than ADollars 500m (USDollars 370.3m) of retail
property. The move is part of a plan to rationalise its ADollars 1.5bn
property portfolio, offset the current ADollars 4.1bn capital investment
programme and prevent it becoming 'overweight' in property.
Coles is selling its 50 per cent interest in the WestMyer Trust, which owns
shopping centres in Adelaide and Southland, to the Australian Mutual
Provident Society, the life office. The deal values the two properties and
development costs to date at ADollars 580.8m - or Coles' share at ADollars
290.4m.
In addition, a joint venture is being established with the Industry
Superannuation Property Trust, which will take in ADollars 113.8m of
properties from Coles, mainly shopping centre interests. ISPT will have a 75
per cent interest in the venture, and Coles, 25 per cent. The disposal of a
variety of smaller property interests makes up the balance of the ADollars
500m.
Coles' gearing has risen significantly recently, as result of buying back
the 21.45 per cent of its shares held by Kmart, the US retailer.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ford returns to Samcor with 45%
stake

Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, is re-entering the
South African market through the purchase of a 45 per cent stake in South
African Motor Corporation (Samcor).
Ford divested its equity interest in Samcor in late 1987 as part of a series
of withdrawals by US companies from South Africa in response to pressure
from anti-apartheid groups.
Samcor assembles Ford vehicles and some Mazda and Mitsubishi models. Ford
will hold an equal stake with Anglo-American Industrial Corporation, buying
31 per cent of Samcor's equity from Amic and a further 14 per cent from the
Samcor Employees Trust. This will leave AMIC and Ford both holding 45 per
cent with the remaining 10 per cent staying in the hands of the trust.
Mr Jim Miller, director of eastern Europe and export operations for Ford of
Europe, is to become Samcor group managing director and chief executive.
The deal, which has been expected for several months, in effect marks a
return to the situation that existed prior to Ford's disinvestment from
South Africa.
Samcor was formed in 1985 as a joint venture between Ford South Africa,
which had been founded by Ford Canada in 1933, and Anglo-American's existing
automotive interests.
Mr Wayne Booker, Ford executive vice-president of international automotive
operations, said he hoped the US group's direct involvement would prove to
be a spur to improved production and new export initiatives by Samcor.
'When I say Ford will re-establish its presence in South Africa, I mean it,'
he said. 'This is not only an investment. Our action symbolises Ford's
commitment to the South African market and the success of Samcor.'
Mr Booker declined to disclose the financing of the transaction, saying only
that it was a combination of new cash, new equipment and product investment.
It was revealed, however, that the Employees Trust had received R50m
(Dollars 14.1m) for the 14 per cent of Samcor equity it had sold to Ford.
Samcor is currently in fourth place among South Africa's seven main vehicle
makers. It has monthly sales of around 2,200 vehicles, trailing market
leaders Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan, but ahead of Mercedes-Benz, Delta
(which manufactures Opel models) and BMW.
South African producers currently manufacture about 320,000 units a year, of
which passenger cars account for just over two-thirds. Almost all production
is for the local market.
The industry is under intense pressure, however, as South Africa begins to
dismantle its high tariffs on imported motor vehicles, currently about 100
per cent, in line with Gatt requirements. Manufacturers, organised labour
and the government are in negotiations to find an acceptable schedule for
phasing out most of the industry's protection over the next eight years.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Poor returns for Japan's life
groups - Insurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's leading life assurers saw an increase in premium revenues but
suffered low returns on their investments during the first six months to
September.
Combined premium revenues at Nippon Life, Dai-Ichi Life, Sumitomo Life,
Meiji Life, Asahi Life, Mitsui Life, Yasuda Life and Chiyoda Life rose 13.4
per cent to Y12,076.4bn (Dollars 122.7bn) due to higher premiums from April.
But a sluggish domestic bond market and smaller interest and dividend income
amid low interest rates hurt returns on investments, and the top eight
assurers saw aggregate income from these sources fall 9.7 per cent to
Y2,892.5bn.
Investment returns were less than 4 per cent on average, sharply lower than
the companies' prospective dividend payout rates for policyholders.
Investment yields have not stopped falling since peaking at 6.8 per cent in
1989, and a further decline may force the companies to cut their dividend
payments for the fifth consecutive year. Officials at the companies said
they were still considering the possibility.
While the leading companies have the unrealised gains on stocks to support
them, declining investment yields, bad loans and slowing growth in new
contracts are affecting the financial soundness of some of the industry's
smaller companies. Analysts reckon some of the bigger groups may be forced
to support the financially-troubled smaller companies following the
industry's liberalisation scheduled in 1996.
Insurance benefit payments for the top eight companies rose 22.1 per cent,
with many policies maturing or being cancelled. Meanwhile, the combined
balance of non-performing loans fell 3.6 per cent to Y364.2bn.
The companies have been selling their long-term shareholdings to cover for
the declines in investment returns. Profits from stock sales rose at all
eight companies except Sumitomo, with combined gains up 4.7 per cent to
Y293.9bn. Profits from stock sales surged by four times at Nippon to Y22.7bn
while Yasuda's gains doubled to Y26.9bn.
Total unrealised gains from stocks, which have traditionally acted as a
buffer against losses on investments, totalled Y11,068bn at the end of
September, up 2.4 per cent from the end of March due to a slight rise in the
stock market.
However, the figure is still insufficient to absorb further losses on
high-risk investments and asset allocations of the companies are expected to
remain conservative.
During the first half, companies allocated funds to the domestic bond
markets and loans, while reducing foreign currency exposure. At Nippon, the
industry leader, bond investments at the end of September rose 2.4 points
from six months earlier to 15 per cent of total investment assets, while
overseas securities investments fell 0.8 points to 6 per cent. Sumitomo's
bond investments rose 2.8 points from the end of March to 18.2 per cent of
total investment assets while funds in deposits fell 2.4 points to 4.3 per
cent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ameritech in Dollars 2.25bn
write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ameritech, the Chicago-based regional telephone company, is to take a
non-financial charge of Dollars 2.25bn net in the fourth quarter, resulting
in a loss for the year. The charge represents a write-down in the company's
asset value to reflect a more competitive market.
Ameritech's move follows that of fellow regional phone companies US West,
which took a Dollars 3.2bn charge in the third quarter of last year, and
Bell Atlantic, which took a charge of Dollars 2.15bn in the third quarter of
this year.
Ameritech said it was reducing its net asset value from Dollars 17.1bn to
Dollars 13.4bn. The Dollars 3.7bn write-down is reduced to Dollars 2.25bn
after tax. Shareholders' equity will fall from Dollars 8.05bn to Dollars
5.74bn. Last year Ameritech made net profits of Dollars 1.5bn.
The company said that in all the states in which it operates it is now
regulated on the basis of price caps, rather than by the older system of
return on assets. It is therefore free to reduce its assets to what it sees
as their commercial value, rather than the higher figure on which its
allowable return was calculated before.
At the same time, Ameritech said it would shorten its depreciation
schedules, which were also set previously by the regulators.
It said it would now fully depreciate its analog switches and depreciate its
more modern digital switches over seven years instead of 17.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mellon Bank takes Dollars 130m
charge over stock lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mellon Bank of the US said it would take a Dollars 130m after-tax charge to
cover investment losses of customers of its stock lending business following
the fall in bond prices this year.
The move is the latest sign that some banks, ambitious to develop their
global custody and stock lending businesses, have bought unsuitable
securities with cash which was deposited by their customers as collateral.
In June, Harris Trust, a subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, said it would
absorb Dollars 51.3m of investment losses for stock-lending customers,
leading to an after-tax charge of Dollars 33m.
Mellon said the charge announced yesterday sprang from its intended purchase
of interest rate swap contracts to change the characteristics of investments
under its control. These swaps would be used to tie the investments to
short-term floating rates, the bank said.
Mr Frank Cahouet, Mellon's chairman and chief executive, said the bank had
decided that 'the interest rate sensitivity of certain client portfolios is
not appropriate under current conditions for the unique requirements of the
securities lending business'.
Mellon did not provide details of its investment strategy, except to say
that it invested in longer-term bonds. Prices of these bonds have fallen
steadly this year.
The returns from investing collateral have become an important source of
income in the global custody business. Custodians, which hold securities on
behalf of institutional investors, lend the securities to brokers and others
for short periods, receiving collateral in return.
The broker is generally paid a return on the collateral equivalent to
overnight interest rates. Any additional investment return is usually kept
by the custodian.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sheinberg steps down at Goldman
Sachs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eric Sheinberg, the Goldman Sachs partner from whom Mr Robert Maxwell's
former employees are seeking restitution of some of their pension assets,
has resigned.
From the beginning of the 1995 fiscal year, Mr Sheinberg, Goldman Sachs'
longest-tenured general partner, will become a limited partner, the status
accorded those who are no longer pursuing full duties.
He will continue to work as a proprietary trader - buying and selling shares
for the firm's own account. A spokesman for the firm said Mr Sheinberg had
asked to become a limited partner to give himself more time to pursue his
personal interests.
Goldman Sachs partners may not withdraw their capital from the firm in full
upon retirement, but withdraw it over a period of years instead, usually in
the form of interest on the sum they have built up. Mr Sheinberg became a
general partner in 1971 after 10 years with the firm.
An internal memo credits Mr Sheinberg with having pioneered the concept of
'24-hour trading' in international securities markets and for introducing
US-style block share trading to the European markets.
In April, lawyers for the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme Trustees
and the Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme filed
lawsuits in New York each seeking Dollars 57m from Goldman Sachs and Mr
Sheinberg personally in connection with the alleged diversion of scheme
assets. The lawsuits, which are continuing, also seek unspecified damages.
The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m (Dollars 90.20m) of MCC
shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa,
which were transacted through Goldman Sachs and for which the schemes were
never paid.
Both Goldman Sachs and Mr Sheinberg have said they will vigorously contest
the charges.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santiago seeks regional finance
role - Chile has its advantages but obstacles remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chile boasts Latin America's most advanced capital market. The country's
high savings rate, the development of its private pension funds and more
than a decade of uninterrupted economic growth have combined to bring this
about. Nowhere else in Latin America can companies raise 10- or even 20-year
finance.
The country's leading financial institutions and its two stock exchanges
want to use this head start over their neighbours to develop a financial
centre servicing the rest of South America. To promote the idea, they formed
a capital markets institute six months ago.
'We have been advocating the idea of transforming Santiago into a financial
centre,' said Mr Hernan Somerville, the head of Chile's banking association.
But for the likes of Mr Somerville, the government has been moving too
slowly on the issue and at least two important obstacles are blocking the
idea.
The first is the rule which demands that foreign investments remain in the
country for at least a year, inhibiting financial market trading. The second
is the country's capital gains tax.
Government officials say lifting the one-year rule would not be difficult.
The finance minister, Mr Eduardo Aninat, said this month in London that 'at
an opportune moment, we could consider amending it by law . . . but that
doesn't mean in the short term'. For now, the government is concerned not to
encourage inflows of volatile hot money which make managing money supply
difficult and raise the exchange rate to uncompetitive levels.
Mr Aninat said, however, that 'the capital gains tax is more complex',
although the issue was under study. The government is worried that relaxing
the tax might lead to a redefinition of a lot of income as capital gains in
order to evade tax.
Mr Somerville says banks are being hindered from developing a regional role
because they cannot lend money outside the country, except for trade. 'We
should also be able to lend money outside Chile to Chilean companies,' many
of which are expanding into other countries in the region, he says.
From the government's point of view, developing the financial services
sector would - like increasing manufacturing capacity - be one way of
developing an economy which, in spite of its success, is still
over-dependent on production of raw materials.
Still, while some financial experts believe Santiago has advantages in
certain areas, for example in custodial services, there is widespread
scepticism that turning the city into financial centre is a serious project.
Chile may have the expertise, and a deregulated telephone system that allows
for relatively cheap communication, but it is geographically remote and the
economy small. Sceptics wonder whether there is a critical mass of local
business to encourage the establishment of a regional financial centre.
Mr Somerville argues: 'Look at Luxembourg', adding that 'we offer political
stability, economic stability, a broad consensus over policy - and we have a
reputation for integrity.'
Mr Pablo Yrarrazavil , chairman of the Santiago Stock Exchange, points out
that for an 'emerging market' the country already has a highly-developed
financial system.
With a gross domestic product of about Dollars 46bn, Chile's stock market
capitalisation is Dollars 60bn, banking assets total Dollars 35bn, the
assets of pension funds are approaching Dollars 20bn and insurance company
assets Dollars 5bn.
Nonetheless, Mr Yrarrazavil acknowledges that he has a problem - currently
most Chilean companies prefer to raise share capital in New York and not on
his exchange. Chilean financial business is migrating to the US, where
investors are willing to pay more than in the Chilean market, partly because
of the one-year rule.
But Chilean financiers are not only worried about New York. They are also
concerned not so much about the development of finance in Sao Paulo if the
Brazilian anti-inflation plan succeeds, but that Argentina is making big
advances in financial sophistication.
Promoting Santiago as a financial centre has, for some of its proponents, a
defensive motive and a desire to avoid a drain of Chilean talent and Chilean
financial companies to Argentina.
'Chileans love Buenos Aires. Many would like to live there, and if it
developed as a financial centre, they would move,' said one financier.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moore transforms its approach -
New chief executive is spearheading shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The occupants of Moore Corporation's executive suite atop one of Toronto's
tallest office towers would have felt quite out of place little more than a
year ago.
The 116-year old company was coasting on its long record as the world's
biggest supplier of paper forms used by almost every business.
A balance sheet with virtually no debt and a steady flow of revenues from
products as varied as credit-card slips, cash-register receipts and train
tickets had lulled Moore into a complacency not uncommon among
well-entrenched market leaders.
This month it reported nine-month net profits of USDollars 82.2m, or 83
cents a share, up from Dollars 60.6m, or 61 cents.
In spite of being one of Canada's biggest companies, with 22,000 employees
and annual revenues of Dollars 2.3bn, Moore saw no need for a public
relations department. Staff turnover was exceptionally low. The chief
executive had been with the company for 34 years and the chief financial
officer for 43.
However, the leisurely atmosphere has evaporated since Mr Reto Braun took
over as chief executive in September 1993.
'This year, more things are happening than in the past 20,' says Swiss-born
Mr Braun, who spearheaded a top-to-toe shake-up at Unisys, the US computer
and defence electronics company.
He has hired a new chief financial officer from Northern Telecom, the
Canadian telephone equipment maker. The new head of the business systems
division is a former McKinsey &amp; Co consultant who also worked for Mitel,
another Canadian phone equipment supplier.
Recruits from the computer and telecommunications industry give a clue to an
even bigger change. While paper will continue to play a role in business
records and transactions for the foreseeable future, many traditional
business forms now comprise words and lines on a computer screen.
The speed and accessibility of electronic data allow companies to use the
information on these forms for an increasing number of purposes. Labels,
another Moore staple, are being transformed by bar-codes into part of
elaborate data management systems.
Companies are also demanding a wider range of services from suppliers. 'The
customer doesn't just want a product any more,' Mr Braun says. 'He wants a
solution to his problem.'
Mr Braun's credo is that if a chief executive needs to inflict pain, it
should be done quickly, but fairly. In the 14 months since he took over,
Moore has chopped about 2,000 jobs and closed six plants. A Dollars 229m
restructuring charge, taken at the end of 1993, drained away 14 per cent of
the company's equity.
The long-term aim is to transform Moore from a supplier of business forms
into a provider of a much wider range of information-handling products and
services.
It will concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management systems;
labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer communications, such as
direct mail.
In each case, Mr Braun is targeting only a handful of sectors. For instance,
the customer communications division will aim primarily at publishers and
retailers. The labels business will be directed mainly at manufacturers, the
transport sector and retailers.
'We have to sell earlier and higher in the sales cycle,' Mr Braun says.
Instead of dealing with purchasing managers, he wants the company to do more
of its business with chief financial officers and marketing executives.
For example, Moore has helped SNCF, the French railway group, design a new
reservations system with a magnetic-strip ticket. In addition to being a
travel voucher, each ticket provides real-time information on a passenger's
movements. SNCF uses this data to adjust routes, trains, seats and fares. On
the customer-communications side, Moore has won a contract from a US hotel
chain to produce a colour brochure, with a common theme but a different
version for each hotel.
Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five
years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and acquisitions
which broaden Moore's horizons.
Such expansion is typified by Moore's recent purchase of a 20 per cent stake
in JetForm Corporation, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms
technology.
formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal
bar-code printer for liner-less labels.
Another sign of the 'new' Moore is a Dollars 1bn two-way deal with EDS, the
US computer-services and management consultancy. EDS is designing, and will
later operate, Moore's internal data-processing system. For its part, Moore
will manage EDS's own printing and other information handling requirements.
The risk, however, is that some products and services may be ahead of their
time. One Moore executive says that 'a lot of customers know they want it,
but they're not certain how they're going to use it'. But people no longer
hang such epithets as 'stodgy' or 'venerable' on Moore these days.
The transformation is set to advance further. Moore plans to raise Dollars
400m to Dollars 500m in debt, lifting its debt-to-equity ratio from an
ultra-conservative 6 per cent to about 25 per cent.
It is preparing a public offering of shares in Toppan Moore, the big
Japanese forms company which Moore owns jointly with Toppan Printing.
Mr Braun took another step this month which would have been unthinkable
under the old guard. He hired Moore's first vice-president of communications
to help get the message across that a leopard can change its spots.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: US investors use foreign voting
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US institutional shareholders are increasingly exercising their voting
rights at non-US companies in which they have a stake, according to a new
survey.
Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), an
organisation which monitors shareholder activity, said US institutional
investors now vote at 71 per cent of all foreign companies in which they own
a stake, compared with just 24 per cent in 1991.
The survey was conducted among the 40 or 50 institutional investors who have
more than Dollars 250bn under management.
Ms Corinna Arnold, deputy director in charge of Global Shareholder Services
at IRRC, said she believed the client base was fairly representative of US
institutional investors, although IRRC clients are likely to be more
concerned with corporate governance matters than other share-holders.
During the summer, the US Department of Labor confirmed that US Erisa funds
 -corporate pension schemes covered by US pensions legislation - have the
same fiduciary duty to vote on matters at non-domestic companies, unless the
costs of voting are prohibitive, as at US companies in which they have
invested.
US public sector pension schemes, among the largest such schemes, are not
covered by the Erisa legislation but have taken their voting
responsibilities seriously.
Ms Maryellen Andersen, director of investor and corporate relations at the
State of Connecticut Retirement and Trust Funds, said that in 1993, the
scheme voted at 1,395 of the 2,300 foreign companies in which it holds a
stake.
Ms Andersen said the scheme has been able to vote in most markets because of
the willingness of its custodian banks to help with the paperwork.
'We found the most effective way to ensure voting was to put pressure on the
custodian,' she said.
Ms Andersen said US pension schemes hold a relatively small stake in foreign
markets, but they are making an impact on local boards of directors.
'They want our money. We have made it clear that we are interested in
investing but we are also interested in voting. We don't really want to do
one without the other,' she said.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk adapts its strategy
in changing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shine has been knocked off Novo Nordisk's shares this year. The Danish
pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes producer has been hit by a rapid rise
in costs, contributing to a 7 per cent slip in nine-month profits to DKr934m
(Dollars 153m) from DKr1bn; problems meeting demand for insulin in the US;
and the resignation of an important member of the management board following
a reorganisation of responsibilities.
The share price fell by DKr15 when the interim results were announced
earlier this month. They have picked up since, but at DKr554 yesterday the
price is a long way from the 12-month high of DKr748.
Mr Mads Ovlisen, chief executive, said: 'We are trying to adapt our
strategy, our organisation, to the huge changes taking place in the market
place. We are also adapting to increased regulatory pressures.'
The shortfall in insulin supply to the US, where it competes with Eli Lily,
the world's other leading supplier, was caused by a production stoppage in
Denmark. This was compounded by a delay in bringing a new production plant
on stream in the US. The delay, Mr Ovlisen said, was caused by the need to
ensure the plant met the US Food and Drug Administration's stringent
regulatory guidelines, 'a tremendous task'.
The supply problem is now over, and he hopes the US plant will go into
production early next year.
The market situation in the US is changing because the large pharmaceutical
producers are buying up healthcare provider groups in order to gain a
captive patient base.
'Buying decisions are made by the healthcare provider organisations. The
medical doctor is no longer king,' said Mr Ovlisen.
The key to survival for a relatively small company such as Novo Nordisk,
with turnover last year of about DKr12.16bn, is to be able to innovate and
to supply value-added products which the healthcare providers will continue
to need, he said. With this in mind board of management responsibilities
were changed last spring, to make decision-making faster. However, Mr Erik
Sorensen, a long-standing board member, found the changes did not suit him
and he resigned this autumn.
The company also wants to concentrate on new products, partly by releasing
resources from other areas. This was reflected by its recent decision to
sell its bulk penicillin production unit.
The obverse of this disposal is the DKr6bn-plus which has been invested in
new plant over three years, with five new international plants in enzymes
and pharmaceutical production due to start up in coming months. This, said
Mr Kurt Anker Nielsen, finance director, was one of the main reason why
costs, up 16 per cent against a sales increase of 12 per cent at nine
months, had soared.
Staff for the plants have been recruited, although the plants are not yet
contributing to sales. Depreciation costs have also risen.
The group has a stated aim of increasing profits by 15 per cent a year, he
said. Viewed over the 1991-94 period, the average increase will be about
13-14 per cent in spite of this year's slip, 'so we are not that far off'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield sale gives
boost to NCC

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NCC, Sweden's second largest construction group, said yesterday that a
SKr1.2bn capital gain from the sale of its 22.5 per cent stake in Avesta
Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, had given a sharp
boost to profits in the first nine months.
The sale helped the group to compensate for the continuing recession in the
Swedish construction market. It reported a SKr1.45bn (Dollars 194.2m) profit
after financial items for the period, compared with a SKr546m surplus a year
ago. If one-off items are excluded, income improved to SKr262m from SKr68m.
NCC sold its holding in Avesta for SKr2.2bn in September. British Steel
picked up a big portion of the shares, lifting its stake in Avesta to 49.9
per cent from 40 per cent.
NCC said its main construction operations continued to be hit by difficult
market conditions, which lowered group sales to SKr12.0m from SKr13.0bn.
But Mr Jan Sjoqvist, group president, said there were 'clear signs that the
market trend is reversing'. He said orders received by the group's Swedish
construction businesses had been 30 per cent higher than last year at
SKr9.7bn. Total orders rose to SKr11.0bn from SKr9.1bn.
The group is predicting a full-year profit of between SKr900m and SKr1bn.
This is after including write-downs of between SKr300m and SKr400m in the
full-year accounts, primarily linked to properties held for future
development outside Sweden. Last year, the group achieved a SKr175m profit.
NCC's civil engineering, building and production units reported nine-month
profits of SKr407m, down from SKr524m last year.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minister indicates timing of
full Renault sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French state-owned motor group which was floated on the stock
market earlier this month, should be privatised in the second half of next
year, Mr Jose Rossi, the French industry minister, said yesterday.
'Today, Renault is quoted on the bourse and has stable shareholders. It
should prepare itself for a new step, that of privatisation,' Mr Rossi told
the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament, while presenting his
ministry's budget for 1995.
His remarks are the first indication of a timing for the full privatisation
of Renault, a sensitive subject given the company's status as a former trade
union stronghold.
During the flotation of the company, in which the government reduced its
holding from 80 per cent to just over 50 per cent, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
economy minister, said that privatisation was 'not the order of the day'.
The government has previously refused to comment on the possible timing of a
full privatisation.
Officials sought to play down differences within the government.
They said that Renault was on the list of 21 public-sector groups slated for
privatisation by the centre-right government, and that its sale was
therefore expected.
However, some expressed reservations about Mr Rossi's remarks, arguing that
it was not advisable to predict such an operation so far in advance.
Mr Rossi's comments will, however, reinforce the assumption of most industry
observers that the French government will move to reduce its holding to a
minority relatively soon after next spring's presidential elections.
The partial privatisation, which was completed on November 18, drew strong
demand from employees and from institutional investors, who subscribed for
more than 15 times the number of shares they were offered.
However, the issue was less enthusiastically received by individual
investors, resulting in a subscription rate of 1.4 times the shares on
offer.
Strong institutional interest has pushed Renault's shares above the FFr165
offer price. Yesterday, the shares closed at FFr181.
Before a full privatisation, the French government has said Renault must
conclude partnerships with other industry groups to secure its future as a
private company following the collapse of merger plans with Volvo at the end
of last year.
Volvo retains just over 11.3 per cent of the shares in its erstwhile merger
partner.
However, Mr Soren Gyll, the chairman of the Swedish motor group, said
yesterday that it planned to sell its remaining holding when market
conditions were favourable.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Campbell Soup in Dollars 1.1bn
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Campbell Soup, the US food company best known for its condensed soups, is to
add some spice to its product line-up with the acquisition of Pace Foods,
the world's biggest maker of Mexican-style hot sauces, for Dollars 1.1bn in
cash.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chairman and chief executive, described Pace
Foods as a 'brand jewel' and said the acquisition would provide Campbell
with a 'turbo-charged' new business category.
The privately-owned Pace Foods is based in San Antonio, Texas, near the
Mexican border. Its main product is salsa, a hot sauce accompanying Mexican
food and increasingly used in the US as a dip or condiment with other
dishes.
Salsa, consisting mainly of crushed tomatoes and chilli, has become popular
with an increasingly health-conscious US public because it is low in fat and
perceived as a healthy food.
According to Campbell, US supermarket sales of salsa and other Mexican-style
sauces have grown at an annual rate of 13 per cent since 1988 and have now
overtaken sales of ketchup in the US. Campbell is expecting further rapid
growth in the category in the US and overseas.
Pace Foods has 471 full time employees, most of them in two factories near
its headquarters. It expects current year sales of Dollars 220m and
operating profits of Dollars 54m.
More than Dollars 1bn of the purchase price consists of goodwill, reflecting
the fact that Pace has the strongest brand name awareness in the US among
consumers of Mexican food products.
Campbell said the acquisition, expected to be completed in January, would
dilute earnings per share by 7 cents in 1995 and the same again in 1996, but
would start adding to earnings in 1997. Its shares were up Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 43 7/8 in early trading yesterday.
Campbell's existing range of food products includes soups, spaghetti, fruit
and vegetable juices, frozen foods, salad dressings, bakery products,
pickles, olives and chocolates. Apart from Campbell's, its brand names
include Pepperidge Farm, Vlasic, Mrs Paul's, Prego, Swanson and Godiva.
The company has been handicapped by the fact that its US market is largely
mature, but like other US food companies, it has been looking for growth
through a combination of acquisitions and expansion overseas. It now gets
about 30 per cent of its sales from businesses in Europe, Latin America and
Asia, and the percentage is growing.
Since the arrival of Mr Johnson as chairman and chief executive in 1990, the
company has shown strong profits growth. In its financial year to July 1994,
net earnings rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 630m, or Dollars 2.51 a share,
on sales of Dollars 6.7bn.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Italian bank set to lift bid for
stake in competitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), were suspended yesterday morning amid
growing speculation that Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank,
was preparing an improved offer for its Bolognese competitor.
Credit revealed a month ago that it was planning a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.24bn)
bid for a 48 per cent stake in Rolo which would give it control of the bank.
Rolo has reacted defensively, reviving plans for a merger with CAER, parent
of the local savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo).
Credit's shares fell by more than 4 per cent yesterday on speculation that
the bank might have to pay as much as L23,000 a share for Rolo, against
Friday's closing price of L17,096, and bid for a larger stake.
In its original plans, Credit said it was prepared to offer L19,000.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, suspended the Rolo shares after
Italian newspapers reported at the weekend that Credit was planning a new
bid in an attempt to win over Rolo's shareholders before December 19, when
they must vote on the merger plans.
Mr Enzo Berlanda, Consob chairman, yesterday told Ansa, the Italian news
agency, that work was under way on the Credit-Rolo dossier at the
authority's Milan offices.
Credit's promised bid has still not been approved by the Bank of Italy,
which supervises the Italian banking system. That puts the Milan bank at a
disadvantage, because the central bank has already given the go-ahead to the
Carisbo-Rolo merger.
The Bolognese banks have laid great emphasis on preserving their regional
roots, which suggests that extra cash would not be enough to win over local
Rolo shareholders to the Credit offer.
The Milan bank might also have to make certain guarantees of shareholder
rights.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: BK Vision wins UBS injunction
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group which is challenging the management of Union Bank of Switzerland, has
won an injunction preventing the bank from converting its registered shares
into bearer shares until an appeal against the plan is heard.
UBS shareholders narrowly approved the conversion plan - with 57.8 per cent
of registered shares in favour - at an extraordinary meeting last Tuesday,
following a tense proxy battle between BK Vision and the UBS board.
BK Vision, the largest shareholder in UBS, claims the plan is illegal
because it does not offer compensation to registered UBS shareholders for
the loss of the extra voting weight attached to their shares.
The registered shares have a par value of one-fifth that of the bearer
shares, giving an investment in them much greater voting power than a
similar investment in bearers.
A Zurich district court judge yesterday accepted BK Vision's argument that
it would be difficult to reverse implementation of the plan if an appeal
court ruled much later that it was illegal.
The two sides will now present their arguments to the judge on a suitable
deadline for BK Vision to submit its appeal case.
By law, the latest possible date is January 22, but UBS will argue for an
earlier deadline so that the case can be decided as quickly as possible.
The UBS board wants to implement the conversion before the next annual
general meeting in April.
At that meeting, 10 of the 23 directors' terms expire, and BK Vision is
trying to rally a majority of votes in support of substantial changes to the
board.
If the conversion goes through, the voting power of BK Vision and other
large registered shareholders will be substantially reduced.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF Bank yesterday blamed the collapse in world bond market prices for a
sharp slide in profits from trading on its own account in the first 10
months. However, it said this was almost entirely offset by earnings from
normal customer business.
Operating profits at the German bank were 0.7 per cent lower at DM265m
(Dollars 170m), after a 22.5 per cent rise in partial operating profits
(which exclude own-account trading in securities, foreign exchange and other
financial instruments) to DM375m.
The bank managed to increase its interest earnings by 16 per cent to DM598m,
with commission profits up 4.9 per cent to DM298m. Operating costs were held
to a 5.5 per cent increase at DM521m.
Profits on the bank's own-account trading were 85 per cent lower at DM14m,
continuing the decline of earlier months which reflected write-downs on
BHF's bond portfolio. It increased its bad-loan provisions by 13 per cent to
DM149m. The bank is exposed to both the Schneider property and
Balsam/Procedo factoring collapses.
Two months ago, the bank announced plans to turn itself into a joint stock
company and strengthen its asset management and corporate finance business
throughout Europe.
The costs of the reorganisation will weigh on next year's result, and
probably that of 1996, but should eventually lead to increased returns on
capital. Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, recently
disclosed a 5 per cent holding in BHF.

<TEXT>
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-Swedish chemicals group, is planning to sell its
hydro-power operations to Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third-largest energy
producer.
Analysts said the deal could be worth more than SKr2bn (Dollars 160.7m) on a
debt-free basis.
The move will end a century-long involvement by Nobel in the energy business
and is in line with its strategy of focusing on core businesses.
Akzo Nobel, formed this year through the merger of Sweden's Nobel Industries
and Akzo of the Netherlands, has a 40 per cent stake in Njordkraft, which
owns four medium-sized and three smaller hydro-power plants in Sweden with a
combined production capacity of 940 gigawatt hours. The plants meet 50 per
cent of the group's Swedish energy needs.
The remaining Njordkraft shares are held by institutional investors.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lafarge rules out role in US
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, has ruled out a plan to
co-operate with Golden Eagle Industries in its Dollars 940m bid for National
Gypsum, the second-largest US plasterboard manufacturer.
The French group, which holds 10 per cent of the shares in National Gypsum,
said it had rejected the idea of a joint bid, and was studying what to do
with its stake.
The decision complicates the task of Golden Eagle, which holds 19 per cent
of National Gypsum and is leading the bid by a group of North Carolina-based
investors.
Golden Eagle, headed by Mr C. D. Spangler, non-executive chairman of
National Gypsum, may also face barriers to any hostile bid. These were
agreed by shareholders of the plasterboard company last week.
Industry observers discounted the idea that Lafarge Coppee would make a
rival offer for control of National Gyspum.
Although Lafarge is one of Europe's largest plasterboard manufacturers, and
has a strong presence in the US building materials market, analysts say it
probably cannot afford to be part of the National Gypsum acquisition.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BFI reduces its conditions for Pounds 391m
Attwoods takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US yesterday reduced its conditions for
the takeover of Attwoods, the UK waste services company for which it has
made a hostile Pounds 391m cash takeover bid, writes Our Financial Staff in
London.
BFI said it would proceed with its offer provided a simple majority of
Attwoods' shareholders voted to accept the bid by December 2, the closing
date for the offer.
The US group previously said it would have proceeded with the offer only if
90 per cent of Attwoods' shareholders approved.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI last night rejected suggestions that this latest
move meant BFI was worried about the level of acceptances for the bid. 'We
are optimistic about the way the bid is progressing and feel very good about
the level of acceptances,' he said.
'We have lowered one condition. It means we can take control of the company
at 50.1 per cent whether or not we get 90 per cent'.
BFI is today expected to disclose the level of acceptances it has received
to-date for its offer.
The BFI bid is also dependent on receiving an anti-trust exemption from the
US government.
Mr Angell said he expected the review to be concluded in BFI's favour before
the end of this week.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leopold Joseph at Pounds 1.09m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leopold Joseph Holdings, the merchant bank, turned in pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.09m for the six months to September 30, against the background of a
volatile financial environment.
Mr Robin Herbert, chairman, cautioned about the future. He predicted a
'satisfactory' result for the year, but did not at this stage, expect an
improvement on last year's Pounds 2.35m, 'unless financial market conditions
became much easier'.
Operating income for the six months was Pounds 4.32m and earnings per share
came to 14.7p. The interim dividend has been raised to 3.4p (3.25p).
The figures were prepared in accordance with new accounting rules for banks
and because of the different reporting basis, no comparatives are available.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Prospect Inds rises 2% in difficult
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospect Industries, the power station engineering and maintenance group,
saw profits edge up 2 per cent to Pounds 5.17m before exceptional items in
the year to September 30.
Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said that trading conditions in the UK
remained 'extremely difficult' with no immediate prospect of improvement.
But he added: 'Competitors such as Babcock and Senior have both lost money
in our sector and I don't see managements of their quality allowing that to
continue.'
Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 67.4m but margins slipped, partly
reflecting the costs of expansion overseas. US profits fell to Pounds
128,000 (Pounds 333,000) on turnover of Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 5.1m).
Last month, Prospect acquired Whessoe's lossmaking piping systems division
for Pounds 11.7m in shares with the aim of accelerating its international
development.
Its UK-based business is now being integrated with Prospect at a cost of
between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m. Prospect's gearing, which was 108 per
cent at the end of the period, has been cut below 50 per cent following the
acquisition and share issue.
After exceptional items, including a profit of Pounds 736,000 on the sale of
the final tranches of the Graystone loan note, pre-tax profits rose to
Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 4.02m). The company's brokers, Peel Hunt, forecast a
rise to Pounds 8.5m this year.
Adjusted earnings per share were 2.01p (1.93p) and the final dividend is
0.56p giving a total for the year of 0.85p (0.8p) - up 6.25 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Marling unloads lossmaking subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marling Industries, the industrial textiles company, yesterday announced a
25 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and the sale of its
lossmaking German industrial webbing subsidiary.
Mr David Abel Smith, chief executive, said that the disposal of Oppermann
was part of the strategy of concentrating on higher margin products. 'We
have now completed the task of eliminating the problems of the past.'
The original owner, Mr Hans Dieter Oppermann, has acquired the company -
which lost DM363,000 (Pounds 148,000) in the six months to September 30 -
for the nominal consideration of DM1. Oppermann will retain debts of
DM810,000.
Marling is keeping Oppermann's seatbelt webbing business, which has been
transferred to its Netherlands factory. It incurred a Pounds 1.24m loss on
the disposal.
Marling's pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose to Pounds
1.14m - after the Pounds 1.24m charge - compared with Pounds 910,000, which
included Pounds 485,000 losses on disposals. Turnover advanced 8 per cent to
Pounds 32m. That compared with Pounds 29.5m - including Pounds 4.04m from
discontinued operations.
Operating margins on continuing businesses rose from 7 per cent to 9.8 per
cent, despite higher raw materials costs.
Mr William Rollason, finance director, said that all the group's businesses
had shown improvement. The main business, seatbelt webbing, benefited from
increased demand in the UK and continental Europe.
Gearing fell from 95 per cent to 83 per cent. Mr Rollason said the ratio
would be 70 to 75 per cent at the year end.
Earnings per share fell to 0.08p (0.29p). The company said that on
continuing operations, and before charges, earnings rose to 0.78p (0.35p).
The interim dividend is 0.25p (0.2p), payable as a foreign income dividend.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hogg Robinson falls to Pounds 7.9m -
Absence of exceptional gains this time has impact on interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, yesterday
reported sharply lower first half pre-tax profits refecting the absence of
exceptional gains.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 7.91m,
against Pounds 14.3m when the results included a Pounds 6.7m exceptional
gain from the sale of the leisure travel business to Airtours for Pounds 25m
last year.
However, excluding exceptional items, all three core businesses showed
significant growth over the period, helped by the performance of the five
acquisitions reported earlier this year.
Turnover grew to Pounds 95.1m (Pounds 78.8m) including Pounds 5.05m from
acquisitions and operating profit increased to Pounds 7.48m, compared with
Pounds 6.75m last time when discontinued operations contributed Pounds 1.2m.
The interim dividend is increased to 2.95p (2.75p), payable from earnings of
7.25p (17.28p) per share. The shares closed down  1/2 p at 201p.
Mr Brian Perry, chairman, commenting on the results, said progress so far
had been, 'in line with plan' and added that the group was, 'looking forward
to a traditionally strong second half with attractive contributions from the
successful integrations of the acquisitions made earlier in the year.'
Underpinning the strong operating performance, the business travel division
increased its profits by almost 50 per cent to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 1.62m)
on sales which grew from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 19.9m.
Transport improved its market share in its European trailer operations and
posted a 35 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.5m) aided
by healthy contributions from its two new acquisitions, Nippress and Snel
coupled with a recovery in the Shipping Services business, which mainly
undertakes cargo movements between the UK and the Falklands Islands.
Meanwhile the financial services division reported a 15 per cent rise in
profits to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.35m), aided by contributions from the
acquisitions of Skillbase and Claybrook. Mr Perry said the recent
acquisition of Bain Hogg's financial services business from Inchcape
positioned the group, 'as one of the leading independent financial advisors
in the UK.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo rises 19% to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalamazoo, the computer services and printed systems group, continued its
profits growth with a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax figures in the six months
to September 30.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3m, against Pounds 2.53m in the same period last
year. This turned into earnings per share of 4.98p (4.2p), and prompted an
interim dividend increase from 0.85p to 1p.
Group turnover, however, was slightly lower at Pounds 28.26m (Pounds
29.56m).
However, Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive, explained that in the computer
services division, new products had been introduced which had led to Pounds
3m of firm orders with a further Pounds 3m under negotiation. The results
would come through in the second half.
In the printed systems division - lossmaking in 1992-93 but profitable after
restructuring - Kalamazoo has been cutting back the range of products and
moving into higher value new lines like security printing.
During the second half, Kalamazoo expects a contribution from its newly
acquired ET Hi-Tec and WIS Computer Systems, both bought to expand the
computer services division. During the first half, new acquisitions
accounted for Pounds 13,000 of operating profit of Pounds 2.77m (Pounds
2.52m).
The group holds net cash of Pounds 7.4m. 'We can do small acquisitions
without going to the market for cash,' said Mr Langmore.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rooney denies Spring Ram stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Rooney, the former chairman of Spring Ram, yesterday denied reports
that he was looking for a buyer for his 13.5 per cent stake in the kitchen,
bathroom and furniture group.
Mr Rooney, who unveiled a Pounds 6.6m deal last week to take control of
Atreus, the bathroom goods supplier, said he had no plans to sell the Spring
Ram stake. However he acknowledged that he would sell, if offered the right
price.
He said he had received several inquiries, 'but no serious approaches',
following newspaper reports that he was seeking a buyer for his shares. At
current prices, his stake in Spring Ram is worth about Pounds 26m. The
shares were unchanged yesterday at 43p.
Mr Rooney was forced off the Spring Ram board by institutional investors 14
months ago following revelations of false accounting at its Balterley
Bathrooms subsidiary and three profit warnings in eight months. Before this,
the group had enjoyed 13 years of rapid growth.
Spring Ram announced on Friday that it was continuing its recent expansion
with the Pounds 4.6m cash acquisition of Pland, a maker of stainless steel
sinks.
For the year to September 30 Pland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
676,000 (Pounds 570,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 10.5m). Net
assets at the end of the period were Pounds 4.7m.
Mr Roger Regan, who took over as Spring Ram chairman last year, said: 'The
acquisition is further evidence of Spring Ram taking opportunities to make
strategic bolt-on acquisitions.
In June, Spring Ram acquired a furniture company and in August announced a
Pounds 5m investment to start a cabinets business. For the six months to
July 2 it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 34.4m) after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 2.5m for the closure of its Artisan Tile
factory.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JLI shows 31% growth to Pounds 1.73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the continuing 'difficult trading environment', JLI Group, the food
processing and snacks company, reported pre-tax profits up by 31 per cent
from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 1.73m for the six months to end-September.
The advance was achieved on turnover of Pounds 54.3m (Pounds 52.5m),
including Pounds 1.6m from acquisitions, with each of the three divisions
making a 'solid contribution', according to Mr Yoav Gottesman, chairman.
Within food services, which achieved operating profits of Pounds 931,000
(Pounds 877,000) on turnover of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.8m), Jack L Israel
had further strengthened its position as a supplier to the catering
industry, the chairman said.
The reorganisation in the snacks division had also been successful, he said,
with operating profits up from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 784,000 on turnover
down from Pounds 15m to Pounds 13.9m.
Kernels Snack Products, the nut processing business acquired in April, had
met expectations and was now fully integrated.
The food ingredients side, helped by contributions from Turban and Frozen
Herbs, turned in Pounds 887,000 (Pounds 660,000) on turnover up Pounds 2m to
Pounds 19.8m.
Earnings emerged at 2.8p (2.1p) and the interim dividend is 1.65p (1.6p).
The shares closed down 1p at 92p.
Mr Gottesman said the impact of the three cash acquisitions made in the past
12 months, coupled with the seasonally high stock and debtor levels, had
increased gearing in the short term.
Analysts are forecasting profits in the region of Pounds 5m for the year.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rodime losses deepen while US courts hold
key to future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodime, the Scottish disk drive pioneer whose business is the licensing of
its 3.5 inch disk drive technology, has reported a sharp drop in revenue and
a big increase in losses, while its future is heavily dependent on lawsuits
awaiting judgment in the US.
Losses before tax deepened from Dollars 2.14m to Dollars 7.02m (Pounds
4.28m) in the year to September 30, because of administrative costs
associated with lawsuits. Rodime has increased its revolving credit with
Bank of Scotland to Dollars 14m.
The shares were unchanged at 11p yesterday, having peaked at 51 1/2 p
earlier this year. Operating income amounted to Dollars 333,000, against
Dollars 4.18m last year.
Running royalty income fell because no new licence agreements were reached,
and all existing agreements are with east Asian manufacturers whose business
was reduced by intense US competition.
Rodime suffered a setback in April when a Minnesota judge declared invalid
certain claims in its principal disk drive patent in a suit with Quantum,
the US disk drive maker.
Rodime now hopes to hear within three to six months the outcome of its
appeal, heard earlier this month by the court of appeals in Washington DC.
If the appeal succeeds it will resume its action against Quantum. If Rodime
loses, the case against Quantum would fail and the scope of infringement by
other disk drive makers, including Seagate, would be materially reduced.
Losses came out at 5 cents (1.9 cents) per share.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Utd Carriers warns again as too little is
now too much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Events at United Carriers took a surreal turn yesterday as the parcel
delivery group issued its second profit warning since going public in
February. It blamed the first setback on too few parcels; the second on too
many.
Yesterday's warning was accompanied by a boardroom shake-up which sees Mr
Michael Howe resign as group managing director and Mr Allan Binks step down
as chairman while remaining chief executive.
Mr Binks said: 'We have made a right mess of our return to the stock market
and none of us can completely absolve ourselves.'
The company warned that profits in the second half would be below the first
half's Pounds 1.2m. The shares fell 15p to 79p, half the flotation price of
153p, as analysts cut full year forecasts from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2m.
In May, when forecasts were Pounds 4.8m, the company warned it had suffered
a sharp fall in parcel volumes in April. In response it started an
aggressive selling campaign. 'In the space of a few days a the end of
September volumes shot up and we were unable to introduce new resources
quickly enough,' said Mr Binks.
Operating costs rose sharply as the company was forced to hire new vehicles
and take on temporary labour to clear the backlog.
Compensation has yet to be agreed for Mr Howe, who has a two year rolling
contract on a salary of Pounds 95,000. He will continue to manage the parcel
business until his unnamed replacement arrives in January.
Mr Binks said his own Pounds 140,000 salary would not be cut in line with
his reduced responsibilities. The new chairman is Mr Doublas Rogers,
chairman of Newman Tonks.
The company said it would pay a final dividend of 3.3p 'in the absence of
unforeseen circumstances'. The flotation was sponsored by Lazard Brothers
with brokers UBS.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 20.8m glass buy for CRH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the building materials group, has expanded its interests in the US
through the acquisition of Tempglass Group, a glass fabricator, for Dollars
20.8m (Pounds 12.6m) cash.
The acquisition through Oldcastle, CRH's US holding company, will allow CRH
to expand its market and product range, making it the largest independent
glass fabricator in North America with total sales of Dollars 160m.
It will provide increased purchasing leverage with glass suppliers, and a
wider product range for the North American markets, where Oldcastle already
has 14 plants in 12 states.
Tempglass operates four plants in Ohio, Texas, Florida and California,
producing tempered, insulated and laminated glass, mostly for the
non-residential construction sector. Sales in 1993 were Dollars 54m and was
expected to break-even in 1994.
Tempglass, originally part of RTZ, was bought out by its management. On the
death of the largest partner earlier this year, CRH bid for the shares of
the other two partners, who will be retained as managers.
The purchase brings CRH's total global acquisitions in 1994 to IPounds 120m
Pounds 118m).

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sidlaw on target with 33% rise - Full
contribution from former Courtaulds business swells profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sidlaw Group yesterday rev-ealed a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
boosted by a full 12-month contribution from the flexible packaging
businesses acquired from Courtaulds in late summer 1993.
The profits for the year to September 30 were in line with estimates at the
time of its Pounds 24m rights issue in October.
The Courtaulds acquisition cost Pounds 78m, partially financed by a Pounds
53m cash call; the recent rights - from which the Scotland-based packaging,
oil services and textiles company will have access to about Pounds 32m - was
to fund a two-year reorganisation and capital expenditure programme for the
packaging side.
Group turnover swelled to Pounds 289.4m (Pounds 172.9m). Operating profits
grew 50 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 12.5m), but sharply increased
interest charges of Pounds 4.18m (Pounds 1.54m) led to a more modest pre-tax
rise to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 11.1m).
Mr Ian Bodie, finance director, said that accounting rules stipulated the
inclusion of discounted bills in the balance sheet. This meant gearing
climbed to 82 (79) per cent; otherwise it would have fallen to 64 (73) per
cent. Pro forma post-rights gearing will be about 30 per cent.
The packaging side made operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 4.72m) on
turnover of Pounds 161.2m (Pounds 54.1m).
Raw material prices for the division continue to rise with basic resin up 70
per cent over the year and polypropylene up 40 per cent. Mr Digby Morrow,
chief executive, said shortages were being experienced but he was unsure if
price peaks had yet been reached.
Profits from oil services fell to Pounds 6.93m (Pounds 7.25m) on turnover of
Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 94.5m) after increased losses of Pounds 472,000
(Pounds 342,000) from the Supplylink joint venture.
Textiles lifted profits to Pounds 713,000 (Pounds 564,000), after the
recovery of a bad debt previously written off. Turnover was 25.4m (Pounds
24.3m) and the division remains up for sale.
Earnings edged ahead to 20.6p (20.3p) per share and the final dividend of
6.5p lifts the total to 11p (10.5p).
COMMENT
While the oil services side is a good business giving steady growth - albeit
at the mercy of the oil price - the packaging side is a much riskier
proposition with potentially greater rewards. Analysts now believe too much
was spent on the Courtaulds businesses and their reorganisation, but that is
history and there is no doubt the packaging side had to expand or wither.
The capital expenditure will not show benefits for about 18 months and the
10 per cent margin target for the division by 1997 is ambitious. If
achieved, however, that would give earnings of about 30p, giving the shares
considerable room for improvement. The jury is out on whether Sidlaw can
follow its script, but more are optimistic than not. Flat profits of Pounds
16m (after an interest fall) are forecast for earnings of about 18p and a
p/e of 11, well below the market.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr feud continues as deal terms rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The family feud at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust flared up yesterday as rebel
shareholders rejected a last-ditch agreement with the board of the motor and
leisure group.
The rebels, led by brothers Nicholas and Robert Barr, rejected the deal
which had been settled at the end of last week. They also voted down the
board's proposals to reform the company's two-tier share structure.
The deal would have paved the way for the brothers to join the board and for
their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, to resign as chairman.
However, the brothers, who speak for more than 50 per cent of ordinary
voting shares, said the board had rejected 'compromise proposals'.
Mr Nicholas Barr said: 'Serious concerns were expressed by management within
the company's two main divisions and the company failed to finalise
essential elements of Friday's deal.'
The board had wanted to enfranchise the non-voting A shares, owned almost
entirely by institutional investors, at an extraordinary meeting in Leeds
yesterday.
It said that the brothers had made unreasonable demands including the
appointment of an additional non-executive director and the payment of their
independent adviser bills, thought to amount to Pounds 245,000.
The rebel shareholders, who want to demerge the company's two divisions,
have requisitioned a further EGM on Thursday to remove Mr Parker and Mr
Brian Small, finance director.
The ordinary shares rose 10p yesterday to 543p, while the A shares rose 8p
to 266p, before news of the enfranchisement vote was released.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Daniel Thwaites, the brewer, wine merchant and public house and hotels
operator, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 3.84m in the
half year to September 30.
Last time there was an exceptional Pounds 565,000 loss on the sale of
properties and related plant and the result this time was also helped by
reduced interest charges of Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 2.26m).
Turnover improved to Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 38m). Earnings per share emerged
at 12.9p (9.9p) and the interim dividend is raised to 1.3p (1.2p).
The company's shares trade under Rule 535 (2).

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: QMH's debt plan in time for AGM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group, plans to publish proposals for its
Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring in the next three weeks.
The group said it hoped to announce the principal terms of the restructuring
before the annual meeting, now set for December 21. The announce-ment is
likely to come days, rather than weeks, before the AGM because of continuing
objections by just one of the more than 70 debt holders.
This is thought to be Trust Company of the West, a US debt trader which
bought its stake in the secondary market. Any restructuring deal needs the
approval of all lenders.
Meanwhile, a group of rebel QMH shareholders is proposing a rescue rights
issue instead of the restructuring plan which is expected to dilute
substantially existing stakes. In a letter, Mr Dennis Woodhams of the QMH
Shareholders' Action Group, urges fellow investors to consider his draft
proposals and projections to be presented at a meeting soon. A rights issue
would be 'fairer to shareholders' and satisfy bankers, says Mr Woodhams.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Field Group advances to Pounds 7.26m at
halfway stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Field Group, the carton maker which went public in July last year, increased
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 7.26m in the 26 weeks to October
2.
Compared with the pro forma figure for the previous half year, which assumes
that flotation took place at the beginning of that period rather than in
July, pre-tax profits rose by 7 per cent from Pounds 6.79m.
In a tough market environment of rising raw materials costs and fierce
competition in the food and household sector, total sales nudged up 3.5 per
cent to Pounds 77.7m (Pounds 75m) and operating profits were up 5 per cent
at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.97m).
Operating margins were slightly higher at 9.4 per cent, against 9.3 per cent
the previous year. Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said: 'We have tried
to maintain the margin rather than go for increased volume.'
Field, which has a 14 per cent share of the UK market, saw raw materials
prices rise by about 25 per cent. The most difficult sector in which to pass
these on to customers was food and household products, where there was tough
competition among supermarket retailers.
In the international and branded sector, which constitutes 52 per cent of
group sales, Field has recently won two important single supply contracts -
a five-year deal with United Distillers, worth some Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m a
year in sales, and another long-term contract with William Grant &amp; Sons
Distillers, worth Pounds 1.5m a year.
Helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.77m) and a reduced
interest bill of Pounds 48,000 (Pounds 176,000), pro forma earnings per
share improved by 11 per cent to 9.4p (8.5p). The interim dividend is 2.5p
(2.3p). The shares rose 3p to 232p, against a flotation price of 250p.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Normand helps European Motor to advance 48%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Motor Holdings, the motor retail and services group, lifted pre-tax
profits 48 per cent from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 3.89m in the six months to
September 30. The shares rose 3p to 124p.
In July the group bought Normand Motor Group in a deal worth Pounds 11.75m,
doubling its size. In two months, the acquisition contributed Pounds 1.2m to
group operating profits of Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 2.86m).
Mr Richard Palmer, EMH chief executive, said benefits deriving from the
integration of the 20 Normand dealerships - including greater management
controls, shrinkage in the workforce, the introduction of a used car
business and facility improvements - would come through within 18 months to
two years.
Reorganisation costs of Pounds 425,000 and a Pounds 106,000 provision for a
non-core disposal took a large bite from the Pounds 778,000 profit made from
the sale of Norman's Mercedes-Benz dealership in Bristol.
Growth in the pre-Normand dealerships was modest at Pounds 2.07m (Pounds
1.96m), though Mr Palmer said that August was 'a little better than last
year' and had started with a robust order intake, which fell off slightly.
He said he was confident of 'the market for the types of cars we sell' -
premium and prestige cars - would be moving forward and cited the strong
January order book as an indicator of the upturn.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 126.2m (Pounds 81.5m) with Normand pitching in
Pounds 40.3m.
Operating profits on the motor services side slid to Pounds 1.08m (Pounds
1.38m), partly as a result of some customers of Wilcomatic, the automatic
car-wash subsidiary, deferring purchases into the next financial year.
Earnings grew to 6.6p (4.9p) per share and the interim dividend is raised
from 1.725p to 2p.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Schroder invests in Limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroder Venture Advisers on behalf of institutional investors has paid
Pounds 35m for a 26.9 per cent stake in Limelight, which intends to seek a
listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Limelight, which sells and installs fitted kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms and
conser-vatories, claims to be the largest privately-owned company in the UK
home improvements market.
The investment by Schroder values the company at Pounds 130m. Limelight is
forecasting after-tax profits of Pounds 11.2m, operating profits of Pounds
13m, and sales of Pounds 120m for the year to end-December.
Its brand names include Moben and Kitchens Direct (kitchens); Dolphin
(bathrooms); Sharps and Limelight (bathrooms); and Portland
(conservatories).
The company expects to have more than doubled its number of showrooms from
185 at the end of last year to more than 300 by the end of this year and to
about 500 by the end of 1996.
NM Rothschild and Apax Partners have acted as financial advisers to
Limelight, which is owned by its management led by Mr Stephen Boler its
founder and principal shareholder.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Green's Heron offer clears its first hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Steven Green's HNV Acquisition yesterday cleared the first hurdle to
gaining control of Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group,
by getting substantial support from ordinary shareholders for his offer.
Acceptances were received in respect of 54 per cent of ordinary shares,
while a further 38 per cent are held by Heron's banks, which are understood
to have agreed to support the offer.
The Annual Meeting was held yesterday, and all the resolutions were passed
by more than 95 per cent of voters, including changes to the company's
articles of association, which remove a number of standard shareholder
rights.
However, the key to Mr Green's success remains in the support of the senior
and junior bondholders, who will meet tomorrow.
Swiss Bank Corporation, which is advising HNVA, said that 'voting
instructions indicate substantial support for these bondholder resolutions'.
A sufficient number of votes have been received to ensure that there will be
a quorum at the bondholders' meetings.
Heron's investors are being offered a cash value that represents 45 per cent
of the nominal value of senior bonds, 6 per cent of the value of junior
bonds, and Pounds 7.50 per 1,000 ordinary shares.
Parties who looked at Heron when it was auctioned earlier this year, have
suggested that HNVA was offering a full price for the company.
Mr Gary Klesch, a dissident bondholder, said last week that there was
another interested party who might present a package which would offer a
lower risk means of participating in the future recovery of Heron.
No buyer has emerged, and Heron is adamant that the only alternative to HNVA
is liquidation, which would bring in less than Mr Green's cash offer, while
involving far longer delays in payment.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort in French move to win more
privatisation work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, is to team up its Paris corporate
finance department with French executives and shareholders in an effort to
win more privatisation work.
Kleinwort will put its existing corporate finance team of five professionals
into the venture, capitalised at FFr60m (Pounds 7.15m), in which it will
have a 51 per cent stake.
'We can no longer confine ourselves to the UK,' said Mr Michael Martin, head
of Kleinwort Benson France. The minority shareholding will be placed with
French institutions as is customary for French merchant banks. Four
insurance companies have already committed themselves to taking stakes.
Another key element in Kleinwort's effort to present its venture as a
domestic French merchant bank is the appointment of Mr Christian Giacomotto.
Kleinwort has lured Mr Giacomotto, who will chair the board, from Groupe
Lagardaire, the diversified conglomerate, where he was chairman of Banque
Arjil, its investment banking subsidiary.
Kleinwort Benson said it hoped the appointment of a 'well-networked'
Frenchman would give it a 'French patina' and contribute to greater success
in winning French privatisation mandates.
In UK privatisations, Kleinwort has established a name as one of the most
active houses but France has proved a difficult market and Kleinwort has
only acted in subsidiary roles.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Salvesen plans distribution growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen has made no secret of its desire to build itself up as a
business services group, getting rid of some of its disparate operations and
spending proceeds on distribution and specialist plant hire.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are concentrating the
business on distribution and Aggreko,' and he described the sale of Salvesen
Bricks and Vikoma as a sensible move towards cleaning up its corporate
structure.
In the short term, however, analysts expect this strategy to reduce earnings
per share, as the management will be challenged to find an equally
profitable home for the cash.
The bricks division was expected to make operating profits of more than
Pounds 7m in the year to March 1995, while attracting a sale price of not
much above Pounds 50m.
Salvesen is expected to channel the proceeds into expanding its industrial
distribution business into Europe, probably through acquisitions.
Mr Masters said yesterday that industrial distribution in Europe was like UK
food retail distribution 10 years ago, and offered enormous potential.
Following the successful integration of Swift, Salvesen is now looking to
broaden its distribution interests in both Europe and the US.
In April this year, the company paid FFr57m (Pounds 6.77m) for a French
frozen good distributor. Further purchases are expected.
COMMENT
Given Salvesen's surprise revelation last February of difficulties in its
plant hire business, combined with tough competition in UK distribution,
these results were roughly in line with expectations. Disposals will help
fund the group's expanding distribution business, but investors will still
want to be persuaded that the Aggreko plant hire business is under control.
Problems in Europe and in Light &amp; Sound Design, suggest that further
reassurance will be required. On a profits forecast of about Pounds 81.5m,
Salvesen's shares are trading on a p/e of 12.9, but this discount to the
sec-tor rating looks set to remain.

FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield buys Belgravia property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsfield, the property company run by Mr Elliott Bernerd, has formed a
joint venture to buy some of central London's most expensive residential
property for Pounds 48.5m.
The 17 buildings on the Chesham Place Estate, between Eaton Square and
Belgrave Square in Belgravia, are being acquired from the executors of the
estate of Mr Eric Hopton, who died in 1991.
Chelsfield is taking a 50 per cent interest in a new joint venture with
Olayan, the Saudi Arabian investment institution, to buy the portfolio.
The Chesham Place Estate comprises 121,000 sq ft of residential
accommodation, including some of the capital's most exclusive addresses, and
85,000 sq ft of offices.
Chelsfield said that the portfolio had been valued for banking purposes at
Pounds 53.5m.
Most of the houses and apartments are let on occupational leases at rents
far lower than could be achieved in the open market.
The estate generates an annual rental income of Pounds 1.3m, against an
estimated Pounds 3m which could be achieved if all the property was let at
today's rents.
The majority of the leases expire in September 1995. Chelsfield will then be
free to either negotiate new leases with the occupants or to sell the
properties.
'The estate has been well looked after but there are some development
opportunities for us,' commented Mr Bernerd, Chelsfield chairman. 'We
envisage a gradual realisation of the portfolio over a number of years.'
Knight Frank and Rutley, the surveyors, estimated that the break-up value of
the estate could be as high as Pounds 80m.
Mr Bernerd added that long leaseholds offered for sale would have rarity
value, because Belgravia is dominated by the Cadogan and Grosvenor Estates,
which tend to grant shorter lea-ses.
The joint venture company will fund the acquisition through bank borrowings.
Chelsfield will manage the properties in return for a management fee linked
to the investment performance of the portfolio.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Eurotunnel attacks report by Klesch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row has erupted between Eurotunnel and Klesch &amp; Company, the London-based
bank debt trader, over a report issued by Klesch called 'Eurotunnel Interim
Results - Disaster Ahead'. The channel tunnel operator has written to
Fimbra, the financial regulator, saying the report is 'seriously misleading
and is plainly the product of serious negligence'.
The letter by Mr Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, says
'there appear to me to be the plainest indications of a breach of your rule
requiring reports of this sort to be fair and not misleading and
consequently clear grounds for an investigation'.
Mr Gary Klesch, founder of the debt-trading firm, said there was 'nothing
wrong with the report . . . We stand by it.'
He complained that Eurotunnel had consistently refused to co-operate with
his firm's analysts when they were preparing reports and that there was 'no
hint that Fimbra is taking the complaint seriously'.
Mr Klesch urged the company 'to use the courts' if it believed the report
was seriously in error.
Mr Corbett believes that the report is in part responsible for Eurotunnel's
bank debt being quoted in the secondary market at 60p in the pound.
A number of Eurotunnel's 200 bank creditors have become concerned about the
low market price for these loans. As a result, Mr Corbett has also written
to Mr Anthony Jarrett, who co-ordinates Eurotunnel's relationship with its
banks, asking him to inform them it has 'filed a formal complaint' against
Klesch &amp; Company.
The Klesch report, written last month, forecasts that the group runs out of
cash next year and has a Pounds 423m deficiency at the end of 1998.
Mr Corbett says this is 'fundamentally wrong' because Klesch omits from its
calculation 'any utilisation of the Pounds 647m of new senior debt (raised
this summer)' and also takes no account of a further Pounds 49m guaranteed
from the exercise of warrants by Transmanche Link, the contracting
consortium, and its adviser, Swiss Banking Corporation.
Mr Corbett says that, even on pessimistic assumptions, the group would have
'Pounds 273m of unused facilities' at the end of 1998.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Salvesen to sell pollution control and brick units:
Distribution and hire group looks at disposals as profits flatten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen, the distribution and specialist hire company, is looking
to sell its pollution control and brick manufacturing divisions by the end
of this financial year, raising around Pounds 60m to invest in its core
businesses. The disposals would almost halve its Pounds 129m of net
borrowings and Salvesen is looking at acquisitions in European distribution,
after the success of its Pounds 84m purchase of Swift, the industrial
distribution company.
The group's results, however, were less upbeat. Pre-tax profits for the six
months to September rose by 1 per cent to Pounds 41.4m, despite the impact
of Swift, which was purchased in October 1993.
Salvesen issued a profits warning last February, after a rapid downturn from
Aggreko, its specialist plant hire business. Aggreko's latest figures reveal
a turnround in the US, which achieved 23 per cent growth. Generator hire for
the World Cup helped, but it also benefited from large cost cuts. However,
Aggreko's European businesses offset most of this improvement.
Light &amp; Sound Design, acquired for Pounds 7.6m in 1991, slumped into loss,
and Salvesen plans to trim its operations. This could lead to second-half
write-downs, which will offset likely profits from the sale of the brick
business. Overall, the specialist hire division saw operating profits fall
4.5 per cent to Pounds 14.8m.
Distribution now accounts for almost half of Salvesen's Pounds 319.3m
(Pounds 262.3m) turnover, and the division's profits rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 21.6m, boosted by a Pounds 5.7m contribution from Swift.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said Swift had been fully integrated into
the division, and performed better than expectations. It has given Salvesen
a substantial push into distribution for industrial companies, which he sees
as a growth area in the UK and Europe. The group won new contracts during
the period, from Texaco Oils, BASF and Lucas Industries.
The UK food sector remains competitive, but Salvesen has renewed
distribution contracts with Safeway and Haagen-Dazs, on 'reasonable' terms.
However, profits at the US division fell 15 per cent to Dollars 6.1m (Pounds
3.7m).
Food Services profits fell 13 per cent to Pounds 6.5m, while the brick
manufacturing division more than doubled to Pounds 3.6m.
Interests payments rose from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.7m, reflecting the
impact of the Swift acquisition, added to a further Pounds 41.1m (Pounds
40.4m) of capital expenditure for the interim period.
The company is paying a 3.4p dividend, up from 3.3p. Earnings per share were
10.5p (10.29p).

FT  29 NOV 94 / Bayer seeks less crowded sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German chemicals multinational, is to re-focus its
pharmaceuticals research away from crowded market sectors and step up
spending on the hunt for treatments for allergies, rheumatic ailments and
Alzheimer's disease, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, group chairman.
Budgets for established areas of interest such as heart and circulatory
disease therapies would be reduced in favour of those offering greater
possibilities for discovering and exploiting innovative drugs, he said.
Reporting a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first nine
months of the current year, forecasting full-year earnings up from DM2.4bn
to DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), and hinting of an increased dividend, Mr
Schneider said he had no plans for any further acquisitions in the
pharmaceuticals sector.
However, Bayer was in other takeover negotiations and was planning a major
co-operative venture. He expected negotiations to be completed during the
first quarter of the new year.
The group has recently spent DM2.1bn in the US on acquiring ChemDesign, a
stake in the Schein generic drugs group and the self-medication business of
Sterling Winthrop. Mr Walter Wenninger, the director for pharmaceuticals
said the group had six new drugs in the final stages of clinical testing.
Although some might not make it to market, they had a combined annual sales
potential of up to DM5bn, he said. Among existing products, the antibiotic
Ciprobay is expected to turn over more than DM2bn this year. He added that
the Adalat high blood-pressure treatment had the potential to reach this
level, while Gluxobay, already achieving sales of DM600m, would bring in
more than DM1bn once approved in the US.
The group as a whole had the potential to increase earnings to more than
DM4bn a year within two or three years, Mr Schneider said.
Forecasting sales of around DM43bn for the current year, Mr Schneider said
he expected foreign markets to grow more than Germany, where sales had risen
only 1 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, and now
accounted for less than 20 per cent of group turnover.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Finance Ministry orders derivative transparency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's financial institutions will be required for the first time to
disclose information about their derivative holdings, the Finance Ministry
said yesterday.
The disclosure rule is expected to focus on the type of derivatives
contracts and their value, and could be enforced as early as next March,
according to ministry officials.
The market in derivatives, securities such as futures and options contracts,
developed in Japan in the late 1980s. Trading in many widely-used
instruments is highly circumscribed by the Finance Ministry, but Japanese
banks and brokers have been active in developing a market in those
derivatives that are permitted.
In the last year regulators watched with alarm as the highly-geared nature
of derivatives increased the exposure of companies to heavy losses. Earlier
this month, one Japanese broker, Tokyo Securities reported that it had lost
Y32bn (Pounds 207m) from contracts on currency options, a sum equivalent to
more than a third of the value of its shareholders' equity.
The authorities have expressed deepening concern about the market, as
Japanese companies previously were required to give only sketchy details
about their derivatives portfolios.

FT  29 NOV 94 / JAL says Y176bn currency losses will not hit earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan Airlines said yesterday its earnings would be unaffected by estimated
losses on 1985 forward currency buying contracts totalling Y176.3bn (Pounds
1.1bn) by the end of this accounting year.
The size of the figure, unconfirmed by JAL, caused a 4 per cent drop to Y681
in the share price, although analysts have long known that the airline is
working its way through a huge pile of currency losses caused by the
dollar's sharp fall against the yen.
JAL said the losses had already been accounted for in past and future
aircraft depreciation charges. While unable to confirm the exact loss,
calculated by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper from currency contract records,
JAL said it was based on correct data, covering the decade to March 1995.
Last month JAL announced Y43.9bn of unrealised currency losses for the two
years until March 1997. It was JAL's first such announcement, a consequence
of a change in Japanese disclosure rules to give investors more information
about companies' currency exposure.
Others to have disclosed currency losses in their half-year reports include
All Nippon Airways, with a Y10.7bn shortfall - also on forward dollar buying
contracts - and 10 companies in the construction and electronics sectors.
JAL's currency shortfall comes from forward contracts to buy dollars for
yen, at rates agreed in the mid 1980s, when the dollar was worth more. JAL
needs to buy dollars every year, because it pays more than Dollars 1bn
annually for fuel and aircraft, but earns most of its revenue in yen.
Forward contracts allow it to calculate in advance the full yen cost of
buying aircraft, even at the risk of a costly miscalculation.
The company used to take out long term futures contracts, running up to 10
years ahead, to fund its aircraft buying programme. Alarmed by the growing
currency losses. Mr Susumu Yamaji, the president, earlier this year asked
his finance department to buy dollars on shorter and less risky forward
contracts.
JAL reported a turnround with a Y20.6bn recurring profit on its operations
for the six months to September and is expected by equity analysts to make a
small profit for the full year, turning the corner after three years of
losses.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Williams cools down the fire: Acquisition 'slowdown' to
follow Pounds 80m purchase of BBA hoses-and-foam unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings signalled a slowdown in its hectic acquisition campaign as
it announced plans to purchase the fire protection arm of BBA Group, the
automotive components company, for Pounds 80m, including assumed debt.
The deal brings the total spent on acquisitions by the diversified
industrial group to almost Pounds 250m in the past 12 months.
Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, expected the pace of acquisitions to
slow. 'We have got to digest these businesses first,' he said. Williams has
bought four other businesses since December, some of which were funded by a
Pounds 267m rights issue in April.
Angus Fire, which makes hoses, foam and foam equipment for the fire
industry, will propel Williams into the world number-one slot for fire hoses
with 21 per cent of the Pounds 110m global market. Williams will also rank
second after Monsanto of Italy in the manufacture of foam and foam
equipment, with roughly 20 per cent of a market estimated at about Pounds
300m. Last year Williams' fire protection division returned operating
profits of Pounds 48m on sales of Pounds 249m.
Mr Rudd said there would be considerable industrial synergy and cost savings
from merging Angus's operations with Silvani of Italy, the foam fire
protection group acquired for Pounds 16.5m in October, and the company's
Kidde subsidiary. He expected that within two to three years the business
would be achieving a return on sales of about 15 per cent, against the 8 per
cent.
Williams is expected to incur costs of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m for
reorganising Angus.
For BBA, the disposal marks a step towards completing the restructuring
launched last year. So far, the group has raised roughly half of the
promised Pounds 200m in disposals.
Mr Roberto Quarta, BBA chief executive, said of the Angus sale: 'It is a
good fit for Williams and a good price for us.' BBA expected a profit on
disposal this year of about Pounds 22m.
Williams accompanied the announcement of the acquisition with a trading
statement described by analysts as 'rather dull'. The company reiterated its
comments at the interim stage that it expected to achieve its 1994
expectations.
'That's not enough for a stock trading on a 12 per cent premium to the
market,' said one analyst. 'We are not getting indications that earnings
momentum is accelerating. That probably killed the joy of the deal.' The
shares closed flat at 348p.
Angus reported operating profits of Pounds 7m, on sales of Pounds 76.1m for
the year to the end of December. Net assets were Pounds 27.4m.
Williams will pay Pounds 69.9m in cash and assume Pounds 10m in debt. The
consideration will be subject to a net asset adjustment.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Spanish carrier in crisis talks as strikes hit airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Airline management and unions were locked in crisis talks last night in an
attempt to prevent Iberia, Spain's national carrier, sliding into
bankruptcy.
Strikes in all domestic airports in protest at proposed cost-cutting
measures brought air traffic in Spain to a virtual halt, stranding some
110,000 passengers.
Altogether 1,125 flights had been cancelled, 800 of which were Iberia
flights, said officials.
The airport chaos highlights a bitter confrontation over Iberia's plans to
slash costs. The dispute threatens to disrupt the government of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez and strain Spain's relations with the European Commission.
Iberia which has reacted late to air traffic deregulation, is struggling
under the financial burden of an ambitious expansion into Latin America,
where it has bought substantial shareholdings in three local carriers,
including Aerolineas Argentinas.
Iberia has Pta150bn (Pounds 731.7m) of accumulated losses and says it faces
bankruptcy early next year unless it pares costs and receives fresh state
aid of some Pta130bn.
However, any capital injection by the government requires the authorisation
of the European Union. In 1992, Iberia was allowed a subsidy of Pta120bn on
condition it did not apply for more aid until 1996.
Iberia has become a test case for Madrid's determination to reduce deficits
in public companies and its escalating losses will fuel the debate in
Brussels over aid to publicly-owned carriers.
Last night's talks were dealt an early blow when representatives of the
pilots' union walked out.
The pilots fear they will bear the brunt of Iberia's planned cuts and are
seeking the removal of its chairman, Mr Javier Salas.
Mr Salas said failure to agree a 15 per cent pay cut would mean the
immediate sacking of 5,000 employees - 20 per cent of Iberia's workforce -
and the break-up of the airline.
The unions representing cabin crews, ground staff, mechanics and other
employees, said wage cuts should be limited to 8 per cent and weighted
towards the higher paid. They said they would continue to disrupt Spain's
air traffic if management went ahead with the lay-offs.
'Iberia has for far too long depended on hand-outs and believed it always
had a safety net,' said a Madrid government official. 'All that is over now
and these are not conventional talks about pay; they are about the survival
of a big company.'
In the absence of a restructuring plan based on the 15 per cent wage cuts,
Iberia says it will be forced to sell off its more profitable business units
to raise capital through disposals.

FT  29 NOV 94 / West and Russia press for ceasefire in Bihac
</HEADLINE>

The US, its European allies and Russia joined forces yesterday to press for
a ceasefire in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac and a broader settlement in
former Yugoslavia.
Mediators from the five-nation contact group - comprising the US, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany - held secret talks with Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic.
In a day of hectic diplomatic activity in former Yugoslavia, Washington and
Brussels, the contact group also called for an immediate truce in Bihac and
in Bosnia as a whole.
The UN said last night that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general,
would meet Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic,
Bosnian Serb leader, in Sarajevo tomorrow to urge an immediate ceasefire.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said Washington would 'seriously
consider' any request for troops to help oversee withdrawal of UN
peacekeepers from Bosnia but hoped no pull-out would be necessary.
His comments were welcomed in Europe as a sign that the US administration,
unlike Congress, remained sympathetic to its allies' concerns.
In Bihac, blood-letting dragged on as two mortar rounds exploded within the
notionally UN-protected 'safe area'. A man was killed.
European Union foreign ministers rejected an attack by Mr Robert Dole,
leader-elect of the Senate's Republican majority, on the stance of Britain
and France. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said Mr Dole's comments -
calling for an immediate UN pullout and arms deliveries to Bosnia -
reflected a mistaken view on what outside forces could do to end the
fighting.
His comments were reinforced by Mr John Major, who dismissed a plea by Ms
Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, for military intervention or a
lifting of the arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems.
Mr Dole said he hoped to narrow his differences with the UK in a trip to
Europe starting today.
'Nato's inability to respond to a war of aggression on south-eastern Europe
raises serious questions about Nato's future plans to expand to central and
eastern Europe,' Mr Dole said.
In spite of Mr Dole's weekend statements that the UN was in the way in
Bosnia and blocking more robust action, the UN late yesterday rejected a
Nato proposal to knock out the Bosnian Serbs' air defences, on the ground
that that would be tantamount to war and would endanger UN troops, including
500 men already in some sort of detention.
Mr Hurd, in a clear reference to US calls for tougher air action, said peace
in the Bihac area 'will not be achieved by fostering illusions about what
Nato air power can achieve'.
British officials said contact group mediators were briefing Mr Milosevic on
the group's latest ideas, reported to include further easing of sanctions on
Serbia if he fully recognises Croatia.
The group has also indicated that it will consider a 'special relationship'
between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia if they accept the peace plan. The idea of
'confederal ties' between Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade was rejected by the
Bosnian government.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Bakery worker wins Pounds 27,500 settlement in asthma case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bakery worker has received Pounds 27,500 in an out-of-court settlement
with his employer after saying inhalation of flour dust gave him asthma.
The settlement was announced yesterday as the Health and Safety Executive
announced research showing that people who inhaled chemical and natural
irritants at work could become life-long asthma victims.
Mr Roger Atley of Shawfield, Glasgow, worked for the Rutherglen plant of
Greggs, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based bakery chain.
The settlement was reached without any admission of liability by Greggs.
The HSE said the case would make employers realise the importance of heeding
warnings about the risks of asthma at work. Mr Atley's union, Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, said it believed the case would 'alert a lot of people
who feel that they have been damaged by inhaling whatever it might be' to
file similar suits.
Robin Thompson and Partners, Mr Atley's solicitors, said they were already
taking legal action on behalf of other bakery workers who said they had
contracted asthma in similar circumstances. Usdaw said it hoped one of those
cases would proceed to court and set a
Mr Atley, who still suffers from breathlessness, has been moved to a part of
the bakery where he has no contact with flour dust.
The HSE's research, jointly funded by the National Asthma Campaign, finds
that increased workplace exposure to such irritants is the most important
factor in provoking occupational asthma.
Previously, researchers had concentrated on the predisposition of an
individual towards allergic reactions, rather than the intensity of exposure
to the irritants, said Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, of Royal Brompton
Hospital, who carried out the research.
Professor Newman Taylor said that although the risk of asthma was primarily
affected by the intensity of exposure to occupational irritants, smokers and
those predisposed to developing allergies were at a higher risk of
contracting the disease.
More than 200 causes of occupational asthma have been identified, and
Professor Newman Taylor estimates that between 1,500 and 2,000 new cases
arise each year.
Along with flour dust, he said, substances used in the manufacture of paint
and plastics, urine from laboratory animals, solvents, grain dust, vehicle
sprays and glues were among the irritants that could cause asthma.
Mr Murray Devine, a senior HSE health policy official, said employers should
install better air extraction systems, enclose the processes that expose
workers to irritants and provide protective equipment such as masks.

FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer has yet again proved itself a class act. Its 60 per cent rise in year
on year pre-tax profits during the third quarter was thanks to hard work as
well as recovery. The cost-cutting has been impressive. During the last four
years staff numbers have been cut 12 per cent, while salaries have been kept
under control. Turnover has been almost static, yet sales per employee
improved 11 per cent. Nor did Bayer stint on capital expenditure during the
recession: the group will have invested more than DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn)
between 1990 and the end of this year.
Such careful husbandry during the downturn is now being rewarded. Sales in
all divisions have started to rise, driven by earlier strategic expansion
into Asia, Latin America and the US. More is yet to come. The group is still
to benefit fully from recovery in Europe, where more than half its turnover
is generated. Year on year, prices were actually down 1 percentage point,
but the group expects to push through increases.
Weaknesses remain. The pharmaceuticals division has not performed well.
However, management has high hopes for the new product portfolio and is
following the example of other groups by reorganising research and
development to raise productivity. Bayer has also addressed the dyestuffs
operations' difficulties, placing them in a joint venture with Hoechst. The
only problem is Agfa, its photographic business, which sits oddly within the
group. Bayer should find some way of disposing of it. The shares, which have
underperformed more cyclical stocks such as Hoechst and BASF, deserve a
rerating.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's chaos on the planes in Spain was nothing compared with the
crisis that would grip the European Commission if it allowed Iberia to be
refinanced yet again by its state owners. Other airlines would cry foul
since the requested Pta130bn (Pounds 634.14m) in refinancing would break
Iberia's undertaking not to seek state aid until 1996.
Iberia's management has masterminded a strategy which generated losses of
Pta120bn since 1992 - the same amount as the state bail-out in that year.
While Iberia's absolute costs have been kept low, revenues have stalled. The
airline has been caught between the Spanish recession, low yields caused by
the high proportion of holiday traffic on its routes, and the absence of
international transit passengers. Its efforts to remedy this by expanding
into Latin America have proved unprofitable.
Iberia must raise capital without begging from the state. It could sell and
lease-back its aircraft, dispose of its European subsidiaries to companies
such as BA or Lufthansa and cut costs still further. If that is not enough,
the group could dismantle its Latin American operations. Iberia would be
without an intercontinental strategy but it could easily merge with another
airline. That might seem a big blow to Spanish pride, but it would be better
than continuing large cash injections from the taxpayer.

FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings yearns to be seen as a focused industrial group rather
than a blindly acquisitive conglomerate. The signs are that it is gradually
winning the battle. Williams' shares command a premium rating of 12 per cent
against the market and are up nearly a quarter against the diversified
industrial sector in the past 12 months.
Yesterday's Pounds 80m deal helps show why. The purchase of Angus Fire on a
multiple of 17 times last year's after-tax profits is unlikely to dilute
Williams' earnings in 1995. This is despite the need for Pounds 3.5m of
restructuring charges to be taken above the line. Thereafter it should
enhance earnings as margins are brought into line with the group's 15 per
cent target and synergies with other fire businesses are exploited. It may
not be huge for a company with a Pounds 2.4bn market capitalisation, but it
demonstrates that Williams is putting its shareholders' money where its
mouth is. Angus is one of the larger transactions in a string of deals -
worth Pounds 250m in the past 12 months - which give credibility to the
strategy of growth by bolt-on acquisitions.
That said, Williams still suffers from a number of problems. Its cash-flow,
though now positive, is still not luxuriant. Moreover, the recurrent need to
write off goodwill following acquisitions means that shareholders' funds are
tiny for so large a group. This means gearing rises rapidly. And as
yesterday's cautious trading statement hinted, trading conditions are
tricky. But Williams deserves its new-found credibility, and its rating.

FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: ABC's star attraction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The big US broadcasters have been kept out of television production for
several decades. Now the shackles are being removed, it is hardly surprising
they are rushing to get into the business. When there is an opportunity to
link up with media titans such as Mr Steven Spielberg, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg
and Mr David Geffen, the temptation to do so must be irresistible. Capital
Cities/ABC clearly hopes for a string of hit TV shows from the trio, which
it can then syndicate throughout the US.
The deal may make sense for ABC. But the commercial logic behind networks
building their own production capacity - rather than buying in programmes on
an arms-length basis - is not clear-cut. On the plus side, vertical
integration should allow cost savings in that a tied studio should not need
its own syndication department. Integration should also shift much of the
risk of making programmes from studios to networks. Arguably such
risk-allocation is efficient, since networks have bigger balance sheets. If
a close relationship allows studio and network to communicate more
effectively, the risk of making dud programmes might even be reduced.
But there are negatives too. Tied studios, secure of an outlet for their
programmes, could easily lose their commercial edge. ABC might also find it
hard to rein in its three stars, if ever their programmes were not up to
scratch or ran over budget. ABC might note that in the UK there is something
of a move away from vertical integration: in a drive to improve value for
money, the BBC is contracting out an increasing proportion of its
production.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Norway No to EU opinion polls predict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two election day opinion polls last night predicted that Norway had rejected
membership of the European Union in a national referendum yesterday, but the
outcome was expected to be close.
One poll on the state NRK television network forecast a 52.6 per cent
majority for the No side, while a survey for the commercial station TV2
predicted a slim No victory with a majority of 50.2 per cent.
Both sides said the surveys were not conclusive pointers, and the results in
favour of the No campaign came despite expectations of a late swing towards
the Yes side.
Officials said turnout had been high among the 3.6m voters, despite
blizzards in the north. They said it could reach 85 per cent, which would be
the biggest participation in any Norwegian vote since 1965. Both camps
claimed high turnout was crucial to their chances of victory.
Norway is the last of four countries from the European Free Trade
Association, due to expand the EU to 16 members next year, to hold a
referendum on the issue. Austria, Finland and Sweden have voted to join.
After Sweden approved membership earlier this month, the Yes side began
making gains as the Labour government, led by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
prime minister, urged Norwegians not to leave the country isolated.
Mrs Brundtland has made the reversal of Norway's rejection of membership of
the European Economic Community in 1972 her central goal over the past four
years.
Despite the traditional reluctance of Norwegians to embrace Brussels - many
fear it will erode the country's independence and control of petroleum and
other natural resources - Mrs Brundtland has sought to persuade the nation
that, after the Cold War, Norway must playa full part in Europe's political
and economic mainstream.
The government faces a problem in the event of a narrow Yes victory. The
opposition Centre party and Socialist Left party, the leaders of the No
campaign, have threatened to block ratification of EU entry in parliament
unless a large majority is in favour. Mrs Brundtland has suggested she will
dissolve parliament and call new elections if that happened.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Save the alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The international community could not save Yugoslavia, and it has failed to
save Bosnia. That failure has hovered like an evil fairy over the cradle of
the European Union. Along with the parallel failure in Somalia, it has
blighted efforts to make a revived United Nations the centre of a new world
order. And it now seems to threaten a death blow to the ageing Atlantic
alliance.
It is too late to save Bosnia as an effective country in its original
frontiers. But Nato might still be saved - though it is desperately
vulnerable - and it is worth saving.
Nato is vulnerable because, with the demise of the Soviet threat, it has
come to be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity by many people on both
sides of the ocean. That may not be such a bad thing if it leads Europeans
to take Nato less for granted than they did in the past, and so to think
more seriously about what they themselves can and should do to ensure their
own security. But it would be no less criminally irresponsible for Europeans
to imagine that they can easily do that without any assistance or
co-operation from the US, than it is for them to assume that such assistance
will always and inevitably be forthcoming.
That is why the alliance is worth saving, even at the cost of some national
pride and self-righteousness. No major power, after all, has any right to
feel proud or self-righteous about the situation in Bosnia. Britain and
France are much given to reminding the world that they, unlike the US, have
troops on the ground. But the events of the last week have cruelly
demonstrated, once again, that those troops are deployed not as an
instrument of policy but as a substitute for one.
Sorry mix
The US is equally prone to accuse the Europeans of betraying the Bosnian
government and appeasing the Serbs. But it has never shown convincingly that
it was able or willing to help the Bosnian government redress the imbalance
of forces on the ground. US policy, like European policy, has been a sorry
mix of indecision, rhetoric and gesture.
Senator Robert Dole, to whose words the mid-term elections have given an
authority equal to, if not greater than, that of President Clinton himself,
has now called for the withdrawal of the UN protection force (Unprofor),
arguing that its presence serves merely as a pretext for Britain and France
to oppose any effective Nato intervention from the air. Those powers, and
other troop contributors, will be sorely tempted to take him at his word.
Undeserved blame
The troops, whose mandate contains almost as many contradictions as it does
Security Council resolutions, are getting a great deal of undeserved blame
for not carrying out a task for which they are not equipped, namely holding
back the Serb offensives and counter-offensives. They are certainly not
saving Bosnia. They are saving an unknown number of individual Bosnian
lives, but possibly at the cost of others if you believe (as many do) that
their presence prolongs the war.
It is never the right time to pull the troops out. Their departure could
easily provoke a resumption of fighting throughout Bosnia and even beyond -
though there is no guarantee that this will not happen anyway. It may also
be violently opposed by one or more parties to the conflict. And it could
easily be accompanied by even more bitter mutual accusations across the
Atlantic than we have already heard. Those are all strong arguments against
withdrawal now - except that the difficulties are likely to get greater
rather than less if more time is left to elapse.
Only the risk of jeopardising a real hope of peace would be a convincing
argument for keeping Unprofor in place. And the only ground on which such
hope can now be based is the acceptance of the Contact Group partition plan
by both the Bosnian and Serbian governments, and the pressure exerted by
Serbia on the Bosnian Serbs to do likewise. If this pressure is not seen to
bear fruit within days, or at most weeks, the Serbs and their Russian
protectors must understand that removing Unprofor and lifting the arms
embargo will become unavoidable for the west irrespective of its effect on
Bosnia, because it will be the only way to save the Atlantic alliance.

FT  29 NOV 94 / All for a share in democracy: Political uncertainty in Italy
is not expected to halt the country's privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody ever said selling off Italy's sprawling public sector would be easy,
and in the past eight months a change of government, political infighting,
and stock market fragility have complicated the task.
However, it will be a bitter irony if the latest and most serious government
crisis derails the programme, because in the last two months the momentum of
the sell-off has picked up again.
In late September, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, badgered by
institutional investors for a firm signal on privatisation, outlined a
revised timetable.
The government has since finally found a buyer for the last morsels of SME,
the state-owned foods, supermarket and catering group, which has taken
nearly two years to dismember and sell. It has also appointed an
international adviser for the sale of further shares in Stet, the
telecommunications holding company. A committee of the upper house of the
Italian parliament last week agreed a framework for independent regulation
of privatised Italian utilities. Most importantly, ministers have proposed a
two-stage privatisation of Enel, one of the world's biggest electricity
companies, from mid-1995.
A simultaneous effort by the government to stimulate demand for shares, by
encouraging the establishment of investment funds and pension funds, is
raising hopes that the state-sector culture in Italy is changing. 'Demand
for 'real shares' will come from Italian mutual funds not from small
savers,' says Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of Akros Finanziaria,
a growing financial services group.
One reason for the hiatus in the privatisation programme was the
inexperience of the new government. Of the Treasury, Budget and Industry
ministers, who are directly responsible for detail of privatisation, only Mr
Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, was at all familiar with the procedure
of committee, cabinet and parliamentary approval. It was he who signed the
documents permitting the June privatisation of Ina, the Treasury-owned
insurer, the only public offer of state-held shares under the Berlusconi
government to date.
The delay was not particularly worrying. Mr Berlusconi's predecessor, Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was also criticised for failing to implement the July
1992 privatisation decree quickly - until late last year, when he initiated
a flurry of share offers in state-controlled banks. Moreover, new ministers
had the crucial 1995 budget to worry about, and, as one analyst puts it,
'it's better that the big privatisations should be done well, than that they
should be done in a hurry'.
What unsettled the markets and the managers of state-controlled companies
was the way some in the new government put a party political spin on the
debate when it came into office in May.
This was partly because new ministers and members of parliament wanted to
stamp their mark on privatisation policy, but also because of clear
divisions within the coalition. For example, the populist Northern League
wanted to see the rapid break-up and sale of state companies, encouraging
competition that would benefit private industry and finance in the north of
the country. The far-right MSI/National Alliance resisted the rapid break-up
of state monopolies, partly, opponents claimed, in order to install its own
supporters in board or senior management positions prior to privatisation.
These factions staked out positions at every level of policy, from the
debate on regulation or shareholder structure to the choice of banks to
co-ordinate the sales.
Top managers in state industry now say they are being left to get on with
preparing for privatisation, and advocates of a controlled and politically
neutral reduction of the state's presence seem happy again. 'At the
beginning and in the first months (of this government) there was strong
pressure to go back to the old system,' says one manager.' All of a sudden,
that pressure has faded out.'
That may be a sign that disruptive elements in the new government are
settling in, or possibly that they are too distracted by crises to worry
about shaping privatisation policy to their own ends.
The Treasury and managers of the state-owned companies do not believe
current political turmoil will halt the programme. No mainstream party
actively opposes privatisation. At issue has been its timing and form. And
both the government and IRI, the state holding company that controls Stet,
need the proceeds to reduce debt.
But the replacement of key ministers, a change of coalition, or even a
general election, could seriously delay the tough timetable set by the
current administration. And even if the existing coalition survives, the
task is not easy.
For example, although ministers' agreement on a plan for the sale of Enel
was hailed as progress, the proposed structure of the group reflects an
uneasy compromise between feuding coalition members: the Northern League
wanted to break up the company and allow tariffs to vary across the country;
and the National Alliance, with the support of Enel management and trade
unions, backed an integrated group and single-tariff structure.
Under the government plan, there will be a single tariff. But before
launching a first tranche of Enel shares around the middle of next year, the
generating activities (accounting for 80 per cent of electricity produced in
Italy) will have been hived off into one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries,
in preparation for the sale of production capacity within three years.
This formula risks displeasing all. Enel unions staged a one-day strike last
week and opponents could delay parliamentary approval of a single authority
to regulate the sector, setting back the timetable.
Furthermore, Enel's estimated market capitalisation of L20,000bn-L30,000bn
(Pounds 11.8bn) would make it one of the largest companies on the Milan
stock market, which could mean small investors find it difficult to digest.
The other candidates for privatisation next year - Stet, the telecoms
holding company, and the Agip/Snam energy activities of the state holding
company, Eni - are almost as big. The government also wants to complete
privatisation of IMI, the financial services and banking group, and Ina.
The sale of shares in state-controlled banks in late 1993 and early this
year went well, but they were already quoted and the market was buoyant. The
sale of nearly 50 per cent of Ina, owned by the Treasury, was received less
enthusiastically, and post-sale trading was sluggish.
A solution would be to sell thinner slices of Stet and Enel, possibly only
10 per cent. But that would prolong uncertainty for their managements - a
particular concern at Stet and Telecom Italia, its operating arm, as they
need to give firm guarantees on future ownership to attract international
partners.
The second problem with partial privatisation is that it could put a brake
on the cultural change that the sell-off was supposed to stimulate. Already
the pioneers of shareholder democracy in Italy - small investor
associations, employee shareholder groups and their advisers, for example -
allege the government has not done its best to release former state
companies into the free market.
In the case of Ina, for example, they claim the insurance company's board is
still under the control of the Treasury, which appointed 10 of Ina's 13
directors, after privatisation. They also claim that Mediobanca, the Milan
merchant bank, has extended its influence over the former state-controlled
banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana, and Credito Italiano, to the detriment of
small investors.
The Treasury believes it can show its willingness to relinquish control by
removing its direct representatives from the boards of former state
companies, even partially privatised ones, as it has done at Ina.
But that is unlikely to satisfy the most zealous privatisers. For them, only
a convincing attempt to diffuse ownership of Italy's largest companies will
do. As one Italian investment banker puts it: 'Up to now, Italian industry
has been managed by the Agnellis, De Benedettis, and Ferruzzis, and at the
end of the day by Mediobanca - plus the state. If you don't have more
players, you don't have a shareholder democracy, and that should be the main
macroeconomic goal of the privatisation programme.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Diplomatic baggage: Bruce Clark argues that the UK could
learn from French diplomacy over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Events in Bosnia have brought home how much Britain has to learn from France
about foreign policy presentation.
The two countries have almost identical attitudes to the conflict, driven by
an almost identical mixture of considerations.
Both countries want to stop the war spreading; to wean the Serbs off
chauvinism and reintegrate them into the European mainstream; to avoid
looking bad in the eyes of an Islamic world concerned about the fate of the
Bosnian Moslems; and to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.
Unlike the US, both London and Paris are more concerned with containing the
war than with 'punishing the guilty' or imposing a fairer partition.
Both would agree that the status quo in Bosnia gives a disproportionate
advantage to the Serbs, but neither believes that imposing justice is worth
the tens of thousands of lives - and the breakdown of relations with Russia
 -that full-blown war against the Serbs could cost.
From an identical mixture of considerations, an almost identical mixture of
policies has flowed: the maintenance, as long as possible, of a small
peacekeeping force in Bosnia that eases suffering and frustrates - both
directly and indirectly - the outbreak of full-scale war; the exercise, by
economic and diplomatic but not military means, of pressure on the parties
to compromise.
Why, in that case, has Britain become the object of loathing among Bosnian
officials and pro-Bosnian US politicians, while France is growing in
diplomatic prowess?
Asking this question is not just an exercise in petty cross-Channel
bickering. At stake is Britain's long-term diplomatic credibility - its
much-vaunted ability to 'punch above its weight' in international affairs.
The mayor of Bihac, the Bosnian town beseiged by Serbs, refuses to speak to
British reporters. Senator Robert Dole, the new majority leader in the US
senate, blames 'the British and the French, particularly the British' for
the situation in the Bihac enclave.
General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is a
hate-figure for the Bosnian government, while his French boss General
Bertrand de Lapresle - whose thinking is virtually identical - is not.
How have the French done it?
The answer, put simply, is that they are far better than Anglo-Saxons at
holding two almost irreconcilable positions at once, and also at striking
rhetorical poses that bear little relation to reality.
Britain and France have made precisely the same analysis of the situation in
Bihac.
As both countries see it, it would be a bad turn of events if the Serbs were
to overrun the Bihac enclave. The fact that they may now do so is seen as an
undesirable consequence of an ill-judged Bosnian government offensive.
But the consequences of yielding to US demands for an all-out air attack on
Serb positions around Bihac are judged even more undesirable in both London
and Paris: it was felt there would be too high a chance of hitting the wrong
people.
So far, so much Anglo-French consensus. But when it comes to policy
presentation, the differences between Gallic flair and Anglo-Saxon phlegm
start to show.
France staked out the moral high ground by proclaiming: 'Bihac must not be
allowed to fall]' Britain was true to its plodding, empirical self by making
the - undeniably accurate, but gloomy - observation that Bihac might fall.
If Bihac does now fall, the world will say that it was not for lack of
French trying; if that outcome is somehow prevented, Paris will claim a
share of the glory.
As for the French penchant for holding two contrasting positions at once, it
is demonstrated by Paris's ability to sound both more pro-Serb and
pro-Moslem than London.
In September, while British officials were sternly stressing the absolute
unchangeability of the existing peace plan for Bosnia, France floated the
idea that the Bosnian Serb zone should have confederal relations with
Serbia. That idea - heresy at the time - has been resurrected this week.
France has balanced the effect of these pro-Serb statements by making
high-sounding commitments to the security of Bosnia's Moslem enclaves, which
are music to the ears of Senator Dole.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, makes weighty pronouncements such
as: 'Europe cannot enjoy stability and peace in a context of confrontation
with Islam . . . What is at stake in Sarajevo is the possibility of an open
and tolerant Islam.'
With the great sweep of French strategic thinking, he 'rejects the
inevitability' of division in Europe between the Catholic, Orthodox and
Moslem worlds. 'France's historical mission, from Richelieu to General de
Gaulle, is to reject barriers erected in the heart of the continent,' he has
proclaimed.
A British minister who said something like that would be lampooned in
satirical magazines. But to judge by the success that France's lofty
rhetoric seems to enjoy, London ought to be sending its brighter young
diplomats off to the grandes ecoles for a refresher course on Descartes and
Voltaire.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Leading Article: All change in Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although often disparaged at home for its unashamed elitism, Britain's civil
service used to be the envy of the democratic world. It now faces an
uncertain future, and could be seriously weakened if the government fails to
tackle problems created by a decade of rapid structural and cultural change
in Whitehall.
In a report published last week, the all-party Treasury and Civil Service
committee of the House of Commons questioned the adequacy of existing
mechanisms for upholding the ethical standards of the civil service. The
committee recommended a statutory code of ethics setting out the duties of
civil servants and the responsibilities of ministers.
It also called for a reformed Civil Service Commission with members drawn
largely from outside Whitehall; and for reforms in the relationship between
parliament and the semi-autonomous 'next steps' agencies which over the past
five years have taken over most of Whitehall's service-delivery
responsibilities.
These proposals are timely and should be implemented. The committee cited
Gladstone's dictum that the British constitution 'presumes more boldly than
any other the good faith of those who work it'. Recent events, notably the
admission by civil servants to the 'arms for Iraq' inquiry that they drafted
inaccurate replies for ministers, have brought that good faith into
question, and support the case for a code of ethics.
The case is made well-nigh imperative by the impact of 15 years of one-party
rule. When parties alternate regularly in power, permanent officials have a
strong incentive not to mistake party convenience for the national interest.
They are under far less pressure to separate the two when serving one set of
political masters for a protracted period.
Ministerial accountability
The doctrine of ministerial accountability also needs be modernised to
reflect new realities. It is a nonsense to pretend that ministers can be
properly accountable to parliament for the work of executive agencies for
which they have no operational responsibility. As the committee notes, the
government's attempt to draw a distinction between accountability, which
cannot be delegated by ministers, and responsibility, which can, is
'unconvincing'.
Chief executives of agencies should be directly and personally accountable
to select committees of the Commons for the implementation of their annual
performance agreements. It might be advisable to go further still and give
select committees a role in the appointment of agency chief executives and
other senior members of quangos. Such a step could underpin the political
impartiality of senior officials in agencies and quangos, and do something
to redress the unhealthy domination of government over parliament which is a
prime cause of much existing unease.
Contradictory signals
However, current Whitehall reforms beg two larger issues. Is the government
committed to the continuation of the career civil service? If not, how does
it intend to ensure that the senior civil service is schooled in the
standards and ethics which today's officials mostly accept from long
training?
Ministers are sending out contradictory signals in response to the first
question. On the one hand, they pay lip service to open competition for top
jobs, and are pressing forward with 'market testing' and cuts in the number
of senior officials; on the other hand, they appear reluctant to advertise
many top jobs outside Whitehall, let alone to adopt the New Zealand practice
of short-term contracts for senior officials inside mainstream departments.
Ministers must make their intentions clear. The official-for-life mentality
of most civil servants has hitherto provided a critical underpinning for the
ethics and political neutrality of Whitehall. It has also limited - although
not banished - the 'revolving door' problem of officials anxiously seeking
outside jobs.
If Whitehall is, by contrast, to provide short career stops for an elite of
high-flyers who commute between the public and private sectors, then far
more attention will have to paid to questions of recruitment, pay and
conflicts of interest. A statutory code of ethics would only be a first step
towards reform.

British Coal may be out of business by Christmas Eve but it still seems to
have a few scores to settle. Gerard McCloskey, the editor of several
Financial Times newsletters on coal, currently engaged in some acrimonious
exchanges with RJB Mining, also seems to have upset Neil Clarke, British
Coal's outgoing chairman. McCloskey has been dropped from the guest list for
British Coal's last Christmas lunch for journalists. Come on lads, isn't it
time to bury the hatchet?

Already near the top of the list of those whom everyone loves to hate,
Britain's fundholding family doctors and their managers can be forgiven for
feeling even more unloved after their annual get-together at
Stratford-upon-Avon last week.
No politician would come near them. David Blunkett, who had originally been
scheduled to deliver the keynote speech, was moved to education in October's
shadow cabinet reshuffle, and Margaret Beckett, who took up the health
baton, was otherwise engaged. No substitute could be found to detail the
party's implacable opposition to the concept of fundholding.
And what of the Conservatives? They too were unable to find a substitute for
the originally advertised Clive Froggatt, a Cheltenham GP and early
proponent of giving doctors their own budgets. He has other things on his
mind nowadays, such as talking to the local constabulary about alleged drugs
offences.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Unsound bite
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the tale that stops the dog wagging. As Observer reported last week,
Beijing's city fathers are trying to bring in draconian laws to curb
dog-ownership.
But the dogs only have themselves to blame; last year in Beijing alone
52,000 people were bitten. Now The Workers' Daily has reported that in the
past six years some 60,000 people have died of rabies throughout China.
This suggests a dog-bites-humans problem on a fairly big scale, but then
numbers in China are always mind-stretching. It seems there are more than
100m dogs in China, of which a mere 10m are pets, and the remainder are bred
to be eaten. No wonder they want to get their retaliation in first.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Wisdom check
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Which still begs the question as to how Kenneth Clarke actually puts to best
use the wise men he inherited from his predecessor Norman Lamont.
The six have already been downgraded since the chancellor now only wishes to
read two, rather than three, of their reports a year. At the same time, it
is their misfortune that their sagacity was sought during a period in which
the Treasury's own forecasting record has improved from dismal to not too
bad.
Judging by the forecasts issued at Budget time last year, the wise men have
not cornered the market in economic wisdom. Cambridge University's Wynne
Godley, for instance, was forecasting gross domestic product growth at 1.6
per cent for 1994, against a probable out-turn of 3.5-4 per cent. And Andrew
Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,
was predicting an inflation rate (minus mortgage interest payments) of 4.5
per cent for the fourth quarter of 1994, when the equivalent figure for the
12 months to October this year was actually a mere 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, Observer's own forecast is that the wise men will, wisely, be
increasingly called upon to deliver their wisdom in the form of policy
prescriptions rather than hard numbers. Much wiser.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Uneconomic in quotes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Without wishing to proffer needless encouragement to garrulous economists on
this of all days, now also happens to be open season for the FT's fame
ratings - an exercise in its third year which ranks UK economists according
to the frequency of their mentions in domestic newspapers over the past 12
months.
Surprise vaulter to pole position for 1994 is last year's number 12, Simon
Briscoe, an ex-Treasury number cruncher at SG Warburg, whose mastery of the
ready quote earns him 221 mentions. He has thrashed - by 70 plus points -
the next placed economist, Gavyn 'wise man' Davies of Goldman Sachs. Davies,
third in 1993 and top the year before, put in a sturdier performance than
other members of the chancellor's team of 'wise men', with Tim Congdon
slipping from first to ninth. Wynne Godley and David Currie - who both leave
Clarke's panel at the end of next year - come in at 17th and 35th, down from
fifth and 12th respectively.
If the chancellor cared to run the fame metre over prospective new wise men,
he would observe the needle flickering above Citibank's Neil Mackinnon, in
third place from eighth, and Salomon's Michael Saunders, who climbs up 11
places to sixth. But watch out for HSBC's Ian Shepherdson, who has leapt an
unheard-of 23 rungs of the ladder to fourth spot. By contrast, BZW's Derek
Scott, the new economic adviser to Labour leader Tony Blair, still seems to
be having some difficulty getting his message across. He remains stuck at
48th, albeit one place above Colin Mowl, the Treasury's chief forecaster.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Universal private pension plan has
powerful support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From FRANK FIELD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report ('Pensions body wants saving to be compulsory', November 18)
the support the National Association of Pension Funds has given to a reform
which Matthew Owen and I proposed 18 months ago (Private Pensions for All,
Fabian Society). The initial reaction to the idea of instigating universal
private pension provision was met by two substantial criticisms.
Those politicians who ideologically opposed the idea never answered the
question we posed. Large numbers of people are in private schemes. How then
can we equalise opportunities? The only sensible way forward is to have
universal private provision, and the only way to do this is through a
compulsory scheme. We are pleased that this approach has been backed by the
Social Justice Commission.
Some members of the National Association of Pension Funds made practical
criticisms. Our 10 per cent combined contribution was too low for adequate
pensions. We therefore proposed that employers and employees should
contribute 18 per cent of the salary bill. Now the NAPF has backed our
original figure. Why?
To what extent is the NAPF's decision a soft-sell approach to employers, or
a belief that a voluntary top-up would naturally occur? What range of
pensions would be produced from these savings running alongside the state
scheme?
Barry Riley highlights ('Waking up to the pension scheme threats', November
23) concern about the underfunding of pension schemes. We have tried to
cover this point too. Taking Joel Joffe's idea for a new savings scheme, we
suggested it should be made universal by establishing a National Pensions
Saving Scheme. This would be separate from the state, would form a new kind
of collective action, and would allow savers to own their own savings.
Our suggested reform could not lead to underfunding as in final salary
schemes. In addition, mobile employees would gain a level playing field,
knowing in advance the minimum pension contributions they would be expected
to make and would not, as many of them now do, enter detailed negotiations
to see whether the pension scheme of the company they hoped to join might
produce pension benefits equal to their current scheme.
Support for the idea of universal private pension provision to run alongside
the state scheme, and to make contributions to both schemes compulsory, has
won powerful allies over the past year. But the debate is not an academic
exercise. I hope that before the next year is out your columns will be
reporting that both Labour and the Liberal Democrats are backing this
proposal. Voters will then have a clear choice on reforming one of the big
areas of welfare reform at the next election.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bribery law change in EU would remove
blight on business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER EIGEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor writes of the European Commission's raft of court actions
to outlaw unfair practices in the awarding of public sector contracts within
the European Union ('Brussels gets tough on public contracts', November 23).
Admirable though these moves are they overlook one particular anomaly: it is
against the law if you bribe an official in your own country, but not if you
do it in your next-door-neighbour's. And you may or may not get a tax break
for the bribe you pay to an official in your own country, but you probably
will do so if you pay it to an official in another. Ethics apart, this must
surely be a wholly unacceptable states of aff-airs.
The EU would do well to implement the OECD recommendations of May 1994 and
criminalise foreign corrupt payments and tax deductibility for illicit
payments, at least as between the member countries of the Union.
Then, companies across Europe could compete with each other on equal terms,
and without those who bid on their home turf having to comply with norms
from which others are exempted.
Such a move would, at a stroke, harmonise the legal framework in these
respects across the EU. Just as important, it would create an opportunity
for developing countries to be judged by the same rules, if they so chose.
It would therefore represent a significant step towards tackling, in a
positive way, one of the greatest blights on business of contemporary times.

<TEXT>
Sir, According to Robert Peston ('Treasury drops dividends probe after
pressure', November 24), quoting a 'senior government official', the
Treasury's inquiry initiated by financial secretary Stephen Dorrell last
year into whether high dividend payments were responsible for inadequate
investment has been abandoned. The government official revealed that 'it
became too much of a hot potato after Lord Hanson attacked the review'.
Can we be told who is the real First Lord of the Treasury, John Major or
Lord Hanson?

FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: BT free to choose on fibre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN WHEELER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding BT's exclusion from entertainment services and the
superhighway, I have yet to read such an ill-informed debate as has raged
over this particular technology in your pages and elsewhere.
Fibre cables are cheap, passive and they deliver unlimited 'band width'  -
the measure of capacity for signals. The cost and speed of laying a fibre
network is dominated not by the electronics connected at either end, nor the
fibre itself, but by the construction of the underground ducting in which
they lie.
An entirely new network of ducts is being installed in the UK by the new
'local delivery' franchisees. These ducts bring a fibre to within 600m of
every residential home. Nowhere else in the world, to my knowledge, are
fibre networks being created at this proximity to the customer, even in the
birthplace of the 'superhighway', the US.
BT does not have to dig. It inherited its ducts free of charge. BT does not
need a law or permission to install fibre into its ducts. BT has the free
choice to bring fibre to within 600m of each home and whether to connect its
new fibres to you or me.
As an aside, BT is the local delivery franchisee for the City of
Westminster. It operates a fibre-based entertainment network. In this
franchise fibres were laid in existing BT ducts several years ago.
Strangely, in the City of Westminster residential customers have a single
source of telephone line connection, guess who? Well, it owns the ducts,
doesn't it?

FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK arms exports at odds with 'good
governance' objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY GERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate about entanglement between arms and aid has to date missed
an important point.
Some policy makers and opinion formers seem to be assuming that, as long as
there are no more explicit links between aid and arms exports, government
policy is quite coherent. But last year, along with other OECD donors,
Britain approved a set of policy orientations which, inter alia, urged
donors to examine contradictions between their aid and development
co-operation objectives and other external policies, 'including the
promotion of exports of arms'.
The UK has been in the forefront of promoting 'good governance', urging
developing countries to reduce military expenditure. What steps has the
government taken to scale down Britain's role as a leading arms exporter, in
a way that will minimise the negative impact on exports and jobs?
The foreign secretary's assurances that arms and aid have not been linked
during his term of office is welcome. The next step should be for the
government to make clear how, both domestically and multilaterally, it plans
to address the gulf between the 'good governance' aspect of foreign policy
and Britain's continued promotion of arms in developing countries.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Life raft for parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A referendum on Britain's continued membership of the European Union will be
promised by all three national political parties at the next general
election. Sure it will. Their respective leaders might deny any such
intention, for the 'in or out' question has not been tabled by any of them,
not in so many words. It need not be. Circumstances will decide that. The
Maastricht treaty allowed specific opt-outs for Britain (and indeed
Denmark), but there is no guarantee that such jiggery-pokery will be
possible when - if - there is a Maastricht II. If the rest of the EU moves
towards further integration and Britain stands back, that will be as good as
an 'out' vote. It would certainly be seen as such during the campaign.
Support for a plebiscite based on an overtly more innocuous question than
'stay or go' is accumulating. The latest platoon to arrive was heralded in
an interview with Sir James Goldsmith on BBC Breakfast with Frost on Sunday.
Sir James offered to fund a new British political party 'the purpose of
which is only one item, to have a referendum'. Our European Perotista need
have no fear. He will not be called upon to lavish millions on a lost cause,
as was Mr Ross Perot in the 1992 US presidential election. He should not go
to the trouble of writing a cheque to a 30-day-wonder party that does not
yet exist. He may not be a serious political figure, but he will have his
referendum, gratis.
We can count the reasons on three fingers. The Liberal Democrats have
promised to consult the people if the intergovernmental conference of 1996
agrees on significant changes to the constitution of the EU. The Labour
party has formally left the matter open, but its leader has placed himself
in a position to promise a popular vote in much the same circumstances. This
would not be expediency, you understand. It would be an expression of
democracy, a means of educating the British about where their government is
taking them. Meanwhile the Conservatives have moved from the prime
minister's original flat rejection of extra-parliamentary decision-making
towards Mr Douglas Hurd's expedient 'never say never' of recent days.
Goodness me. What tricks the mind does play. Two long years ago, during the
tense summer when the passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty
seemed to be in question, the proposition was put, here as elsewhere, that a
promise of a referendum on melding sterling into a single European currency
would not only be constitutionally correct, it might even reunite the
Conservatives. Did I see the foreign secretary slipping that card up his
sleeve, mumbling the while that he would note its usefulness? Surely not. It
must be my fevered imagination.
Let us move away from such phantasmagoria. It has been objected that a vote
on the single currency would destabilise the currency markets for the
duration of the campaign. The value of the pound would fluctuate. Titch.
Sterling moves every which way, every day. Contemporary markets are
destabilised by everything and anything. They were pretty jumpy over the
'join or not' question recently posed in Finland, Austria, Sweden and, on
Sunday and Monday, Norway. The planet survived.
Without such a popular vote the British polity might not survive - not if
our Parliament, from which we feel ever more remote, took us into a single
European currency before first asking our permission. As matters stand, the
EU is a club in which its members, all sovereign states, sit in constant
negotiating session. It has the characteristics of a Gaullist union of
nations rather than those of a sapling superstate. Create a single currency
and the balance tips sharply the other way. That would be a constitutional
leap in the dark for everyone. It is not only the British people who would
demand a referendum first.
The trouble with 'do you want to defend the pound?' is that most people's
emotional response would be that they do. Believe me, Britain will
eventually join a European currency, if there is one. Business will see to
that. But it might be necessary to hold two referendums about it, the first
to say no, the second, yes. Like the business community, the mainstream
political establishment knows it can more easily win the overarching 'stay
or go' type of question, as it has everywhere in western Europe nearly every
time it has been put. When the Danes made the mistake of voting no, they
were asked again. This type of question is the 'rubber life raft into which
we may all have to climb', as the then Mr James Callaghan remarked when what
became the British plebiscite of 1975 was first discussed.
Use of this life-saving dinghy is increasing everywhere, we are informed by
Referendums around the world, an invaluable reference work published by
Macmillan and edited by David Butler and Austin Ranney. Referendums
facilitated the overthrow of autocratic regimes in Chile and South Africa.
In New Zealand, Ireland and Italy, the voters chose electoral systems that
the political leaders of the time asked them to reject. In the US, statewide
voter initiatives are becoming as commonplace as national referendums have
long been in Switzerland. For the most part electorates are pretty
conservative. They tend to go with the established consensus, usually by a
decisive majority. That is why Britain voted two to one for membership of
the then Common Market in 1975.
Whatever type of question is chosen, a referendum on Europe in 1996 might
split the Conservative party. Well, yes, in a way, sort of. You cannot
properly divide what is already in smithereens. True, a promise of a popular
consultation might not heal the wounds evident in yesterday's debate on
Britain's contribution to the EU budget. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
mercilessly thumped the sceptics behind him, leaving none unbruised. But we
are talking of a mere handful of Tory bitter-enders here. Surely most of the
party would come together on a promise to consult the people. As in 1975,
cabinet solidarity might have to be suspended so that ministers could
campaign on opposite sides. So what? They do that, covertly, now.
In sum, a properly managed referendum is a useful, if risky, last-ditch
device for getting parties out of trouble and persuading us to vote the way
the elite of the day thinks best. My case rests.

FT  29 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Mind your language - Jacques Toubon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My great desire is not to prevent the French from speaking whatever
language they like,' says the man whose name, Jacques Toubon, will for ever
be attached to the law of August 4 1994, regulating the use of the French
language.
'What I want is to make it just as modern, just as - dare I say it? -
'fashionable' to speak French as to speak English.'
Had the minister of culture and 'francophonie', now known to many of his
compatriots as 'Jack Allgood', just broken his own law by using an English
word while speaking in his official capacity and on public premises? That
would be for the courts to decide, if anyone prosecutes.
The official glossary of French words which Mr Toubon wanted to append to
his law was struck out by the Constitutional Council as an infringement of
the 'free communication of thought and of opinion' proclaimed by the
Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. This means that 'you can still
oblige people to speak French, but they can speak whatever French they like
 -which obviously leaves it to the courts to decide, in the last resort,
what is French.'
Mr Toubon is a close ally of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist mayor of Paris,
former prime minister and now for the third time presidential candidate. But
he insists his language policy is part of a general strategy adopted by the
Balladur government, aimed both at developing French culture abroad and at
strengthening the links within the French-speaking world, of which the most
important is of course the language itself.
Indeed, he claims the loudest demand for action to defend French in France
came from other French-speaking countries, which are anxious to join with
France 'in proposing an alternative to the Anglo-Saxon model of the
universe'. And he clearly relishes the task of defending this alternative in
an interview with the Financial Times, a newspaper seen by many French
people as heading the Anglo-Saxon invasion of the continent.
'I'm a strong believer in learning foreign languages,' Mr Toubon declares.
'What I don't want is a language which would be neither a foreign language
nor my own. I want French, English, Russian - but as languages, in the
plural. I want the English of Shakespeare, not of Microsoft.'
His nightmare is that in 50 years France would have a 'tribal' linguistic
structure, with executives speaking English, immigrants speaking their own
languages, ordinary people speaking 'the language of television - 400 words,
with every kind of sloppiness', and 'in the middle the language of the
administration . . . and perhaps the language of intellectuals and
professors'.
This, he says, would be 'a catastrophe: it would mean that our society,
already torn apart by so many other things, would not only tear itself apart
but the fragments would be incapable of understanding each other'.
Mr Toubon brushes aside the argument that language cannot be decided by law.
In France, he says, 'the state has always had its word to say', ever since
the 17th century when Richelieu instituted the French Academy.
It was in this spirit that he fought his successful battle last year to keep
cultural products, especially film and television, outside the purview of
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, preserving France's right to
subsidise its film industry and to reserve a part of its air time for
European products. In the same spirit he is now engaged in another battle,
aimed at ensuring the European Union as a whole takes advantage of this
'cultural exception' and acts to preserve the diversity of European culture.
Largely thanks to French pressure Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner
for culture, is now bringing forward plans to tighten European broadcasting
quotas and to ban advertising on new electronic information services.
Mr Toubon accepts that some countries, such as Britain, will choose not to
implement the 1989 'television without frontiers' directive, which says that
a majority of TV programmes shown in Europe should be European-made. But, he
insists, countries such as France which do apply the directive must be able
to apply it to all TV signals they receive, as well as those which they
produce.
Otherwise, he says, someone like Mr Ted Turner, the US media magnate, can
broadcast from UK territory by satellite 'into Europe, including those
countries which apply the TWF directive, whatever programmes he likes,
including 100 per cent American cartoons'. France has banned Mr Turner's
products from its cable network, but the legal status of this decision is
unclear.
Mr Toubon wants the EU to ban such unauthorised cross-frontier broadcasts,
and also to extend the directive to cover 'new information techniques,
namely those which are generally called multimedia'. He also wants to expand
the EU media programme to give increased EU and national aid to the
production, and especially the distribution, of European films 'and, by
extension, to the films of countries linked to Europe, for instance the
southern film industries in Africa, Mexico, Brazil, etc'.
His object, he explains, is 'to maintain the diversity of film production in
the world'. He rejects the suggestion that 'all you need to do is make films
that people actually want to see', arguing it is up to states, and by
extension the EU, to ensure that people can still enjoy a real choice of
films and television programmes rather than being limited to ones which
reflect 'the same model, the same state of mind, the same aesthetic'.
In this spirit he wants to negotiate a convention with other governments to
make the mutual recognition of high school diplomas conditional on their
inclusion of a compulsory second foreign language, alongside the inevitable
English. Obviously he hopes that in many non-French-speaking countries
French would be the most popular choice, but he suggests that Spanish and
German also have much to gain.
Mr Toubon hopes to enlist the support of the German presidency for these
ideas during the Franco-German summit in Bonn today and tomorrow, which he
will attend. After that he plans to use the French presidency to push them
forward early next year, leaving his fellow-Latins from Spain and Italy to
finish the job. He knows he has a fight on his hands with the UK government,
but claims to have heard that even British delegates in Brussels are now
adopting 'more conciliatory' positions.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: The Spanish Lady - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERIC DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Elgar died in 1934, one of the three major unfinished projects he left
was an opera, The Spanish Lady. Is it salvageable? Arguably not. The
surviving material is extensive but fragmentary, and almost beyond repair.
But both Cambridge University Opera Club, and Dr Percy Young, to whose
devoted scholarship we know as much as we do, are to be congratulated on
having a crack at it. The Spanish Lady was staged last week as part of the
enterprising Cambridge Elgar Festival.
The story is broadly based on Ben Jonson's play The Devil is an Ass, on to
which Elgar grafted texts from other sources, including Jonson's The
Epicoene (on which Strauss was already working independently for Die
Schweigsame Frau). Elgar's text is not merely eclectic, but butterfly-like:
part-masque, part Restoration comedy, mainly morality a la Volpone (with a
satirical bite rather lost here in performance).
This first full staging, in Young's conjectural completion, made for a mixed
evening. What was badly needed was the kind of coherent, taut direction
Joseph Ward brought to the Royal Northern College's Pilgrim's Progress.
There, not a flinch or quiver was wasted. Here, Adrian Osmond (Trinity),
unhelped by the cramping of on-stage orchestra and the set that gave none of
the intended sense of place, failed to surmount the inherent problems.
Most first-half stage entries and exits were loose, at worst abysmal.
Over-fussy or random crowd activity muddied too many focal moments.
Principals projected insufficiently, so that the intricate plot became
further confounded. Character definition was weak, with the exception of
Leigh Melrose's Meercraft and Keith Perry's foppish Manly, both admirably
sung. The devilry of Pug (Susie Trayling) soon lost its initial promise.
Even a memorably funny drag entry by Christopher Genz (Wittipol) as the
Spanish instructress was blurred by poor blocking. Blake Applegate supplied
the tidiest cameo as Engine, doubling as the duenna.
And Elgar's music? Young's orchestral completion turned out attractive, but
markedly 'safe'. Too often, the music seemed to bare scant relation to what
was happening on stage. More risks needed to be taken. But where a salient
feature appeared, such as the brief prominence awarded to paired clarinets
and bassoon near the end, a momentary magic was unfurled.
Conductor William Lacey (Kings) gave consistently clear leads, surviving one
nervous Act II moment in the upper strings but engendering some needlessly
awkward pauses that detracted from overall pace. His besetting fault was a
monotonous dynamic, frozen between forte and mezzo-forte. (The leisurely
Handelian pacings best in the stately Sarabande) often verged on the bland:
the poise of a Lully or Rameau would have been a welcome relief.
The choreographer, Darren Royston, seemed alone in sensing this: his dances
(with chief accolade, undeniably, to the boys) were charming, lucid and
inventive.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Raising Fires - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It ill behoves me to speak ill of a play that concerns farming folk near
Manningtree, since the folk I myself come from are all farmers near
Manningtree and since they present a valuable contrast to the popular
conception of 'Essex person'. Indeed, Raising Fires, a new play by Jenny
McLeod, is also about rural arson, and in my time I have stood by flaming
strawstacks ignited by arsonists.
But Raising Fires is not the play to raise Manningtree-consciousness. It is
merely a muddled melodrama, and dismally close to mimicking the bygone
witch-hunting depicted in Arthur Miller's The Crucible. Set in Elizabethan
times (Manningtree is mentioned in Shakespeare), it shows how young Marshall
Loder has married one woman, Ruth, to advance his own political career,
though having made another girl, Tilda Hubbie, pregnant; and it then shows
how the women of the community make Tilda out to be the witching culprit of
the mysterious local fires. The twist is that Tilda is black.
Tilda is conceived entirely as a pc victim - female, black, innocent,
loveable, maligned. ('The first thing I remember is other people.') Men have
used her for their various purposes all along (Minister Hubbie in adopting
her, his son Daniel and Marshall Loder in making love to her); and now women
pick on her too. 'Women look, men touch,' she says. But it is peculiar how
long we wait until Tilda's colour is properly mentioned (nor is it ever
seriously discussed); and yet that, in a trice, becomes the reason why she
is picked on as a witch.
The thumbscrews are tightened when Ruth Loder, aware that her husband has
impregnated Tilda, bitterly testifies that Tilda is both witch and arsonist.
Marshall Loder, a standard male hypocrite who wants political advancement
through his wife's father and sex with Tilda, vacillates. What will he do?
Actually, it doesn't matter, for he proves as helpless in the face of mob
hysteria as Tilda. Tilda is packed off to her death. Someone ends by saying
'God - we will answer for this'. A more serious play might have shown them
answering for it, or might have made Marshall Loder's dilemma more
interesting (by making him a more interesting character), or might not kept
its focus more thoroughly on Minister Hubbie (who promises damnation or
paradise for the pettiest sins or virtues, but who has kept Tilda
irresponsibly passive).
But everything here is clumsy. The language commutes wretchedly between
mock-period ('At such a sight the sickness inside me was so great', 'Four
babies I had in my arms') and naturalistic modernity ('This is not what I
need', 'I say 'Bugger the father''). The conflict between Minister Hubbie
and Judge Fury suggests a church v. law conflict that is inadequately
investigated. The roles that Daniel Hubbie and Grace Turvey play in the
off-stage action are insufficiently clear. And the names] Hubbie this, Wife
that; Grace here, Fury there. I cannot imagine why this play won a 1993
London Weekend Television Plays on Stage Award.
Dominic Dromgoole, directing, keeps it lively, but he cannot provide depth.
The same goes for his cast, which includes Robin Soans as Minister Hubbie,
Julie Saunders as Tilda and Gary Love as Marshall Loder. And there is too
much unnecessary shouting. In pub theatres, making the actors turn up their
volume controls is the easiest way to achieve intensity, but also the
cheapest.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Drawn to the kitchen sink - William Packer reviews the
work of five artists in vogue during the 1950s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Give a dog a bad name - but with art it would seem that any name will stick.
It was remarked in the mid-1950s that certain younger realist painters and
writers were fixing upon the more unkempt and informal features of domestic
life: the lovely Mary Ure at the ironing-board, the unmade bed, the lavatory
bowl, the breakfast-table, the kitchen sink itself. And 'Kitchen Sink' was
taken up at once, and still stands, as the epithet by which to characterise
much of the work, indeed the very mood, of the entire period.
That it was only ever a partial truth would hardly disqualify so patently
catchy and convenient a term. But it had its effects, even so, and not all
of them benign. It might be all very well in relation to Look Back in Anger,
or to John Bratby's paintings of table-tops, or Jack Smith's babies, prams
and sink. But was it always quite so apropos? What about Lucky Jim or Godot?
More to the point, what about the still-lifes and butchers' shops of Peter
Coker, the fields and streams of Edward Middleditch, the Italian farmyards
and rooftops of Derrick Greaves?
Give a dog a bad name: so when the mood of the moment lightened with the
turn of the decade, and the arch and ironical references of Pop-Art replaced
a supposed realist gloom, small wonder that all these painters seemed
suddenly so irrelevant and passe, ripe for the rubbish bin. Greaves, Smith,
Middleditch and Bratby had together represented Britain at the Venice
Biennale of 1956. By the mid-1960s, only Smith, who had since 'gone
abstract', still enjoyed any critical credibility at all.
The critical rehabilitation, which at times amounts to rediscovery, of the
painting of the 1950s has been one of the most positive and encouraging
critical developments of recent years. For it reminds us that no critical
orthodoxy is either permanent or necessarily narrow, and suggests besides
that good work eventually will receive its due. The process continues
happily with this handsome show at the Mayor Gallery, in which a
considerable emphasis is placed upon the role of drawing in relation to
painting.
What emerges is that drawing as a discipline is no mere thing of indulgent
self-expression, though inevitably the self is expressed. Nor is it simply a
matter of technical mastery or demonstration, though of course skill is not
to be sniffed at. Rather it is a discipline quite as much of the eye and the
mind as of the hand, of observation, understanding and enquiry. The
particular subject is studied, the useful record of information made, the
larger composition proposed and modified through variation. It is a
practical and unselfconscious business, out of which things of great power
and beauty emerge.
That we see all these artists as they were as young artists, is, however, a
shade dispiriting. For, leaving their painting aside for the moment, here is
drawing of a technical quality and seriousness of purpose which in those
days could be assumed even from the young, but which today is entirely
foreign to the experience of almost any artist under 50. We simply never see
it because it is not done, nor even thought to be relevant.
The five heroes, Bratby, Smith, Middleditch, Greaves and Coker, are
represented by substantial paintings of that period, including Smith's
eponymous 'Baby in Sink' of 1953, and they are joined in their draughtsman
aspect by Henry Inlander and Bruce Tippett. And of them all, what with
Bratby, Middleditch and Inlander already dead, Coker sadly now an invalid,
and Smith and Tippett both now abstract painters, only Greaves is still at
work in the old way. He was always the aesthete, even then as concerned with
the elegant run and sweep of the line as with his nominal subject of a
pregnant woman or a sleeping baby.
John Bratby's remains a powerful presence, with some fine still-lifes and
kitchen interiors and strong drawings. They offer a salutary reminder that a
remarkable young artist has been too-long obscured by the reputation of the
uncritical, self-regarding buffoon and caricature of himself he became in
his later years. Certainly he is remembered by those who taught him at the
Royal College in the early 1950s as still one of the most gifted draughtsmen
ever to pass through the painting school.
But the star of the show is Peter Coker, with but one large painting of an
apple tree, of 1956, and a sequence of ravishing drawings, of trees and
landscape, of dead fish and hare and chickens, of butchers heaving carcases
about, and of his baby son asleep - for they all drew and painted their
children. And the young Coker's drawings, above the rest, make the very
point that drawing too, and with a wonderful economy, can aspire to the
condition of true art. He is one of the great unacknowledged painters of our
time, and it is time we put that right.

Just as nobody is so prudish as a reformed tart, so no one is more devoted
to integrity than an ex-MP. In Without Walls: Bad Ideas of the Twentieth
Century (9pm, Channel 4) Matthew Parris excoriates the public relations
industry with a sense of outrage that occasionally topples into moral
confusion. Does the fact that the eye-witness of alleged atrocities in
Kuwait is a royal and the daughter of the ambassador to the US automatically
discredit her testimony? And why discount U2's charity work simply because
Parris accusingly brands them 'the world's richest band'?
Much of the film shows Parris being groomed (haircut, new underpants,
pedicure) by a PR lady called Shaa Wasmund (if it's an anagram I haven't
worked it out yet). 'I have felt conscious of the presence of a camera all
morning,' he observes with the percipience that marked him out for politics
and journalism. And there's the rub: he hates PR because it can corrupt his
own profession. He may have a point, but this exercise in over-decent
exposure doth protest too much.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Van Dam, Levine and the Philharmonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opportunities of hearing the great baritone Jose van Dam in London are so
rare that even the turgid account of Brahms's Ein Deutsches Requiem at the
Royal Festival Hall on Saturday was worth catching for his performance. Van
Dam - undervalued, it seems, by Covent Garden - ought to be a regular
visitor here, but at least he made a brief appearance with James Levine and
the Philharmonia Orchestra, bringing a few minutes of musical sanity to an
otherwise largely self-indulgent reading.
Van Dam is one of the most musicianly of singers around today, and he gave
Brahms's vocal lines sculpted nobility. His contribution, and that of
Barbara Bonney, the radiant soprano soloist, contrasted starkly with
Levine's bloated conception of the piece. Levine, chief of New York's
Metropolitan Opera, is the conductor who broke almost all records by adding
an hour onto the length of the Ring at Bayreuth this year, and here his
Brahms was similarly distorted.
The majestic funeral march of the second movement lacked muscular tautness,
and seemed more like a musical picture of the throbbing engines on a slowly
cruising ocean liner. The strong singing of the Philharmonia Chorus was
undermined at every turn by Levine's square conducting, the fugal passages
in particular emerging as ponderous exercises in counterpoint. Fortissimos
were all equally, unrelentingly heavy.
The concert was certainly a starry one: the soloist in Beethoven's Emperor
Concerto before interval had been the young Yevgeny Kissin, perhaps the
outstanding pianist of his generation and one already tipped to inherit the
mantle of the Russian keyboard giants before him.
His playing had all the stature - power and poetry in equal measure - that
suggests, but Levine drained the music of dramatic vigour. This was a
well-upholstered performance in the grand manner one had thought extinct,
and would have appealed only to those who hanker after Karajan at his most
portentous.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Arkhipova and her protege - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday was Russian Opera Night in London: while the new production of
Khovanshchina unfolded at the Coliseum, the great
Russian mezzo Irina Arkhipova was holding her Wigmore Hall audience
spellbound in a programme devoted mainly to Rimsky-Korsakov songs.
Arkhipova, doyenne of Russian singers, is nearing the end of a performing
career that has taken her throughout the world and made her a heroine in her
homeland, and Thursday's recital, latest offering in the Kirov-Maryinsky
Series, may well turn out to have been her final appearance on the London
platform. She was in remarkably good vocal shape: though she of course no
longer commands the powers of her prime, every phrase was sung with warmth
and dramatic intensity.
Arkhipova's programme was also an imaginative contribution to the 150th
anniversary this year of Rimsky-Korsakov's birth. The composer's 80-or-so
songs are scandalously undervalued, far more neglected even than those of
Tchaikovsky or Rakhmaninov, and they form an equally rich body of
literature. Spanning most of Rimsky's career, the songs reflect his
stylistic attachments and - like artists' sketches to finished paintings -
contain the essence of ideas developed in the operas. Above all, with texts
drawn from writers including Pushkin, Lermontov and Alexis Tolstoy, many of
Rimsky's songs are musico-poetic gems.
We heard 17 of them, and Arkhipova's performances made clear their range of
expression. With rich tone flowing effortlessly, the mezzo sounded in 'Not a
sound from the sea' like
the proverbial voice of Mother Russia.
Arkhipova traversed a range of feeling, from the melancholia of the 'Hebrew
Song' and sultriness of 'Southern Night' to the gentle simplicity of
'Quietly evening falls' and bursting happiness of 'The lark sings louder'.
One savoured each equally, yet the exquisite 'The clouds begin to scatter'
was a highlight of the evening. Ivari Ilya provided masterfully
characterised accompaniments.
The programme's scope was widened to include music by two of Rimsky's
colleagues, Mussorgsky and Borodin, and to allow Arkhipova to introduce one
of her proteges, the Bashkirian bass Askar Abdrasakov. Together they sang
the duet for Marfa (one of the mezzo's most celebrated roles) and Dosifey
from Khovanshchina,
before the spotlight was turned on Abdrasakov in his imposing performances
of the Trepak
from Songs and Dances of Death, Konchak's aria (Prince Igor)
and the Viking Guest's song (Sadko).
All revealed an instrument - dark, full-toned and focused - of astonishing
maturity for a singer so young. Abdrasakov is undoubtedly a name to watch,
and his presence here was an indication of Arkhipova's generosity and
dedication to the future of her art.
The Maryinsky-Kirov Series is supported by the Regent Hotel (London) and
British Airways (St Petersburg).

FT  29 NOV 94 / People: The art of persuasion at TransTec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Carr, the former Tomkins executive who was appointed chief executive
of TransTec just three weeks ago, has persuaded two of the unsuccessful
applicants for his job to join the specialist engineering group.
Peter Summerfield, 47, (far right) who is to be managing director of the
newly formed manufacturing division, joins from British Aerospace, where for
the past five years he has been managing director, operations, for the
regional jet business at Avro. The other new director is Tony Kirkman (near
right), a 49-year-old engineer who has held a number of senior positions at
GEC's Avery subsidiary. He will head up the new controls division.
Carr, 41, said the pair took some persuading. 'They are both highly
qualified managers with their own egos. But I managed to sell them my vision
of the group. It's great that we have got them so quickly - it could well
have taken six months or more - and it puts us in a very strong position.'
Carr was brought in earlier this month when TransTec's founder, Labour MP
Geoffrey Robinson, agreed to split his role as chairman and chief executive
following pressure from institutional investors. Previously in charge of US
acquisitions for Tomkins, Carr picked up a Pounds 10m bonus before he left.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Companies liable for employees'
price-fixing deals - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The English House of Lords has overturned the Appeal Court's 1992 ruling in
the Smiths' Concrete case, in which it said companies were not liable for
their employees' breaches of competition law.
In 1991 Smiths and three other ready-mixed concrete companies operating in
Oxfordshire were fined by the Restrictive Trade Practices Court for allowing
their representatives to enter into price- fixing and market-sharing
arrangements. On the basis that the companies had expressly instructed
employees not to participate in anti-competitive arrangements, and were
therefore 'not party to the agreements', the Appeal Court allowed their
appeals. The House of Lords has now overturned those decisions.
The Law Lords said that to rule otherwise would allow companies to benefit
from restrictive trade practices outlawed by Parliament if the arrangements
were made by employees and had been forbidden by 'higher management'. An
employee acting for the company within the scope of his or her employment
was the company, they said. The Lords also described the fines of up to
Pounds 25,000 as 'derisory'.
Competition lawyers say the decision points up the need for companies to
adopt effective competition compliance programmes or risk heavier penalties
in future.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: French request on air routes rejected
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of the European Court of Justice has rejected France's
application for suspension of the European Commission's April 1994 decision
on access to the Paris (Orly)-Marseille and Paris (Orly)-Toulouse air
routes.
He said the alleged damage to Air Inter, the French regional airline, and
French air transport had not been established.
The Commission's decision said France could not rely on the exclusivity
provisions of the 1992 council regulation (2408/92) on access to Community
air routes to refuse Community airlines access to the contested routes, in
favour of Air Inter.
In June 1993, TAT European Airlines had applied to the French authorities
for a licence to operate on the contested routes. The application was
rejected on the basis of the 1992 regulation which permitted exclusive
concessions on internal routes for a transitional period, when service could
not be assured by other forms of transport. The French authorities claimed
Air Inter, part of the Air France group, enjoyed exclusivity under a 1985
agreement.
In September 1993, TAT complained to the Commission, relying on a number of
grounds including breach of the 1992 regulation. It argued France had agreed
in October 1990 to terminate the Air France monopoly over the contested Orly
routes by March 1 1992. Since TAT served the same routes from Paris Charles
de Gaulle, Air Inter did not have exclusivity as envisaged by the
regulation. TAT claimed the consequent discrimination between TAT and Air
Inter in the allocation of routes infringed the 1992 regulation.
TAT asked the Commission to adopt a decision under the 1992 regulation,
saying France could not continue to apply the measure in issue. The
contested decision was adopted on April 27, giving France until October 27
to comply.
In dismissing the French application for suspension of the Commission
decision, the ECJ president said the rules of procedure required two
conditions to be satisfied: urgency and prima facie grounds for interim
measures.
To be urgent, it must be necessary for the Court to adopt interim measures
to prevent serious and irreparable harm resulting from the immediate
application of the challenged decision.
The president rejected France's arguments that serious and irreparable harm
would result. France claimed that Air Inter would lose 35 per cent market
share within one year. This would prevent its operation of allegedly
unprofitable services on the contested routes. Consequently, it would have
to grant state aids to Air Inter to maintain that service, but would not be
able to adopt the necessary measures before the end of 1995.
France also maintained the immediate application of the decision would cause
serious harm to the organisation of French air transport and the policy of
territorial management. And since the exclusivity provisions of the
regulation would expire on January 1 1996, the main appeal would be without
purpose and the alleged damage irreparable.
The Commission's response was that the evidence on the market evolution and
profitability of Air Inter, which was unchallenged, revealed that it was
unprofitable on international routes and not Orly routes. Even if specific
regional routes were to be given up by Air Inter, which was unlikely, it
said there were other airlines with lower costs which could enter the market
and maintain French air transport policy.
The president concluded the predicted losses were uncertain. Even if French
estimates were correct, the risk that Air Inter would abandon certain
loss-making regional routes was a hypothesis subject to innumerable
unpredictabilities. And if that did happen, there was no reason to believe
the French authorities would be unable to ensure continuity of those routes
by inviting other airlines to service them or by imposing public interest
obligations in accordance with the 1992 regulation.
Since the harm alleged was not established, it was not necessary to decide
if prima facie grounds for interim measures existed.

FT  29 NOV 94 / People: Winning post in Darby's sights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gavin Darby is expanding his territory within the Coca-Cola empire.
President of Coke's northwest European division, he is picking up Great
Britain and Ireland (north and south) at the turn of the year. They join
France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Denmark in his portfolio.
He takes over from Penny Hughes, Coke's president of Great Britain and
Ireland, who has decided not to return from maternity leave after her baby
arrives in April. One of the highest flying female executives in the UK,
Hughes, 35, wants to concentrate for a while on family rather than business
commitments.
Darby, 38, is moving from Brussels to London to manage his expanded brief.
This will be the fourth configuration of countries Coke had managed from
London within 10 years, he said.
'We often group divisions around the experience of the leader and I've spent
half of my 10 years with Coca-Cola in the UK,' he says. With strong teams of
country managers, it is easy to make such shuffles, he added. Born in London
and educated at Manchester University, he worked in the UK for Spillers
Foods and SC Johnson before joining Coke in 1984.
Coke remains the largest single UK grocery brand with grocery sales of about
Pounds 260m, according to Nielsen, the market researchers.
Darby says the biggest task for him - and indeed Coke anywhere - is to get
more people to drink its soft drinks rather than other beverages of any
kind. 'Competing for the consumption occasion' is the phrase that gets Coke
pulses racing. In per capita consumption terms, the UK and other European
countries are still virgin territory for soft drinks compared with the US.
Another adrenalin-inducing phrase might be Virgin Cola, launched recently by
Richard Branson and Cott Corporation. But Darby says competition helps
stimulate the whole market and anyway Coke always gets the lion share of any
growth.
With Branson likely to have a glass of his own in his hand in every picture,
the competition could be brisk. But Darby's not bothered. 'We always feature
Coca-Cola as the hero, the star.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / People: Davidson Kelly quits Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the oil explorer which earlier this year repelled a hostile bid from
rival Enterprise Oil, yesterday announced the surprise departure of its
charismatic corporate development director, Norman Davidson Kelly.
Davidson Kelly, described by colleagues as possessing a 'certain bounce and
flair', is expected to receive a pay-off of less than Pounds 500,000.
Davidson Kelly was widely acknowledged to have been the architect of most of
Lasmo's largest deals in the past few years. He arrived through Lasmo's 1979
takeover of Oil Exploration Holdings and joined the board in 1986.
Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, says Davidson Kelly's departure came as
a result of an organisational review following the Enterprise bid. 'The bid
helped us to focus on what we needed to do in the future,' says Darby. This
included 'clarifying reporting lines and responsibilities'.
Davidson Kelly's responsibilities included finance, investor relations, and
developing new business opportunities. These functions would now be divided
between Paul Murray, appointed general manager,corporate finance, who will
report to the recently appointed finance director, Dick Smernoff, and a new
business team comprising Peter Nolan, general manager, and Tom King,
director.
Davidson Kelly kept a low profile during the bid, with many observers
feeling he could have been a potential weakness in the target company's
defence. He had been closely associated with arranging several of Lasmo's
controversial acquisitions, including Ultramar.
However, a close associate says that, while Lasmo was acknowledged to have
paid far too much for Ultramar, its best assets are those which were
acquired in the deal.
Davidson Kelly, whose annual salary was in the region of Pounds 180,000, was
on a three-year rolling contract.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: At risk from harassment - UK companies
cannot afford to ignore sexual misconduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate America blanched in early September when a jury in California
awarded Ms Rena Weeks, a former secretary at international law firm Baker &amp;
McKenzie, Dollars 7.2m for sexual harassment by partner Mr Martin
Greenstein.
Ms Weeks, who had worked for Mr Greenstein for just 25 days, took on the
might of the world's largest law firm and won the biggest ever sexual
harassment award in a case not involving sexual assault or rape. What, then,
might someone in her position inflict on a corporation less well placed than
Baker &amp; McKenzie to defend itself?
In the search to find a rational explanation for the size of the award in
the days that followed, law firms and company executives were tempted to
regard it as an aberration of America's bizarre system of punitive damages.
After all, the San Francisco jury had awarded Ms Weeks only Dollars 50,000
for emotional distress caused by Mr Greenstein touching her breast while
putting sweets into her blouse pocket. The rest of the award was punitive
damages.
But those who kidded themselves that the Weeks case was a one-off were soon
disabused of the notion. The jurors, who had heard testimony of alleged
sexual harassment from other Baker &amp; McKenzie employees, told America's
Court TV they felt that a message needed to be sent not just to the law firm
but to all companies of the dangers of ignoring and covering up unacceptable
conduct.
The result of the Weeks case, according to US employment lawyer Mr Ronald
Green, a partner of New York's Epstein Becker &amp; Green, is likely to be a big
jump in the number of sexual harassment claims in the US.
Last week, Mr Green, who is widely regarded as America's leading employer
defence attorney in sexual harassment and discrimination cases, was in
London to talk to UK companies about the rise in this type of lawsuit in the
US and the risk this poses to UK businesses.
He said the most obvious risk was to companies with operations in the US.
His message to them was that their US investment would be imperilled by
indifference to this problem and they should take action now, rather than
waiting until they faced a lawsuit.
His advice was the same as that to his US corporate clients: carry out an
immediate risk assessment, look at the company's prior history of
complaints, check grievance procedures, and train your staff.
'The aim is to have employees know enough to expand their rights,' he said.
But not too much - 'you don't want to create a flow of grievances and
complaints'.
The second group most at risk comprises UK subsidiaries of US companies.
These companies need to be aware of the problem, because the US exercises
jurisdiction in this area over a US-owned or controlled employer anywhere in
the world.
US-owned companies in the UK could find themselves facing lawsuits in the US
from UK-based employees. There was a timely reminder of this in April, when
three male foreign exchange dealers at the London branch of Goldman Sachs,
the US investment bank, were forced to resign following complaints of sexual
harassment from a female colleague.
Mr Green also believes the UK could soon face a wave of its own sexual
harassment cases.
Although awards in the UK are unlikely to reach US levels - because juries
do not decide damages except in libel cases, and punitive damages are not
generally available - there are signs of an upsurge in sex-based employment
actions.
The UK Equal Opportunities Commission says the number of complaints of
sexual harassment at work that it received last year rose by 58 per cent
from 502 in 1992 to 793. In the first nine months of 1994 it had already
received 552.
Public awareness of the problem in the UK has increased through cases such
as that brought by Samantha Phillips, an aviation insurance broker with
Willis Corroon. In August she was awarded Pounds 18,000 damages by an
industrial tribunal after claiming she was sacked because she spurned the
advances of a senior manager.
The biggest threat to UK companies from sexual harassment claims will come
if the UK allows actions to be brought on behalf of a whole class, or group,
of employees. In the US, Mr Green said, class actions in employment cases
were well established. In April 1992, for instance, the Illinois-based State
Farm Insurance Company settled a sex discrimination class action for Dollars
157m.
In May 1993, in the first class action for sexual harassment, a Minnesota
District Court found the Eveleth Taconite mining company guilty of sexual
harassment for creating a hostile work environment for women. Damages are
yet to be assessed.
Class actions in this area are potentially devastating. In the US, a woman
or a man who has been sexually harassed has the right to go to the US Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, which will investigate and prosecute the
complaint free of charge. If the complainant is unhappy with the result, he
or she is entitled to bring an action for damages before a civil jury.
Under a new Federal statute, the damages for emotional distress and punitive
damages recoverable by a plaintiff proving sexual harassment before a
Federal jury are capped at Dollars 300,000, although the cap does not extend
to damages for lost prior or future earnings.
In a single action, this law would be of benefit to employers, but in a
class action the picture is different. One employee can claim not just on
his or her own behalf but theoretically on behalf of all members of the
class - which could mean every woman who works for, or has worked for, an
employer.
With each member of a successful Federal class action entitled to recover up
to Dollars 300,000, the potential threat of such a case to a company's
finances is enormous.
Under state law, however, things are even worse. No state has a cap on
damages for emotional distress and only a handful, such as New York State,
has a cap on punitive damages. Ms Weeks was able to recover Dollars 7.2m
because she brought her case under California state law. 'One large class
action under state law could wipe out a corporation,' Mr Green said.
Where companies have offices in several states, there is also a potential
for forum shopping. Complainants could choose to bring a sexual harassment
class action in a state such as Florida, Michigan or California, which
traditionally produce the highest jury awards.
Mr Green earned his reputation as an employers' defence attorney through
tough cross-examination of claimants on their past sexual behaviour and
personal history. However, that hard-nosed approach is under threat from new
federal laws, extending the shield given to rape victims to plaintiffs in
sexual harassment cases. The new law prohibits indiscriminate use of a
plaintiff's sex history.
Mr Green said this would make it more difficult for employers to disprove
plaintiffs' claims that sexual advances were unwelcome and unprovoked. 'You
win these cases by destroying the credibility of the accuser,' he said.
Such cases look like becoming harder for employers to win. Companies doing
business in the US have been warned.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Technology: Closing in on a serial killer - Cancer kills
five people every minute of the day. In the first of a six-part series,
Clive Cookson reports on the war against cancer and the encouraging trends
behind the statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cancer continues to sink its claws deeper into mankind. After two decades of
'war on cancer', fuelled by billions of research dollars, the death toll
rises inexorably.
The disease - named after the Latin word for crab because of the crab-like
pattern made by blood vessels on a growing tumour - will kill an estimated
2.5m people in the industrialised world this year. That amounts to almost a
quarter of all deaths.
The gloomy mortality statistics contrast with excitement among cancer
researchers, who have made more progress towards understanding the
fundamental processes responsible for the disease over the past 15 years
than in all previous history. The important question for present and future
cancer patients is how quickly the new knowledge can be converted into
better diagnosis and treatment.
At present there is a gap between doctors' continuing inability to provide
much more than palliative care for millions of cancer patients and the
cascade of optimistic stories in the popular media about 'breakthroughs' in
research, such as discovering cancer genes and inventing experimental drugs.
There is an inevitable delay - typically a decade or so - while an advance
in medical science is developed for commercial application. So no one should
expect the latest discoveries to have made any clinical impact yet. But many
people will remember 'breakthroughs' from the 1970s and early 1980s, such as
interferon and 'magic bullet' antibodies, which would have transformed
cancer treatment by now - if they had lived up to first expectations.
Very few patients are treated with novel approaches derived from
biotechnology. The vast majority still undergo the well-established
procedures of chemotherapy (poisoning cancer cells with a drug cocktail) and
radiotherapy (destroying them with radiation). Surgery is also used to cut
out solid tumours.
'We hear the word 'breakthrough' thrown around too much,' says Nicholas
Wright, clinical director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
'and we certainly get the impression that the public are a bit jaundiced by
scientists talking about breakthroughs.'
Why are more people contracting and dying from cancer? The first reason is
an epidemic of cancers caused by smoking, particularly lung cancer. 'At
least 30 per cent of all cancer deaths are tobacco-related,' says Archie
Turnbull, executive secretary of the Geneva-based UICC, an umbrella body for
the world's cancer charities.
A second, more fundamental, reason is that cancer is mainly a disease of old
age. As medicine becomes more successful at preventing early deaths from
other illnesses such as heart attacks and strokes, more people are living
beyond the age of 70, above which the risk of cancer rises rapidly.
Despite the overall rise in cancer mortality, there have been substantial
improvements in some areas. The most encouraging feature of the statistics
since the 1970s is the progress in curing cancers in children and young
adults - particularly leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer -
through new drug combinations. The number of children under the age of 15
dying from cancer has fallen by half.
There are two principal reasons why young people are responding more readily
to treatment. One is that youthful cancer cells in the blood or lymph
systems are physically easier to reach and destroy with drugs and/or
radiation than the solid tumours of the middle-aged and elderly. Another
reason is that the difference between proliferating cancer cells and normal
cells is greater in childhood cancers than in slower-growing adult tumours.
Therefore chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which work by damaging DNA during
cell division, can destroy more cancer cells without causing unacceptable
side-effects.
Prospects for curing the big killers - tumours of the lungs, bowels,
stomach, breast, prostate and pancreas - depend above all on developing
treatments that discriminate more effectively between cancer and normal
cells than the drugs used in chemotherapy today.
The discovery of genetic changes leading to cancer should make this
possible, says Gordon McVie, scientific director of the Cancer Research
Campaign. 'These provide for the first time an absolute chemical difference
between the cells. Until now we have had to rely on qualitative differences
 -the cancer cells making rather more of some proteins and less of others.'
Scientists have identified more than 100 genes that can trigger the cellular
processes leading to cancer, if they mutate. (Causes of mutation include
carcinogenic chemicals, radiation, family inheritance, and random changes
during cell division.)
One dangerous type of genetic change stimulates cell growth. Another shuts
down the protective 'tumour suppressor' genes which normally prevent
excessive proliferation. The former has been compared with a car that has
its accelerator jammed on, the latter with a failure in the brakes.
New approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer are
being built on such differences between the genes of diseased and normal
cells - and the corresponding differences in the proteins they produce. One
possibility is to block the damaging effects of abnormal 'growth factors'
which sustain the proliferation of tumour cells, without harming healthy
cell growth.
But cancer genes are not the only reason why researchers are excited.
Another is their new understanding of the way the body's immune system
recognises and attacks cancer cells. This has led to experimental 'cancer
vaccines' to boost the immune response.
These novel 'biotech' approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment will be
examined over the next six months on the Financial Times technology page. So
will advances in more conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The aim is to convey the real optimism that now prevails in the laboratories
 -a hope and expectation that cancer will eventually be restricted to a
disease of the very old - without raising excessive expectations about the
speed and ease with which this will happen.
After 50 years in cancer research, Sir Richard Doll of the ICRF Cancer
Studies Unit in Oxford sums up the mood: 'We are winning the war against
cancer, albeit slowly.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Technology: Disease tops list of industry priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pharmaceutical industry is devoting huge resources to cancer research
and development, in relation to sales of existing drugs.
Although reliable figures are not available, industry sources estimate that
companies worldwide spend Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year on cancer R&amp;D. US
companies are responsible for about half the total.
The cancer therapeutics market is worth about Dollars 6.5bn this year,
according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the international market research company: 38
per cent in the US, 26 per cent in Europe and 36 per cent in the rest of the
world.
The leading suppliers are Zeneca of the UK (whose tamoxifen was the best
selling-cancer drug with Dollars 550m sales in 1993) and Bristol-Myers
Squibb of the US.
'Devoting almost 50 per cent of sales revenues to R&amp;D is a very high figure
indeed,' says David Barrett, Bristol-Myers Squibb's strategic projects
director. The industry's overall R&amp;D expenditure is 15 per cent of drug
sales.
The main reason why cancer spending is so high is that the disease is top of
the industry's priority list of 'unmet needs'. Although deaths from heart
disease are twice those from cancer, they are falling - and cardiologists
already have a much wider range of effective treatments than oncologists.
At the same time, scientific advances are giving many new leads both to
traditional drug companies and to the emerging biotechnology sector. The
world now has more than 1,000 experimental cancer drugs in the R&amp;D pipeline.
Analysts such as Decision Resources and Frost &amp; Sullivan predict continued
growth of more than 10 per cent a year in the cancer market into the next
century. It is expected to exceed Dollars 10bn by 1998.
The industry's cancer R&amp;D spending is matched by a further Dollars 3bn a
year from the world's governments and charities. By far the largest
contributor is the US National Cancer Institute, which receives Dollars 2bn
a year in federal funding.
The charitable sector is particularly important in the UK, where the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund and Cancer Research Campaign spend Pounds 100m
a year between them - 10 times as much as the state-funded Medical Research
Council.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A clean job of it - A
laundry owner's experience of working with Investors in People
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the first holiday David Coulter took after founding his laundry
business, Stalbridge Linen Services, he read a book on management by Peter
Drucker.
To Coulter, a boot-strapping entrepreneur who began his business washing pub
tea towels in London launderettes, Drucker was merely re-stating the
obvious. 'You talk to the customers and find out what they want and provide
it. And if it goes wrong, you find out why and sort it out,' says Coulter.
Without knowing it, Coulter says he had been applying much of this theory as
he grew his business in Dorset to Pounds 6m of sales and a workforce of 200
people.
It was therefore a rude shock when he applied for Investors in People, a
government-sponsored programme set up in 1990 to boost training and
management development in the UK. Instead of sailing through to IIP
recognition, Coulter found his management team fell well short of the mark.
The production side of the laundry - sorting, washing, pressing and packing
 -passed with flying colours. But in frank conversations with the consultant
who helped implement the IIP programme, Coulter was told his management
relied on firefighter decision-making, rather than foresight and planning,
and that there was considerable scope for improving com-munication among the
team.
'We had senior managers who were relying on experience and know-how from the
past and were not looking to improve themselves or inspire the people
underneath them,' Coulter says. 'The attitude had to change.'
Driving down a narrow Dorset lane shortly after starting the IIP programme,
Coulter recognised his problem. Like the traffic building up behind two
dawdling cars, the pace of Stalbridge's progress was being dictated by its
slowest managers.
He fired the entire management team and made them reapply for their jobs.
Nine months later, in May this year, Stalbridge won IIP recognition. Most of
its managers got jobs back in different areas. But responsibility is now
more effectively delegated, training systems are better documented and the
management team has been allowed to grow now that it has been freed of the
influence of managers who did not encourage personal development, Coulter
says.
His early scepticism about the IIP programme is not uncommon. He approached
the exercise thinking it would be a good marketing tool but otherwise with
low expectations.
The surprise at discovering that IIP has real benefits is also not unusual.
According to Mark Spilsbury, senior research fellow at the Institute of
Employment Studies at Sussex University, a growing number of case studies
suggest the IIP programme is achieving its aims.
'Unusually in our evaluations of government initiatives, the response has
been quite astonishingly positive,' Spilsbury says, based on the early stage
of an evaluation he is conducting. 'Employers certainly liked it (IIP) and
thought it had made an impact on how they had done their training and
development and thought it would filter through and benefit the bottom
line.'
He believes IIP opens up channels of communication and will eventually
increase businesses' chances of surviving and growing. 'It gets them
(managers) focusing on their business needs,' he says. 'It goes all the way
through from the mission statement, the business plan and training plan
linked to that. For some companies that is quite new stuff.'
The IIP programme is funded by the department for employment and
administered through the Training and Enterprise Councils which market it to
local companies. Some companies qualify for a subsidy from the Tec. Dorset
Tec paid about half the cost of Stalbridge's IIP consultant but the expense
of implementing the programme still came to Pounds 30,000, Coulter says.
Companies that seek the standard must agree to training all employees
towards specified corporate objectives; they must regularly review training
and development needs and identify the necessary resources in their business
plans. They must train employees when they are recruited and evaluate
subsequent training and development and revise their targets.
The government's intention is that half the companies with more than 200
employees should have achieved IIP recognition by 1996. More than 350
companies are already recognised as Investors in People and 2,800 are on the
way to achieving recognition - this is about 35 per cent of companies with
more than 200 employees.
But is there any proof that IIP works? 'I would say there is plenty of
evidence, though not proof, of improvements,' says Mary Chapman, chief
executive of Investors in People UK, a government-supported body promoting
the IIP programme. 'There is reduced absenteeism and staff turnover and
tangible improved productivity, reduced waste and increased profitability.'
Bringing in outside consultants is not easy for any entrepreneur,
particularly one like Coulter who has taken an unconventional route.
Coulter and his then wife had decided to move to Dorset before they had any
idea that they would start a laundry business. 'We thought of opening a shop
but we didn't have enough capital and had to fall back on our experience and
what we knew best,' says Coulter.
Having started and subsequently bought a local laundry business, Coulter
proved it was possible to build a thriving business in an industry where
there were relatively low bars to entry.
Coulter knew he had to change from an entrepreneurial to a professional
management style. But the IIP programme exposed him to some blunt criticism.
'A customer once said I was an autocrat trying to be a democrat,' Coulter
says. The IIP consultant was broadly of the same opinion.
'I am having to learn to delegate and by delegation I mean you have to train
people to develop themselves,' Coulter says.
He is also worried about losing his contact with customers, the basis for
the growth of his business. 'The process is supposed to be getting us closer
to customers,' he says. 'Some people are getting closer but others, like me,
are getting more removed.'
He is having to learn to let his management team take the reins. No doubt,
now that he has recognised this need he will read a management tract that
tells him entrepreneurs need to let go if their businesses are to grow.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Midlands funds - spoilt
for choice / The proliferation of finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New funds and fresh schemes to help small companies have been proliferating
across the Midlands with such bewildering confusion that concern is growing
about fragmentation. The problem now may be not that there is inadequate
finance to help aspiring executives, but that there is too much choice.
The initiatives have one thing in common. There is a clearing bank involved
somewhere.
Since the end of September, Midland Bank has begun two funds for start-up
businesses, one of Pounds 300,000 with Birmingham Venture, part of the
Chamber of Commerce, and another of Pounds 260,000 with Birmingham Training
and Enterprise Council.
Lloyds Bank has joined with six government-funded agencies and local
solicitors and accountants to set up the Pounds 550,000 Arrow Fund to help
the small, growing business. Barclays, as the agent for the European
Investment Bank, has emerged with a rebate scheme which provides cash for
companies using lease finance and creating jobs at the same time.
There is more to come. National Westminster Bank shortly will announce that
it is heading a group of 18 private-sector groups providing Pounds 2m
largely to fund a Business in the Community plan to foster voluntary sector
commercial projects.
In January, Aston Reinvestment Trust, the nascent community bank for east
Birmingham, will hold its first board meeting. Among the institutions to
which it is talking about funding are Co-operative Bank and National
Westminster.
In February, the University of Central England will outline a project to
help potential fast-growth businesses where senior managers, already in
employment, are seeking to break out on their own; behind it will be Midland
Bank and 3i, the venture capital group.
This intensity of clearing bank interest at an end of the market which
historically banks have tended to find difficult, time-consuming and risky
is not confined to the Midlands. Banks give local shape to national plans.
Midland, for example, has 30 local loan funds.
Indeed, the banks appear now to be competing for business which previously
they eschewed. 'All the banks see the value of being involved,' said Mike
Conroy, a small-business specialist at Midland.
It is a sharp change from two years ago when banks were pilloried for what
was perceived to be their indifference to an ailing small-business sector.
It is the result of a confluence of circumstances.
The government's 1993 Competitiveness White Paper played a part with its
stress on encouraging banks to provide a wider range of products. The banks'
own desire, after the criticism of the recession years, to escape the charge
that they would only lend against the collateral of physical assets chimed
with that urging of the government.
The banks also met a movement from another angle. David Hall of Business
Link Birmingham explained that the subsuming of the Enterprise Allowance
scheme into the government's Single Regeneration Budget meant that local
Tecs, Business Links and councils were looking for new funds. The banks
found ready partners to act in a sector where the personality and prospects
of a potential borrower are more significant than his assets. The vehicle of
partnership proved to be the loan fund.
The fact that organisations such as Tecs and Business Link had the
facilities and willingness to school potential borrowers through the writing
of business plans meant that the banks could deal with the fund clients at
one remove.
The banks could administer the loans but they were spared the time-consuming
task of giving pastoral care to borrowers with a negligible business track
record. They had a comfort factor, somebody to look after their money for
them.
Certainly, the banks are unlikely to make much profit out of the funds. The
Midland funds and the Arrow fund offer loans at 1 per cent above bank base
rate, the sort of interest charged to blue-chip multinationals.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Italian borsino planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans announced last week to launch a pan-European stock market for
entrepreneurial companies have struck a chord in Italy, where banks,
business federations and the stock exchange authorities are encouraging the
birth of a baby stock market, or 'borsino'.
The plan ought to stand a good chance of success. Italy's innovative small
and medium-sized companies, particularly those in the north of the country,
are recognised as the backbone of the Italian economy, and many are
enthusiastic exporters bent on expansion. But management consultants say
their development is being hampered by their inability or unwillingness to
take on more bank debt, making stock market flotation a tempting
alternative.
Consob, Italy's stock exchange watchdog, has invited consortia to submit
offers to set up a second market, which would trade ordinary shares as well
as bonds and warrants. Promoters would have to guarantee the presence of at
least 50 companies with an overall market capitalisation of more than L500bn
(Pounds 198m) and the involvement of an adequate number of intermediaries to
guarantee liquidity.
The main problem, however, will be persuading growing Italian businesses -
many of them family-owned - that they need to list their shares, after
decades of relative prosperity as unquoted companies. To encourage
entrepreneurs on to the second market, the government is offering fiscal
incentives to small companies which decide to float their shares, and to
investors who want to buy them. A further snag is that even the main equity
market, in Milan, is relatively underdeveloped.
As for the European second market, advocates of an Italian version are
sceptical about the willingness of investors in Rochdale wanting to buy
shares in a Rimini-based company. Although the second Italian market will be
national, the emphasis is at first likely to be on local savers investing in
local companies.

FT  29 NOV 94 / BBC and Pearson in TV launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC and media group Pearson yesterday announced their plans to push
ahead with the launch of two 24-hour European satellite television channels
in January. One will be devoted to news and the other to entertainment.
BBC Prime - a subscription service concentrating on drama, comedy, light
entertainment, natural history and children's programming - will replace the
BBC's existing European general programming.
BBC World, to be financed by advertising, will offer news on the hour backed
by current affairs, documentaries and factual programmes.
Both channels, aimed mainly at continental European cable television
networks, will be launched on January 26. Neither will be available in the
UK although the BBC hopes to launch a 24-hour television news service for
Britain.
The launch is the first fruit of the strategic alliance announced earlier
this year between the BBC and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Under the deal Pearson has agreed to meet the estimated cost of the
two-channel venture of up to Pounds 30m, with the BBC contributing
broadcasting expertise and programmes from its library.
Mr Bob Phillis, chairman of BBC Worldwide, the corporation's international
operating arm, said yesterday that there would be 'full transparency' and
that the venture would pay market prices for BBC services and library
programmes.
At the moment the venture is a 50-50 one between Pearson and the corporation
but talks are said to be at an advanced stage to bring in one or more
additional investors who will hold a total stake of 20 per cent.
Cox, the Altanta-based media group, is believed to be a potential partner.
It founded UK Gold, a library channel for UK cable and satellite with the
BBC and Thames Television, now a Pearson subsidiary.
Neither the BBC nor Thames would give a projected breakeven date for the
venture.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames and managing director of Pearson
Television Holdings, said, however: 'This is not going to be profitable in
two years' time.'
It is believed that the timescale being envisaged is from five to seven
years, although much depends on how quickly the new channels are accepted on
European cable networks.
The hope is BBC World will be in 10m homes in two years. The number of cable
network subscribers is rising, according to figures from the Independent
Television Commission.
However, penetration levels - subscribers as a proportion of the population
covered by the spreading cable networks - have increased only marginally.
By October 1, 779,461 homes were connected to modern cable networks, a 50
per cent increase from last year.
Most cable companies offer telephone services, and the number of lines
installed by October 1 was 570,656.
Nynex CableComms, one of the biggest cable operators, yesterday launched new
low-cost phone services for business customers, to include free local calls
to multisite subscribers with three or more Nynex lines per site.
The average cloaks considerable variation in the performance of the 74 cable
franchises.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Mobile phone newcomers fail to impress business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The newcomers to the UK mobile telephone market, Mercury One2One and
Hutchison Telecoms' Orange, are failing to make an impact in the business
sector, which continues to be dominated by the traditional operators,
Vodafone and Cellnet.
A survey among members of the Telecommunications Managers Association,
representing the UK's big telephone users, confirms that Vodafone remains
the principal mobile phone operator with a 46 per cent share. Cellnet has 38
per cent. Mercury One2One, launched last year, has a 2 per cent share and
Orange, launched about six months ago, has 1 per cent.
Orange is expected to overtake One2One in the business community soon,
however. Asked which operators would most likely meet business needs over
the next two years, 31 per cent of respondents chose Vodafone, 21 per cent
Cellnet, 14 per cent Orange and 1 per cent One2One.
The survey, published at the annual telecommunications managers' conference
in Brighton yesterday, confirms anecdotal evidence that Vodafone and Cellnet
are taking the lion's share of the portable phone sales boom because their
analogue systems are mature, well-tested and provide extensive coverage.
The newcomers, which offer digital services exclusively, are still
developing their technical infrastructures. Both are limited in coverage -
One2One has only just started to extend beyond the few miles around London.
The survey shows that most business customers rate quality of service ahead
of price - as competition drives prices down, the implication is that buyers
will be prepared to pay a premium for quality.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Accountancy rules relief attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to release 90 per cent of companies from compliance with most
accounting standards were attacked yesterday by the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
The accountancy profession's working party on standards, commissioned by the
Accounting Standards Board, has said that small companies should be exempt
from most of the rules.
The working party said complicated accounting standards were an inefficient
burden and could lead to the loss of a competitive advantage when private
information was disclosed.
It proposed that small companies, as defined by the Companies Act, should be
exempt from most standards and all new ones unless a special case was made
by the standards board.
But Mr Peter Langard, vice-president of the chartered association, said the
proposals - which are out for public consultation - could reduce the
comparability of accounts for companies 'which form the backbone of British
industry'.
The chartered association said the cost of compliance with standards would
not be removed by the proposals because as the main burden for companies was
meeting the requirements of the Companies Act.
Mr Langard said: 'Accounting standards help both preparers and users to make
sense of existing rules, which often fail to prescribe an appropriate
accounting base.
'Exemption could be made on a case-by-case basis only, when it can be
demonstrated that there are significant cost burdens arising from the
application of a particular standard.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Westminster auditor 'wrong to seize papers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former senior local government officer yesterday told the public inquiry
into alleged vote-rigging by Westminster City Council that it was
unprecedented for the district auditor to have obtained secret political
papers from councillors.
Mr John Hender, chief executive of West Midlands County Council between 1973
and 1986, was called as an expert witness by Conservative councillor Ms
Judith Warner, one of the 10 accused of vote-rigging by Mr John Magill,
district auditor.
Mr Hender said: 'I have never before come across a situation where a
district auditor has had access to the party political papers of the
majority party in his investigations of any alleged improper political
activity by members or officers and I frankly would not expect to have
access myself.'
Lawyers for the accused have argued at the inquiry that it was wrong for Mr
Magill to seize political papers from closed meetings of Tory councillors
and rely on them as evidence of what was decided in committee meetings.
They have argued that everybody in local government except Mr Magill
understood the 'great divide' between what councillors discussed in these
closed meetings and what they were legally allowed to do in the council
chamber.
In his provisional report Mr Magill recommended a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m
on 10 councillors and officials for selling off homes in marginal wards.
Mr Hender also said councillors and officials should be safe from being
surcharged if they had acted on legal advice from a respected counsel, even
if that advice was wrong.
The accused have said that proper legal approval for the sales policy was
obtained from Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC before it was implemented in 1987.
The inquiry continues today.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Railtrack blamed for train delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the newly created train operating companies has accused Railtrack of
providing such a poor service that it has been unable to run its advertised
timetables.
North London Railways said it had held talks with the East Anglia zone of
Railtrack, owner of the track, signals and stations, to discuss urgently
needed infrastructure improvements.
Mr Chris Gibbard, retail manager of North London, said in a letter to Mr
John Sanderson, secretary of the North London Line passengers' committee:
'We have all been as frustrated as yourself and all our customers at
Railtrack's apparent inability to manage the route.'
A North London director had 'arranged high level talks with Railtrack East
Anglia Management to insist upon an improvement in infrastructure management
to enable North London Railways to run its advertised service'.
Details of Mr Gibbard's comments were made public by Ms Glenda Jackson,
Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate.
Railtrack East Anglia said the North London lines had been neglected before
it took them over from British Rail on April 1. It said: 'We inherited old
infrastructure which needed improvement.'
Railtrack added that plans to upgrade the line to allow the Channel tunnel
Eurostar trains to get to the north of England had been delayed but were
expected to be carried out next year. These improvements would also benefit
local train services.
London Underground will today unveil plans for a Pounds 70m 1 1/4 -mile
extension of the Piccadilly line to the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow
airport.
If the plans are approved work could start in 1997 and the new extension and
station would become operational in the year 2002, when Terminal 5 is due to
open.

FT  29 NOV 94 / New mortgages fall in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence of the sluggishness of the mortgage market came yesterday as
it emerged that new home loans by banks fell more than 10 per cent in
October compared with September.
The number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken was also down
slightly at 29,081, from 29,718 in September. While this was higher than in
October last year, the average value of loans approved - Pounds 50,400 - was
scarcely more than the equivalent in 1993. This contrasts with the summer,
when average values of loans approved were 10 per cent higher than in the
previous year.
The figures, released by the British Bankers' Association, show new lending
last month, both in gross and net terms, below the levels of October 1993.
Mr Tim Sweeney, BBA director-general, said the figures mirrored the fall in
new home loans from building societies last month.
He suggested that the poorer figures for October might have reflected
September's 'good month' in the mortgage market. However, new net lending by
banks in September this year was less than in September last year.

FT  29 NOV 94 / House sale lull hits land prices: Inland Revenue report says
improvement in property market has petered out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapid increases in housing land prices seen earlier this year have slowed
considerably as the expected housing market upturn has failed to
materialise, says a report by Inland Revenue valuation officers.
The findings of the Revenue's district valuation officers provide one of the
most comprehensive guides to the health of the residential, commercial and
agricultural property markets.
Their latest report shows that 956,000 property transactions, mostly house
sales, were notified to the Revenue in England and Wales in the first nine
months of this year - 10 per cent more than in the corresponding period last
year.
The valuation office said that in spite of this improvement 'the purchaser
is still very much in command of the market, making for predominantly static
prices in all parts of the country'.
The pace of improvement, moreover, had slowed as a sharp increase in sales
activity in the spring was followed by an earlier than usual summer lull.
This trend had continued in the autumn with reported transactions 6 per cent
lower in September than in the corresponding month last year.
The report says the number of housing transactions is at a level last seen
in 1980, with purchases being dictated by necessity rather than desire.
House prices had seen very little increase, with average housing values in
England and Wales rising by just 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to the end of
October.
The valuation office said: 'The regional markets show very little variation,
with the majority exhibiting only marginally higher values over (the
previous) six months.'
Only Wales, south-east England and outer London had shown 'overall increases
of any substance'.
The slowdown in the housing market in the summer and autumn has led to a
corresponding reduction in the pace of housing land price increases, which
rose sharply earlier this year.
The report says: 'The increased activity seen in the previous reporting
period appears to have subsided now that the anticipated upturn in the
housing market has not materialised.'
Builders were continuing to restock with land but were no longer 'prepared
to bid up prices except in favoured locations such as the Home Counties,
where marked increases in value have been seen for sites within striking
distance of the M25'.
There were also big differences in land price movements between northern and
southern regions of England. Increases in north-west and northern England
had been limited.
The market in the southern half of the country, by comparison, had generally
been buoyant apart from 'pockets of inactivity where employment in
long-established industries has declined such as at English China Clays in
St Austell (Cornwall)'.
The Revenue said yesterday: 'Overall district valuers are of the opinion
that an upturn in the housing market is a prerequisite of any further
improvement in the resi-dential building land market.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Electrotech plans 200 Welsh jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrotech, a UK manufacturer of machinery for making microchips, is to
transfer production from its main plant near Bristol to Newport in south
Wales.
The move is part of a Pounds 2.1m expansion intended to create an additional
200 jobs over the next three years.
The privately-owned company, which has annual sales of more than Pounds 20m,
will be moving into a 102,000 sq ft air-conditioned factory which was
formerly owned by Inmos, the UK-based semiconductor subsidiary of
SGS-Thomson.
Electrotech said it was unable to expand at its existing plant at Thornbury
and there had been no suitable alternative premises locally. All 240
full-time employees at Thornbury would be offered a transfer to Newport.
The move to the Newport factory, which has been empty for several years, has
been co-ordinated by the Welsh Development Agency.
Electrotech is acquiring the lease from Newport Wafer-Fab, which was set up
two years ago to take over manufacture at a second Inmos factory nearby.
Electrotech expects the plant to be fully operational by the middle of next
year.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Ulster to renew electricity link with republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The power link between Ulster and the Irish Republic is to be restored,
Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised power utility, announced
yesterday. It was damaged by IRA bombs in the early 1970s.
The North-South Interconnector is one of a number of cross-border
initiatives dusted off in the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires. The move
will result in savings for both NIE and the Electricity Supply Board, the
republic's power utility.
The link will improve load management efficiencies, allowing both companies
to cover temporary power shortfalls. It will also provide trading
opportunities for NIE to sell to the republic.
NIE said it was 'still talking about contracts'. ESB estimated that the
project could result in savings of IPounds 500,000 (Pounds 495,000) a year.
The restoration would increase the viability of NIE's proposed Pounds 175m
power link with Scotland, which is the subject of a public inquiry that
should be completed by February. An NIE official said yesterday that the two
projects were 'perfectly complementary and in line with European energy
policy'.
If the link with ScottishPower is approved both Irish grids will be
integrated into the European network for the first time - there is already a
link between England and France.
The European Union has backed the Ulster-Scotland link with a Pounds 61m
grant.
Mr Geoffrey Horton, the Northern Ireland electricity regulator, is reviewing
the NIE/ScottishPower link after a request from the province's consumer
committee.
As part of his review Mr Horton is looking at alternative proposals,
including one from Meekatharra Minerals, the loss-making Australian mining
company, to build a lignite power plant near Ballymoney in County Antrim.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Government probes 'black market' in milk sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government, dairy industry and farmers' leaders called yesterday for a
crackdown on an emerging black market in milk sales.
The Intervention Board, the government department that polices Common
Agricultural Policy milk quotas in the UK, is investigating allegations that
farmers are illegally selling milk to small processors.
Under European Union regulations, all milk sold by farmers must be offset
against their individual quota limit - selling it without declaring it is
illegal.
Demand for quota has risen in the wake of the deregulation of the dairy
industry which helped push up prices to farmers and encouraged them to
produce more milk. European milk quotas, however, prevent British farmers
from meeting more than 85 per cent of domestic needs.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said farmers were
understandably frustrated about the EU quota constraints but they would be
'wrong and foolish' to break the rules.
He said: 'They'd find themselves in very great difficulty at a time when
we're rightly adding to the drive on fraud in the CAP. Any suggestions that
was beginning to happen in the UK would be very damaging.'
The intervention board said more than half the 30 tip-offs to its fraud
hotline, set up on November 9, had alleged milk fraud.
Milk Marque, the dairy farmers' co-operative that controls more than 65 per
cent of supplies in England and Wales, said 'a handful' of its members were
being investigated for alleged fraud.
Mr Neil MacFarlane, manager for the Midlands and north Wales, said: 'It's
not a massive problem, but it gets emotions running high when people are
seen to be cheating. It's another potential fraud and it could become
large-scale.'
Farmers face large penalties for producing milk without a quota. They could
be levied 29p a litre by the Intervention Board and face an unlimited fine
and up to two years in prison if the case goes to the criminal courts. Milk
quotas are traded between farmers. However, the cost of buying or leasing
the extra quota a farmer needs to cover increased output has soared.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said quotas
caused difficulties but there was 'no excuse for black marketeering'. Milk
Marque urged the intervention board to 'stamp on it'. Breaches were fairly
obvious, Mr MacFarlane said. 'It's very difficult to hide a 16 or 18-tonne
tanker going on to your farm.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Think-tank calls for farming 'safety net'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agricultural subsidies to farmers in the European Union should be phased out
and replaced by a 'safety net' of social and environmental payments in rural
areas, the Royal Institute of International Affairs will recommend this
week.
The radical proposals from the Chatham House think-tank are the latest in a
groundswell of pressure for further reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy, intensified by the proposed entry of east European countries into
the EU.
In a 10-point programme of reform to be unveiled in Brussels on Thursday,
the institute calls for a comprehensive policy for rural development to
replace the CAP and take on a comparable political importance. It says this
would involve 'organisational changes' in the European Commission and the
Council of Ministers - a hint that farm policy would be better dictated in
future by a wider range of ministers than just agriculture ministers.
The institute says the difficult negotiations leading to the MacSharry
reforms of 1992 left European agriculture ministers reluctant to embark on
further big changes. But it says the reform process is incomplete and
further change is needed 'sooner rather than later' to address the
integration of eastern Europe, with its vast agricultural potential.
The report, based on eight months of deliberations by European policymakers
and agricultural experts, is designed to coincide with the arrival of the
new Commission next year. It recommends that support prices for all CAP
products be cut to near world market levels over a period of five to seven
years and border tariffs should be correspondingly lowered.
Existing compensation paid to farmers for price cuts should be phased out,
while compensation for reductions in support prices in as yet unreformed
sectors, such as sugar, should not be related in any way to output levels in
order to discourage overproduction. It should also carry specific time
limits.
The institute wants production quotas for sugar and milk to be transferable
across borders in the short term, and to be eliminated in the long term. By
contrast, payments for adopting environmentally-friendly practices should be
available to all farmers.
It calls for member states to have greater freedom to introduce social and
environmental schemes provided these are strictly controlled by the EU to
prevent unfair competition. The extent of EU financing for such programmes
should vary according to member states' ability to pay - a policy designed
to promote social cohesion within the EU.
The report says: 'Adopting such a programme would leave the EU with an
agricultural support system which protects the farmer from market collapse
but serves only as a safety net.
'It would facilitate the entry into the union of the countries of central
and eastern Europe without unacceptable budgetary cost . . . Above all it
would allow the EU to develop rural policies which were more closely attuned
to the social and environmental objectives of the union.'
Sir Michael Franklin, chairman of the European research programme and
co-author of the report, said: 'We're clear the best route is through a
carefully-constructed programme over several years to minimise disruption
and give investors and farmers a greater degree of confidence and certainty
on which to base their plans.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Sleaze goes to university after government reforms: Claims
of financial impropriety in higher education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sleaze allegations have hit the government's reforms of further and higher
education this month.
Yesterday Portsmouth University, a former polytechnic which owes its
independent status to government reforms, launched an investigation into
claims that its vice-chancellor muddled his expense claims for foreign
trips.
The university said yesterday that it had given Professor Neil Merritt a
'formal warning' over the allegations, and said that a vote of no-confidence
in him supported by 93 per cent of staff was 'hardly surprising, given the
one-sided nature of the information' drip fed to them. The members and remit
of the independent inquiry will be decided next week.
This is only the latest of several allegations of dubious financial
behaviour by university and college governors.
One quango, the Further Education Funding Council for England, has
recommended dismissal for the governing boards of two further education
colleges, in Birmingham and Derby. Both were freed from local authority
control and incorporated as independent institutions in April 1993.
At St Philip's Roman Catholic Sixth Form College, Birmingham, the governors
said they were determined to close the college in spite of opposition from
parents and staff. At Derby College, Wilmorton, governors were asked to
repay illegal payments of about Pounds 16,000.
The most serious incident came at the end of October, when the funding
council which covers higher education ordered Huddersfield University -
which gained its current status in 1992 - not to pay a planned Pounds
400,000 golden handshake to its departing vice-chancellor, saying it was
'possibly illegal'.
Higher education in particular is divided over how to respond to the
problems. Universities are traditionally autonomous and are alarmed by any
indications that they cannot use their autonomy responsibly.
But lecturers' unions say that accountability in the sector has been
weakened by the government's decision to incorporate colleges and
universities as bodies run on the same lines as limited companies.
Huddersfield has taken the most drastic action so far. It used powers given
to it by the 1988 and 1992 education acts to remove the local authority,
staff and student representatives from its governing body.
Then it gave its vice-chancellor, Professor Kenneth Durrands, a pay rise of
45 per cent, backdated by four months, to be followed by a severance package
of about Pounds 400,000 - out of a total annual turnover of about Pounds
55m. The total involved was only revealed after a National Audit Office
investigation, which MPs from the Public Accounts Committee ordered to be
made public.
This had been agreed in spite of an overwhelming vote of no-confidence in
the governing council by academic staff.
The university agreed to set aside the package after the funding council's
intervention. The funding council is anxious not to make incursions on
university autonomy, however, and said that renegotiating a fresh package
for Prof Durrands was 'a matter for the university'.
It is now working on a guidance note for governors, although it stresses
this will not include binding regulations.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents the
managers of all universities in the UK, wants to avoid any resort to
legislation to solve the problems.
It opposed Huddersfield's action in dismissing its local authority and staff
representatives. 'Huddersfield was the only new university which used the
powers it was given by the government,' it said.

FT  29 NOV 94 / EU agreement on livestock journey times unlikely says
Waldegrave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday it was highly
unlikely that his European Union counterparts would agree this year
acceptable limits on journey times for animals being transported to
slaughter.
He said he did not expect agreement, although the best hope lay with the
German presidency, which concluded at the end of this year. It was even less
likely under the French presidency next year, given that France would be
preoccupied with elections.
Leading British ferry companies have stopped transporting live animals to
the Continent following protests from animal welfare groups. They say they
will reconsider their bans only if there is EU-wide agreement on shorter
journey times.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Channel tunnel duty-free row grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferries, airlines, goods suppliers and Dover Harbour Board yesterday asked
the High Court to block the attempt by Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
operator, to put an end to duty-free shopping.
Eurotunnel, which is not allowed to sell duty-free goods on its trains
although it has duty-free shops at Folkestone and Calais, claims its
competitors are enjoying an unfair and discriminatory advantage under
European free trade laws because they can subsidise fares from on-board
sales profits.
Eurotunnel's competitors argued that its application for a judicial review
of a 1991 Customs and Excise decision allowing the duty-free trade to
continue should be struck out because it was brought outside legal time
limits.
The Customs decision was based on a ruling by the European Council of
Ministers that, despite the advent of the European single market, the trade
should be allowed to continue until 1999 because of the failure to harmonise
rates of duty between member states.
At the start of a five-day hearing, the ferry companies' counsel, Mr Kenneth
Rokison QC, told Lord Justice Balcombe and Mr Justice Tucker Eurotunnel was
seeking to argue that its competitors had no sufficient legal interest in
the case enabling them to seek a strike-out order. He said this was clearly
a 'blatant' attempt to stop the court ever deciding the question of delay.
The ferries and the other operators obviously had an interest because they
relied on revenue from duty-free sales and would be seriously affected if
Eurotunnel won its case.
Eurotunnel, which points out that the duty-free trade represents a total
loss to the Exchequer of Pounds 600m a year in excise duty and value added
tax, is asking the judges to refer questions of European law to the European
Court of Justice as a preliminary to the full hearing of its judicial review
application.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Waldegrave says EU agreement on animal journey times
unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday it was highly
unlikely that his European Union counterparts would agree this year
acceptable limits on journey times for animals being transported to
slaughter.
He said he did not expect agreement, although the best hope lay with the
German presidency, which concluded at the end of this year.
It was even less likely under the French presidency next year, given that
France would be preoccupied with elections, he said.
Leading British ferry companies have stopped transporting live animals to
the Continent following protests from animal welfare groups.
They say they will reconsider their bans only if there is EU-wide agreement
on shorter journey times.
Mr Waldegrave said at the Royal Smithfield Show in London that the
government was ready to introduce its own code of practice for hauliers if
no EU deal emerged, and would seek help from other member states to police
it.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Skilled workers 'less confident'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skilled workers are less confident about the economy and job security than
any other social group, according to the latest FT/MFS Mood of the Nation
Index.
The 'feel-good' factor among the C2 social group - the bedrock of
Conservative success in the 1980s - fell 10 per cent in the past month.
Skilled workers are more pessimistic than unskilled workers, while
confidence among the professional and managerial classes rose 24 per cent
this month.
The overall index has recovered from a two-month depression triggered by the
rise in interest rates. The index rose two points to 90, but is still 10
points lower than its starting point in April last year.
The rise reflects a slight reduction in the number of people who think the
economy will worsen in the next 12 months. The survey shows, however, that
the workforce is just as concerned about redundancy as it was in October.
One third of the 1,932 people surveyed think the economy will deteriorate,
while 21 per cent are concerned about losing their jobs.
Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI Financial Services, the index
compiler, said: 'More than one in four of the backbone of the electorate is
very or fairly concerned' about losing their jobs.
He added: 'The feel-good factor is traditionally about whether the economy
will get worse, but people are saying that is not the case. People are
worried about their own jobs.'
Tory supporters remain the most optimistic of all political groups, as their
confidence rating rose 41 points to 207. The feel-good factor among Tories
is more than twice that of Liberal Democrats, who register an index of 97,
and Labour voters, who score 75.
Confidence levels among mortgage holders rose 4 points to 87, but still
lingers below the average index level of 90.
The north of England failed to feel some improvement in the economy and
labour market, as its rating fell from 80 to 78.
Scotland recorded the highest rise in confidence from 76 to 84, overtaking
greater London, which fell from 91 to 82.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Securities watchdog fines broking house Pounds 25,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Durlacher &amp; Co, the stockbroking house, has been fined Pounds 25,000 by the
Securities and Futures Authority, for breaches of regulations.
Mr Peter Durlacher, the chairman, has also been fined Pounds 5,000 by the
regulator for securities and futures brokers.
Mr David Tabizel and Mr Tom Scrase, who held senior positions with the house
at various times, have also each been fined Pounds 5,000. Mr Douglas
Braddock and Mr Craig Thomson, registered representatives of the firm, have
been fined Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 5,000.
Mr Braddock has been put on notice that if he is found guilty of misconduct
in any further disciplinary proceedings his registration with the authority
will be terminated.
The men all admitted the SFA charges, which included failure to maintain
sufficient financial resources to comply with SFA requirements and reporting
inaccurate financial statements to the authority.
The firm also admitted to failing to calulate correctly the margin
requirement on a customer's option trading account and failing to review the
portfolio regularly.
The customer incurred a considerable loss from the trading, according to the
SFA. Compensation has been agreed from the firm, Mr Braddock and Mr Thomson.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Shephard snubs selective education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday refused permission
for the Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth to select half
of the entrants to one of its comprehensive schools on the basis of academic
ability.
Her move was taken as a decisive signal that the government was not looking
to reintroduce widespread academic selection. Mr John Patten, her
predecessor, had given strong encouragement to selective schools.
Two other opted-out schools were asked to reconsider proposals to introduce
selection in the light of the decision.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, described the decision as
'very disappointing'. He said: 'By proposing to select a proportion of their
pupils each year the three schools were aiming to increase the range of
educational opportunities they provide.'
A shake-up in the funding of Training and Enterprise Councils, the
business-led bodies responsible for vocational training in England and
Wales, is expected in the Budget today.
It is understood that output-related funding will be introduced for Training
for Work, the scheme for training unemployed adults which the Tecs help
deliver. About 75 per cent of the funding Tecs receive will depend on
candidates' getting a job, a qualification or entering full-time higher
education.
At present about 70 per cent of funding is received regardless of how the
trainee fares.
Tecs are allowed to make a profit of only 7.5 per cent on their revenues.
Under the new scheme they would not make a profit unless they put enough
people into jobs or further education.
The Treasury spends Pounds 762m a year on the scheme but only 22 per cent of
the 120,000 who completed six-month training courses in England and Wales in
1993-94 found work or moved into further education.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Mackay plans libel reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation to simplify court procedures in cases of libel and slander was
promised last night by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern.
The reforms would include provision to avoid the need for a trial if a
defendant was prepared to offer amends and pay damages assessed by a judge,
Lord Mackay said in a Lords written reply.
There would be a new summary procedure under which every defamation claim
would come before a judge 'at an early stage'.
The judge would then assess whether the claim was suitable for summary
disposal or whether it should go for a full trial, with or without a jury.
The judge would have the power, on summary disposal, to award damages up to
a fixed ceiling.
Opponents say that the present system is slow and unwieldy and can lead to
disproportionate awards, especially when celebrities are appellants.
Lord Mackay, who first outlined his intentions in 1992, said: 'I believe
that the new procedure will help the parties to clarify the real issues much
earlier and encourage sensible settlements, as well as providing a fast
track for the disposal of straightforward claims.'
Lord Mackay said he now intended to introduce legislation 'as soon as I have
a suitable opportunity'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Carsberg quits Heseltine's long shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seeds of Sir Bryan Carsberg's decision to quit the Office of Fair
Trading were probably planted in the early months after his departure from
his former role as regulator of telecommunications.
He moved from a role in which he was able to exercise considerable energy
and freedom into a new post circumscribed by the powers of others: most
notably Mr Michael Heseltine at the Department of Trade and Industry.
There is little doubt that he found this frustrating and it may well be that
the scope of his new role as secretary-general of the International
Accounting Standards Committee was the crucial factor.
There is no reason to doubt the sentiments of one of his officials who said
last night that he was leaving to fulfil a new role, not to escape an old
one.
He will not be an easy act to follow and it is significant that the
government felt the need to press him into staying six months. Finding a
replacement of his calibre will be tough.
His last six months will not be easy. He will be busy vetting the bids for
shipbuilders VSEL from GEC and BAe and the proposed merger between the Leeds
and Halifax building societies.
But while his friends and colleagues may have been shocked, others had seen
the writing on the wall. It was evident early this year that inquiry reports
from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission were pointing to a shift in
competition policy.
There is little doubt that this shift, and the frustrations of working in
the shadow of Mr Heseltine, helped bring about his decision.
The monopolies commission was seen to adopt an increasingly pro-industry
approach which even then was seen to threaten a rift with Sir Bryan's
competition watchdog. Competition officials and other advocates of a
stricter policy believe the Department of Trade and Industry and the
commission were relaxing policy to help create strong champions capable of
competing in global markets.
Mr Heseltine had signalled his preference for industrial over competition
policy.
The shift appeared to be a cause for alarm at the OFT which, under Sir
Bryan, had taken a strongly consumerist approach to competition policy. Sir
Bryan gave the impression that he believed markets should be free of any
anti-competitive restraints unless they could be shown to benefit the
consumer.
He has made a number of referrals to the monopolies commission, including
fine fragrances and ice cream. These demonstrated his particular concern
with vertical restraints - those affecting the supply to the marketplace.
But the monopolies commission, under Mr Graeme Odgers, its new chief,
appeared to take the view that vertical restraints and anti-competitive
practices must clearly damage the consumer interest before it will interfere
in an industry. This approach by the commission had put it on a direct
collision course with the OFT.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Builders warn on cuts in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government efforts to raise private finance for railways, roads, schools,
hospitals and other infrastructure should not be used as an excuse to cut
public spending, building industry leaders said yesterday.
The eve-of-Budget warning follows a recent statement by the chancellor that
spending departments would be required to consider whether there was a
private finance alternative before approving public spending projects.
Mr Hugh Try, chairman of the Building Employers ConFederation, the biggest
industry trade association, stressed yesterday that the initiative 'was
intended to supplement, and not replace, existing planned public
expenditure'.
Construction companies are worried that Mr Clarke may announce further cuts
in the road programme to curtail public spending.
They also expect the chancellor to make a feature of the private finance
initiative - possibly announcing approval for some light rail schemes and
more privately financed roads.
Industry leaders say, however, that they will be dismayed if this is
accom-panied by substantial cuts in public investment on construction.
Mr Try said yesterday: 'We shall be monitoring the position carefully to see
that future public sector capital expenditure is maintained at the necessary
levels with additional schemes being brought on stream through the private
finance initiative.'
Mr Clarke told a a Confederation of British Industry conference this month
that he expected private finance to provide 'the main source of growth' for
public investment projects.
He said the requirement on public sector bodies to investigate private
finance alternatives would concentrate 'finite public capital provision on
those areas where, for whatever reason, private finance is not possible'.
The Building Employers Confederation said it was concerned that progress on
the private finance initiative was 'unnecessarily slow.'
More effective procedures needed to be developed by the Treasury and other
government departments for dealing with projects, it said. Banks and
construction companies also needed to be more positive in bringing schemes
forward.
Mr Try said ministers had promised to overcome unnecessary bureaucracy and
constraints. It was also up to 'the construction industry to rise to the
challenge to deal with the risks and deliver value for money and profit from
its investment'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Safety cover curbs spark fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Safety inspectors have been asked to consult Whitehall before taking action
next year against companies with inadequate insurance for deaths and
injuries at work as concern grows about proposed new policy conditions.
Changes planned to employers' liability policies renewed from January 'are
likely to lead to compliance problems' for some employers, the Department of
Employment acknowledged yesterday.
The department has asked to be informed before Health and Safety Executive
inspectors begin action against companies under the the 1969 Employers
Liability Act, which requires employers to have insurance policies worth at
least Pounds 2m per claim.
Companies have had little difficulty meeting the terms of the act because
insurance companies have provided unlimited-cover policies. However
insurance companies faced with rapidly rising claims have decided that in
future employers' liability policies will have a basic claims limit of
Pounds 10m.
This threatens to create problems for corporate groups because new
Department of Employment guidelines suggest that each subsidiary company
will have to have Pounds 2m cover 'in all circumstances'. This may leave
each subsidiary without adequate cover if a large claim were made elsewhere
in the group.
Representatives of the Association of British Insurers are expected to meet
employment department officials on Thursday in an attempt to resolve the
impasse.
The department said yesterday it had been 'consulting informally' with the
Health and Safety Executive as well as the association to gauge the extent
of the problem 'with a view to finding an acceptable solution'.
The executive, which is responsible for policing the act, said about 10
companies a year were prosecuted for failing to display a certificate
showing that they were properly insured.
Meanwhile, the association expressed confidence that new insurance products
would become available to allow companies to buy extra cover, both to meet
the legal requirements and to allow proper cover against large-scale
disasters. It expects the market for 'top-up' liability insurance to be a
specialised sector.
Questions also remain over whether insurance and reinsurance companies will
make sufficient capacity available to meet large companies' demands and over
whether restrictions on the new products will be compatible with the
employment department's guidelines.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke urged to 'repair damage'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's Budget gives the government an opportunity to 'repair some of the
damage' done to people in the West Midlands, Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader
of the Commons, said in the Dudley West by-election campaign yesterday.
But, she added, she had no doubt that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
would fail to do so and accused him of being 'completely out of touch' with
ordinary people.
As she spoke, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was campaigning
on behalf of Mr Graham Postles, the Tory candidate in the by-election called
following the death of John Blackburn, the sitting MP.
In the past five years in the West Midlands alone, she said, there had been
a 10 per cent increase in the number of consultants. Junior doctors' hours
had been cut by 23 per cent and there had been more than Pounds 124m of
capital investment.
Mrs Bottomley said everyone who was on a waiting list in the West Midlands
on July 1 this year would be treated no later than the end of the financial
year.
After that no-one would have to wait more than nine months for any
operation.
The poor have more chance of winning the National Lottery than of gaining
tax cuts in today's Budget, the Low Pay Unit said yesterday.
The campaign group said that the chancellor might raise income tax 'through
the back door' by freezing tax thresholds and allowances. This would draw a
further 300,000 of the lowest-paid into the poverty trap, the group said.
The Low Pay Unit has called for an increase in tax thresholds above the rate
of inflation, a reform of National Insurance contributions, the scrapping of
value added tax on fuel and an increase in child benefit.
Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'The chancellor has
enough revenue to redress the injustice of past tax policy, which has helped
to turn Britain into the most unequal nation in Europe.'
He added: 'Champagne pay rises and windfall tax cuts for the better off,
alongside wage and benefit reductions and tax increases for the poor mean
that inequalities are greater than at any time this century.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Funding of Tecs set for shake-up
</HEADLINE>

A shake-up in the funding of Training and Enterprise Councils, the
business-led bodies responsible for vocational training in England and
Wales, is expected in the Budget today.
It is understood that output-related funding will be introduced for Training
for Work, the scheme for training the adult unemployed which the Tecs help

At present about 70 per cent of funding is received regardless of how the

paid weekly instalments while the individual is on a course.
By law Tecs are allowed to make a profit of only 7.5 per cent on their
revenues. Under the new scheme they would not make a profit unless they put
enough people into jobs or further education.
The Treasury spends Pounds 762m a year on the Training for Work scheme but
just 22 per cent of the 120,000 who completed six-month training courses in
England and Wales in 1993-94 found a job, became self-employed or moved into
further education.
The Tec national executive proposed the output-related funding initiative in
1992 and the scheme has been tested in seven Tecs.
It is hoped the new funding scheme will speed up the progress of Tecs, put
people into jobs faster and get them qualifications more quickly.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Lib Dems 'hit by low brand loyalty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Nelson AGB, the UK's biggest market research group, has found some
bad news for the Liberal Democrats.
A survey for the group, applying the concept of brand loyalty to the main
political parties, found that loyalty to the parties is much lower than for
leading consumer brands.
The bad news for the Liberal Democrats is that like 'most number-three
brands', the party not only has a relatively small number of supporters but
also a relatively low degree of commitment among those supporters.
Labour, according to the survey, has highest proportion of hardcore
supporters. A total of 57 per cent said they were entrenched or unlikely to
back another party. The comparable figures for the Conservatives are 40 per
cent, and only 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.
Most voters who have switched voting intentions are not very committed to
their new party. For example, AGB said, 13 per cent of Tory voters at the
last election would now vote Labour, but just one third said they were
strongly committed to their new party.
Of the 11 per cent of Tory defectors who would now vote Liberal Democrat,
less than one fifth are really committed to their new choice.
But Mr Stephan Buck, an AGB director, said those who were unhappy with the
party they supported at the moment were equally disenchanted by the other
possibilities.
The disenchantment figure was 25 per cent - 'significantly higher than that
record for any branded consumer product and twice as bad as that registered
for the performance of the three US presidential candidates' in 1992.
Mr Buck said that although Conservative support had been severely dented and
Labour's position had strengthened drastically in recent months, the gain
from ex-Tory voters was likely to be 5 percentage points rather than the 12
points to 15 points suggested.
The survey was carried out after the Labour conference last month and was
based on 1,000 adults.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Aftershock of rebels' revolt will rumble on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, only a handful of Tories defied the government last night but
the consequences of the mini-rebellion are likely to rumble on for months,
with serious consequences for the government, as well as the rebels.
Most of the 18 Eurosceptics who last week signed a motion opposing the
European Communities Finance bill fell into line in the face of Mr John
Major's determination to call a general election if the bill was defeated.
But seven hard-core MPs abstained in a crucial vote on a Labour amendment.
They were: Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend E), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr
Tony Marlow (Northampton N), Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton SW), Mr
Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip
Northwood) and Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow).
Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth) abstained on the second reading
division, after voting with the government on the amendment.
Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, immediately wrote to the seven
MPs who abstained on the amendment, withdrawing the Conservative whip -
effectively suspending them from the parliamentary party. It was unclear
whether Mr Carttiss would also be suspended.
Withdrawal of the whip is a serious punishment which bans MPs from taking
part in the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, from sitting on back-bench
Tory committees, or voting on party issues such as the election of a new
leader.
Tory MPs said it was the first mass withdrawal of the whip since the second
world war. The consequences could be serious for the government, which
theoretically loses their support and sees its majority cut from 14 to zero.
In theory, Mr Major will find himself leading a government with a Commons
minority of two if Mr Carttiss is also disciplined, and three if Labour, as
expected, wins the forthcoming by-election in Dudley West. He could even
find himself with a minority of five if Sir Richard Body (Holland with
Boston), carries out a threat to resign the whip in protest at the drift of
government policy.
In practice, Mr Major can rely on the support of the rebels on most issues,
and on the 10 Ulster unionist MPs, all of whom voted with the government in
both divisions last night. However, the technical loss of support will make
the management of the government's parliamentary business more difficult,
and could threaten control of important parliamentary committees.
Most of the rebels will probably try to emulate Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay),
whose suspension from the Tory whip for abstaining in the Maastricht vote
last year, was lifted after he apologised and demonstrated an impeccable
voting record of support for the government.
If they remain in the cold, they could be prevented from standing as
official Conservative candidates at the next general election, effectively
ending their parliamentary careers.
Some rebels, including Mrs Gorman and Mr Wilkinson, say their constituency
organisations have already been warned that they must deselect their rebel
MPs or face disbandment and replacement by more compliant local officials.
The hardliners sat defiantly on the Commons benches through the divisions,
chatting amiably to less courageous Eurosceptics, and making no attempt to
hide their refusal to support the bill.
All are long-time opponents of the EU. Sir Teddy, for example, has
campaigned against British membership for longer than most MPs have been in
parliament. He told the Commons: 'I am not in any way trying to rock the
government. But, quite frankly, I hope the government should accept that
there are some of us who would think it outrageous, impossible and wrong to
vote for extra cash for the EU.'
Mrs Gorman, a right-wing populist who is frequently at odds with senior
ministers, was the only Tory MP to question the cost of the contributions
deal in the immediate aftermath of its negotiation by Mr Major at the 1992
Edinburgh summit.
Mr Budgen may have more problems than most of the rebels because he does not
have the full support of his constituency organisation.
Mr Gill, who has the strong backing of his constituency party, said he was
resigned to losing the whip. 'If the constituency wants to be represented by
a sheep then they can go down to Ludlow livestock market and buy one,' he
said.
Mr Wilkinson likened Mr Major's attitude to Brussels to the appeasement of
Adolf Hitler by Neville Chamberlain. 'The danger is that, like Neville
Chamberlain, Mr Major will be swept away from office - perhaps as a
consequence of his weakness - some two years hence,' he said.
Last night the lobbies of the Commons were echoing with the sound of less
courageous Euro-sceptics explaining away their unwillingness to join the
rebellion. The repentant rebels all had cogent reasons for backing down:
some feared deselection, others accepted the government's promises on EU
fraud, many were keeping their powder dry for the 1996 inter-governmental
conference.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Seven Tories abstain in confidence vote: Clarke in sharp
exchange with Lamont - Labour anti-marketeers ignore official party line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven Conservative backbenchers abstained in the Commons last night when the
government secured a majority of 27 in the confidence vote on the bill
authorising increased payments to the European Union.
A debate dominated by anguished speeches from Tory MPs angered by the
government's strong-arm tactics ended with a Labour amendment, describing
the bill as unacceptable because of inadequate EU action to combat fraud,
being defeated by 330 votes to 303.
The government's majority soared to 285 (329-44) when Labour anti-marketeers
ignored the party line to abstain and forced a vote against the second
reading of the bill.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor, underlined the risk
run by the government in using the confidence weapon.
Highlighting the continuing turmoil on the Tory benches over Europe, he
called for a redefinition of policy before the crucial EU inter-governmental
conferences took place in 1996.
The risk that stemmed from making the bill a confidence issue was that it
might give the impression that the government would want the Commons to be
'a rubber stamp to whatever is agreed in some European town in 1996'.
Mr Lamont reaffirmed his view that Britain should consider all the options,
including withdrawal, if it proved impossible to negotiate a special
relationship with her EU partners. He clashed with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, over the benefits gained by British taxpayers from the money
they provided for the EU.
Mr Clarke, who opened the debate on the bill, said that any Tory MP who
joined with Labour and the Liberal Democrats in voting for the amendment
would be following 'a totally dishonourable course'.
He recalled that only Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Conservative MP for Billericay,
had criticised the financial agreement made by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, at the 1992 Edinburgh summit.
Mr Clarke insisted that the cabinet had not resorted to a political 'ploy'
in deciding to make approval of the bill - which implemented the agreement -
a confidence issue. He said it was obvious that any government which entered
into undertakings in an international agreement and required money to
support it had to seek the authority of the Commons for the additional
expenditure.
If the House did not vote for the money increase the government would have
'lost the confidence of parliament'.
Britain had joined the EU to increase its influence in the world and add
clout to its worldwide policy. He said: 'The Edinburgh deal paid a fair
price for those benefits.'
While Mr Clarke acknowledged that Britain's net contribution to the EU
budget would eventually exceed Pounds 3bn a year, Mr Lamont said that it was
the gross figure which provided the true measure of the cost involved.
Mr Lamont calculated that the gross contribution, minus the rebate
negotiated by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister, was Pounds 6bn
a year, rising to Pounds 8bn in 1996-97.
With support from Tory critics of EU expenditure he said the vast majority
of it was spent on projects which would not be chosen by the UK government.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, taunted Mr Major over his failure to
open the debate.
He said: 'It's rather as if the grand old Duke of York had marched his men
up to the top of the hill, made his excuses and then left.'
Mr Brown accused the government of seeking a vote of confidence on the eve
of the Budget not because the national interest required it but to satisfy
the 'imperatives exercised by the bitter feuding inside the Conservative
party'.
Mr Andrew Smith, in the closing speech from the Opposition front bench,
brushed aside ministerial warnings that if the Labour amendment were to be
approved Britain would not be able to honour the agreement made at the
Edinburgh summit.
A government defeat, he said, would result in a general election and the
return to office of a Labour government which would be able to introduce a
similar bill.
Mr David Heathcoat Amory, the paymaster-general, said Labour MPs were voting
against a bill even though they were not really opposed to it.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Minister gives up Scottish earldom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's chances of securing victory in the vote on the European
Communities finance bill were boosted yesterday after a minister renounced
an earldom which he had recently inherited.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior Scottish Office minister and MP for
Edinburgh West, said that he would not adopt the title Earl of Selkirk
following the death of the 10th earl, his uncle, five days ago.
Lord James could have been barred immediately from the Commons chamber and
been unable to vote in last night's crucial division. Lord James's present
title is a courtesy title meaning he can sit as an MP. He said yesterday
that he would renounce the earldom under the provisions of the Peerage Act
1963. He had already submitted documents of disclaimer.
He said he had been unhappy to take the decision so soon, but added: 'I owe
it as a duty to my constituents whom I wish to continue to serve, and as a
matter of loyalty to the prime minister and to the Conservative party, to
support John Major in the voting lobby tonight.'
Several MPs pointed out yesterday that Lord James's decision was
particularly significant because he had a majority of just 879 over his
Liberal Democrat challenger in Edinburgh West at the last general election.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Klimt painting sold for Pounds 3.74m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, 'Flower Garden' dating from
about 1906, sold for Pounds 3.74m at Christie's last night. Once described
as a 'firework display of summer heat', it was bought by a private investor.
The price was at the lower end of Christie's estimate, but was a record for
a Klimt landscape and set the seal on a successful auction of Impressionist
and modern art which totalled Pounds 15.1m.

The Princess Royal Trust for carers was yesterday awarded British Standard
registration, after giving an assurance that no more than 15 per cent of
donations would be spent on administration.
It is thought to be the first charity to gain BS 5750 registration, given in
recognition of an organisation's competence and efficiency in achieving its
goals. The charity was set up to provide recognition and support for the
estimated 6.8m carers in Britain.

The government has spent more than Pounds 1.6m on consultancy work related
to the privatisation of the Post Office, Mr Tim Eggar, a junior industry
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Eggar said the money had been spent between July 1992, when the
government announced its intention to privatise Parcelforce, and October
this year, when it said privatisation would be postponed.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the money should
have been spent on improving the service.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Lib Dems face 'low brand loyalty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Nelson AGB, the UK's biggest market research group, has found some
bad news for the Liberal Democrats, Raymond Snoddy writes.
A survey for the group, applying the concept of brand loyalty to the main
political parties, found that loyalty to the parties is much lower than for
leading consumer brands.
The bad news for the Liberal Democrats is that like 'most number-three
brands', the party not only has a relatively small number of supporters but
also a relatively low degree of commitment among those supporters.
The survey shows Labour has the highest proportion of hardcore supporters. A
total of 57 per cent said they were entrenched or unlikely to back another
party. The figures are 40 per cent for the Conservatives and 20 per cent for
the Liberal Democrats.
Most voters who have switched voting intentions are not very committed to
the new party. For example 13 per cent of Tory voters at the last election
would now vote Labour, but just one third said they were strongly committed
to the new party. Of the 11 per cent of Tory defectors who would now vote
Liberal Democrat, less than one fifth are really committed to their new
choice.
The survey, among 1,000 adults, was carried out after the Labour conference
last month.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Left refuses to join move against Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory leftwingers yesterday ruled out teaming up with rightwing colleagues to
pave the way for a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership.
The move appeared to reduce the prospects of an attempt this year to topple
the prime minister, and to leave the matter in the hands of the right.
Leading rightwing figures behind attempts to raise by tomorrow the 34
signatures from Tory MPs needed to allow a challenge admitted at the weekend
they were about 10 short of that number.
The prospects of a contest looked to have diminished further when eight Tory
Euro-sceptics defied government whips by abstaining on last night's crucial
votes on the European Union finance bill.
This means they will almost certainly forfeit the party whip and lose the
right to add their names to those calling for a challenge.
One young Euro-sceptic said before last night's vote that the chances of a
leadership contest would be higher paradoxically if only two or three
backbenchers rebelled.
Yesterday those attempting to gather the 34 signatures were still not ruling
out a challenge.
But several Tory Eurosceptics made clear such a move would not have their
support.
One said: 'I wouldn't back a leadership challenge for the simple reason I
don't want Kenneth Clarke (the chancellor) or Michael Heseltine (trade and
industry secretary) as leader.'
Another said: 'I have not been approached and I would have thought I would
have been if talk about a leadership contest was serious.' He added that he
would not back such a move if he was approached.
Questioned on how leftwing dissidents had responded to overtures from the
right seeking their backing for a leadership challenge, one leading
leftwinger said: 'We are not going in with them. We have not given a
positive answer to any overture.'
The leftwinger said he had been approached three times about such an
arrangement but the thought of joining forces with the rightwingers behind
the move was 'anathema' to many on the left of the party.
He suggested that the sort of arrangement proposed could be damaging to Mr
Heseltine, who would be the preferred candidate of many leftwing dissidents
if a challenge by a 'stalking horse' candidate forced Mr Major to step down.
He said: 'The right have got to do it on their own.'
Yesterday's developments came after Mr Heseltine ruled himself out as a
challenger to Mr Major in an early morning radio interview.
Asked if there were no circumstances in which he would stand in a leadership
contest while Mr Major was prime minister, Mr Heseltine replied: 'Yes.'
He added: 'I will have nothing to do with a conspiracy against the prime
minister . . . I have made it clear I am a loyal member of John Major's
cabinet. I expect to help him win the next general election and I have
absolutely resolved in public and in private that I will support the prime
minister through thick and thin.'
Opinion among rightwingers on the likelihood of a challenge was mixed. One
said the prospect was 'nil'. But another said he thought there would be a
challenge.
One former minister said he did not want a contest and 'the people agitating
for one know that well enough so they haven't approached me'. But he said
the atmosphere at Westminster was 'more lively' than it was immediately
before the challenge to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then prime minister,
launched by Sir Anthony Meyer in 1989.
Another Tory Eurosceptic said he had been approached twice but had not given
his support to attempts to force a challenge.

FT  29 NOV 94 / MPs leave sickbeds to support PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the most vivid indication of the government's despair. For the first
time since the cliffhanger divisions over the Maastricht treaty, Tory MPs
hobbled into the Commons from their sickbeds to save Mr John Major's
administration, James Blitz writes.
Under parliamentary rules, MPs cannot vote by proxy. They must walk through
the division lobbies to have their votes counted. And amid continuing
uncertainty about how many Tories would rebel, government whips realised
they would have to bring out every last supporter to pass the European
finance bill.
Mr Julian Critchley, the MP for Aldershot, Hampshire, was wheeled into the
chamber in a wheelchair, grinning at the Tory benches.
Mr Geoffrey Dickens, the MP for Littleborough, braved serious illness to
turn up for the vote. He stunned MPs on all sides by making a typically
boisterous intervention shortly before the division, before engaging in a
lengthy conversation with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Another MP who went to trouble to support the prime minister was Mr Patrick
Nicholls, who resigned as a Tory party vice-chairman last week after calling
the French 'a nation of collaborators'. Mr Nicholls, the MP for Teignbridge,
Devon, arrived wearing a neck brace after postponing an operation. Tory wags
privately claimed that the MP, who did a round of pro-government interviews,
was making amends for his gaffe.
However, there were some absentees. Most notable was Sir Nicholas Fairbairn,
the maverick MP for Perth and Kinross, who is thought to have stayed away
while recovering from a virus.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Howard suffers court defeat on 'miscarriage' appeals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government suffered a further defeat in the courts yesterday when the
High Court ruled that Home Office procedures for dealing with alleged
miscarriages of justice were unfair.
Two judges ruled unfair the ability of the home secretary to deny convicted
criminals access to new evidence considered by him when deciding whether to
refer their cases back to the Court of Appeal.
Lord Justice Simon Brown, laying down new guidelines for the handling of
cases of alleged miscarriage of justice, said such evidence should be
disclosed to those seeking to have their convictions overturned before the
home secretary reached his decision.
Applicants had to have sufficient access to evidence to present their cases
properly. He said: 'Only the highest standards of fairness will suffice.'
The case that prompted yesterday's ruling was brought by six men, including
three convicted of the killing of newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater in 1978.
The ruling was welcomed by Justice, the civil liberties organisation. It
said: 'It is an extremely important decision which goes to the very heart of
how criminal cases work. It will affect every case before the home secretary
and shows he must be more flexible and broader in his approach.'
The ruling marks the third significant defeat for the government in the
courts in as many weeks. It follows a Court of Appeal ruling that the home
secretary abused his powers by introducing a compensation scheme for victims
of violent crime without consulting parliament, and a High Court ruling that
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, unlawfully approved aid for the Pergau
dam project.
Until yesterday convicted criminals applying for their cases to be
reconsidered by the Court of Appeal were unable to see experts' reports and
other documents considered by the home secretary.
Applicants have usually been shown only a summary of this evidence after the
minister had reached his decision. Lord Justice Brown, sitting with Mr
Justice Buckley, said these arrangements were 'significantly too closed'.
The judges rejected the argument of Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, that
present procedures were fair and that increased disclosure would make the
process unmanageable and prone to delays.
They ruled that disclosure of evidence before the home secretary had reached
his decision was required in the interests of fairness and informed
decision-making. Without prior disclosure, an adverse decision might not be
right and would not be fair.
Lord Justice Brown said: 'I have no doubt that fairness requires not merely
prior disclosure, but a substantial increase in the level of disclosure
made.'
The judges ruled that the handling of the Bridgewater case by successive
home secretaries had been 'plainly most unsatisfactory'.
The other cases where disclosure was ordered involved Mr Sammy Davis, who
served a six-year sentence for rape; Mr Jeremy Bamber, convicted of the
murders of his adoptive parents, sister and her two children; and Mr Paul
Malone, who was convicted of four armed robberies.
The home secretary was yesterday considering whether to appeal against the
ruling.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Eurosceptics bend to finance bill whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lobbies of the House of Commons were echoing last night to the sound of
Conservative Eurosceptics explaining away the near-collapse of a threatened
backbench rebellion against the European Communities Finance bill.
The repentant rebels all had cogent reasons for backing down: some feared
deselection; others accepted the government's promises on EU fraud; many
were keeping their powder dry for the 1996 inter-governmental conference.
But the result was the same: with the exception of a handful of die-hards,
the rebels' courage failed in the face of Mr John Major's decision to make
the bill an issue of confidence.
It was the culmination of a government operation that began last week with
the threat of a general election if the bill was defeated or substantially
amended.
Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, backed that with a clear threat that any
rebels either voting against the government or abstaining would lose the
Conservative whip - a which equals suspension from the parliamentary party.
This is a serious punishment which bans MPs from taking part in the 1922
committee of Tory backbenchers, from sitting on backbench Tory committees,
or voting on party issues such as the election of a new leader.
The lengths to which the government was prepared to go to avoid defeat
became clear on Friday, when leading rebels started to complain that they
had been threatened with deselection if they failed to support the bill.
Conservative central office says constituency organisations were merely
reminded that party rules do not allow MPs who have lost the whip to be
adopted as candidates at a subsequent election.
Some of the rebels saw it differently. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay,
said her constituency chairman had been warned that the local party
organisation would be closed down and replaced unless she were dumped.
Mr Ryder's troops were still at it as MPs prepared to vote, pointing out to
the most hardline Eurosceptics that there was little point in rebelling
because the government was no longer in danger of defeat.
But the collapse of the rebellion became clear long before the vote when
only a handful of MPs turned up for a meeting of the rightwing Fresh Start
group intended to make a final decision on tactics.
In the end the rebel hardcore was reduced to half a dozen MPs, including Mrs
Gorman, Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip, Northwood) and Sir Richard Body (Holland
with Boston), a veteran MP who last year threatened to resign and cause a
by-election after falling out with Mr Major.
Mr Christopher Gill said he was resigned to losing the party whip, but had
the backing of his Ludlow constituency. 'If the constituency wants to be
represented by a sheep then they can go down to Ludlow livestock market and
buy one,' he said.
Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North), said the vote was 'concerned with
whether we want to waste any more money in Europe or not'.
The rebellion might have been a lot bigger. A further 12 Tory backbenchers
joined the six hardliners last week in signing an amendment opposing the
bill. The amendment was not called by the Speaker.
They 12 were: Mr Bill Cash (Stafford); Sir George Gardiner (Reigate); Mr
Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horncastle); Mr Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton SW); Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham); Mr John Carlisle (Luton N);
Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield); Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton); Mr
Vivian Bendall (Ilford N); Mr Bill Walker (Tayside N); Mr Richard Shepherd
(Aldridge Brownhills) and Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay).

FT  29 NOV 94 / Minister renounces his earldom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's chances of securing victory in the vote on the European
Communities finance bill were boosted yesterday after a minister renounced
an earldom which he had recently inherited.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior Scottish Office minister and MP for
Edinburgh West, announced that he would not adopt the title Earl of Selkirk
following the death of the 10th earl, his uncle, five days ago.
Lord James could have been barred immediately from the Commons chamber and
unable to vote in last night's crucial division.
Lord James's present title is a courtesy title and he can therefore sit as
an MP.
He said yesterday that he would renounce the earldom under the provisions of
the Peerage Act 1963. He had already submitted documents of disclaimer.
He said he had been unhappy to take the decision so soon, but added: 'I owe
it as a duty to my constituents whom I wish to continue to serve, and as a
matter of loyalty to the prime minister and to the Conservative party, to
support John Major in the voting lobby tonight.'
He had discussed the matter with Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, before making up his mind.
Mr Lang said last night: 'Lord James's decision is greatly to his credit. It
reflects his strong commitment to the welfare of his constituents.'
The Peerage Act was used by Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP, to renounce the
title Viscount Stansgate in 1963. Mr Quintin Hogg, the former Lord
Chancellor, now Lord Hailsham; and Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the former prime
minister, now Baron Home of the Hirsel, also renounced peerages in order to
sit in the Commons.
Several MPs pointed out yesterday that Lord James's decision was
particularly significant because he had a majority of just 879 in Edinburgh
West at the last general election.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke clashes with Lamont over EU cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, clashed with his predecessor Mr Norman
Lamont in the Commons last night. The exchange came as the government
reaffirmed that approval for the bill authorising increased payments to the
European Union was a confidence issue.
The chancellor's claim that the undoubted benefits flowing from membership,
including the single market, justified a bigger British contribution to the
European budget was challenged by Mr Lamont.
While making it clear that he would not join any rebellion against the bill,
Mr Lamont argued that the continuing divisions among Conservative MPs over
Europe warranted a policy reassessment. He again contended that this should
include 'even withdrawal' from the EU, but reaffirmed his support for the
deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, at the Edinburgh
European Community summit in 1992.
Mr Clarke, who opened the debate on the bill authorising the additional
expenditure, told Tory critics and opposition MPs that by voting against it
after welcoming the Edinburgh agreement they would be following 'a totally
dishonourable course'.
He insisted that the cabinet had not resorted to a political 'ploy' in
deciding to make approval of the bill a confidence issue.
Mr Lamont said it was obvious that any government which entered into
undertakings in an international agreement and required money to support it
had to seek the authority of the Commons for the additional expenditure.
If the House did not vote the money the government would have 'lost the
confidence of parliament'.
Mr Clarke recalled that only Mrs Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for
Billericay, one of the leading Eurosceptics, had criticised the Edinburgh
agreement when it was announced.
He stressed that it was a British initiative which had resulted in the
European Court of Auditors being given increased powers to curb fraud in the
EU.
Mr Clarke bluntly rejected demands by Tory critics of the bill that no
additional funds should be provided to the EU until the government was
satisfied about the effectiveness of new procedures for dealing with fraud.
He told Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for Tayside North, who highlighted
Tory concern over fraud: 'That really will not do.'
Mr Clarke said it was normal procedure for the government to seek
parliamentary approval for increased expenditure, and for Conservative MPs
to support the prime minister whom they had congratulated when the
commitment was announced.
Britain had joined the EU to increase its influence in the world and add
clout to its worldwide policy.
He said: 'The Edinburgh deal paid a fair price for those benefits.' He
reminded MPs that they had been made aware that Britain's net contribution
to the EU budget would eventually exceed Pounds 3bn a year.
Mr Lamont maintained that it was the gross and not the net cost which
provided the true measure of the cost of Britain's EU membership.
He calculated that the gross contribution, minus the rebate negotiated by
Baroness Thatcher when prime minister, was Pounds 6bn a year, rising to
Pounds 8bn in 1996-97.
Mr Lamont said the vast majority of EU expenditure was devoted to projects
which would not be chosen by the UK government. He believed Britain needed
to redefine its relationship with the EU. If it was not possible to
negotiate effective safeguards against further moves towards federalism, the
option of withdrawal should be considered.
Mr Lamont warned that by making the bill an issue of confidence the
impression might be given that the government expected MPs to 'rubber stamp'
whatever was agreed at the intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, taunted Mr Major over his failure to
open the debate. He said: 'It's rather as if the grand old Duke of York had
marched his men up to the top of the hill, made his excuses and then left.'
Mr Brown accused the government of seeking a vote of confidence on the eve
of the Budget not because the national interest required it but to satisfy
the 'imperatives exercised by the bitter feuding inside the Conservative
party'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Tube to unveil Heathrow plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground will today unveil plans for a Pounds 70m 1 1/4 -mile
extension of the Piccadilly Line to the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow
Airport.
If London Underground's plans are approved work could start in 1997 and the
new extension and station would become operational in 2002, when Terminal 5
is due to open.
The Underground is applying to Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, for
permission to extend the line under the Transport and Works Act - avoiding
the need for a parliamentary bill.
Objectors have seven weeks to register their concerns with the Department of
Transport. These will then be considered by London Underground and Heathrow
Airport. A public inquiry into Terminal 5 is expected to start in May.
Work will involve an extension west of the existing station for Heathrow
terminals 1, 2 and 3. All trains will serve that station with some running
on to Terminal 4 and some to Terminal 5. About 30m air passengers are
expected to use Terminal 5 each year.
Work on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express rail link between Heathrow and
Paddington Station was stopped after a tunnel collapse last month.

The Indian inflation rate is falling, according to data published this week
showing that the annual rate of increase of wholesale prices in the week
ending November 12 was 8.89 per cent. The inflation rate is well below its
recent peak of 13.7 per cent in 1991-92, when Prime Minister PV Narasimha
Rao, launched his economic reforms. It is also comfortably below a recent
high of more than 11 per cent in May this year, when the rate of increase
was pushed up by rises in prices of government-controlled commodities
including fertilisers. A good monsoon, the seventh in succession, has helped
limit price increases.

union involved - the Transport Workers Union - was seeking to avoid
'enterprise-bargaining', and that its right to immunity from legal action
should be withdrawn. The Labor government yesterday said it supported this.

A breakthrough in the deadlock over who should head the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, the industrial world's economic
think-tank, was in the balance yesterday after a meeting of OECD ambassadors
was adjourned for 24 hours. Hopes for a new secretary-general were raised
last week when Washington grudgingly agreed to a compromise deal. But
diplomats said a Franco-Canadian consensus eluded the 25 nations at their
two-hour meeting. They agreed to meet again today when they will have to
come up with a solution because the mandate of a stand-in head expires the
next day. Under the proposed compromise, Frenchman Jean-Claude Paye - whose
second five-year term ended in September - would be reappointed for 18
months and Canada's Donald Johnston would then take a full five-year tenure.
Several countries, particularly Japan, were said to be opposed to this.

FT  29 NOV 94 / KMT makes sure the party is not over: Taiwan's Nationalists
seek to continue enjoying fruits of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's long-ruling Nationalist party, the Kuomintang, fearing that the
opposition Democratic Progressive party may try to nationalise its vast
business empire should it come to power, is consolidating its assets,
converting them into more liquid form and investing profits offshore.
Accustomed to ruling by fist and fiat, the 100-year-old KMT has turned to
its extensive business interests to keep its grip on power through the
ballot box.
So far the strategy, while costly, appears to have worked. The KMT is
believed to have an edge over the opposition in elections to be held on
Saturday. However, the party, which has seen its mandate slip perilously
since the lifting of martial law in 1987, is scrambling to protect its
riches.
It is coming under increasing pressure to disclose the true extent and
origins of its assets. DPP legislators have drafted a law governing the
activities of political parties, but the KMT has obstructed attempts to put
the draft on the parliamentary agenda.
'There are a lot of unanswered questions about how the party became so rich
and how it started all its businesses,' says Professor Lu Ya-li, a political
scientist at National Taiwan University. 'The party's main concerns right
now are to make all the companies private so people will never know how rich
the KMT really is, and to move assets offshore, both for economic and
political reasons.'
The party is regarded as one of the island's biggest and most diverse
industrial conglomerates. Its seven holding companies have investments in
more than 100 enterprises spanning cement, electronics, finance,
petrochemicals, telecommunications, construction and trade. The total
registered assets of those businesses, of which perhaps a dozen are listed,
stood at TDollars 950bn (Pounds 23bn) and net assets at TDollars 240bn at
the end of 1992, the most recent figures available.
'The KMT has managed to gain control of a large part of Taiwan's economy and
accumulate a huge amount of party enterprises and assets, and through these
can also exert control over domestic politics,' says Prof Chen Shih-meng, an
economist at National Taiwan University and co-author of Dismantling
Party-state Capitalism, published in 1991. 'I doubt very much that President
Lee Teng-hui is trying to build a true democracy in Taiwan as long as he
wants to hold on to the party's wealth.'
In the last year, the party has begun to invest offshore, mainly across
south-east Asia where it ranks among the biggest foreign investors in
Vietnam and Indonesia. It has invested or considered investing in the US,
Japan, Hong Kong, Burma, Russia, Paraguay and even China, though through
circuitous channels as it officially bans investments in the Chinese
mainland.
As democracy threatens to erode the longstanding privileges of KMT
enterprises, the party's new policy is to list as many of its companies as
possible on the stock exchange. Last week Fuh-Hwa Securities Finance, whose
monopoly on finance for margin share trading is being broken down by
deregulation and is one of the party's biggest earners, went public.
According to a book just published by the party, The Evolution and Ideals of
the Kuomintang of China, the purpose behind listing KMT companies is 'so
that all the people may share in their success'.
Critics say it is so that the KMT can reap while they are still profitable.
'Through listing, the party will be able to cash in assets very quickly and
transfer them overseas if necessary,' says Prof Chang Ching-hsi, also an
economist and the other author of Dismantling Party-state Capitalism. 'That
way the party can also use its assets more flexibly before elections,' he
added in a reference to alleged vote-buying.
This weekend voters will for the first time elect mayors for Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the island's two largest cities, and a provincial governor in
what are the most important polls to date in Taiwan's political reform.
Municipal councils and a provincial assembly will also be elected.
A DPP victory would not pose an immediate threat to the KMT's empire.
Nonetheless a KMT loss would tilt the balance in favour of the opposition in
crucial parliamentary elections late next year and first ever presidential
elections slated for early 1996.
Critics say that the KMT built its empire through its privileged position.
The party bought land from the government at a fraction of market value,
enjoyed monopoly market positions in certain sectors and preferential access
to government contracts, they say.
KMT officials do not deny such charges but counter that party businesses
have contributed greatly to Taiwan's economic and cultural development and
moreover many of them are marginally profitable or even loss-making.
The advent of democracy has resulted in ever-tighter links among party
members, businessmen and politicians. 'Party discipline is now a major
problem for the KMT,' says Prof Lu. 'In the old days, party leaders could
impose their will on the rank and file but now they must use persuasion.
This has resulted in trading of favours and widespread corruption.'
In addition, says Prof Chen, there are many enterprises that are only
partially owned by the KMT 'but in fact are completely controlled by the
party, not in legal but in practical terms'.
Once transformation of its business empire is complete, the KMT should be
well positioned to withstand the rigours of democracy. Analysts estimate its
annual expenditures at Dollars 200m compared with Dollars 2m for the DPP.
The KMT's ability to out-finance the opposition in future elections looks
likely to be assured for some time.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Economic overheating approaches the danger level

<TEXT>
Taiwan may be experiencing too much of a good thing as its economy gains
speed, the country's planning ministry warned yesterday. The economy showed
signs of overheating in October for the second consecutive month, the
cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development said.
The council's coloured signal system for measuring economic health flashed a
'yellow-red light', indicating fast growth but danger that the economy may
be overheating. Until September, a yellow-red signal had not been used since
August 1989. A green light, meaning steady growth, was posted for nine
consecutive months before September.
An October business confidence survey showed 65 per cent of manufacturers
taking part believed the economic climate would remain stable for the next
three months, unchanged from a month earlier. Businessmen who felt the
economy would improve in the next three months fell from 23 to 21 per cent;
those expecting it to worsen climbed from 12 to 14 per cent.
Last week the government's central statistics office said growth in gross
national product reached 6.08 per cent in the third quarter of this year, up
from 5.62 per cent in the second quarter. The forecast for the fourth
quarter was raised to 6.9 per cent from 6.44 per cent, based on improved
export performance and strong domestic investment.
The statistics office forecast GNP growth would reach 6.1 per cent in 1994
and 6.52 per cent in 1995. In 1993 Taiwan's GNP rose 6.02 per cent.
Taiwan's negotiators blamed counterparts from their arch-rival China
yesterday for failure of six days of bilateral talks in the eastern Chinese
city of Nanjing, Reuter adds.
Returning to Taipei's international airport, Mr Shi Hwei-you, Taiwan's chief
negotiator, said the Chinese side had raised new questions that prevented
final agreements being signed. 'Both sides in principle agreed on the
structure and resolutions for an agreement,' said Mr Shi, deputy
secretary-general of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).
'But (China's) Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
raised many new questions and that led to the failure of signing a final
agreement,' the semi-official Central News Agency quoted Mr Shi as saying.

North Korea has halted its nuclear programme and stopped building two
nuclear reactors in accordance with its landmark accord with the US, the
United Nations atomic safeguards agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Vienna. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said inspectors who
arrived in North Korea last week had visited nuclear sites in the communist
state and confirmed all work had come to a halt.
'The IAEA team visited the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and Taechon and
confirmed that these facilities were not in operation and that construction
work had stopped,' the IAEA said in a statement.
An IAEA team held a series of negotiations with North Korean officials aimed
at setting out an inspections framework to ensure Pyongyang was complying
with a nuclear agreement signed with Washington in Geneva last month. The
statement said some verification measures, which were understood to include
inspections, had already been carried out.
North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for western
help and cash to build light-water reactors which produce less of the
plutonium that can be used to make nuclear arms. The US and its allies
suspected that North Korea had syphoned off nuclear fuel from its one
working reactor in Yongbyon to try to develop an atomic bomb.
Pressure from the west and the IAEA earlier this year provoked one of the
most serious military standoffs on the Korean peninsula since the 1950-53
Korean war. The US-North Korean accord defused the crisis.
Under the deal, the US pledged to set up an international consortium with
Japan and South Korea to help pay for the estimated Dollars 4bn operation.

</DATELINE>

Support for New Zealand's Labour party has improved, with opinion polls
timed to coincide with its annual conference at the weekend showing it with
25 points against the National government's 42, Terry Hall reports from
Wellington.
The change in Labour's fortunes has been dramatic: less than three months
ago it came in fifth place in a a by-election in the South Island Selwyn
constituency, a seat it nearly won in last year's general elections.
The polls suggests that the New Zealand political scene is set to return to
its traditional dominance by its two old-established parties.
Labour's resurrection has been partly due to hard work by Ms Helen Clark,
the party leader in distancing it from the right-wing policies it followed
in government between 1984 and 1990 that caused its eventual landslide
defeat. Labour's unity has been helped by defections of both left- and
right-wing critics to other parties.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Thai police bend rule of law: A catalogue of crime has
stirred uneasy feelings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody paid much attention when they saw a 20-year-old policeman demanding
cash from passing motorists in central Bangkok the other day; Thai
policemen, unmistakable in their too-tight brown uniforms, routinely engage
in roadside extortion.
What gave Mr Thammarong Sricharoen away as an impostor and led to his arrest
was not his blatant money-grabbing but an incorrect salute to a passing
police officer with his left hand instead of his right. He had stolen the
uniform.
Incidents such as this (Mr Thammarong's mistake was explained at a news
conference by a Thai police chief) have for years been cheerfully accepted
by the majority of Thais. They take it for granted their 170,000-strong
police force is corrupt. But a lengthening list of recent murders and other
tragedies in which police were implicated has aroused uneasy feelings among
even the most cynical Thais, fuelling a debate about the pernicious effects
of corruption.
Earlier this year, seven Thai policemen were charged with involvement in the
murder of at least nine visitors from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China;
the victims were robbed and shot. In July, a 15-year-old prostitute
committed suicide by drinking poison in a police station in the southern
town of Hat Yai; she had escaped from a brothel and gone to the police
station to seek help, but the police sent her away.
All prostitution is illegal in Thailand, and the government is waging a
campaign against child prostitution. But underpaid policemen earn
substantial sums in 'protection money' from brothel-owners for turning a
blind eye, and in some cases run brothels themselves. Even if the
credibility of the Thai police had been able to survive such scandals, it
would surely have been destroyed by recent developments in the case of the
stolen Saudi gems.
In 1989 a Thai worker in Saudi Arabia stole Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.5m) worth
of jewellery from the palace of a Saudi prince. He was arrested after his
return to Thailand and the recovered items were proudly displayed by the
police.
Triumph quickly became farce when the haul was sent back to Saudi Arabia,
because most of the returned jewels turned out to be fakes copied from the
originals. A police general's wife was seen, and photographed, wearing what
appeared to be one of the stolen necklaces, although she and her husband
later insisted this too was a fake.
At first the saga was seen in Thailand as something of a joke, since the
Saudis were not popular either as employers in their own country or as
visitors to Thailand. But the mood has now changed. Saudi Arabia has stopped
granting visas to Thai migrant workers and forbidden its own citizens to go
to Thailand on holiday, depriving Thailand of millions of dollars a year in
income.
Several people connected to the case have meanwhile been murdered in
Thailand. The two most recent victims were the wife and child of a jeweller
who was an important witness in the case. They were bludgeoned to death, but
the police forensic department initially announced, to cries of derision,
that they had died in a car accident.
'The law enforcement branch has broken its last bond with the people,' wrote
Mr Suthichai Yoon, columnist and editor-in-chief of The Nation newspaper.
The embarrassed Thai government finally acted: two police generals have been
charged in connection with the killing of the jeweller's family, and dozens
of other police officers are under investigation.
Mr Mohammed Said Khoja, the outspoken Saudi charge d'affaires in Bangkok,
remains understandably sceptical. He arrived in 1990 on what he thought
would be a three-month mission to resolve the affair and is now in his fifth
year in Thailand.
'I'm glad that the public in Thailand are starting to have some sympathy,'
he said in an interview, but added: 'Anything can happen in Thailand. Today
they arrest the generals; tomorrow they will say there is no evidence. The
big policemen here have a better life than the prime minister himself.'
Many Thai policemen are so involved in crime, rather than crime prevention,
and so dedicated to protecting the rich and powerful, rather than enforcing
the law impartially, that it will be hard for any government to make them
change their ways.
A recent study by Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University found that some
officers pay bribes of up to Baht5m (Pounds 125,000) to their superiors to
be promoted to lucrative posts enjoying a steady flow of extorted money - in
areas with plenty of brothels, for example.
But the new wave of popular outrage at the latest police crimes may start to
make life easier for the few senior police officers regarded as honest.
Maj-Gen Seri Temiyavej, one such crusader, recently arrested one of
Thailand's best-known 'godfathers', in connection with an allegedly illegal
land deal near the coastal resort of Pattaya.
Even if such prosecutions succeed, cleaning up the police force is likely to
be a painfully slow process.
'What we've been trying to do is to establish the rule of law,' says Mr
Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, 'I think the situation will improve as a
result of the government's determination, but in the short term it may not
be so easy to perceive.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / EU lifts arms embargo against Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union lifted its eight-year arms embargo on Syria last night
following a thawing of relations, a move criticised by Mr Shimon Peres,
Israel's foreign minister, as a mistake unless Damascus was willing to
negotiate peace with Israel.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told reporters the decision
had been nodded through at the General Affairs Council.
The embargo was put in place in 1986 after allegations of Syrian involvement
in a thwarted attempt to smuggle explosives onto an Israeli El Al airliner
at London's Heathrow airport.
Other sanctions, such as bans on low-level diplomatic meetings were
gradually lifted between 1987 and 1990, when Syria sided with the west in
the Gulf War.
'Before the Syrians move, why lift. . . the embargo? Let them move and maybe
then there won't be a need for an arms embargo?' Mr Peres told reporters. 'I
don't know why the Syrians were so shy. If they want to have peace, why hide
away?'
At the same time, Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation made some progress towards ironing out their
differences over the Palestinian peace process.
Both men, visiting Brussels on the eve of an international donor conference
intended to speed up aid flows to the Palestinian authority in Gaza and
Jericho, emphasised that recent acts of violence in the Middle East would
not be allowed to scupper progress made so far. 'We will make this peace
process a success,' said Mr Peres. 'We will not stop en route.'
There were few details on the talks. Neither side was particularly
forthcoming on the issues dividing them, including Israeli delays in
withdrawing from the West Bank and its action in sealing off Israel to
Palestinian workers resident in Gaza or the delays in holding elections in
the Palestinian territories.
Referring to the recent bloody clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and
both Palestinian police and his own Fatah faction, Mr Arafat said: 'I insist
on very rapid elections to see who has the support of the people; Hamas or
Fatah?'
'In my opinion the Israelis understand our need for a quick election, but at
the same time we have to understand their necessity for security which is
one of their main items,' said Mr Arafat.
He said that the most important thing for the Palestinians was that all
donors kept their promises, pointing out that the Palestinians had so far
only received a fraction of the total promised.
A senior British official said Mr Hurd had 'floated some ideas' on taking
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations forward. 'There is a real need on all sides
to make clear what the tangible benefits of the peace process are,' said the
UK official.
A successful outcome to the Palestine donors conference today and tomorrow
is regarded as a vital first step in this direction.

Support for New Zealand's Labour party has improved with opinion polls timed

points against the National government's 42.
The change in Labour's fortunes has been dramatic: less than three months
ago it came in fifth place in a a by-election in the South Island Selwyn

The polls suggests that the New Zealand political scene is set to return to

Labour's resurrection has been partly due to hard work by Ms Helen Clark,
the party leader in distancing it from the right wing policies that it
followed in government between 1984 and 1990 that caused its eventual
landslide defeat. Labour's unity has been helped by the departure of both
left and wing ring critics to join other parties.
It recently unveiled populist economic policy featuring higher taxes for the
well off, bigger family support payments, industry planning and a venture
capital fund.
However it has also benefited handsomely from the surprise decision of Jim
Anderton to step down as leader of the Alliance party, an unusual grouping
of left and centre parties.
A charismatic former president of the Labour party, Mr Anderton broke away
to form his own left wing party in 1988. This was promptly joined by some
minor political groups favouring such disparate policies as monetary reform
and Maori rights and also the Green movement.
Mr Anderton's consistent rating as preferred prime minister helped the
Alliance become the country's second top polling party. But his resignation
saw the Alliance support drop by 20 per cent to 23 points, its lowest level
this year.
The Alliance is now led by an Ms Sandra Lee, who is considered too
inexperienced to be able to revive its fortunes.
The fourth political party now represented in parliament, New Zealand First,
led by Maori MP Winston Peters, has slumped badly in public support
following a public spat over its funding.
However, the advent of a new electoral system, which will reduce the number
of electorate seats from 99 to 66, is causing concern among sitting MPs.
They believe the reduced number of seats means fewer of them can represent
the existing main parties, and many are known to be considering joining or
forming new parties, which they calculate will prosper under proportional
representation.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Aborigine land fund setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Senate, the federal parliament's upper house, yesterday
referred the government's contentious Aboriginal land fund legislation to a
select committee for further examination.
The move came despite warnings from Senator Gareth Evans, the government's
Senate leader, that this could trigger a 'double dissolution', that is, a
dissolution of both houses, necessitating fresh elections.
The legislation proposes to establish a ADollars 1.4bn (Pounds 680m) land
fund by 2004, through a series of government payments over the next 10
years. By using the money to make land purchases, the fund would aim to help
dispossessed Aborigines who are unlikely to benefit from last year's Native
Title legislation.
The proposed structure of the land fund and the relatively low level of
financing have been criticised by some Aboriginal groups. In recent weeks,
the Senate, where the government does not have a majority, has made a large
number of amendments to the bill. But the government refused to accept these
and returned the legislation to the Senate.
Yesterday, Senator Evans, Australia's foreign minister, warned the
government would treat a select committee reference 'as a failure to pass
this legislation within the meaning of the Constitution, Section 57'. This
states that if legislation passed by the House of Representatives is
rejected or obstructed by the Senate twice within certain time limits,
Australia's governor general may dissolve both houses simultaneously.
The notion that the government will seek to call an early election, before
the economic outlook clouds, has circulated for some months, and the land
fund hiatus could provide an excuse. But, in issuing his warning, Senator
Evans emphasised yesterday that the government was not looking for an
'artificial trigger'.
Meanwhile, Senator Brian Harradine, an independent whose vote was crucial to
securing the committee referral, pointed out that a double dissolution
trigger was already in place because of the Senate's decision to reject
certain immigration-related legislation.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Fears grow that EU's weapon may misfire -
Some countries see trade proposal turning into unguided missile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Section 301 trade legislation, which calls on other countries to open
their markets or face the threat of retaliation, has long inspired fear and
loathing in critics around the world.
Few have spoken out more loudly than Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade
commissioner, who has accused Washington of using 'bilateral bully' tactics
to extract trade concessions by force.
But now Sir Leon has stirred up controversy by proposing an EU trade measure
which, according to its opponents and supporters, could serve many of the
same purposes as Section 301 actions.
At issue is the Commission's plan for a so-called illicit practices
regulation. Submitted to the Council of Ministers recently as part of the
Uruguay Round implementing legislation, it aims to streamline existing EU
procedures for tackling other countries' trade barriers.
Sir Leon insists the regulation differs from Section 301 because it would be
used only to hold other countries to agreed international rules, not to pass
unilateral judgments on their trade policies.
His reassurances have not, however, convinced everyone. 'The more Brussels
tries to explain why the regulation is not like Section 301, the more
similar it sounds,' says a senior official of one of Asia's most successful
exporting economies.
The proposal has divided EU members. France and most Mediterranean
governments support it, saying the EU needs to beef up its negotiating
muscle to compensate for cuts in its trade barriers required by the Uruguay
Round.
'When your market defences are coming down, it makes sense to switch to the
attack,' says an official of the Patronat, the French employers'
organisation. 'The regulation is a can opener. It is not Section 301, but is
in the same spirit.'
Such thinking troubles more liberal EU governments. Britain, Denmark,
Germany and the Netherlands fear that the proposal could unleash an unguided
missile which might threaten the authority of the new World Trade
Organisation.
The proposal is backed by Unice, the European industry federation. However,
the BDI, the German employers' body, says it supported the Unice line only
out of European solidarity, and has deep reservations about the planned
regulation. 'We think this is a potentially dangerous measure which could go
off in the wrong direction,' says a BDI official.
Formally, the proposal is a revision of the EU's 'new commercial
instrument', which permits action against trade practices not already banned
by Community rules. Though in existence since 1984, it has has been little
used.
The new regulation would make it more accessible by entitling individual
companies - not just EU governments and industry bodies, as at present - to
institute complaints against other countries' trade barriers. The complaints
would be dealt with by a new committee of member states and the Commission,
and be chaired by the latter.
Commission officials say this 'third track' would give European exporters
the right to the same prompt investigations as EU anti-dumping procedures
offer importers which face low-priced foreign competition.
Brussels stresses that the proposal addresses trade practices 'incompatible
with international law' and would be used primarily to identify cases for
adjudication by WTO disputes panels. However, they do not exclude using it
against countries outside the WTO, and in areas where WTO rules are lacking
or incomplete. 'A lot of promises were made in the Uruguay Round trade talks
which have not been delivered on,' says an adviser to Sir Leon.
EU government critics, however, are worried by several aspects of the
proposed regulation, which they say is not essential to implementation of
the Uruguay Round. Their main concerns are:
That its wording is too vague and could lead to indiscriminate attacks on
any trade practices used by other WTO members, rather than only those which
are actionable under WTO rules. For instance, French industry thinks the
regulation should be used against countries which permit anti-competitive
practices, such as cartels, in their home markets. These currently lie
outside the WTO's jurisdiction.
That the procedures envisaged could give the Commission too much scope for
action, without consulting closely enough with the Article 113 committee,
the body in which the Commission and EU governments co-ordinate external
trade policy.
That there are uncertainties about how the regulation would fit with a
recent European Court ruling which says the Commission and the Council have
'mixed competence' over trade in services.
That it is unclear what form of actions, other than reference to a WTO
disputes panel, the EU might take against allegedly illicit practices, and
whether such actions might include unilateral retaliation.
Commission officials insist that, unlike Section 301, the proposal does not
provide for unilateral sanctions and say they would not resort to them.
However, French officials say the regulation's exact application in this and
other areas is still under debate.
Some observers suspect the Commission may have deliberately left details of
the proposal unclear. They say that, for all Sir Leon Brittan's criticisms
of aggressive US trade tactics, his alternative approach of 'quiet
diplomacy' towards Japan has produced little.
As a consequence, he faces growing pressure from European industry to adopt
stronger market-opening measures. In its present form, the proposal looks
sufficiently tough to satisfy these demands, without committing the
Commission to taking specific actions.
Even the regulation's liberal-minded opponents think Sir Leon would not
abuse it. But that is not their main concern. Says one: 'The problem is that
he will not have the job forever, and a more protectionist successor might
have fewer scruples.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China spells out views on Gatt membership
timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China said yesterday that it would offer no new concessions in its
eight-year-long negotiations to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade if the talks were not concluded by the end of the year. However,
Beijing said it would continue to participate in negotiations after the
deadline until its Gatt status was resumed, if it were asked to do so by the
secretariat of Gatt or the World Trade Organisation, its successor.
The message was conveyed to Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, by
Mr Long Yong-tu, Beijing's chief negotiator, who has led a Chinese
delegation to Geneva to take part in further membership talks.
Western diplomats said the statement appeared to be a face-saving
acknowledgement that it may be impossible to reach an agreement on WTO entry
terms by the end of the year, and that China may have no option but to
accept an extension. They pointed out that Beijing appeared to have softened
its previous line by dropping suggestions that it would walk away from the
talks if the year-end deadline was not met.
They also said China's insistence that it would not make fresh offers or
seek bilateral negotiations with Gatt members after the end of this year
need not prevent it from responding to demands by other countries that it
make concessions.
'To the extent that it is not useful to set artificial deadlines, then so
much the better,' said one US trade official about Mr Long's statement.
The US and the EU have both told Beijing recently that they would be
prepared to consider helping China to fulfil its ambition of becoming a
founder member of the WTO by conferring such status on it even if it joined
well into next year.
However, China has balked at the offer, arguing that it is a device to
enable the US to continue spinning out membership negotiations indefinitely.
Beijing blames the US for the slow progress of the talks up til now, saying
that every time China makes a concession, Washington asks for more.
The US, under strong pressure from American industry, has insisted that
China join the WTO as a developed country - a demand which Beijing has
strongly rejected.
Although the EU agrees with Washington that Beijing still has a long way to
go to meet the requirements of the multilateral trading system, it is ready
to be more flexible by allowing China an adjustment period after it enters
the WTO.

FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US rallies for Uruguay Round vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents and supporters of the Uruguay Round global trade pact yesterday
were lobbying feverishly for votes ahead of today's vote in the House of
Representatives on the deal reached last December.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday predicted that the
House today would pass the legislation implementing the Round by 'a large
vote' in favour, sending it on to the Senate 'with overwhelming support' for
a vote on Thursday.
A serious hurdle was cleared last week when Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican leader, accepted a deal addressing his concerns about the dispute
settlement mechanism in the proposed World Trade Organisation.
But Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist and a leader of anti-Gatt forces,
said neither side could claim enough votes in the Senate, where 60 are
needed for passage, and no one in the Administration disputed him.
Mr Nader had one victory yesterday. Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado
Republican, took him up on his offer of Dollars 10,000 to any member of
Congress who would read the implementing legislation and pass a 12-question
test on the contents.
The senator, who had been leaning in favour of the pact, passed the test,
rejected the Dollars 10,000 and then announced he had decided to vote
against the pact.
'He realised the US would be paying 25 per cent of the costs while taking in
about 30 per cent of the imports and it would get only one vote out of 124,'
his spokesman said.
The trade pact battle, conducted when there is little else in the national
news, is receiving attention on a par with the fight over the North American
Free Trade Agreement. Opponents maintained that polls showed the US public
were against the deal. Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has vowed to
start a third party if the deal passes.
In an effort to counter the negative messages, supporters, led by the
Alliance for Gatt Now, poured funds into television, radio and print.
Individual companies - Boeing, Merrill Lynch, and EDS - entered the fray,
and trade groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers of America called for 'a
vote of confidence in America's ability to succeed in a fair world trading
system'.
President Clinton held a rally with supporters, hoping to convince wavering
senators. The president said: 'It is not a Republican agreement or a
Democratic one. It is an American agreement designed to benefit all the
American people in every region of our country and from every walk of life.'
The US Business and Industrial Council, a protectionist business group,
placed a large advertisement in the Washington Post listing names of 91
defeated and retiring senators and house members. 'The Gatt vote will be
very close,' it said. 'This means that the defeated lame duck Congressmen
and senators - many of whom will soon become lobbyists for special and
foreign interests - will get to decide OUR economic future.'
All weekend the CNN television network ran an advertisement with pigs -
designated as members - at a trough. 'Some call it a global trade deal, but
hidden inside is billions of special interest pork,' it says. 'Call your
senators today and tell them don't butcher the budget. Take the fat out of
Gatt.'
Three former presidents - George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter -
released a letter to the president calling the pact 'a bridge from the
post-war world of half a century ago to the post-Cold War world which is
being forged today'.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Sanguinetti wins close Uruguay election: Ex-president's
opposition Colorado party edges home in country's tightest poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julio Maria Sanguinetti was yesterday declared president-elect of
Uruguay, as his Colorado party edged out the governing Blanco party and the
left-wing Encuentro Progresista coalition in the country's closest ever
election.
President Lus Alberto Lacalle called Mr Sanguinetti yesterday to
congratulate him and invited him to meet to discuss the March 1 transition,
the government said.
With about 95 per cent of the nearly 2m ballots counted from Sunday's poll,
Mr Sanguinetti had 31.36 per cent of the vote, just over 1 per cent more
than Mr Alberto Volonte of the centrist Blanco Party.
'Since the country was divided in three parts, we told him he can count on
us so his government can benefit all Uruguayans,' said Mr Volonte, conceding
defeat.
A 55-year-old free-market businessman, Mr Volonte had only a 0.75 percent
margin over former Montevideo Mayor Tabore Vazquez of the Encuentro
Progresista (Progressive Gathering). Early this morning with most of the
110,000 still uncounted ballots from Mr Vazquez's bastion of Montevideo,
there was a strong possibility the left might end up in second place.
Mr Sanguinetti - one of four Colorado presidential hopefuls in a system that
combines primaries with national elections - looked set to end up less than
2 per cent ahead of Mr Vazquez, who was likely to finish up with the most
individual votes but not become president because Encuentro failed to win at
party level.
The virtual three-way tie, mirrored in parallel congressional elections,
will force Mr Sanguinetti to forge a coalition. The need for cross-party
accords is likely to slow Uruguay's cautious reform process still further.
Mr Sanguinetti, president from 1984 to 1989, said yesterday he recognised
that the narrowness of his victory would complicate his ability to govern.
'This has been the most hotly disputed election in our history . . . our
political system obliges us to make great efforts to achieve governability
and to enable our democracy - as well as guaranteeing freedom - to be
effective and functional,' Mr Sanguinetti said.
The election, in which Blanco candidates mustered less than a third of the
votes, is likely to be seen as a rejection of the administration's curtailed
reform attempts. President Lacalle tried to change the country from an
inward-looking welfare state to a more liberal economy competing in the
international arena. But his attempts to privatise state corporations,
dismantle tariffs and cut social security costs aroused public suspicion,
despite reducing inflation and producing healthy economic growth.
The very strong showing for Encuentro Progresista, a coalition ranging from
social democrats to former Tupamaro guerrillas, is evidence that many
Uruguayans place defence of generous social welfare provisions ahead of any
desire to adopt the neo-liberal policies sweeping across much of Latin
America. Encuentro, which in the early stages of vote-counting seemed close
to victory, won easily in Montevideo, the capital, but could not do so in
the conservative interior.
Mr Sanguinetti, who campaigned on a social democratic platform, will take
the reins of a very different Uruguay from the one he led in 1984. Uruguay
was then emerging from 11 years of military dictatorship and Mr Sanguinetti,
now at 58 already considered a grand old man of Uruguayan politics, saw his
main task as re-establishing the country's democratic roots.
One of his principal challenges this time will be to forge a new role for
the country within Mercosur, the emerging customs union that will from next
January integrate the Uruguayan market with its enormous counterparts in
Argentina and Brazil.
During the campaign, Mr Sanguinetti expressed concern at some aspects of
regional integration, particularly its potential to expose fragile Uruguayan
industry - and jobs - to fierce competition. He has spoken of the need for
properly conceived export policies. He also criticised the Blancos for
allowing the peso to appreciate as part of its inflation-beating strategy.
This has led to speculation - denied by Mr Sanguinetti - he is contemplating
a devaluation.
The president-elect has said that a too-strong currency has been prejudicial
to exports and has helped to fuel a trade deficit, expected to be Dollars
900m this year. Mr Sanguinetti may well try to slow the peso's appreciation,
though he will have to balance this against efforts to bring inflation down
from 40 per cent a year now.
When Mr Sanguinetti left office in 1989, inflation was more than 80 per cent
a year and the government was running large budget deficits, leading critics
to question his commitment to fiscal rectitude.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Senate Republicans start to jockey for position
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The nascent rivalry between two potential Republican presidential candidates
 -Senators Robert Dole and Phil Gramm - could get an early airing this week
as the party begins to choose senior congressional leadership positions.
Mr Dole is certain to be elected majority leader by his peers on Friday but
it is far from clear who will be his number two - Senator Alan Simpson of
Wyoming or Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi.
While both are conservative, Mr Lott has made no secret of his support for
Mr Gramm's candidacy for the Republican nomination and the Senator from
Texas has returned the compliment by openly preferring his Mississippi
colleague to be Mr Dole's deputy.
Mr Gramm's argument, which he is not shy in expressing, is that if Mr Dole
is frequently going to be absent in pursuit of his national ambitions, Mr
Lott would be a more effective deputy.
Some political observers translate this into the belief that Mr Gramm would
urge Mr Lott to undercut the majority leader on key policy issues relevant
to the 1996 campaign.
The Dole-Simpson connection is based more on a record of pragmatism, plus a
shared reputation for being ascerbic.
Both support abortion rights, unlike many party dogmatists, while the
Senator from Wyoming, probably the leading congressional authority on
immigration, is less inclined to take the hard line against all immigration
currently popular among right-wing Republicans.
Mr Lott also has some history of accommodating party moderates, both in the
Senate and as a House whip in the 1980s.
In a recent interview Mr Lott urged the conservative forces lined up behind
Congressman Newt Gingrich, who is due to be elected next Speaker of the
House on January 4, 'to cool their jets a bit.'
But he is also contrasting his 'more extensive and personal' relationships
with the new House leadership to those of Mr Dole and Mr Simpson.
Mr Simpson told the New York Times in typically blunt language that he was
the best candidate to combat what he described as the Republicans'
'atavistic desire to clobber themselves when they begin to give each other
the saliva test of purity.'
The new Republican committee chairmanships in both houses will not be
settled until early January. But, over the weekend, Mr Dole pretty much laid
to rest flickering speculation that Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina
would not take over the foreign relations committee following his
extraordinary attacks on President Bill Clinton.
'If you're going to start knocking down seniority,' Mr Dole said, 'there's
going to be an avalanche.' This was taken as a clear warning that any
challenge to Mr Helms could lead to conservative attempts to oust party
moderates in line for committee chairmanships, such as Senator John Chafee
of Rhode Island who is due to take over the environment and public works
panel.
Democrats also have some close leadership contests to decide. The party's
House members must decide tomorrow whether to remove two of the old
hierarchy, Congressmen Richard Gephardt and David Bonior.
They are the outgoing majority leader and chief whip and are under challenge
for both positions in the new minority from a pair of southern
conservatives, Congressmen Charlie Rose of North Carolina and Charles
Stenholm from Texas respectively.
A third contest - for chairmanship of the party caucus, pits Congressman Vic
Fazio against Kweisi Mfume, now head of the black caucus.
On Friday, Senate Democrats will choose a new minority leader from between
senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.
Mr Daschle is the protege of Sen George Mitchell, the outgoing majority
leader.

<TEXT>
Argentina's opposition Radical party has picked Mr Horacio Massaccesi,
governor of Rio Negro province, as its challenger to President Carlos Menem
in next May's presidential elections. The Frente Amplio, an opposition
coalition, has postponed nominating its presidential candidate for next
year's elections, expected to be won convincingly by Mr Menem.
Mr Massaccesi defeated rival Mr Federico Storani by a wide margin, partly as
a result of backing from former Radical president Mr Raul Alfonsin, and from
powerful Cordoba governor Mr Eduardo Angeloz.
Mr Massaccesi now faces the task of fortifying a Radical party plagued by
poor results in recent elections and riven by internal conflict. 'The next
step is to create party unity' so that we 'can offer Argentinians
alternative proposals to official policies of backwardness and social
injustice,' Mr Massaccesi said in his victory speech.

US cigarette manufacturer RJ Reynolds Tobacco yesterday appeared to be
playing down prospects for the launch of a new type of low-smoke cigarette
called Eclipse, saying it did not know if or when the cigarette would be
introduced because it was still being developed.
Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, the US food and cigarette group, has been
testing the cigarette which works by igniting a charcoal element at the end
and passing the hot air over tobacco without burning it. A similar
non-burning cigarette called Premier, launched by the company in 1988,
flopped.
Yesterday Reynolds said testing indicated that Eclipse had less tar and
nicotine than 95 per cent of cigarettes currently on the market and
eliminated 90 per cent of second-hand smoke.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of existing US homes rose by 0.5 per cent in October, but downward
revisions to statistics for earlier months meant that the announcement
offered more evidence of a slowdown in the housing market. The National
Association of Realtors said sales of existing single family homes rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91m in October from a revised level of
3.89m in September. The figure is, however, a drop from the 3.97m annual
rate the association had originally reported for September. The association
is predicting sales of existing homes will reach a total of 3.97m in 1994.
Home sales have shown increasing signs of weakness in recent months in
response to the Federal Reserve's successive increases in short-term
interest rates, which had already pushed average 30-year fixed-interest
mortgage rates up by 2 percentage points before the three quarters of a
percentage point increase the Fed decided on two weeks ago.

<TEXT>
Italian police claim to have made a breakthrough in unmasking Falange
Armata, a right-wing group that has claimed responsibility for numerous acts
of terrorism over the past five years. This follows the arrest over the past
week of three policeman, two of them brothers, stationed in Bologna and the
Emilia Romagna region. All three are believed to be linked to some 15
unexplained killings and a series of violent robberies dating back to 1988.
A pistol found in the possession of one of the arrested policeman has been
matched by firearms experts to the killing of a carabiniere and the murder
of a prison educationalist. Police are now checking whether the group was
protected within the service and allowed to carry out activities to
destabilise Emilia Romagna, the region controlled by the former Communist
party. The inquiry could also clarify still unexplained aspects of terrorist
attacks in Bologna, including the bombing of Bologna station in 1980 that
killed 80 people and left 200 injured.

Ireland's political parties were still in deliberations on the formation of
a new government last night, raising fresh doubts on whether tomorrow's
meeting of the Irish parliament will be able to resolve the uncertainty and
vote in a new administration. The Labour party leader, Mr Dick Spring, the
kingmaker in any future coalition, held separate talks with both Fianna
Fail, Labour's partners in the outgoing government, and with the main
opposition Fine Gael party in an attempt to break the deadlock, following
the collapse of the 22-month coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour and
the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. A poll published
yesterday suggested 63 per cent of people wanted a new Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition. Moreover 49 per cent of those polled wanted Fianna Fail's leader,
Mr Bertie Ahern, as prime minister and only 23 per cent supported Mr Spring.
The result gives Mr Ahern a strengthened hand in negotiations with Labour.
'I don't think we're a hundred miles away from reaching agreement,' said Mr
Ahern before going into yesterday's talks. Fianna Fail officials said Mr
Ahern and Mr Spring had agreed to meet again.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pioneering micro city car that is being developed by Mercedes-Benz, the
German executive and luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss watchmaker, is
likely to be produced at a new plant in France or Germany. The board of
Micro-Compact-Car, the joint venture formed earlier this year by
Mercedes-Benz and SMH, is due to meet on Friday and is expected to make a
preliminary decision on a production location. Final approval of the site is
likely to be given by the boards of the parent companies next week. The
Alsace region of France and the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg are
believed to be the front-runners to win the project. Mr Hans-Jurg Schar,
marketing and sales director of MCC, said that the so-called 'Swatchmobile'
would be built either in France or Germany and not in Switzerland. SMH and
its chief executive Mr Nicolas Hayek had hoped to bring production of the
micro car to Switzerland, but Mr Schar said that the 'offers from Biel and
Oensingen cannot compete with sites that receive European Union subsidies'.
Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has some of the highest labour
costs in the world. Mercedes-Benz, which holds a 51 per cent stake in the
venture, and SMH, the maker of Swatch watches, which holds 49 per cent, are
aiming to launch the 'micro compact car' in Europe by 1997/98 with an
initial production capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 cars a year.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, resigned yesterday over a
dispute with prime minister Tansu Ciller on the appointment of his
assistant. The Anatolian news agency said Mrs Ciller had accepted the
resignation, but the foreign ministry made no announcement. Mr Soysal, a
member of the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's party,
had resisted appointing Mrs Ciller's hand-picked candidate as his deputy
since he was named foreign minister during a cabinet reshuffle in July. Mr
Soysal has also clashed with Mrs Ciller on the issue of privatisation and
had pushed for an amendment in the anti-terrorism law, which gives officials
wide latitude to declare writings and speeches terrorist propaganda. Mr
Soysal, 65, spent more than 14 months in jail in the early 1970s under the
military regime on charges of making Communist propaganda, and has been a
university lecturer on constitutional law and a deputy president of Amnesty
International. His strong nationalist stance won him few friends in foreign
capitals. Mr Soysal has been particularly vocal in the row with Greece over
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea.

<TEXT>
A joint group from France's ruling Gaullist RPR and Union for French
Democracy (UDF) coalition parties is due later today to report on the
feasibility of holding primary elections to select a single conservative
candidate to contest next year's presidential elections, amid signs of
falling public support for such a US-style innovation.
According to a Sofres opinion poll, 65 per cent of French believe that the
traditional first round vote, to be held next year on April 23, is
sufficient to select the final two contestants - usually one from the right
and one from the left - for the second-round vote on May 7.
Proponents of primaries, notably Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister,
have argued that the fortnight between the two rounds is not long enough to
heal the deep divisions within the right. But, seeing primaries mainly as a
device to corral conservatives into backing prime minister Edouard Balladur
from the outset, two of the prime minister's opponents, ex-president Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, who leads the UDF, and Mr Philippe Seguin, the National
Assembly president who is backing Mr Jacques Chirac as the RPR candidate,
have come out strongly against special early primaries.

East German industrial output rose sharply by 10.7 per cent in September
from August and increased by 14.2 per cent compared with a year ago, the
German economics ministry reported yesterday. The ministry said the end of
the summer holidays was a contributing factor, but several recent studies
from leading economists have said the recovery in eastern Germany was
'widening'. Manufacturing, which bore the brunt of the restructuring over
the past five years, rose 16.3 per cent in September from August and 19.6
per cent year-on-year. Construction output rose by 5.1 per cent in September
from August and was up 11.4 per cent from a year earlier. Mining output rose
by 15.1 over the same period, although it had declined by 10 per cent on a
year-on-year comparison.
Belgian year-on-year inflation dipped from 2.12 per cent to 1.99 per cent in
November, the first time it has been below 2 per cent since December 1988.
The annual growth of Greece's M3 money supply aggregate decelerated to 9.7
per cent in September from 10.6 per cent in August, and M4 slightly
accelerated to 10.7 per cent from 10 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Tapie tries to avoid riches to rags ending: The French
courts will soon decide the fate of the populist tycoon-politician
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr Bernard Tapie, France's populist politician, tycoon and one-time pop
star hopeful, it is time to face the music. A spate of legal and financial
wrangles accumulated over the past few years are now before the courts. They
threaten his political aspirations and could lead to a decline from riches
to rags for the French deputy and Euro MP.
The most important ruling is due within the next few days. A Paris
commercial court is set to decide whether the remaining indebted companies
in Mr Tapie's business empire should be wound up. The case focuses on the
financial health of FIBT, the holding company which owns Mr Tapie's home in
Paris, on ACT, the management company for his luxury yacht, and on Groupe
Bernard Tapie, which controls his commercial interests, principally his
weighing machine businesses and health shop chain.
Despite the complexities of the case, Mr Tapie's ordeals have captured
public interest. For some, his image as an anti-establishment champion has
been fuelled by his clashes with the law courts and Credit Lyonnais, the
state-owned bank which is his principal creditor. As one Paris politics
professor puts it: 'There is a disillusionment with the political class, and
a sense that it cannot respond to the big problems of the day such as
unemployment. So mavericks like Mr Tapie can play an important political
role.'
His ability to do so is now in the balance. FIBT and GBT are unlimited
liability companies, owned by himself and his wife. Should they be wound up,
it could spell bankruptcy for the Tapie couple. And, under French law,
bankruptcy would mean that Mr Tapie would be ineligible for elections to
public office.
This would present a serious reverse for Mr Tapie. He has made no secret of
his intention to run for mayor of Marseilles in elections next year and has
also indicated that he might take a tilt at presidential polls due next
spring. 'If there is no one to represent the interests of my supporters then
I will do so,' he says, referring to the 2.5m who voted for his Radical
Energy list in June's European elections, supporting his pro-European,
anti-racist and full employment ticket.
The ineligibility of Mr Tapie could also hold implications for France's
other presidential hopefuls. The 12 per cent of the vote garnered by his
list in the European polls presents Mr Tapie as a significant power broker.
By running in June, he drew support from the Socialist party, prompting a
disastrous result and the ejection of Mr Michel Rocard as its leader. Mr
Tapie argues that he should not be blamed for this. Rather, he claims: 'They
should congratulate me. I rid them of a candidate who was a sure loser.'
As for Mr Jacques Delors, the head of the European Commission and widely
touted as the Socialist standard-bearer in the presidential elections, the
considerations are more complex. According to Ifop, the polling institute,
Mr Tapie and Mr Delors could complement each other because they draw support
from different age and social groups.
In the absence of a Tapie candidacy, Ifop estimates that only one-third of
his supporters would vote for Mr Delors in the first round of the two-round
poll. At the same time, the populist businessman could garner support for
the left from his electoral strongholds. 'The danger of splitting the vote
of the left may not be a problem, particularly if Tapie was to support
Delors in the second round,' says one political analyst. To Mr Tapie,
however, such calculations, are premature. For amid his complex legal
tangles one thing is clear; he is not going to relent without a fight. 'The
match is not over until the whistle goes, and we are not even at half-time,'
he says, using one of his frequent football metaphors.
Mr Tapie, however, has just conceded two goals. Last week, a Paris court
ordered him and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds 40.3m) to Credit Lyonnais,
which funded Mr Tapie's business expansion in the 1980s. In a separate case,
the Paris police tribunal ruled that Mr Tapie must repay FFr66.7m to the
French customs office because he illegally registered his luxury yacht, the
Phocea, as a commercial vessel.
Mr Tapie's rearguard action is based on a host of appeals against his
adversaries. 'There is no sanction which is not susceptible to appeal,' he
told L'Express magazine. He is already contesting last week's rulings and is
suing Credit Lyonnais on the grounds that it is partly responsible for the
management of the companies he controlled.
Mr Tapie's prospects may also be helped by the reluctance of the commercial
court to move rapidly to wind up his businesses, partly because of the
implications for the hundreds of employees involved and the political
sensitivity of unemployment in France.
As a result, a possible outcome is the opening of a process of judicial
redressment for Mr Tapie's companies. This involves an exhaustive study of
the possibilities for the rescue or sale of the businesses - both of which
are described as feasible solutions by Mr Tapie's lawyers. The process can
last up to six months, buying time for the embattled businessman. A more
aggressive stance by the court, however, would mean that Mr Tapie's time is
running out.

The Swiss government confirmed yesterday that 15kg of gold it confiscated
from a Geneva safe after an Italian request belonged to former Italian prime
minister Bettino Craxi, who was sentenced in absentia earlier this year in
Italy to 8 1/2 years in prison for corruption. Mr Craxi, who has refused to
return from his villa in Tunisia citing health problems, has consistently
denied any links with the gold and said it was part of a
politically-motivated vendetta. In a written statement issued through his
lawyer in Italy, he reiterated those denials. He is the highest-ranked
official charged so far in connection with the corruption scandals. A former
friend of Craxi's, Mr Giorgio Tradati, a businessman, said last month that
he transferred about SFr20m (Pounds 9m) into banks in Switzerland. Mr
Tradati claimed that once the corruption inquiry started, Craxi used some of
the money to buy the gold upon the advice of an American Express Bank
official, to try to cover the trail.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, resigned yesterday over a
dispute with prime minister Tansu Ciller on the appointment of his
assistant. The Anatolian news agency said Mrs Ciller had accepted the
resignation, but the foreign ministry made no announcement. Mr Soysal, a
member of the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's party,
had resisted appointing Mrs Ciller's hand-picked candidate as his deputy
since he was named foreign minister during a cabinet reshuffle in July. Mr
Soysal has also clashed with Mrs Ciller on the issue of privatisation and
had pushed for an amendment in the anti-terrorism law, which gives officials
wide latitude to declare writings and speeches terrorist propaganda. He had
expressed his uneasiness over the increasing pressure from the west about
Turkey's poor human rights record. 'I have been relying on my own
reputation, which is not going to last long, to face the charges,' Mr Soysal
said recently. Mr Soysal, 65, spent more than 14 months in jail in the early
1970s under the military regime on charges of making Communist propaganda,
and has been a university lecturer on constitutional law and a deputy
president of Amnesty International. His strong nationalist stance won him
few friends in foreign capitals. Mr Soysal's resignation came two days
before the national security council, a supreme advisory body, was scheduled
to discuss the use of Turkish bases by US aircraft enforcing the Iraqi
Kurd's 'safe haven' in northern Iraq. Mr Soysal has said that the force
should leave. He has also been particularly vocal in the row with Greece
over territorial waters in the Aegean Sea.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Van Miert rejects French EU power plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French proposals to alter significantly the European Commission's proposed
directive on liberalising the electricity market in the European Union were
yesterday described as unacceptable by Mr Karel Van Miert, competition
commissioner.
Mr Van Miert said the French proposals would be contrary to existing Union
rules, partly because they would allow power companies in some countries to
preserve a monopoly on imports and exports.
He was speaking ahead of a meeting in Brussels today of the council of EU
energy ministers which will consider the French 'single buyer' proposals
along with the Commission's plan to promote so-called third party access.
Third party access would make it possible for power companies to sell
electricity directly to industrial power users in another country by giving
them access to that country's transmission system.
Under the single buyer proposals such deals would have to be conducted
through a transmission system operator in the buyer's country. The operator
would be responsible for running the system and meeting new demand for
electricity.
Critics of the single buyer system, including the UK, say the single buyer
concept would have little practical impact on increasing competition.
Energy ministers will today consider several options, the most likely of
which is an inconclusive outcome in which they will order an investigation
into whether the single buyer and third party access proposals are
compatible.
Ministers will focus on proposals for the electricity market. Gas is being
given less priority.
Mr Van Miert, speaking at a Royal Institute of International Affairs
conference in London, said the Commission had a solid commitment to create
international energy markets.
He said the third party access and other proposals in the directive, first
drafted two years ago, went no further than expressing existing rights in
Union treaties.
He indicated that the Commission would press harder for the liberalisation
of the markets through the courts if no progress was made politically.
Since the Commission launched its drive to liberalise the energy markets
five years ago, it has made only limited progress, with two previous
directives having a relatively peripheral effect.
In discussions over the current directive, most member states have agreed on
introducing competition in generation and on the need to 'unbundle' the
accounts of integrated power companies' by separating out production,
transmission and distribution costs.
However, free market countries argue that the electricity market will only
begin to become competitive if third party access is agreed.

FT  29 NOV 94 / EU priority transport projects lack cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Only five of the European Union's priority transport public works have the
necessary financing in place, and budgets for the other nine are far from
complete, Mr Henning Christophersen, the commissioner responsible for
economic affairs, revealed yesterday.
Presenting a report on the EU's cross-border road and rail projects - part
of the trans-European networks project - Mr Christophersen said only three
transport schemes out of a list of 14 were completely ready, and a further
two were almost there.
Mr Christophersen was urging foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday
to accept or reject plans for the 14 priority projects - valued at a total
Ecu91bn (Pounds 71bn) - at the forthcoming summit for heads of state in
Essen, Germany.
The report, drawn up by experts from across the Union, also proposed the
adoption of 10 international energy network projects plus pan-European air
traffic control measures. Its recommendations amount to an updating of last
December's white paper on jobs, growth and competitiveness which is to be
tackled by the heads of state at Essen.
The disarray in the finances of most of the transport projects represent a
setback for the desire of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to boost
European competitiveness. He had urged the use of so-called 'Euro-bonds' to
fund gaps in financing, but this has been resisted by some member states,
notably Britain. The UK argues that four key sources of finance - national
exchequers, private finance, loans from the European Investment Bank and
designated EU funds - should be sufficient to support the projects and that
no additional funding instruments are necessary.
Yesterday, Mr Christophersen said no doors should be closed when it came to
financing. The report included a recommendation that 'measures will be
taken, if proven necessary, in order that priority projects do not run into
financial or other obstacles which would jeopardise their implementation'.
However, the British contributor to the report distanced himself from
suggestions that the Union could agree in the future to 'new' forms of
financial support.
The three projects for which financing is complete are: development of
Malpensa airport at Milan; the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Stranraer rail link; and
a fixed road and rail link between Denmark and Sweden. Finance is almost in
place for development of Greek motorways and a motorway between Lisbon, the
Portuguese capital, and the Spanish city of Valladolid.
The report stressed that the biggest obstacles to trans-European networks
were administrative. It said governments had to work to change regulations
that differ from country to country and to ensure co-ordination to avoid
basic problems like different electrical systems.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Kohl cracks whip over CDU: Chancellor's warning to his party
congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who was easily re-elected as party leader
yesterday, threw down the gauntlet to his governing Christian Democrats by
warning them to liberalise the economy and open up the party to the younger
(and female) generation.
If not, Mr Kohl warned, the coalition government, fresh from winning a
fourth term in office but with a majority of just 10 seats in the lower
house, would not be ready to face the electorate in four years' time.
In a speech to the CDU's first party congress since it narrowly won last
month's federal election, Mr Kohl highlighted the splits within the party,
particularly on how far it should go in co-operating with the opposition, as
well as modernising its recruitment and promotion structures.
CDU officials yesterday openly admitted that the combined opposition of
Social Democrats, Greens/Bundnis 90 and the reformed east German communist
Party of Democratic Socialism could no longer be ignored by the government.
The opposition holds 331 seats in the Bundestag, ten less than the governing
coalition of the CDU, the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, and the
Free Democrats. The FDP's seat tally was reduced by 32 to 47.
As a measure of the potential threat posed by the opposition, both Mr Kohl
and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, yesterday
refrained from criticising it, thus endorsing a strategy the latter hopes
will keep the opposition divided.
Last week, Mr Schauble said the Greens/Bundnis 90 could join the
parliamentary committees which sit in secret on security issues from which
they have traditionally been excluded. Earlier, the CDU voted for Mr Antje
Vollmer, a Green deputy, as one of the four deputy speakers of parliament.
The need to prevent any opposition alliance from emerging, and to break the
growing influence of the PDS in east Germany is now seen as one of the main
strategies of the CDU, senior officials said yesterday.
On Sunday, the CDU party in the eastern state of Thuringia, which set up a
grand coalition with the SPD at the weekend, said the Christian Democrats
should open the party up to former east German communist party members.
But there is no stomach in the party to endorse this call officially. Mr
Peter Hintze, general secretary and a staunch critic of the PDS, yesterday
said he opposed completely any co-operation with 'the radicals', signalling
dissent about how the CDU can increase support in the eastern states without
compromising its pre-election rhetoric which labelled the PDS as a black
party painted red.
The CDU is even divided over how it should be modernised. The more
conservative rank-and-file would prefer, for example, no special quota for
women, a system introduced by the Social Democrats and the Greens more than
a decade ago.
However, as more younger women in their twenties drift to the Greens, Mr
Kohl said it was time to open the doors. The CDU parliamentary group has
only 13.9 per cent women, the lowest percentage of any party. The overall
average of the new Bundestag is 26.3 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Union tries to agree line on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union was struggling yesterday to paper over its differences
regarding enlargement to embrace eastern Europe, and to assemble a package
which EU leaders can endorse at their Essen summit on December 9-10.
Still to be agreed are the amount of EU funding needed to assist integration
of the former communist states, the extent of EU reform in areas like
agriculture before they join around the turn of the century, and the degree
of trade access to the Union's single market they will be given in the
interim.
The hub of the strategy, designed for Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, remains intact, however. This is to draw up
a white paper detailing the changes the newcomers need to make to their
legislative, regulatory and standards regimes to bring them into line with
the EU.
'If this is not the actual Rubicon, then it's very close to it,' one senior
European Commission official said. 'If the east Europeans sign up to the
single market, then the only arguments you've got against integrating them
are essentially internal, not very respectable ones.'
But such arguments, over money, agriculture, and trade access, were on
display yesterday when EU foreign ministers met to prepare the summit.
Brussels wants to commit Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in aid under its Phare
programme for eastern Europe in 1995-99. Southern and Mediterranean member
states, however, want parallel commitments on the Commission's recently
unveiled Ecu5.5bn aid plan for the Middle East and North Africa, before they
sign up to the eastern strategy.
Work is far less advanced on the Mediterranean strategy, however, and the
German presidency of the EU yesterday secured a compromise which will get it
past the summit.
Aid already pledged aid for next year (Ecu1.16bn for east and central Europe
and Ecu492m for the Mediterranean) will be minimum benchmarks for succeeding
years, with the amounts by which they are to increase to be decided later.
Under the Commission plan, the 1996 figures, for example, would be Ecu1.23bn
for the east, and a sharper increase to Ecu710m for the Mediterranean.
However, up to a quarter of this will be available for big infrastructure
schemes in the east, including up to eight road, rail and gas pipeline
projects to be examined at Essen.
On agriculture, the UK - strongly opposed by France - demanded a full debate
on reform of the common agricultural policy, the cost of which would rocket
if it were extended without changes to the east. 'That is a discussion we
cannot avoid,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary. But Essen now
looks certain merely to call for a Commission study on the impact of eastern
enlargement on the CAP and other expensive EU policies such as aid to
backward regions.
Tomorrow, Brussels will try to resolve the trade access question, but only
through what one official called 'fairly modest' improvements in rules of
origin for incoming eastern goods. These would probably allow an
'accumulation' of rules of origin, with a product containing added value of
at least 40 per cent from any three of the six states counting as an EU good
and entering tariff-free.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Chechnya threat to Russian lives: Breakaway republic warns
that captured fighters face execution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya has threatened to execute the 70
Russian fighters it claimed to have captured in recent skirmishes unless
Moscow admits it is directly involved in trying to destabilise President
Dzhokhar Dudayev's regime.
The threat will further inflame tensions with Moscow; some western diplomats
suggest it could provoke the open hostilities with Russia about which the
Chechen authorities have been complaining. President Boris Yeltsin yesterday
held an extraordinary meeting of his security council to discuss Chechnya,
which declared its independence from Moscow three years ago.
Mr Pavel Grachev, defence minister, denied the Russian army had directly
supported the Chechen opposition forces, which launched an assault against
Grozny, the republic's capital, on Friday. However, he added that if Russia
did intervene 'one airborne regiment would be enough to resolve all
questions in two hours'.
So far, Russia has refrained from direct intervention fearing such a move
would tarnish its image abroad and threaten to unleash a Chechen terrorist
campaign within Russia. But the government has repeatedly urged Chechnya to
come back into the fold, and has recognised the provisional council of
opposition forces as the republic's rightful government, providing it with
moral and financial support.
Chechen officials said 300 opposition troops had been killed and 200 taken
prisoner in the latest fighting in Grozny. They said 70 prisoners were
serving Russian servicemen. 'If Russia does not recognise these soldiers as
prisoners of war they will be tried by the laws of the shariat (Islamic
rule). I will not lift a finger to stop this process,' Mr Dudayev said,
indicating they could then be executed.
Russian officials have denied serving soldiers were involved although they
have conceded it was possible that former servicemen had been hired as
mercenaries by the opposition forces. Mr Grachev said that, according to his
information, mercenaries from the Baltic states, Afghanistan and Russia had
been hired by Mr Dudayev.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Chechen opposition leader, warned Grozny's
population that they might soon be bombed and urged them to evacuate all
children although the capital was reported to be quiet yesterday. Mr
Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament and one of the
leaders of the failed uprising against Mr Yeltsin in October 1993, is now
being backed by Moscow.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Aid plan to back Irish peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders are expected to agree substantial new aid to bolster
the Northern Irish peace plan at their summit in Essen on December 9-10,
senior EU officials said yesterday.
The 'peace grants', targeted mainly on creating jobs and improving
infrastructure, could total Ecu625m (Pounds 490m) in new money between 1995
and 1999.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, briefed foreign ministers
meeting in Brussels on the shape of the peace package, put together for the
whole of Northern Ireland and the six bordering counties of the Irish
Republic.
The Commission is expected to agree a final proposal for Essen on December
7, and has been consulting widely at grassroots level in the pro-British
Unionist and Irish nationalist communities in the province. Senior officials
in London and Dublin say both governments endorse the initiative. 'It's
virtually gift-wrapped for Essen,' one Irish official said.
Brussels is suggesting an initial commitment of Ecu300m from the EU budget
for 1995-97, with an extension of the same rate of new funding - Ecu100m a
year - for a further two years if the scheme is working. About 80 per cent
of this would go to Northern Ireland and the rest to the bordering counties.
The UK and Ireland would contribute additional new money, worth 25 per cent
of the new EU funds spent within their territory, for a total potential
package of Ecu625m.
Britain, which has clashed with the Commission in the past about the normal
legal requirement to 'match' EU aid with 'additional', or genuinely new
money, says there will be no repackaging of already committed funding for
the province.
Mr John Major, British prime minister, gave a public commitment in Belfast
late last month that the UK would put in new funding to match extra EU
grants.
The EU has already committed Ecu1.23bn to Northern Ireland in 1994-99, under
the structural funds aid programme, as well as Ecu20m a year to the
multinational International Fund for Ireland.

FT  29 NOV 94 / ABC owner joins Spielberg group in TV studio venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Cities/ABC, owner of the US television network ABC, is to join
forces with the newly formed Hollywood trio of Spielberg, Katzenberg and
Geffen to create a TV studio.
The joint venture, in which the two sides will initially invest Dollars 100m
(Pounds 60.9m) apiece, aims to produce and syndicate a broad range of TV
programmes.
The venture puts ABC in the vanguard of a general move by the US TV networks
into producing their own material, from which they were largely barred by
government regulation until last year. It is also expected to increase the
level of competition with the Hollywood studios, some of which plan to set
up their own TV networks in retaliation.
The partnership between the film maker Steven Spielberg, former Disney
production chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and the recording impresario David
Geffen was set up in October to produce films, music, cartoons and
interactive entertainment as well as TV programmes.
The trio's original intention to strike a deal with the Hollywood studio MCA
has been thwarted by uncertainties over the relationship between MCA and its
parent, Matsushita of Japan.
Mr Katzenberg, whose recent resignation from Walt Disney was seen as a blow
to the company, said: 'As the entertainment industry looks to the future, it
is clear that one of the most important considerations will be the
ever-evolving relationship between the Hollywood studios and the broadcast
community. When David, Steven and I formed our company, one of our initial
goals was to build a strategic alliance with a broadcast power.'
An ABC executive said the initial Dollars 200m investment was merely a
start-up figure. 'If it is working well and needs more, we'll be willing to
invest more,' she said. While ABC had invested in its own production
facilities and in other joint projects, this would be its largest production
venture.
The partners said the new venture would produce programmes for TV networks
and cable TV, and would also syndicate its material. Under government
regulation, the US networks are barred from domestic syndication until
November 1995, although they are permitted to syndicate abroad.
Mr Spielberg said later that the first programmes from the venture would
appear in the second half of next year.
The studio will be managed as a separate entity, with operations controlled
by a senior executive yet to be appointed. All parties are committed for
seven years.
The venture illustrates a growing trend in the US whereby the explosion in
communications media has created a large appetite for entertainment
material.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Major defeats Euro-rebellion but suffers blow to majority:
Conservative sceptics defy government threat to withdraw party whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government had its paper majority in the House of Commons
wiped out last night as the price of crushing a Tory rebellion against
higher British contributions to the European Union.
With the backing of Ulster unionists, the government defeated with a
majority of 27 a Labour amendment that would have delayed legislation to
implement the agreement on European Union finances reached at the Edinburgh
summit two years ago.
After a barnstorming Commons defence of the EU by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, the government won a crucial vote on a Labour amendment to the
European Communities Finance bill by 330 to 303.
But during a day of high drama which exposed again the fault-line in the
Tory party over Europe, seven hard line Tory Eurosceptics ignored Mr Major's
decision to make the vote an issue of confidence and abstained.
Their defiance, in spite of a cabinet warning that defeat would have forced
a general election, resulted in the immediate withdrawal of the Conservative
whip - in effect the rebels' suspension from the parliamentary party.
That meant the government's paper majority of 14 in the Commons over all
other political parties was wiped out. With another Tory MP expected to lose
the whip for abstaining on a second vote on the legislation, Mr Major was
left heading what in theory is a minority administration.
Yet another Eurosceptic was thought to be preparing to resign the party whip
in spite of reluctantly voting for the legislation. The government was in
any case likely to see its Commons majority cut to 13 after an expected
defeat in next month's Dudley by-election. On paper it will now be in a
minority by at least one and possibly by as many as five.
Opponents of the legislation who had buckled under the pressure to fall into
line warned the prime minister that he now faces the prospect of a second,
more dangerous rebellion, over the imposition of Value Added Tax on domestic
fuel.
On the eve of today's Budget, several MPs said that if Mr Clarke presses
ahead as expected with plans to impose VAT on fuel at the full rate from
next April, the government might well be defeated on the issue.
Ministers insisted that in practice most if not all of those suspended from
the party would continue to support the government in its legislative
programme. Unless they are given back the whip, the rebels will not be
allowed to stand as Conservatives at the next election - an incentive to
fall into line.
Cabinet colleagues also pointed out that Mr Major's real, rather than
theoretical, majority was the 27 votes margin by which he won last night's
confidence vote. On most big issues - though not on VAT on fuel - he can
rely on the support of 10 unionist MPs from Ulster.
But although the prime minister joined Tory party managers last night to
celebrate their success, MPs across a wide swathe of the right wing said he
would pay a heavy price for the victory.
Mr Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke's predecessor at the Treasury and a leading
sceptic, called during a heated debate for Britain to redefine its
relationship with Brussels, even if that meant withdrawal from the EU.
Mr Clarke, in a combative performance, accused Labour and the Liberal
Democrats of colluding with the rebels to wreck an agreement they had backed
when it was signed at the Edinburgh summit two years ago.
As the likelihood of a government victory became clear, rightwing opponents
of Mr Major renewed their efforts to gather support for a challenge before
tomorrow's deadline.
But dissidents on the left of the party made clear they were not prepared to
add their names to those seeking a challenge, leaving the rightwingers short
of the required 34 names.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had earlier rejected any
suggestions that a contest might pave the way for him to win the leadership.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Norway votes to stay out of European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway last night rejected membership of the European Union for the second
time in two decades, snubbing the EU's enlargement plans and dealing a
stinging political blow to Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister.
With 92 per cent of the votes counted in yesterday's referendum, the state
NRK television network forecast a win for the anti-EU camp by 52.4 per cent
to 47.6 per cent.
Mrs Brundtland conceded defeat while Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the
main opposition Centre party and the leading figure in the No camp, told
cheering supporters in Oslo: 'We said yes to Europe, yes to international
solidarity, but we said No to the Union.'
The No vote followed the country's rejection in an earlier referendum in
1972 of membership of what was then the European Economic Community. It came
despite the recent approval of membership by Austria, Finland and Sweden -
Norway's fellow European Free Trade Area nations - and means that the EU
will expand from 12 to 15 members next year, not 16 as planned.
The result was an embarrassing defeat for Mrs Brundtland, who had made
winning over the country's Euro-sceptical electorate her central political
goal over the past four years. The result belied her confidence that a sharp
swing to the Yes side in the final weeks of the campaign, following the Yes
vote in neighbouring Sweden, would be enough to win her the day.
'The Norwegian people have spoken and we have said from the beginning that
we will respect the advice of the people,' she said. However, Mrs Brundtland
repeated her earlier determination to carry on in office with her minority
Labour government. Thanks to the splintering of the opposition parties in
the Storting (parliament), there is no realistic alternative government to
Labour, which remains easily the most popular party in the opinion polls.
'What is important for the government now is to take care of the country's
interests through our international co-operation and through our
co-operation in western Europe through the EEA,' she said. Norway is a
participant in the European Economic Area trade accord with the EU.
Norway will, however, stand outside the EU's drive to develop closer
economic, political and strategic co-operation which the government had
argued was vital for the country's economic and political security.
A majority of Norwegians instead backed the No campaign's claim that EU
membership would undermine the country's independence and its control over
its rich petroleum and other natural resources.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Carsberg to quit early as fair trading head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, Britain's senior competition regulator, is to step down
as director-general of fair trading next May, three years into his five-year
term.
Sir Bryan, a former accountancy professor, is quitting the Office of Fair
Trading to become secretary-general of the IASC - the international
financial reporting organisation.
Although his decision will cause some embarrassment to the government it has
not come as a surprise. Sir Bryan is known to be frustrated by his role at
the OFT as the government has watered down competition policy in favour of
promoting industry.
As director-general of telecommunications from 1984 to 1992, Sir Bryan was
the UK's first privatised utilities regulator, and when he moved to the OFT
it was widely expected he would expand the role. Observers thought he would
eventually take full responsibility for regulation and oversee other utility
watchdogs.
However, his appointment to the OFT coincided with that of Mr Michael
Heseltine as trade and industry secretary and with the change of government
policy on competition.
Sir Bryan, who is on a two-day business trip to Paris, was unavailable for
comment last night, but an OFT official denied that there was any rift
between him and Mr Heseltine. 'It is a question of him wanting to go to
something rather an escape from something,' he said.
Ironically, the announcement of his departure comes when the OFT is much
busier than it has been for several months, vetting both the British
Aerospace and GEC bids for VSEL, the submarine builder, and the proposed
merger between the Leeds and Halifax building societies.
Sir Bryan moves to the IASC for an initial five-year term, but his contract
is renewable. The appointment delighted the accounting body, which draws up
model financial reporting standards. Sir Bryan said in a statement issued
yesterday by the IASC: 'The move towards more competitive global capital
markets and the continuing progress of multinational companies create a
strong need for common accounting rules which can be applied in all
countries and which will be accepted by all stock exchanges.'
Mr Eiichi Shiratori, chairman of the IASC, said: 'I am very pleased that the
IASC has been able to attract such a well qualified person as its
secretary-general at such an important time in its development.'
The IASC is playing an increasing role in regulating accounting standards at
a time when the growth in international trading is giving it influence in
bringing together national regulators.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke defends Britain's policy over EU: Lamont calls for
rethink as Brussels cash debate highlights Tory divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, delivered an uncompromising defence of
Britain's policy towards the European Union yesterday as the government
faced down a threatened rebellion by Tory Eurosceptics over the Brussels
budget.
But the debate on legislation to allow higher British contributions to
Brussels again exposed the deep divisions in the Tory party over Europe.
Mr Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke's predecessor at the Treasury, called for
Britain to redefine its relationship with Brussels, even if that meant
considering withdrawal from the EU.
Hardcore Eurosceptics were also still threatening to abstain or vote against
the measure in spite of the threat that rebels would be suspended from the
parliamentary party.
Mr Clarke, in a combative performance, accused Labour and the Liberal
Democrats of colluding with the rebels to wreck an agreement they had backed
when it was signed at the Edinburgh summit two years ago. He said the
government was 'certain' of victory in last night's vote.
But a decision to suspend - or more formally remove the parliamentary whip
from any rebels - might drastically reduce or wipe out the government's
already slender theoretical Commons majority of 14.
Right-wing opponents of Mr John Major were also still seeking support for a
challenge to the prime minister before Wednesday's deadline for the the
launch of any contest.
But dissidents on the left of the party made clear that they were not
prepared to add their names to the list of those seeking a challenge,
leaving the right-wingers short of the required 34 names.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had earlier rejected any
suggestion that he had any knowledge of suggestions from some in the
anti-Major camp that a contest might pave the way for him to win the
leadership.
Mr Clarke defended the government's decision to make passage of the
legislation an issue of confidence. If parliament could not support a deal
in which a government had given 'its solemn international commitment', then
'that government has lost the confidence of the House and it must fall'.
Insisting that the agreement would add only Pounds 75m to Britain's
contributions next year - rising to about Pounds 250m extra by the end of
the century - he said the accord represented a 'personal triumph' for Mr
Major.
Offering a robust defence of the political and economic advantages of
Britain's membership, he added: 'That increase in the contribution is an
increase in the price we pay for the undoubted benefits of membership of the
EU.'
Mr Clarke's only concession to the rebels was to promise tougher measures by
national governments and by the Brussels Commission to clamp down on EU
fraud.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Pressure grows for Bihac truce: US aligns with Europe and
Russia for settlement in former Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, EMMA TUCKER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, its European allies and Russia joined forces yesterday to press for
a ceasefire in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac and a broader settlement in
former Yugoslavia.
Mediators from the five-nation contact group - comprising the US, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany - held secret talks with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic at a remote villa.
In a day of hectic diplomatic activity in former Yugoslavia, Washington and
Brussels, the contact group also called for an immediate truce in Bihac and
in Bosnia as a whole.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said Washington would 'seriously
consider' any request for troops to help oversee the withdrawal of UN
peacekeepers from Bosnia. But he hoped that no pull-out would be necessary.
His comments were welcomed in Europe as a sign that the US administration,
unlike Congress, remained sympathetic to its allies' concerns.
In Bihac, blood-letting dragged on as two mortar rounds exploded within the
notionally UN-protected 'safe area'. A man was killed.
Diplomatic recriminations over Bosnia also continued, with European Union
foreign ministers angrily rejecting an attack by Mr Robert Dole,
leader-elect of the Senate's Republican majority, on the stance of Britain
and France.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said Mr Dole's comments - calling
for an immediate UN withdrawal and arms deliveries to Bosnia - reflected a
mistaken view about what outside forces could do to end the fighting.
Mr Dole said he hoped to narrow his differences with the UK in a trip to
Europe starting today.
'Nato's inability to respond to a war of aggression on south-eastern Europe
raises serious questions about Nato's future plans to expand to central and
eastern Europe,' Mr Dole said before he left.
Mr Hurd, in a clear reference to US calls for tougher air action, said peace
in the Bihac area 'will not be achieved by fostering illusions about what
Nato air power can achieve'.
The UN was continuing yesterday to work for a ceasefire accord between
Bosnia's Moslem-led government - which favours a three-month truce - and the
Serbs, who prefer any truce to be indefinite.
British officials said the contact group mediators were briefing Mr
Milosevic on the group's latest ideas, which are reported to include a
further easing of sanctions on Serbia if he fully recognises Croatia.
The group, in a significant concession, has also indicated that it will
consider allowing the Bosnian Serbs a 'special relationship' with Serbia if
they accept the international peace plan.
The idea of 'confederal ties' between the Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade was
firmly rejected by the Bosnian government last night, and western officials
emphasised that the issue could not even be raised unless the Serbs agreed
to the existing peace proposals.
France, meanwhile, launched a fresh appeal to the UN and Nato to 'ensure the
respect' of safe havens in Bosnia. Paris called for a renewed effort to find
an overall settlement that took no account of recent Serb gains in the Bihac
area.

FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBoS rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reassessment of the prospects for Royal Bank of Scotland ahead of figures on
Thursday saw the Scottish clearer's shares lose 7 at 416p. The change of
heart followed disappointing comments from the bank's insurance subsidiary
Direct Line.
BZW, whose ardour has been cooling for some time, finally put the stock on
its sell list, saying Direct Line's profits would peak in two years' time
and, as such, the RBoS valuation was too high.
The investment bank believes that RBoS is at a current price to book value
of 4.7 times and sees the share price falling to 380p. It forecast a profit
on Thursday of Pounds 520m giving earnings per share of 36.4p and a 13.2p
dividend.
Barclays moved ahead 10 to 597p on switching out of Lloyds, up 3 at 567p.
A large block of TSB sold at above the prevailing market price, and via a
marketmaker anxious not to go short ahead of the Budget, saw the underlying
stock gain 8 1/2 at 227p.
Dealers hung fire on Singer &amp; Friedlander. The merchant bank confirmed it
was in talks with Nordbanken, of Sweden, over buying the Carnegie brokerage
but gave no further details. The shares held at 81p.
Insurer General Accident slipped 5 to 536p, with institutions digesting a
cautious note from Smith New Court which argued that the shares were now at
an over-demanding premium of between 28 and 30 per cent above net asset
value.
Northern Ireland Electricity rose 5 to 362p after agreement to restore the
Republican power link, out of service since 1975.
Historically one of the Budget's more price sensitive sectors, drinks shares
showed no obvious signs of nerves, with a number of stocks putting in a
steady showing. Bass gained 5 at 531p and GrandMet put on 2 at 389p
following a switch recommendation from Nomura Securities.
The top Japanese house told clients to switch out of Guinness and into
GrandMet given the way the stout producer has outperformed over the past
month and GrandMet's weakness ahead of this week's interims. Guinness shed 3
to 453p.
Allied Domecq rose 10 to 563p, partly in response to over-selling following
last week's results but mostly on the perception that today's Budget
statement will not produce duty increases.
Ahead of next week's interims and helped by positive comment from broker
James Capel, Scottish &amp; Newcastle appreciated 7 to 507p.
Dollar sensitive stocks responded to the stronger US currency. Glaxo gained
5 at 626p and Unilever 9 at 1112p.
International conglomerate Hanson, which reports full-year figures on
Thursday, moved up 4 to 231p.
Health care group Smith &amp; Nephew eased marginally to 151p following a strong
performance recently.
NatWest Securities issued a weighty review which argued inter alia that
demand for oil was rising as OECD countries emerge from recession and Iraq
oil was unlikely to return to the market in significant quantities before
the 1996 US election. The house maintains its forecast of Dollars 19 a
barrel for Brent crude and focuses on stocks with 'low valuations and high
leverage to a still improving industry background'. The choices include BP,
which rose 1 1/2 to 418 1/2 p, and Lasmo, which improved 2 1/2 to 146 1/2 p
in spite of news that Mr Norman Davidson Kelly, the company's corporate
development director, is to resign at the end of the month.
Shell Transport failed to get above 696p in spite of a recommendation on its
Royal Dutch arm by PaineWebber.
British Steel moved forward 3 to 156p in turnover of 11m shares, helped by
US press reports of strong North American steel prices extending into 1995
and possibly 1996.
Among engineering shares, Siebe recovered 8 to 558p in advance of next
week's interim results. TI Group firmed 6 to 372p, while renewed focus on a
big foreign partner for its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars business underpinned a
rise of 8 to 184p in Vickers.
Textile leader Coats Viyella eased 3 to 199p after Smith New Court cut
forecasts. Courtaulds Textiles shed 11 to 449p in sympathy. Analysts are
concerned that the unseasonally warm weather will hit autumn sales, possibly
forcing companies to discount prices.
MEPC, which unveils interim results on Thursday, gained a penny at 400p, but
Land Securities had a less resilient day, tumbling 9 to 589p ex-dividend
following an unfavourable note about asset values from property adviser
Savills.
Diversified industrial group Williams Holdings held at 348p following the
Pounds 80m purchase of the Angus fire equipment business from engineering
services concern BBA, up 3 at 203p.
Heavily dealt with 7.8m shares changing hands, BTR managed to hold steady at
285p despite weekend press suggestions of nervousness among some
institutional shareholders following last week's resignation of the group's
chief operating officer.

The UK and France are blocking a joint US-German effort to mount an
international financial aid package to encourage economic reform in Ukraine.
The stand-off is creating further tensions in the trans-atlantic alliance
following US criticism of the European Union's efforts to stabilise eastern
Europe and former Yugoslavia. Ukraine is expected to be discussed informally
at today's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, but the decisive
meeting will take place among finance ministers a week later, just before
the European Council summit in Essen on December 9. Report, Page 3

FT  28 NOV 94 / Berlusconi fights leaks from corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, this week faces
interrogation by Milan magistrates over corruption allegations and a
threatened general strike on Friday.
Mr Berlusconi was originally expected to be questioned by Milan's
anti-corruption magistrates at the weekend, but his lawyer was reported to
be unwell and the appointment was postponed.
The delay has given the prime minister time to tighten the security
surrounding the encounter, which is likely to take place at an undisclosed
location in Milan.
Political analysts have warned that, should any compromising information
emerge, it would be hard for Mr Berlusconi to reject calls for his
resignation.
He was angered by the leak last Tuesday of the fact that he was being
investigated for corruption while running his Fininvest business empire. He
is anxious to protect the full secrecy of the interrogation and prevent the
Milan judiciary allowing testimony to leak immediately to the media.
Mr Berlusconi last week insisted that he had done no wrong while running
Fininvest, Italy's second-largest private business group. He has accused the
magistrates of conducting a political vendetta against him.
Meanwhile, the three main trade union confederations are standing by their
call for an eight-hour stoppage on Friday to protest against pension cuts in
the 1995 budget even though a compromise plan is to be discussed on
Wednesday.
The compromise centres on removing structural changes in the costly state
pensions system from the 1995 budget and treating them separately. The
unions have hinted that this would probably be enough to avert the strike.
The new proposals, which would have to include alternative spending cuts,
also meet many of the objections to the pension reform plans made by the
ruling rightwing coalition's populist Northern League, led by Mr Umberto
Bossi. The league leader held a long meeting at the weekend with President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
It was announced afterwards that Mr Bossi had pledged to support his
coalition partners until the 1995 budget has passed through parliament.
The magistrates' move against the prime minister follows recent admissions
by his younger brother, Mr Paolo Berlusconi, and by Mr Salvatore Sciascia,
the head of Fininvest's tax department, that L330bn (Dollars 204m) was paid
between 1989-92 in bribes to officials of the Guardia di Finanza, the
financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of company books.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's financially crippled airline, will be grounded today as
unions stage a 24-strike to protest at a drastic restructuring plan that
involves 5,000 redundancies, 20 per cent of the company's labour force, and
the break-up of the carrier in order to raise fresh capital through
disposals.
The stoppage is likely to cause chaos at domestic airports and severely
disrupt all air traffic to Spain.
Unions rejected calls over the weekend to return to the negotiating table
and to reconsider an earlier viability plan in which the management proposed
to cut salaries by an average 15 per cent and to shed 2,000 jobs over the
next two years.
The management said the only alternative to its viability plan was to scale
down the airline to a fraction of its present size in order to avert its
impending bankruptcy.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Brussels boost for mechanical engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is proposing a series of measures to improve the
competitiveness of the European Union's Ecu210bn (Dollars 250bn) mechanical
engineering industry, one of the sectors worst hit by the recent recession.
The move reflects concern in the Commission about a potential loss of global
competitiveness in the industry, which accounts for 8 per cent of total EU
industrial output.
This would have serious consequences for all manufacturing in the EU,
because of machinery makers' central role in supplying production equipment,
the commission warns.
A commission communication, Strengthening the Competitiveness of the
European Machinery Construction Industry, was presented to EU industry
ministers at their last meeting on November 8.
It is the result of more than two years of talks with industry leaders, who
have been keen to raise the awareness in Brussels of the strategically
important but highly fragmented mechanical engineering sector.
The communication discloses that production in the EU mechanical engineering
industry fell from Ecu225bn in 1991 to Ecu210bn last year, apparent
consumption from Ecu190bn to Ecu170bn, and employment from 2.7m to 2.3m.
The commission says the industry has to meet challenges on a number of
fronts: it needs to reduce its sensitivity to recession, accelerate its
restructuring, learn how to exploit innovation fully and step up efforts to
become a true global force.
Its proposals are designed to provide guidelines for action over the next
few years by the EU, member states and the industry itself.
The most important cover investment promotion, where member states will be
encouraged to improve tax depreciation rules for capital goods; industrial
co-operation especially among small and medium-sized machine manufacturers;
and fiscal incentives for research and development.
The proposals were welcomed last week by Orgalime, the Brussels-based
liaison group for the European mechanical, electrical, electronic and metal
working industries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Horst Schulmann, a director of the Bundesbank and president of the
regional central bank of the state of Hesse, who died last week aged 61
after a long illness, was one of the most internationally experienced people
on the German banking and financial scene.
He was closely involved in the creation of the European Monetary System.
As a senior economic adviser to the German government when Mr Helmut Schmidt
was chancellor, he played an important role in smoothing the way for the
start of the EMS in 1978.
Mr Schulmann also helped prepare the ground for western economic summit
conferences between 1978 and 1982. Before his time with Mr Schmidt's Social
Democratic government, he had spent four years as a senior executive at the
World Bank in the early 1970s, after which he worked as a senior economic
official for the European Community.

FT  28 NOV 94 / CDU women resist fixed job quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will today try to
agree on quotas designed to give women a higher profile within the party
despite evidence that many of them want nothing of the sort.
Several have spoken out ahead of the one-day national congress saying quotas
 -which would reserve one third of the party's positions for women - are not
helpful. 'It's a democratic crutch,' said Ms Rita Sussmuth, speaker of the
Bundestag, or lower house of parliament.
The quota is the only big issue at the congress, which meets in Bonn for the
first time since the mid-October election victory, and will also re-elect
its 13-strong council and the 26-strong national executive.
However, much of the talk on the sidelines is expected to focus on who will
succeed Mr Kohl, who said just before the October elections that he would
not stand again in 1998.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound leader of the parliamentary
party, has long been regarded as Mr Kohl's designated successor, and the
1,000 or so delegates will be paying particular attention to what he says.
However a handful of younger politicians - including Mr Jurgen Ruttgers, the
new research and technology minister - have been mentioned in recent weeks
as possible alternatives.
The quota is likely to be approved, given that Mr Kohl has thrown his weight
behind the idea in the hope that it will improve his standing among women
voters.
For many other CDU members it is also seen as a last-ditch solution to a
problem which has been often talked about but never solved: the CDU has just
13.9 per cent women in its ranks, less than the 26.3 per cent average for
parliament as a whole.
However, opponents of the quota said it would be better to adopt the model
used by the CDU in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg, where a fixed
percentage of women are nominated but the election itself is left open.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (19): 'Our economy has tremendous
potential' / Interview - Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto talks to
Stefan Wagstyl and Farhan Bokhari
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question from the Financial Times: Pakistan's economic policies have been
praised by many observers, including foreign businessmen. But there is
concern about the country's political stability. What assurances can you
give?
Benazir Bhutto: Pakistan went through a transition period in which there was
tussle between democracy and dictatorship. That tussle ended last year in
July 1993 when the military said they were not interested in intervening.
Today in Pakistan we don't have a constitution in name, we have a
constitution in fact, we don't have a democracy in name, we have a democracy
in fact. The military is totally neutral now. It's not doing political work
for the government, and its not doing political work for the opposition. Its
doing military work, and military work is defending the frontiers of
Pakistan.
In the past, many (economic and social) schemes have come on paper but they
have not been implemented, but that has been because there has been no
popular base in the government. Now there's a government in Pakistan with a
popular base. When there's a government with a popular base and grass roots
support, it's in a better position to implement its programmes.
There is also concern about law and order in Pakistan. We are addressing the
problems of crime. We have inherited a very bitter legacy of sectarianism
and of ethnic violence. We have introduced a socio-economic package for
Karachi in an attempt to go to the genesis of the causes of resentment among
the people of Karachi - that is the lack of transport and the lack of water
and lack of sewerage. The government is continuing discussions with the MQM
(the radical ethnic political movement in Karachi). But it's a problem that
some people are involved in heinous crimes, such as kidnapping and murder.
FT: What can be done about corruption in Pakistani politics?
BB: We are committed to the elimination of corruption. That's why we have
reduced through institutional means the scope for corruption. For example,
we have tightened up our banking laws. In fact, we have declared a morale
crusade to cleanse our society from this evil.
FT: What are your economic aims and achievements?
BB: We are a role model for the IMF . . . we have been able to provide very
competent management for Pakistan's economic problems. We aimed at
macro-economic stability because we believe that without macro-economic
stability, micro-economic activity cannot take place at its full potential.
We cut the fiscal deficit to 5.8 per cent of GDP last year and we aim for a
4 per cent deficit next year. Now if this deficit (cut) takes place, we can
address the problem of inflation which is the most common problem which
ordinary people in Pakistan complain about. We have also, in keeping with
our IMF commitments, begun lowering peak import tariff rates, which will be
lowered further as the years pass by . . . also we have sought to improve
the taxation collection system.
Much depends now on weather and crops but given good weather and good crops
I think Pakistan will be in a good position by next year. So, if within 18
months (of taking office) we can bring real economic stability, we would
feel proud of that achievement. It would allow Pakistan's economy to take
off. I think Pakistan's economy has tremendous potential which needs to be
realised.
Agriculture is also an important concern as it employs 70 per cent of the
people. We have increased the wheat support price to promote the growing of
wheat and we are expanding edible oil cultivation to cut dependence on
imports. We have imposed an agricultural tax on rich landlords. It was with
much trepidation that we introduced the bill to be passed by the National
Assembly, because our assembly is traditionally dominated by people from the
feudal class. But by the grace of God it was passed.
In the energy field we have suffered a tremendous electricity shortfall. . .
so we announced an incentive package for foreign investors interested in
setting up thermal plants. We have had tremendous response from the world
over - and we hope that within five years we will have increased our energy
output at least by 50 per cent if not more.
The massive investment of USDollars 12bn, which we have attracted to
Pakistan, will trickle down to the people in about two years. Some
Pakistanis are very sceptical about foreign investment in Pakistan, but I
think it is because they are not aware that the world has changed so
dramatically. And in the 21st century we are going to be witnessing a global
economy.
FT: How will you deal with Pakistan's urgent social needs?
BB: Well, I think that if one had to talk about a theme for the government
that theme must surely be social revolution, because unlike past governments
we have really concentrated on the social sector. This is also evident from
the budgetary allocations made by my predecessors and by our government on
sectors such as women's development, population planning minority affairs
and other development works.
We have set up a human rights cell in the ministry of the interior. . . we
have also set up an elite anti-narcotics force which is headed by a serving
general. . . we want to send a message that nobody is above the law. The
government is committed to upholding the law irrespective of how high or
influential any individual may be.
Once we stabilise the economy and give a sound socio-economic basis to the
society we hope to continue on to the larger political problems of how
narcotics barons run mafias, how certain tribal chiefs run their own mafias
with their own guards and their own laws, how sectarian groups, funded from
God knows where, preach the politics of hatred and violence, and how ethnic
parties preach hate at one another.
FT: What are you doing to improve the lot of women?
BB: I've seen myself that without economic independence, a woman cannot do
anything. If my father had not left me with independent means, there's no
way that the male members of my family would have permitted me to enter
politics. They would have made sure that I didn't have funds or a home or
space or a telephone to do a thing.
So that's why I've always believed that the key to a woman's independence is
economic independence. We have tried to make Pakistan a role model for other
Moslem countries by introducing a system for women's rights in a Moslem
society. We have done that by lifting the ban on women taking part in
international sports, by setting up a women's development bank which has
allowed a mushrooming of women-oriented small industries like garments,
slimming boutiques, and beauty salons, in the urban areas of Pakistan.
We have also done that by setting up women's police stations. In some Moslem
societies, women are kept behind locked doors. Here in Pakistan women go
knocking on doors investigating crimes. So it's a totally different society
 -it's a society on the move and on the march.
FT: There is international concern about Pakistan's nuclear programme and
about its dispute with India over Kashmir.
BB: As far as Pakistan's nuclear programme is concerned, it is a peaceful
programme, but we have shown tremendous restraint in not exporting the
technology, in not detonating a device and we feel that this restraint ought
to be recognised.
After all, if this restraint is not recognised then what is the use of
restraint, especially when I took an opinion poll and 99 per cent people in
Pakistan said that we should detonate, so I think it must be recognised that
there are tremendous domestic pressures on the government. And if we have an
international concern on non-proliferation, we must all work together to
strengthen the goal of non-proliferation and not take a myopic view that
results in something opposite taking place.
I feel that root cause of tension in the sub-continent ought to be
addressed, and that root cause is the political dispute over Jammu and
Kashmir, a dispute which is recognised by international law.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (20): Pakistan fact file
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President: Mr Farooq Leghari.
Prime Minister: Ms Benazir Bhutto, (Pakistan People's Party).
POPULATION AND AREA
The latest estimate is 128m. Density (per sq km) at mid-1992 was 149.6. The
main cities are Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad,
Islamabad (the capital) and Peshawar. Pakistan's land area: 796,095 sq km
(307,374 sq miles). This excludes the disputed territory of Jammu and
Kashmir. The Pakistani-held parts of this region are known in Pakistan as
Azad ('Free') Kashmir, with an area of 11,639 sq km (4,494 sq miles).
Northern Areas (including Gilgit and Baltistan) have an area of 72,520 sq km
(28,000 sq miles). Also excluded are Junagardh and Manavadar. The population
figures exclude refugees from Afghanistan (estimated to number about 3.8m).
LANGUAGES
Urdu is the national language. English is used extensively in all
governmental and commercial circles and is used fairly widely in hotels,
airports, railway stations, post offices and large stores. Basic English is
taught in schools and is the medium of instruction for higher education.
ETHNIC MIX
The driving force behind the creation of Pakistan was religion, and 97 per
cent of the population is Muslim. Of these, the majority are Sunni, the rest
being Shia (15/25 per cent). There are small communities of Hindus, mainly
in Sindh. There are also Christians in the main cities and Parsis in
Karachi.
The main ethnic groups in Pakistan are the Punjabis, the Sindhis, the Baluch
and the Pathans, plus a number of small tribal groups in the more remote
northern areas. The muhajirs, or refugees from India at the time of
independence, who for the most part speak Urdu as their mother tongue, can
also be regarded as an ethnic group. A relatively new element in the
population is the Afghan refugees, mainly concentrated along the tribal
areas.
CURRENCY
Pakistan's currency is the rupee, divided into 100 paisa. The average
exchange rate of the rupee in 1994: Rs46.56 =Pounds 1; Rs30.51 = USDollars
1. The exchange rate on November 8, 1994 was Rs49.5545 to Pounds 1;
Rs30.6194 to Dollars 1.
Government deregulation now allows freedom of currency exchange. Visitors
are advised that some false currency notes are in circulation.
VISA REQUIREMENTS
A valid passport is required by all visitors. All nationals of India,
Afghanistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, plus any country not recognised
by Pakistan must have a visa. Israeli passport holders are not permitted

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (18): Luck is a place at school - Life in
Qillah village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mohammed Maqbool does not enjoy the rice harvest. By the time he starts work
in the fields, he will have been up since 5 in the morning and he will not
rest until sunset.
Gathering crops is hard work for a nine-year-old boy, especially after a
morning of chores and schoolwork. Wiping the dust from his face, Mohammed
says he would rather be a policeman.
Life in uniform is an alluring prospect for boys brought up in the fields
and alleys of Qillah, a ramshackle collection of mud and brick huts in the
heart of Punjab.
The landlord of the village is unimpressed. 'You want to take bribes and
beat people up,' he jokes. 'What kind of life is that?' The sarcasm hides a
deeper concern - that today's children will leave the village for the bright
lights of Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, less than 40 miles away.
Mohammed has never travelled beyond the nearby market town of Mandi Faizabad
but he has glimpsed the outside world on one of the 17 television sets in
the village - home to some 80 households.
'What will they make of MTV?' asks the landlord, whose family has owned the
surrounding 550 acres for more than 40 years. 'My great worry is that the
next generation will want nothing to do with the land.'
His pessimism is probably exaggerated. Fears that today's children will
abandon farming underestimate the grip of agriculture on the rural
workforce.
For all its drawbacks, most labourers prefer village life to the unplanned
urban development of Mandi Faizabad. The congested market town is littered
with abandoned vehicles, broken-down shops and the skeletons of tractors
stripped for spares. Food stalls cast a pall of smoke across the area, and
residents defecate in the road.
It is not surprising villagers stay on the land, which at least promises
fresh produce and modest profits. Qillah may be under-developed, but it is
relatively prosperous compared with settlements in poorer provinces such as
Sindh or Baluchistan.
'About 10 per cent of the villagers can read and write,' says the landlord.
'But that's better than in the more backward areas.'
More than 100 children are officially enrolled in the two-room school,
although their numbers are depleted by chronic absenteeism.
It is a problem throughout the Punjab, where only a third of children attend
primary school. Nevertheless, the prospects are brighter in this village
than others. If children complete full-time education, the landlord promises
to pay for a college place and the first villager has just received a
degree.
'We respect him, but it has not made anyone else want to do it,' says
Mohammed Rafiq, the head farmer.
Instead, Mr Rafiq encourages young men to concentrate on crops: rice,
potatoes, guava and citrus. In a good year they can grow 12,000kg of
potatoes and sell enough rice to pay for new amenities, although there is
still no telephone.
Their prosperity depends on one essential resource - water. The Qadirabad to
Baloki canal runs through the village, giving it a high water table. That in
turn produces a soil capable of sustaining a variety of produce.
The village also rears buffalo and goats for slaughter - a rare source of
income in a country where most livestock is used for motive power.
'This is one of the most progressive villages in the area,' says the
landlord, who visits once a week to check the ledgers. 'We don't prevent
them from improving their situation. Not everyone is so lucky.'
Luck for the people of Qillah is the right to an education of sorts; the
right to leave for the city and to sell their own produce. Mohammed Maqbool,
whose family relies on dried dung for fuel and canal water for washing,
hopes his luck will change.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (17): Agriculture faces a crisis / A look
at government plans to revive the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iqbal Mustafa is disillusioned with agriculture. He has tried cotton, grain
and horticulture on his 150-acre farm in Punjab. Now he has put the land to
a new use - housebuilding.
One of Pakistan's small group of entrepreneurial farmers, Mr Mustafa warns:
'The industry is stagnating. Production cannot keep pace with population
growth. There are not enough development funds, no infrastructure for
getting goods to market, and rural education has totally collapsed.'
It is a gloomy assessment of a country in which agriculture employs more
than 50 per cent of the working population and accounts for 24 per cent of
its GNP. For modern, efficient farming, Pakistan needs to consolidate
agricultural land holdings. But rapid population growth is restricting the
amount of land available. Moreover, feudal landlords, whose power is based
upon keeping people on the land, resist change.
Mr Mustafa's verdict is all the more depressing because he is not citing
personal grievances, but the findings of the prime minister's Task Force on
Agriculture, set up last year to assess the state of the industry and
proposals to widen the tax net to include farmers for the first time. The
task force - bringing together politicians, farmers and rural interest
groups - told the government that agriculture was facing a crisis, which was
exacerbated last year by a sharp fall in cotton production, the country's
principal cash crop and largest farming export.
Output peaked at 12.8m bales in 1991, but fell to 9.1m bales in 1992 and to
7.9m bales last year under the twin impact of heavy rain and viral
infections.
The dismal performance by the cotton sector which, together with textiles,
accounts for more than half of Pakistan's total exports, pegged agricultural
growth to a modest 2.6 per cent.
The disproportionate effect of two years' poor weather and virus problems
underlined the structural difficulties of an industry in which only cotton
and livestock have outstripped population growth over the past 10 years.
Prolonged dry spells in wheat-growing areas, meanwhile, could reduce yields
by more than 6 per cent this year; and rice farmers, who saw output increase
28 per cent to 3.99m tonnes last year, are uncertain whether there is a
ready market for any excess produce.
Pakistan's inability to feed itself, let alone develop a commercially-minded
farming community, has been further hampered by the absence of an organised
seed industry; intermittent or non-existent power and water supplies; and
increasingly fragmented land holdings.
Together with the drain on foreign exchange reserves caused by food imports
and the reluctance of some feudal landlords to improve conditions for
villagers, it adds up to a massive structural problem for a government
already constrained by heavy defence and debt servicing costs.
Even so, Mr Shah Mehmood Qureshi, parliamentary secretary at the ministry of
agriculture and former chairman of the Agricultural Task Force, is
undaunted. He says the government is determined to solve the malaise - 'we
have no option but to implement new initiatives. The government is in office
because of strong support from a rural population let down by its
predecessors.'
The Bhutto government has tailored agricultural policy to the main
recommendations of the task force, which identified four broad strategies to
transform the industry:
The development of a demand-driven industry using credit to boost
production, along with aid for a new processing industry.
Reducing the transfer of resources from agriculture to other sectors.
Fresh investment in rural infrastructure and the formation of new
institutions to monitor the policy framework.
So far, these policies have been dominated by the decision to make farmers
pay income and wealth taxes, levied by provincial authorities and the
federal government respectively. Collecting those taxes, however, could run
into opposition from feudal landlords, whose patronage plays an important
part in the careers of some politicians.
'I had a feeling I was going to be lynched when I first proposed it,' says
Mr Qureshi.
Other new initiatives have also run into problems. Plans to offer farmers
credit to buy low-priced tractors, imported from Poland and Belarus, have
prompted strong resistance from local manufacturers, which argue that it
would lead to large-scale losses.
Government critics, meanwhile, claim that increased fixed procurement prices
for main crops and new credit facilities for small farmers could lead to
abuse of the reform process.
Wheat farmers, who saw production rise from 14.7m tonnes to 16.4m tonnes
last year, have enjoyed price increases of almost 20 per cent, while sugar
cane prices have risen 14 per cent.
'We must reduce govern- ment intervention in agriculture,' says one
lobbyist. 'Support prices were designed to save farmers from ruin, rather
than generate profits.'
Others ask where the government will find the resources to fund schemes,
such as those to improve the rural road network, computerise land records
and ensure year-round fertiliser supplies.
Upgrading rural roads would cost Rs240bn alone, according to the
Agricultural Task Force, and a further Rs120bn is needed for education in
outlying villages.
Although some of the demands will be met by the government's Social Action
Programme, Mr Qureshi admits that it will not cover the full financial
requirements - likely to run into 'billions of dollars'.
Nevertheless, he claims Pakistan could become self-sufficient in food
production within five years if the government implements measures to
modernise the sector.
But if it fails to raise poor farmers above subsistence level, or reduce the
reliance of richer farms on state hand-outs, there could be a far-reaching
upheaval in the industry.
That process may be accelerated if this year's cotton crop falls short of
government targets of 9.5m bales.
Most industry analysts expect a crop of no more than 8.5m bales, and the
Small Landholders and Farmers Association has warned that heavy rain and
pest problems could leave full-year production languishing at about 5m
bales.
Mr Mustafa, who helped draft the task force report, suggests that rapid
contraction of the industry could be a blessing in disguise - forcing a
shake-out of inefficient and loss-making farms and increasing the pressure
for land reforms.
Changes, to make land acquisition and disposal easier, would allow more
efficient farms to expand, he says. But successive governments have avoided
tackling the issue.
'What Pakistan needs is fewer, more technically advanced farms supplying
higher quality produce,' he says.
'The problem is that land in this country is associated with political
power, rather than commercial potential. That won't change overnight.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (15): Islamic fervour still affects
public life - Religious observance has declined but fundamentalists continue
to wield influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Qari Saeed-ur-Rahman, an Islamic scholar and preacher, shook his head sadly
and said: 'I am afraid Pakistan is becoming less Islamic by the day. People
have no image of Islamic society in their minds.'
Even as he spoke, earlier this month, in his mosque in Rawalpindi, another
preacher working a few hundred miles away was trying to make a reality of
his particular image of Islamic society. Armed militants acting in the name
of Maulana Soofi Mohammed had seized control of the district of Malakand in
the mountains of the north-west frontier and imposed Islamic law. It took
the security forces a week to recapture the territory.
While one mullah bemoans the decline of religious faith, another leads his
believers into battle. There could not be a greater contradiction over the
role of Islam in contemporary Pakistan.
In the country as a whole, the intensity of religious observance is almost
certainly on the decline - as Qari Saeed notes. But, on the margins,
fundamentalist fervour is almost as strong as it was at its peak in the
1980s during the Islamic jihad (holy war) against the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan.
The arsenal of guns and ammunition left from the Afghanistan war has put
power into the hands of armed groups, some of them committed to a new jihad
in Pakistan. Radical preachers often take advantage of the country's
miserably low levels of education to fill young minds with ideas they are
unable to question.
Fundamentalism is a difficult challenge for Pakistan. As a country created
for Moslems, it must necessarily have a strong Islamic identity. Yet, it
also has to accommodate significant minorities of Hindus and Christians, and
cope with the competing demands of a Sunni Moslem majority and a Shia
minority.
Moreover, the government must pursue economic and social development without
alienating too many conservative Moslems who hold strong views over matters
like the social emancipation of women. Finally, Pakistan's two biggest
foreign policy issues - the long-running conflict with India over the
troubled region of Kashmir and the civil war in Afghanistan - are overlaid
by religious considerations.
While Moslems, Hindus and Christians have clashed for centuries in the
Indian sub-continent, the need to live together in close proximity also
brought long periods of peace.
Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder, and the country's early leaders
showed little interest in rigidly enforcing Islamic codes. Often educated in
mission schools and in British universities, their views had little in
common with the faith of their people.
Yet as the euphoria of building a new country evaporated, religion became an
increasingly powerful force in public life. Ironically, it was Mr Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, a western-educated prime minister, who in the 1970s was forced
by pressure from the mullahs to move the weekend from Saturday-Sunday to
Friday-Saturday. A connoisseur of whisky and fine wines, Mr Bhutto was also
persuaded to ban alcohol consumption.
However, it was left to General Zia-ul-Haq, the military dictator who
overthrew Mr Bhutto to pursue Islamicisation in earnest. Using the support
of the mullahs to give legitimacy to his undemocratic regime, he imposed
strict controls on public displays of art, films and theatre, extended the
teaching of Islam in schools and encouraged the strict observance of public
prayers, notably in government offices.
Cosmopolitan Pakistanis remember the 1980s as grim and repressive, but for
most mullahs it was a golden age, when the country's energy was focused on
the jihad in Afghanistan. Qari Saeed says: 'General Zia did not bring full
Islamic laws, but he made progress.'
General Zia's death has been followed by a moderate easing of pressures in
society to conform to Islamic codes of conduct. Among the elite, people
hosting parties at home have become less cautious about serving alcohol,
though public consumption remains illegal. Video recordings of western films
abound. Art galleries and theatres are broadening their offerings a little.
Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamic parties, which held considerable influence
under General Zia, have seen their support slump - to just five seats in the
217-member National Assembly in last year's general election. The vociferous
condemnations of the Islamic clergy, who believe a woman cannot lead an
Islamic country, have failed to prevent Ms Benazir Bhutto winning two
general elections.
For Mr Altaf Gauhar, a veteran journalist and magazine editor, this is
evidence that talk of 'rising fundamentalism' in Pakistan is 'a huge hoax.
'Ordinary people saw the Islamic system in action under Zia. They don't want
it back,' he says. Yet, even if people are willing to dispute the clergy's
will at the ballot box, and to some extent in their private lives, they are
still cautious about making any kind of public challenge. The mullahs retain
the sole right to interpret the faith - and are apt to condemn any
challengers as heretics. For example, when Ms Bhutto visited France
recently, she intervened in the controversy over the protests of French
Moslems against a ban on their daughters wearing headscarves to school. Ms
Bhutto told them that it was enough to wear the veil in one's heart. Qari
Saeed, for one, was furious - 'she has no right to speak on this matter,' he
says.
An equally serious debate concerns the implementation of Islamic law, or
Sharia, in Pakistan. All political parties are agreed on the principle of
introducing Sharia. The debate centres on how to put it into practice.
In its purest form, Sharia prescribes only physical punishments for crimes -
from flogging to death - and fines play a very small part. But it would be
difficult for Pakistan to evolve a modern economy without financial
penalties for business-related offences. Also, many mullahs believe that
Islam invests in them the right to be judges. But the government would
prefer to introduce Sharia by overhauling existing laws and courts to give
them a more Islamic flavour.
This is not a theoretical argument. The uprising in Malakand followed a
supreme court decision in February striking down existing laws governing the
tribal areas in the north and north-west of Pakistan. The court declared the
laws unconstitutional on the grounds that the government's legal writ runs
only in the settled regions of Pakistan and not in the tribal areas, which
joined the country in 1947 under a special treaty between the government and
tribal leaders.
Islamabad was slow to react to the Supreme Court order. Mr Maulana Soofi, a
fundamentalist who refuses to have his photograph taken for fear of
offending God, took advantage of the delay to implement full Sharia law in
Malakand.
But even such an extreme development as an armed uprising generates only
muted protests from many Pakistanis. The fear of offending the mullahs
affects even politicians. As Mr Fateh Mohammed Khan, the senator for
Malakand, says: 'They (the insurgents) held me in my house (during the
uprising). But if I spoke out against them they would tear out my tongue.
They would kill me.'
Silence allows the mullahs to win arguments by default. Extremists in the
lawless tribal areas are free to establish and train armed bands. So the
religious fundamentalists are able to exert far more power than the people
are willing to give them at the ballot box.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (16): Labour force of 10m children - Need
for social progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's record on social welfare is visible on almost every street
corner. Malnourished children wait at traffic-lights to beg from motorists
or sell newspapers which they will never read. In rural areas, many work the
land or provide labour in rice mills and brick kilns, writes Tim Burt.
In Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province, children as young as
six work in the kilns, mixing mud and filling brick casts. Impoverished
families - most earning less than Rs2,000 a month - cannot spare their
children for school and send them to work as patheras, 'the brick makers.'
A survey of 20 kilns by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) found
almost 400 school-age children at work. In a damning indictment of a country
where the labour force includes 10m children under the age of 15, Unicef
says it was startled by the 'high rate of illiteracy, lack of family
planning, exposure to health hazards, inadequate or total lack of medical
facilities, deplorable sanitation and a general impression of being bonded
to this way of life.'
Those problems are not confined to child labour. They are endemic in poorer
parts of Pakistan. The 1994 Human Development Index, compiled by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ranks Pakistan behind neighbouring
countries in many of the key measures of social progress.
Its annual population growth exceeds that of India, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. Its performance, moreover, in school enrolment, adult literacy
and the percentage of people in work also lags behind, while access to
health and sanitation facilities are among the worst in the region.
Addressing the international conference on population and development
earlier this year, Ms Benazir Bhutto admitted: 'Pakistan cannot progress if
it cannot check its rapid population growth.'
That is a tall order for a country where the population has grown from 50m
in 1960 to 128m today, and is set to double by the year 2017.
Anxious to improve Pakistan's standing on human development, the Bhutto
government has embraced and extended an ambitious Social Action Programme
(SAP), launched last year by the government of Nawaz Sharif following
mounting pressure from international donors and aid agencies. Over five
years, the programme envisages Dollars 7.7bn being spent on initiatives to
curb population growth, improve primary education, health care, rural water
supplies and sanitation. In the first three years, the government plans to
build more than 32,000 schools, improve teacher training and ensure that
teachers stay in rural areas where demand is greatest.
It also aims to revamp health education and train female paramedics. A
village-level initiative on family planning is also under way to encourage
contraception.
Only a small number of villagers have access to safe sanitation and clean
water. Public bodies have a poor record in maintaining water services, so
control of new schemes will be transfered to local communities. Hailing the
programme as a step forward, Ms Bhutto says it will 'educate and motivate
our people to a higher standard of living.'
Some international aid agencies are not so sure. They claim the programme is
too narrow and the government will have few resources to fund its commitment
while military expenditure remains at 6 per cent of gross national product -
the highest figure in the sub-continent - and debt servicing continues to
drains its reserves.
'I haven't seen any evidence of political groups being interested in
far-reaching social change,' says a senior aid agency official in Islamabad.
'Pakistan is not addressing land reform, women's rights or defence
spending.'
Such officials want the SAP to become a community-based reform programme
focused particularly on educating women, who take primary responsibility for
family health care and education. Female literacy in Pakistan is among the
lowest in the world at 20 per cent, and fewer than one-in-five girls
complete even primary education - 'building more schools is irrelevant. The
problems are more basic than that,' says Dr Tariq Banuri, head of the
Sustainable Development Policy Institute. 'We need to develop a cohesive
village-based education system. It can't be done through centralised
management.'
His view is echoed by Mr Jim Mayrides, head of the Unicef mission in
Islamabad, who says female literacy is the key to improvements in basic
healthcare and hygiene. 'If they could read and write, it would help spread
the message of how to treat diarrhoea and respiratory infection.'
Eradicating those two ailments alone would cut infant morality by more than
60 per cent.
'The political will is there to improve things, but there is a paralysis in
the bureaucracy and the changes are very slow,' says Mr Mayrides.
Failure to address these issues could prompt widespread social discontent -
'if the rural people were to become aware of the resistance in Malakand and
Karachi it could prompt disorder elsewhere,' says Dr Banuri. 'The risk is
complete breakdown in the community.'
The government, however, claims the SAP - partly funded by a Dollars 200m
World Bank loan - deserves praise for at least promising to upgrade basic
services in rural areas, where some 24m people are living in absolute
poverty.
This poses a dilemma for the aid agencies. They have no wish to derail the
programme but they want to broaden its scope to a 10-year horizon, with
day-to-day management of the initiatives transferred from local politicians
to new community groups.
'These issues are not susceptible to a quick fix,' says Mr Philip Regan,
deputy resident representative of the UNDP in Islamabad. 'More people can be
trained, more buildings put up. But they won't have an impact until the
long-term problems are addressed.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (14): Textile industry may need imports -
Cotton farmers and manufacturers are anxious for a good harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers across Punjab, the heartland of the cotton industry, are anxiously
scanning their crops for signs of a good harvest.
They are not alone. A bumper crop would draw sighs of relief not only from
the farming community but also from the textile industry, which depends on
home-grown cotton. The government would be similarly relieved after seeing
production of its main export earner fall from 9.1m bales to 7.9m bales last
year - almost 40 per cent below the record 12.8m bales produced in 1991.
The collapse - blamed on pest attacks and heavy rains - sent shock waves
through the economy. For cotton prod- uction underpins a textile industry
that employs 35 per cent of the total labour-force, and supplies raw
materials to more than 1,000 ginning factories and hundreds of mills.
Hopes of a recovery this year, however, have been dented by reports of a
poor harvest in Sindh, where prolonged rainfall has ruined much of the crop.
Although the southern province produces less than 20 per cent of Pakistan's
total output, the Small Landholders and Farmers Association says the
situation is no better in Punjab, home to the prog- ressive farmers who once
boasted some of the world's highest yields.
Mr Ishtiaq Jafari, chairman of the association, claims that only 5m bales
will be harv- ested this year, far short of government estimates of 9.5m
bales. Pests have destroyed about 30 per cent of the crop, while up to 20
per cent may have been ruined by rain, according to the association.
Its gloomy forecasts are rejected by Mr VA Jafarey, adviser to the prime
minister on finance, who accuses Mr Jafari of deliberately playing down the
industry's prospects.
'The growers say the crop is bad just to push prices up,' he says. 'The real
position is far from clear. There has been damage in Sindh, but some parts
of the Punjab have harvested more than last year.'
Privately, government officials and western econ- omists admit the crop will
probably fall short of initial estimates, with output hovering in the region
of about 8m-8.5m bales.
That may be bad news for the textile industry, which together with raw
cotton accounted for 68 per cent of Pakistan's total exports in 1991-92.
Domestic consump- tion alone has exceeded 8.5m bales in recent years, and
the country could lose Rs7bn (Dollars 228.6m) of foreign exchange earnings
if there is insufficient production for overseas sales.
If the crop fails to meet even domestic needs, the textile companies would
be forced to import higher priced overseas cotton, increasing their costs
and squeezing profit margins.
The knock-on effect could be dramatic. The textile companies represent
almost a third of all companies listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange, and
the market invariably falls on bad news from the cotton growers.
Aware of the grim prospects for Pakistan if output stagnates, the government
has set up a Cotton Resource Group to investigate the fall in production and
suggest remedial measures. In its first report, the group blamed the decline
not only on persistent rain and viruses, but also on the decision by many
farmers to abandon cotton altogether or their failure to protect crops with
adequate pest- icides.
A large number of farmers have switched to sugar cane in Punjab, prompting a
1.89m-hectare contraction in the area used to grow cotton.
Yields per hectare, meanwhile, fell 14 per cent from 574kg to 493kg last
year - almost half the 1991-92 total - following an attack of cotton-leaf
virus. Some 1.88m bales were lost, worth more than Rs19bn at current market
prices. A further 1.65m bales were also lost to attacks by whitefly and
aphids.
'I don't think production will ever get back to 12m bales,' says one Punjabi
cotton farmer, who asked not to be named. 'Too many hybrid species have been
introduced. They are more susceptible to viruses, and the first crop has
been horrendous.'
In a bid to improve yields, the Cotton Resource Group has drawn up a list of
recommendations. Imple- menting them requires significant government
intervention at both federal and provincial levels, to ensure that new rules
take effect and existing regulations are followed more tightly.
The group, for instance, wants the government to reduce pesticide prices by
abandoning the 27 per cent tax on imported products, which puts some of the
best brands out of reach for small farmers.
They also recommend tougher control of pesticide dealers, who have been
accused of diluting products. Other demands include improved water supplies,
better seed distribution, and new credit facilities for farmers.
Although most of the measures have not been costed, the group said Rs55m was
need just for research on combating pests and viruses.
The Pakistan Central Cotton Committee has gone further and urged the
government to give farmers interest-free credit facilities; incentives to
combine production in co-operative farms; and crop insurance.
This leaves the government with a dilemma. It has few reserves to meet all
the farmers' demands, but the knock-on effects of ignoring them may be even
more costly.
Leaving the cotton industry to market forces could persuade more farmers to
switch to other crops, and deprive the textile industry of raw materials. In
turn, that could lead to widespread factory closures and higher
unemployment.
With the ruling Pakistan People's Party relying on rural areas of Punjab and
Sindh for the bedrock of its political support, it is unlikely to abandon
the industry in a hurry.
Indeed, the findings of the Cotton Resource Group have already been endorsed
by the National Agriculture Co-ordination Committee, which helps to
formulate policy.
An injection of government funds and incentives is likely to boost the
industry, but it may be only a temporary diversion for a farming community
moving inexorably towards a more diversified crop base.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (13): Pockets of hope sought - The
textile sector's problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pakistan's large textile industry is reeling under the pressure of more than
two years of losses suffered by most of the country's spinning units. As a
result, many textile industrialists are convinced that they will not be able
to recover, unless bailed out by the government.
'The industry is heading towards collapse,' complains Mr Riaz Tata, chairman
of the All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association, (APTMA) the national
association of the textile industry.
The spinning sector has been hit hardest by the crisis. According to Mr
Tata, up to 30 per cent of the country's 8.3m spindles have been forced to
stop production. Some officials estimate that up to 90 per cent of the
largest 446 spinning units have defaulted on bank loans.
Once again this year, the extent of the problem will be determined by the
cotton crop, which the government hopes will reach its estimated 9.5m bales,
as opposed to newspaper forecasts of a possible shortfall of at least 1m
bales. After crop failures for two years in a row, Pakistan's textile sector
can ill afford another year of failure which would only lead to higher raw
material prices.
Despite such concerns, the government is convinced that recent agreements
with the European Union and the US to increase the quotas for Pakistan's
textiles would help to improve exports. That could be crucial for the
country's trade balance as it relies for up to 60 per cent of its export
earnings on cotton-related products.
At the same time, Islamabad has agreed to open up its domestic market to
garment imports as part of the government's commitment to reduce tariffs to
an average 35 per cent by July 1996, from more than 75 per cent.
'The sky is the limit. It now depends on the industry,' says Mr Ahmed
Mukhtar, the commerce minister, who has been urging businesses to become
more competitive in response to the new opportunities. Senior officials at
the commerce ministry are convinced that improvements in the quality of
T-shirts and fabrics during the past few years will help the country's
exports, and create new pockets of hope for the textile sector.
The ministry is urging exporters to enter into joint ventures with
established foreign enterprises in quality garments, so that they can have a
stronger edge over their international competitors. 'A shirt costing the
equivalent of USDollars 8 in Pakistan can fetch at least twice that price in
retail on Oxford Street in London. We have to become aggressive enough to be
able to force our way ahead,' says one official.
Some exporters take the cue from such encouragement and say that they are
prepared to meet the challenge. 'There are countries that don't have cotton
of their own, and they are competitive and surviving,' says Sheikh Mohammad
Obaid, Pakistan's largest exporter of towels and bed-linen.
Mr Obaid discounts fears over the effects of the cotton losses and expects
the new quotas to generate increasedbusiness. He now wants to see a greater
push towards manufacture of quality garments so that textile exports
generate more revenue.
However, Mr Tata is convinced that the textile sector will need to improve
its own performance after years of neglect. He believes the government
should immediately privatise the large public sector banks, so that the
money which is wasted in the large administrative costs for running
over-staffed and inefficient banks could instead be used to give more credit
to businesses.
Other industrialists are also urging the government to introduce stringent
regulations for grading of cotton and improved quality of ginning, so that
the textile business can prepare itself to produce internationally
recognised products. 'The quality of ginning is not up to international
standards,' concedes Mr Mukhtar.
Senior officials say that the government has begun to look at these problems
with a view to introducing a new system of selecting quality cotton before
it is processed. Despite the country's ambitious targets, especially after
the recent quota increases, some industrialists are convinced that a
solution to the spinning crisis holds one of the most important keys to
long-term growth prospects.
In an effort to stimulate growth in all sectors of the economy including
textiles, the maximum bank lending rate has been lowered from 19 per cent to
17.5 per cent this month. The government has also waived interest payments
on loans given by the public sector banks since 1992 to help the textile
sector repay its debts.
However, it may be some time before any signs of recovery become evident.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (12): Keen for competition / Profile of
Atlas Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, more than four decades ago, a young reporter with leftist leanings
resigned from his job in protest after his editor was arrested in an
anti-left clampdown, he began a journey which has made him one of Pakistan's
most successful businessmen.
Mr Yusuf Shirazi, chairman of the Karachi-based Atlas group which owns seven
companies listed on the stock market, now wants his country to make a
similar sharp turn around away from years of government-backed industrial
growth to one driven by its own competitive edge.
He is convinced that Pakistan's acceptance of International Monetary Fund
conditionalities and the government's decision to reduce tariffs in line
with the new global trade agreement, will force businesses to prepare for
stronger international competition - 'the entrepreneurialism should now
begin, led by competitiveness, rather than state subsidy. Only the fittest
will survive,' he says.
Mr Shirazi claims that Atlas group has succeeded in keeping up with changing
times. Starting with an initial investment of Rs500,000 in 1962, Atlas has
now emerged as one of the leading companies on Pakistan's business horizon.
Some of its more visible interests include insurance, investment banking and
leasing, as well as a Honda car plant which opened this year in Lahore, a
Honda motor-cycle factory, an engineering spares company and a vehicle
battery production plant.
Results for its listed companies last year saw profits rise to Rs437.5m and
paid-up capital at Rs1.1bn (Dollars 35m). Fixed assets stood at Rs5bn
(Dollars 160m) and sales reached Rs8bn (Dollars 255m). Earnings per share
for the entire group were Rs4.37, or roughly 40 per cent of paid-up capital.
On the back of that success, the group's plans include exporting motorcycles
to Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ghana and the Middle East.
The Atlas investment bank and leasing companies are also examining prospects
for opening branches in the UK, Middle East and south-east Asia.
Mr Shirazi concedes, however, that doing business is not always easy.
Policies pursued by successive Pakistani governments, for example, exempted
from tax under-developed parts of the country, giving these areas large
incentives to encourage industrial growth. This placed areas of developed
industry at a severe disadvantage, denting profit margins. Mr Shirazi also
criticises the taxation system - he is well placed to do so, having served
as a tax official for almost eight years). One of the biggest problems faced
by many businesses is the growing practice of deducting tax at source,
rather than allowing businesses to pay at the end of the year, he says. As a
result, the system is abused with some employees of the tax department
allegedly demanding up to 38 per cent of the refunds in bribes.
Mr Shirazi retains a strong belief in Pakistan's future, even if some
problems make the country look 'unpromising' in the short term.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (10): Surge of foreign capital - The
growing multinational presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan has opened its arms to overseas investment with some of the most
liberal economic policies yet seen in Asia: it has been rewarded with an
inflow of foreign capital which is the envy of some of its neighbours.
In the past four years, successive governments have reduced tariffs;
deregulated the market; made the rupee fully convertible; and begun to
sell-off state industries. The moves, encouraged by the World Bank and IMF,
have resulted in a total of Dollars 1.24bn of direct investment being
attracted since 1990.
Portfolio investment has risen to Dollars 865m - a figure likely to rise
sharply after the public listing earlier this year of Pakistan
Telecommunications, the state telephone company.
While foreign fund managers have been wooed by privatisation, more than 200
multinational companies have embarked on joint ventures and partial
acquisitions. Their presence is reflected on the Karachi Stock Exchange,
where the KSE-100 is peppered with foreign names such as ICI, Lever
Brothers, Glaxo, Shell and Reckitt &amp; Colman.
The government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has also signed a host of lucrative
investment deals which, according to the Overseas Investors Chamber of
Commerce, could push the total value of direct investment beyond Dollars
25bn by the end of the decade.
'It is an extremely positive environment for foreign investment,' says Mr
Nisar Memon, president of the chamber. 'We've seen an acceleration which has
surprised even those who said it would never happen.'
The cynics point out, however, that initial contracts signed by overseas
companies may not be taken up. There is also concern that the growth in
portfolio investment has not been matched by any sizeable increase in direct
investment. This has remained steady at Dollars 300m-Dollars 350m a year,
while portfolio investment has increased from Dollars 84m in 1990 to Dollars
339m last year.
'The challenge now for the government has to be converting portfolio
investment into direct investment,' says Mr Farrukh Khan, chief executive of
Karachi-based BMA Capital Management. 'For that to happen there has to be
better infrastructure, consistent policies and a solution to the law and
order problem.'
With limited reserves to spend on infrastructure projects and no end in
sight to violence in Karachi, the government is in a difficult position. It
has secured some invaluable investment projects - dominated by the Dollars
1.6bn Hub power project, backed by National Power of Britain and Xenel of
Saudi Arabia - and others are tantalisingly close. But business leaders warn
that unless it gets a grip on unrest in the commercial capital, the
investment effort will be undermined.
Mr Byram Avari, chairman of the diversified Avari hotels and manufacturing
group, warns: 'Direct investment will suffer if disorder worsens. Pakistan
may be considered too risky and companies could have trouble raising loans
for developments.'
There are similar concerns at ANZ Grindlays Bank, where general manager, Mr
Azhar Hamid says: 'We need strong arm tactics to control the situation. If
Sindh and Karachi are not stable it will be a serious blow to investor
confidence.'
At the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce, Mr Memon admits security
measures could affect the cost of setting up in Pakistan but he takes heart
from the fact that most multinationals have maintained a presence despite
periodic outbreaks of violence.
The government has played down the security fears, concentrating instead on
its privatisation record - Rs13bn has been raised from the sale of 60 state
companies - and its success in attracting investment from south-east Asia
and the Pacific Rim.
Its satisfaction is understandable. Toyota, Honda and Suzuki have
established joint ventures; South Korea's Hyundai Motors has submitted
outline plans for a plant in Lahore and, in the biggest deal yet, Hong Kong
business leader Gordon Wu has signed an agreement to build an Dollars 8bn
coal-fired power station.
Investors in the energy sector have also stepped up their activity. Union
Texas Petroleum plans to spend Dollars 173m over the next three years, while
Lasmo - the UK exploration group - is moving towards full production in its
Kadanwari gas field, where Dollars 180m has been invested.
Mr Joel Dykstra, business co-ordinator at Lasmo's international division,
says the group may consider bidding for state-owned gas facilities. National
Power is looking at Pakistani privatisation issues too. Mr Philip Smith,
director of treasury, says it 'would take an interest where there's an
opportunity to develop a stake'.
All this suggests that overseas executives are not as concerned about the
law and order problem as their Pakistani counterparts, but other hurdles
remain. One senior western economist in Islamabad warns that difficulties in
raising debt finance could slow down the pace of investment.
Concerns remain that corruption, too, may prove a powerful deterrent to some
companies. One foreign executive, who asked not to be named, says his
company paid Dollars 3.6m to 'fixing agents' who helped secure a lucrative
deal.
Emerging markets analysts in London warn that although Pakistan has stolen a
march on its neighbours, growing investment opportunities in countries such
as India may dent the inflow of foreign capital. 'Companies and institutions
are using spare cash to chase these deals. If something deterred them or
they saw better prospects elsewhere, the flow could dry up in six months,'
says one analyst. Some investors are also said to have been unnerved by the
government's handling of the PTC sale, which was overshadowed by errors in
its prospectus and problems with voucher distribution.
With Dollars 15bn of privatisations planned before the end of the decade,
the government is, therefore, keen to reassure investors and has turned to
the Pakistan Investment Board to help overseas companies. This provides a
one-stop shop which smoothes the way through the bureaucratic maze and
obtains ministerial authority for new projects. 'We market a package of
incentives tailored to investors' needs,' says Mr Mohib Ullah Shah,
secretary of the PIB.
Citing its success in winning approval for new investment, he adds that ICI
Pakistan received clearance for a Dollars 400m plant to manufacture pure
terephthalic acid within 30 days.
Mr Naseem Mirza, chairman of the company, was impressed. 'There was a time
when that would have taken three years,' he says. 'We have overcome the
problems because we've been here for a long time. New investors have more
anxieties - for them it may not be so easy.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Soda ash leads to much more /
Profile of ICI Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon after arriving at Khewra, Mr Richard Banks decided that the salt mines
of the Punjab would sustain a lucrative new offshoot for Imperial Chemical
Industries, as the British group was then known.
His 1929 excursion - overland to Marseilles, steamer to Bombay and train to
Lahore - proved extremely worthwhile. The business, founded on soda ash, has
grown into one of the company's most important overseas subsidiaries -
boasting sales last year of Rs4.7bn.
'ICI had expansionist ideas and a number of us were selected to go foreign
parts,' recalls Mr Banks, now aged 92. 'The company knew it would have to
start manufacturing overseas, and it wanted to find the best sites.'
By negotiating a deal to extract Khewra's salt free of tax, the ICI engineer
enabled his employers to exploit cheap reserves of the basic material for
soda ash, an important ingredient in products such as soap, paper and glass.
He helped persuade the company to set up a manufacturing plant in what was
to become Pakistan, a country where today it is a leading supplier of not
just soda ash, but also polyester fibres, paints, agrochemicals and seeds,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer products.
Rising demand for those activities, with the exception of agrochemicals,
helped lift pre-tax profits last year by 30 per cent to Rs639.5m.
From its beginnings at Khewra, ICI Pakistan - in which the UK parent retains
a 61 per cent holding - has become the fourth largest company on the Karachi
stock exchange with fixed assets of Rs1.36bn and reserves of Rs128.6m.
Mr Naseem Mirza, chairman and chief executive, says the company's strategy
has not changed much since Mr Banks was dispatched from England. 'We want to
grow aggressively where we have market strengths and step out into new
areas.'
As part of that vision, ICI Pakistan plans to spend Dollars 400m on building
a chemicals plant to manufacture pure terephthalic acid, used in producing
polyester fibre.
The plant will have a capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year, and represents one
of the country's largest-ever industrial investments.
The company will also spend up to Rs4bn to expand its polyester stable fibre
operations in Sheikhupura, increasing capacity by 50,000 tonnes a year,
while investing a further Rs200m on a new power generation facility and
Rs15m plant to manufacture calcium carbonate at Khewra.
It is spending another Rs1bn to expand its soda ash capacity in Punjab by
50,000 tonnes a year, and is installing a new plant to manufacture 10,000
tonnes of sodium bicarbonate.
By investing more than Rs3bn on expanding its businesses over the past 10
years, ICI Pakistan has emerged with considerable muscle in the increasingly
important industrial lobby. Unlike smaller companies, it has no reservations
about offering advice to the government on economic policy.
In its last annual report, the company says the government must mobilise
resources 'particularly to improve population control, health, education and
infrastructure'.
It also calls for the 'elimination of exemptions and concessions given in
the past, which, according to some estimates amount to a staggering Rs18bn
per annum in lost revenue'.
Mr Mirza applauds government efforts to liberalise the economy and attract
foreign investors, but he warns the Bhutto administration not to neglect the
interests of its largest domestic companies.
While welcoming the principle of tariff reductions, he adds: 'To suddenly
dismantle the tariffs would be a disaster. All industry in Pakistan have
been helped by (protection) barriers, so there must be help to adjust.'
Before considering its latest round of investment - funded from borrowing
and rights issues - the group also sought government assurances that fiscal
policies would remain consistent.
Mr Mirza, who has an armed guard outside his office in Karachi, wants the
government to take action too on curbing violence in the city.
'This is the gateway to Pakistan and this is where everyone arrives first.
We must get the law and order situation sorted out or it could create
anxieties among new investors.'
ICI Pakistan, however, has no such anxieties. As it prepares to celebrate
the fiftieth anniversary of soda ash production, Mr Mirza says it is here to
stay.
'This is a good place to invest,' says the chairman. 'But as we have found
out, you must have the right products and make sure that they can capture
the market.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (13): Easier on the gas -
Aluminium cars are coming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK Royal Commission report on environmental pollution, expressing concern
at worsening air quality in urban areas, in October called for the fuel
efficiency of the typical family car to be increased by 40 per cent over the
next 11 years.
It provided no concrete suggestions as to how this might be achieved. Motor
industry chiefs immediately rejected the call as 'technically impossible'.
What they really meant was that over that period cars could be made very
much more frugal with fuel than they are now. But to come anywhere near the
Commission's target would not only mean using all the technology and new
materials now becoming available but would require cars to be made much more
austere than even the greenest-minded driver could accept.
There is a motor industry rule of thumb that if a car can be made 10 per
cent lighter, it will go 6-7 per cent further per unit of fuel consumed.
If electric windows, central locking, sunroofs, audio systems,
air-conditioning and other non-essentials were to be tossed out - along with
the mass of motor, servos, actuators and other hardware needed to operate
them - a weight saving of around 25 per cent should be achievable. (The
first Volkswagen Golf of 1974 weighed 250kg less than the 1,000kg of the
current version.)
The saving would be considerably higher yet if anti-lock brakes, airbag
systems, side anti-intrusion bars and other recent safety innovations were
abandoned.
Without all this heavy equipment, fuel consumption would be further cut by
being able to use a smaller engine and lightersuspension and wheels.
Clearly, only the most militant environmentalist would advocate such a
radical approach (particularly since some of the extra weight comprises
catalytic converters for exhaust emissions).
In energy efficiency terms, therefore, the new car of the year 2005 is much
more likely to be a compromise.
While all this heavy equipment will stay on board, fuel savings will come
partly from further improvements in internal combustion engines, both petrol
and diesel.
Today's petrol engine, with multi-valves, fuel injection and electronic
management already uses about one-third less fuel than a simpler,
similarly-sized and carburettor-fed unit in a similar sized vehicle of the
1970s.
But weight is the central factor - and the car of a decade hence seems set
to shed lots of it thanks to a fierce 'battle for the bodyshell' being
fought out between the steel and aluminium industries.
Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary and Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) say
that the revolutionary aluminium spaceframe body of Audi's recently-launched
A8 luxury car is 40 per cent lighter than it would have been if made of
steel. They also maintain that such lightweight bodies can be introduced
cost-effectively in high-volume production cars within a decade.
Steel makers from around the world have struck back by launching a
collaborative project aimed at designing the lightest possible bodyshell
using the latest, high-strength steels. They claim that a 20 per cent weight
saving is possible by optimising current designs using current manufacturing
systems, and that 35 per cent is achievable with all-new designs using the
most advanced technology.
Two weeks ago, Ford, the world's second biggest vehicle maker, and Aluminium
Company of Canada (Alcan) reconfirmed their determination to ensure viable
production of aluminium cars early in the next century.
Initially, just like Audi's A8, Ford expects aluminium cars to make their
appearance at the top of Ford's product range and only gradually filter down
into cheaper, higher-volume cars, according to Mr Bill Stueff, manager of
Ford's vehicle systems engineering.
But an indication of the potential is provided by the AIV
(aluminium-intensive vehicle) which the two companies are using as the
showcase for their aluminium technology. It is 318kg (700lb) lighter than
Ford's steel bodied Taurus/Mercury Sable model on which it is based and with
which it shares almost identical equipment.
The bodyshell is 182kg, a full 47 per cent lighter than the steel
equivalent; the additional 126kg difference represents the 'knock-on'
savings from smaller, lighter brakes and other components.
Crucially, in Ford's view, the AIV and the processes developed by Alcan,
Ford and a third partner, Ciba Polymers, allow it to be made mainly by
conventional motor industry manufacturing methods, thereby avoiding the need
for largescale investment in new plant and equipment.
Alcan's 'AVT' (Aluminium Vehicle Technology) process uses a mixture of spot
welding and bonding with a Ciba-developed epoxy adhesive to join sheet
aluminium pressings. By welding and bonding, lighter gauges of aluminium can
be used than would be the case with spot welding alone.
That the partners are serious is in no doubt: to date Alcan alone has spent
Dollars 100m on research with current annual spending running at Dollars
10m; Ford has invested Dollars 35m and a fleet of 40 AIVs are undergoing
field trials. They are said to have exceeded 50,000 miles of rough usage and
will be durability tested well beyond 100,000 miles.
Many problems remain, such as the need to optimise vehicle design while
remaining compatible with the plant and machinery that will still turn out
steel cars for a very long time. Even Alcan admits that there will be a cost
premium for such cars, although not too big to deter consumers.
The aluminium producers acknowledge that they use much more more primary
energy than the steel makers. But they maintain that the overall balance is
tipped back in their favour by aluminium's easier recyclability and the
on-road fuel savings. For example, with the 20 per cent fuel saving arising
from a 25 per cent overall weight reduction, a mid-sized aluminium family
car would use 600 gallons less fuel over 100,000 miles.
It is not quite that simple, however. An aluminium car would actually
contain several alloys, which would have to be separated before being
successfully recycled.
As Mr Don MacMillan, vice president and general manager of Alcan's
automotive division, acknowledges, it is not practical to expect scrapyard
workers to take three days to take apart every scrapped car with spanners.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (12): The problem is in the east
 -Global warming experts think again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears about global warming have provided much of the impetus behind the
energy efficiency programmes of Western countries. But governments have been
slower to introduce many long-promised measures than environmentalists
hoped.
Meanwhile, some politicians, economists and industrialists are now
questioning the scientific basis for these fears.
For some years scientists have been predicting that if concentrations of
'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere continued to increase, the earth could
warm up.
Governments took those predictions seriously enough to agree, at the 1992
Rio Earth Summit, that the risk deserved their attention. Industrialised
countries pledged to draw up plans for bringing emissions of greenhouse
gases back to 1990 levels in the year 2000, while developing countries
committed themselves to promoting energy efficiency.
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, produced when organic material,
including fossil fuels, is burnt. Policies to combat global warming have
therefore concentrated on limiting carbon dioxide. Emissions of other gases
which are incriminated, such as methane, are harder to measure and to
control, and have so far inspired less political effort.
Governments' main policy tool in trying to draw up plans for curbing carbon
emissions has been higher taxes on energy in order to encourage more energy
efficiency. However such proposals have run into fierce political opposition
in many countries.
In the European Union, the proposed tax on energy and its carbon content has
stalled, even though this is the only tool the EU has at its disposal for
meeting the Rio targets. US President Bill Clinton's proposals for energy
taxes, drawn up after Rio, met a similar fate. In the UK, the government's
decision to introduce value-added tax on heating fuel provoked a ferocious
political row, although steep annual increases on motor fuel and car
licences have proved less controversial.
Moreover, in the past few years, some of the political momentum has been
taken out of the issue by recession, which has proved unexpectedly effective
at restraining emissions. It has, just as importantly, reduced the amount of
money available in many countries for spending on measures to encourage
energy efficiency directly, such as household insulation.
At the same time, a chorus of scepticism about the level of the threat posed
by global warming has become louder. It has questioned the legislative and
economic effort devoted to the problem, and arguably has made it harder to
force through politically controversial measures.
The essence of the science which underpins the predictions is not contested.
Physicists agree that greenhouse gases can trap heat which is emitted from
the earth's surface and so prevent it passing into space.
But there is still scientific disagreement about the prediction that if the
concentrations of these gases build up, the earth will warm up. There is
even more disagreement about the amount of warming that might reasonably be
expected.
The best current predictions of the four leading models of climate change
used worldwide suggest that, if carbon dioxide levels double, the world will
warm up by between 1.9C and 5.2C from existing levels.
Mr Bruce Callander, head of the working party which weighs up scientific
research for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
acknowledges that there are still problems with the models. Taking account
of the behaviour of clouds and oceans remains the biggest difficulty, he
says.
While the IPCC is emphatic that the risk of warming should be taken
seriously, it points out too that scientists will need years more data
before they know whether the predictions are accurate.
Global warming is one of the most difficult examples of a conundrum which
politicians increasingly face: how to make policy, which may have
considerable economic repercussions, when science is uncertain.
Cost-benefit analysis, of the kind now modish in environmental economics,
offers little assistance in the case of global warming, given that the
probabilities of the threat are so hard to calculate.
Moreover, there is intense debate, both scientific and economic, about
whether a small degree of warming in the earth's atmosphere would be harmful
or beneficial. Some countries, such as Russia, have suggested that they
could benefit, as they would be able to farm previously ice-bound regions.
Such points have highlighted one of the most controversial aspects of the
international debate on climate change: the unequal distribution between
countries of the costs of warming, and the costs of mitigation.
Increasingly, as they try to put together plans to meet the Rio
stipulations, industrialised countries are wondering whether they would do
better to spend money helping improve energy efficiency in developing
countries.
The collapse of the former Soviet Union and Eastern European economies has
temporarily restrained the rise of global emissions. But although the
introduction of new technology into Eastern and Central Europe is greatly
improving their energy efficiency, the emissions from those countries will
soon begin to rise again as their economies pick up.
Meanwhile, the industrialisation and the population growth of China and
India, and China's heavy dependence on coal, means that their carbon
emissions are rising steeply.
As developed countries which have ratified the Rio convention struggle to
persuade their citizens to turn off lights as they leave the room, put only
one cup of water in the kettle and walk rather than drive to the shops, they
are beginning to ask more urgently than before whether the most efficient
way of tackling global warming is not to start with the energy consumption
of the developing world.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (9): Privatisation flagship - Case study
/ Pakistan Telecommunications - As the country celebrates this year's first
public offer of shares in the Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC),
no one can be entirely certain of the company's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government claims that the offer of PTC shares is a huge success. But
some analysts regard it as a grave setback - possibly one which has left the
PTC's reputation in tatters.
At the root of the controversy lies the claim that clients were provided
with misleading information about the scale of the company's operations and
the number of lines in use before 6m shares, representing 12 per cent of
PTC, were placed on the markets in Pakistan and abroad this year.
This included 1m shares, sold through vouchers of 100 shares each, in
Pakistan. After a strong show of public interest in that effort, the
government abruptly changed the initial terms and decided to keep all the
subscription money.
But that triggered protests from brokers and investors, many of whom
expected to make windfall profits of up to 160 per cent, based on
projections for future price rises.
At the same time, some bankers also expressed concern over the government's
last-minute decision to cancel an agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland
(UBS) for a subsequent placement of 5m shares in international markets.
The cancellation came in response to protests from investors, many of whom
claimed that the price for the international placement was undervalued and
would then force down the market value of shares already sold in Pakistan.
In the light of that criticism, a contract for the placement of the 5m
shares was given to Jardine Fleming. That placement brought in approximately
Dollars 900m, as opposed to an earlier estimate of Dollars 500m.
This gave Pakistan an opportunity to claim that it was right in changing the
terms of the sale.
But that view has hardly helped to save the company's face, especially in
view of the subsequent troubles over the disclosure of information. In less
than three months, share prices have fallen by over 20 per cent, due to the
uncertainty.
Among other troubles, a delay in the declaration of the results for the
fiscal year ending this June has also intensified anxieties among investors.
Despite these difficulties, the government continues to insist that its
plans remain on track. Some officials claim that problems such as the delay
in the results have occurred because the government is carrying out detailed
assessment of the company's assets, so that future investors are provided
full information.
'We want to give confidence to the investor that the telecommunication
sector will not be part of the whim and fancy of a state, but that anybody
who comes within the framework (of the new terms) will know very clearly
what his rights and what his obligations are,' explains Mr Shahid Aziz
Siddiqui, a senior official in the government's communications ministry and
a member of the PTC's board of directors.
According to Mr Siddiqui, the company's new management will have exclusive
rights to the market for up to seven years, so that it has a certain degree
of security.
The government plans to start inviting offers by the end of next summer from
'strategic investors' - a term used to describe large telephone companies or
business groups which are willing to buy at least 26 per cent of the shares
and take over the management. If there are no further delays, the new
management may step in by early 1996.
Some officials expect strong international competition, based on the
different companies which have made inquiries. According to one official
involved in the preparation of the privatisation plan, these have included
AT&amp;T, Australian Telecom, Singapore Telecom, Alcatel and Cable &amp; Wireless.
In addition to inviting these offers, it is planned that a new company shall
be set up, called the National Telecommunications Corporation (NTC), to
provide service to the defence forces and government offices. This is in
response to concern that private ownership, especially foreign, taking over
the telephone company would create new security risks for the country. These
concerns have delayed privatisation efforts for almost three years.
Some businessmen are worried that Islamabad risks alienating international
investors if there are any further delays.
'The more the delay, the greater the possibility that companies looking at
PTC will look elsewhere,' cautions Mr Farooq Hasan, chairman of Paktel,
Pakistan's largest mobile telephone company, a joint venture with Britain's
Cable &amp; Wireless as the lead foreign partner.
'Nowadays, there are other countries which are trying to privatise the
telephone business, too,' he adds.
However, Mr Hasan concedes that the government faces a dilemma, because of
all the work that needs to be done, such as the provision of full financial
details and preparation of the latest company results - 'they face a dilemma
too, the PTC cannot be given when it is only half-cooked,' he says.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (8): Hopes pinned on new rules - Banking
and bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Badruddin Khan, president of Schon Bank, in Karachi - Pakistan's newest
private bank - laments from his office in the heart of the business district
at Chundrigar Road, that very few poor people come to his bank to do
business.
He wants to open two branches in the city for small merchants, fruit
vendors, grocery sellers and traders in cheap consumer items, in order to
find clients who would otherwise stay away from the fast-moving business
quarters.
Mr Khan has joined the ranks of bankers who are becoming cautious over a
history of bad bank debts, and who feel that small borrowers may be more
reliable than large and influential ones.
In a country where public sector banks are reeling under the pressure of
almost Rs76bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in bad loans, almost no one is convinced that
all the money can ever be recovered.
Many of these loans were given out under political pressures during the past
two decades, following nationalisation of the banks in the early 1970s. That
legacy has cast a shadow over the future of the country's two largest
public-sector banks - Habib Bank and United Bank - which successive
Pakistani governments have planned to privatise for more than four years.
The two banks are together faced with a 'classified debt', or loans which
are difficult to recover, worth almost Rs34bn. That is almost one quarter of
their combined portfolios at Rs140bn.
The government claims that stronger regulatory powers, given to the central
bank last year to monitor new loans from banks, will at least help to ensure
that the extent of bad loans does not increase. If that policy works, it may
in time reduce the portion of such loans in overall lendings and help give
stability to the financial system.
'The bad debts may not come down sharply but, with growth in lending, they
will decline in their overall proportion,' says Mr VA Jafarey, the prime
minister's adviser on finance.
Whatever the future trend, Mr Khan is encouraged that the past legacy of the
bad loans comes with a silver lining. He hopes that private banks will
eventually attract more clients, especially those looking for efficient
services and better profits. Drawing a lesson from that bitter past, Mr Khan
wants his bank to diversify beyond traditional commercial banking, to become
involved in a wide variety of activities which would also minimise the risks
attached to lendings - 'in a couple of years, new demands for merchant
banking, financial and brokerage houses will be made on the market,' he
says, forecasting his bank's future in a changing corporate environment.
A few kilometres up the road, at the offices of Muslim Commercial Bank -
Pakistan's first public sector bank to be privatised, three years ago  - Mr
Hussain Lawai, the president, is convinced that private banking is the way
of the future. 'The performance of public sector banks could improve if the
management is handed over to the private sector,' he says. The MCB's record
supports his claim. Profits have doubled, and deposits have trebled in the
three years since privatisation.
In addition to the nine new local commercial banks which have begun business
since licences for private banks were issued in 1991, Mr Lawai sees a bright
future for foreign banks. Deregulation on foreign exchange has encouraged
many Pakistanis to deposit their savings in foreign currency, to seek added
protection against devaluation of the rupee and possibly as a way to
facilitate foreign travel.
Some bankers are convinced that new contracts signed this year in the energy
sector, worth up to Dollars 12bn, have created opportunities for foreign
banks to further improve their impressive performance of recent years.
According to estimates by Pakistan's central bank, all the local commercial
banks (public and private) had total deposits worth Rs436bn by the end of
this summer at their 7,738 branches across the country. However, the foreign
banks, with a total of 74 branches, had deposits of approximately Rs120bn,
or more than a quarter of those of Pakistani banks.
'The nationalised banking sector has become so inefficient that new
commercial and investment banks have an opportunity to eat into their market
share,' says Mr Nessar Ahmed, president of Cresbank, one of the 11
investment banks. However, such optimism does not hide the memory of this
year's large banking scandal involving the Mehran Bank - a private bank.
The bank's chief operating officer was arrested on charges of fraud, after
allegations that he had given large loans to influential clients in return
for personal favours which eventually led him to amass a fortune running
into several hundred million rupees. The government claims credit for moving
fast to protect depositors' interests in that bank, despite concerns over
inadequate laws.
Even if Pakistan is able to live up to the challenge of regulating private
banks to protect consumer interests, the sector would still be left to deal
with the public sector banks. Some bankers say that, before putting up the
two banks for privatisation, the government will have to reveal their exact
financial picture, and give the new management full power to hire and fire
in order to trim over-staffed operations.
'When we bring these issues (banks) to the market, we would have to make a
full disclosure, and that is the only way to get a genuine investor,'
concedes Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the privatisation commission,
responding to those concerns. Despite that commitment, no one knows what the
response would be to such an offer.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (10): Poacher turned gamekeeper
/ Profile of Robert Jones MP - Britain's new Mr Save-It
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The task of making Britain more energy efficient belongs to Mr Robert Jones,
the newly appointed junior minister at the Department of the Environment.
Although the UK has previously had energy ministers with a brief to raise
energy efficiency, this is the first time anyone has formally carried the
title.
It was an unusual choice. Mr Jones was previously chairman of the Select
Committee on the Environment in the House of Commons where he grilled
ministers and officials on Britain's rather mixed performance on energy
saving. Last year, he produced a report which effectively said that
government policy in the area was too weak, and put forward a string of
recommendations.
Some people have therefore viewed the appointment as 'poacher turned
gamekeeper', though he is highly regarded in the energy efficiency business
itself.
'He comes to the job with great knowledge and sympathy for the subject',
says Mr Andrew Warren of the Association for the Conservation of Energy.
'But people also have high expectations of what he can achieve.'
Now, he is in the hot seat himself. How does the view look from there? 'We
are achieving a lot, but there's also a lot of complacency around,' he says.
The progress has come mainly in industry, he thinks, where companies have
become much more cost-conscious, and are taking serious steps to reduce
energy consumption. The government is backing this up with advice schemes,
help with eco-audits and management standards.
The UK is also 'doing quite well' by international standards. 'Our building
regulations take us close to the top, well ahead of countries like Germany,'
he says. He is also encouraged by the initiatives taken by local authorities
to save energy, and by the government's target of reducing its own energy
consumption by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1996.
The complacency Mr Jones sees is mainly in the residential/commercial sector
where energy is only a small part of people's costs. Moreover, householders
do not bother to compare one quarter's electricity and gas bills with the
same quarter the year before, so they have little idea of the energy trends
in their own homes.
'We do need to get over the fact that more than half of global warming gases
come from buildings,' he says.
The government has been running a publicity campaign to sharpen people's
awareness of the risks of global warming. It recently turned the pressure up
with a fresh campaign which is supposed to make them actually do something
about it. The Pounds 6m campaign, using the message 'Wasting energy costs
the Earth', is based on dinosaur figures because they appeal to children who
tend to be much more responsive than adults to appeals of this kind.
Mr Jones has also been asking banks to provide free energy ratings for homes
when advancing mortgages to house purchasers. From next July, new building
regulations will require all new dwellings to be given an energy efficiency
rating.
The campaign comes on top of the government's highly controversial
imposition of VAT on home heating in last year's Budget. But the effects of
this tax are being eroded by the decline in gas and electricity prices. Does
Mr Jones think taxes should be pushed up further to keep up the pressure?
'Rather than jack up energy taxes, I would prefer to concentrate on
educating people,' he says. 'We don't want to add unnecessarily to their
costs.'
In fact, the trend in prices reinforces the government's view that it needs
to use other weapons besides price, such as persuasion, publicity, and pump
priming exercises, particularly for low income households. But Mr Jones
opposes further legislation to enforce energy efficiency. In a recent House
of Commons debate, he told MPs that he thought sufficient progress was being
achieved without adding to the legislative burden.
This concern about costs also lies behind Britain's resistance to an EU plan
for a carbon tax, which Mr Jones thinks would greatly harm the
competitiveness of European industry if it was imposed unilaterally. 'We
should look at this on a world basis,' he says.
Mr Jones concedes that there is still doubt about the seriousness of the
risk of global warming. But he says this is expressed 'by a tiny minority of
scientists'. And he believes that energy efficiency is still a worthy goal
in its own right because it increases industrial competitiveness, and saves
householders money.
He remains confident that the UK will be able to reach its target of
reducing CO to 1990 levels by the year 2000 under its Earth Summit
commitments. The next point to be considered is what happens after that, and
international negotiations have only just started.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (11): Don't forget the dinosaurs
 -UK has no target but could do 20% better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are looking at a model of the Dinodome' said Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, with an embarrassed laugh. On the table before him
stood a plastic dome with models of what looked like dinosaurs wearing human
dress.
In fact, that was precisely what they were. Mr Gummer was launching the
government's latest energy efficiency drive: 'Wasting energy costs the
earth' - a campaign is typical of the policy adopted by the government to
encourage energy efficiency in the UK.
It is based on what it calls 'partnership', a voluntary effort by
government, homeowners and businessmen to work together to achieve the
energy reduction goals. Shortly after the dinosaurs were launched, the
government squashed an attempt by opposition parties to introduce an energy
efficiency Bill into parliament on the grounds that it would add to costs
and regulation.
There is no official target for energy efficiency in the UK, though Mr
Robert Atkins, one of Mr Gummer's ministerial colleagues, told parliament
that he believed the UK economy could operate on 20 per cent less energy
than it does to-day. The more constraining target is the UK's commitment,
made at the Rio Earth Summit, to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990
levels by the year 2000. This implies a cut of some 10m tonnes a year, or
about 6-7 per cent.
However, the government's own research shows that despite earlier publicity
campaigns to raise awareness of global warming issues the public's knowledge
is still poor: one official poll showed that nearly half the population
confuses the issues of global warming and the ozone layer. The public's
willingness to invest in energy efficiency is also low. A poll by Projects
in Partnership, an independent group funded by the Department of the
Environment, found homeowners 'disinterested, confused and mistrustful'.
A year ago, the government took what it thought was a big step forward in
persuading people of the value of energy saving investment when it extended
 -after long deliberation - value added tax to home heating. VAT was
introduced at 8 per cent last April and will rise to the standard rate of 17
1/2 per cent next April. Although this conflicted with the 'partnership'
idea, the temptation for the Treasury to cash in on pressure for greater
energy efficiency was evidently irresistible.
However, the impact of this measure is already being eroded by the steady
decline in gas and electricity prices which has been caused by deregulation
and privatisation of the gas and power utilities. Some specialists believe
that the entire effect may be offset by the end of this decade - in which
case further measures may be needed to get the 1.5m tonne CO saving which
VAT was supposed to deliver.
This could strengthen the chances for further development of nuclear power.
Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, is currently
reviewing the future of the nuclear power industry, and he will weigh the
contribution that N-stations can make to reducing greenhouse gases when
deciding whether to authorise construction of further nuclear capacity.
Meanwhile, the government suffered another setback when the regulators of
the gas and electricity industries refused to sanction further levies on
consumers to fund the Energy Saving Trust, the agency which the government
had set up to subsidise and promote energy efficiency projects. Mr Eoin
Lees, the EST's chief executive, still hopes to be able to promote various
schemes, such as low energy light bulbs and self-financing improvements. But
until the government devises alternative ways of providing long-term
funding, the EST will not be able to fulfil its promised role.
Instead, much of the official energy saving effort is being directed through
Neighbourhood Energy Action, a government sponsored charity which has a
budget of Pounds 75m to help the heating problems of low income households.
A recent report by the Gas Consumers Council and the EST concluded that the
market for energy services (helping customers make better use of the energy
they buy) will not be helped by deregulation, at least in the short term.
Deregulation will stimulate competition to cut prices, and energy saving
will be sidelined.
The report says: 'Price reductions cannot go on indefinitely. But whilst
customers can get significant savings just by signing a new supply contract,
why should they be interested in having new process equipment or heating
controls/insulation fitted?'
The picture in industry is better. A recent report by Touche Ross, the
accountants, showed that energy intensive industry has taken steps to cut
its power bills because of the strategic importance of energy costs. But
less intensive industries still tend to treat spending on energy efficiency
as discretionary rather than vital.
Mr Simon Lloyd, the marketing director of BP Energy, one of the country's
largest industrial contract energy companies, says that energy management
has only 'scratched the surface' of the country's annual Pounds 9bn energy
bill. 'But attitudes are changing very fast now', he says, as companies try
to cut costs and protect themselves from the risk of changing energy prices.
However, this has yet to feed through to widespread use of combined heat and
power schemes. The government has a target of 4,000MW of additional
capacity, but so far only about 1,000MW has been built.
Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, says
that projects have been squeezed by adverse trends in power prices.
Electricity prices are falling, while contracts for gas on which CHP schemes
are based have been going up, contrary to the trend for gas generally.
Mr Green thinks the government should require all new power schemes to
provide heating as well - something it could enforce since the Department of
Trade and Industry has to approve all new electricity generation projects
over a certain size. This is the case in a number of other European
countries, such as Denmark, he points out, but government officials are
unsympathetic, taking the view that CHP 'should be able to stand on its own
two feet'.
One aspect of power generation which does get financial support is
alternative energy. The government will shortly announce a new round of
subsidy for renewable energy projects, though with public opposition to wind
power now increasing, even this aspect is not without controversy.
A further area where the government is being pressed is transport. The
recent report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution called for
a massive redirection of resources away from roads towards public transport
and other means of reducing traffic on grounds of pollution control and
energy efficiency.
However, the report received a cautious welcome from ministers because it
challenges many key aspects of government policy: the preference for roads,
the reluctance to subsidise public transport and the planning process. It
does, however, reinforce the policy of increasing fuel taxes, which the
government must welcome.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (7): Spurred on by foreign investors -
Stock Market Expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI

<TEXT>
In a year when the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has been forced to suspend
trading in at least two new share issues, amid concerns that investors'
interests were at risk, no one can take for granted the safety of investment
in Pakistani stocks.
However, the potential damage has not been enough to inhibit the market's
fast growth or a sharp rise in seat prices on the KSE.
In a closed shop of just under 200 members, prospective brokers need to
spend up to Rs27.5m (Dollars 800,000) to buy a licence in the open market -
three times more than was charged four years ago, when the country's
economic reforms allowed the entry of foreign investors.
Those reforms have attracted up to Dollars 800m from foreign investors.
Although still a small portion of the overall market capitalisation of
Dollars 13bn, the entry of foreign funds has prompted increased investment
by domestic investors. The market's average daily turnover has trebled to
10m shares since 1991, while capitalisation has almost doubled in the past
three years. As a result of increased business activity, at least six new
brokerage houses have been formed.
The changes have also given birth to a new breed of 'yuppies' who are fast
emerging in the market. According to Mr Nasir Bukhari, chief executive of
Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, a leading brokerage firm, up to half of the new
graduates from the country's two top management schools now want to join a
brokerage house. Before the reforms, virtually none wanted to. But behind
the impressive change, the KSE is still faced by concerns over lax laws and
a potentially 'overheated' environment.
'We asserted ourselves in such a way that we pre-empted any chance of the
small investor being misled,' is how Mr Yasin Lakhani, president of the KSE,
defends his record. Critics argue that this year's suspension of two new
issues hardly gives reason for comfort. The action was prompted when one
announced an excessively generous rights issue; while another did not
deliver share certificates to the public, even after receiving subscription
money.
The market 'is not becoming unsafe for investors - there are scandals and
dubious issues, which come in every market of the world,' comments Mr
Farrukh Khan, chief executive of BMA Capital Management, a leading brokerage
house, who also defends the record. However, he concedes that there is room
for changes to protect investors' interests.
He wants to see tighter regulations, to require underwriters to take full
legal responsibility for the prospectus issued before shares are brought to
the market. Mr Lakhani says the government is planning to increase the
powers of the KSE management, which can only suspend trading or delist a
company. Among other concerns, some foreign fund managers and their
representatives also complain of inadequate mechanisms to clamp down on
insider trading.
'The market is still not geared to deal aggressively with such issues,' says
one. 'This is not the New York stock exchange, but still, if it wants to be
taken seriously, it will have to prove that its taking action to prevent
fraud.'
Even if regulations are tightened, that alone will not resolve issues which
could prevent further growth. Investing in the market is yet to become a
popular concept for small Pakistani investors, many of whom still rely upon
bank deposits as their main investments.
According to Mr Khan, the KSE growth could take off if open-ended mutual
funds, pension funds and insurance companies from the domestic market were
allowed to invest freely. The government is reconsidering the rules on these
matters, but it is not clear how soon changes, if any, will be announced.
To keep up the investment momentum, Mr Lakhani is also urging the government
to announce a further five-year extension to a capital-gains exemption
before it expires next summer, to avoid uncertainty and large-scale
speculative trading.
Many brokers also see developments in the market as an important element in
the success of Pakistan's privatisation programme, especially the plans to
sell government-owned utilities. A beginning has been made this year with
the first international and domestic share offers in the giant Pakistan
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), the biggest company to be listed on
the KSE.
The government is considering plans to offer some of the power-generation
plants run by Water and Power Development Authority - Pakistan's largest
power company - during the next year, and at least one of the two largest
public-sector banks. It proposes that part of this will be through the KSE,
although the exact size of the offer has not yet been announced.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (6): The programme gathers pace -
Privatisation projects / telephone, power and shipping companies are being
lined up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beginning of the privatisation of Pakistan's telephone company, the PTC
(Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation), this year, could well be the most
important development in the country's four-year-old privatisation
programme.
So far, only small companies, making on average less than 2 per cent annual
profits as a proportion of turnover, have been offered for sale. Following
the sale of 65 such companies during the past four years, the government
plans to transfer a further 30 companies to the private sector by next
spring.
The importance of the public sector in the economy is obvious. Large and
small public sector companies account for about half of the manufacturing
sector, virtually all power generation and transmission, and a substantial
portion of banking.
But the sale of the PTC marks the start of the sale of what many would
regard as the 'family silver.'
Other potentially lucrative enterprises be which may offered next year
include portions of two large power companies, two gas companies, at least
one public sector bank, a government-owned shipping company and even
portions of the port.
'We are very much on a 'war footing' in the privatisation programme,' says
Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the national privatisation commission.
The offer of public sector utilities could be the most important step to
liven up the effort, he says. Among new ideas to increase public interest in
the offers, is scheme being considered by the government for registering a
privatisation fund on Pakistani stock markets. This would comprise shares of
state-owned companies, in which investors would be invited to buy shares
through mutual funds.
Despite Mr Qamar's confidence, and the novel concepts which are just being
attempted, there are few clear indications as to how far the programme can
be expected to succeed.
The government is convinced, however, that Pakistan's public sector
utilities can attract large investments from domestic and foreign investors.
The PTC (Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation) - the government-owned
telephone company which maintains an absolute monopoly, has alone been
estimated to be worth up to USDollars 20bn. The thermal power generation
units of the Water And Power Development Authority (Wapda) - the largest
power company of those due to be sold, could be worth another USDollars 5bn,
according to some estimates.
However, those claims by no means give the final figure. In recent weeks,
share prices in PTC have fallen, amid fresh selling pressures. The selling
followed fears which had arisen over allegations that investors were not
provided with accurate information when up to 6m shares were offered this
summer, in the company's first public offer. Senior officials say that the
ommission was merely an 'oversight' due more to inexperience than deliberate
misinformation. However, that experience has alerted the government to the
possibility of setbacks, unless future offers are planned properly, one
official involved with the privatisation effort claims privately.
Some investors are also concerned over the extent to which full financial
details of the companies being offered would be made available. Mr Qamar is
committed to providing full details on public sector organisations including
the large banks, currently reeling under the pressure of extensive bad
loans.
The PTC and WAPDA are also faced with large scale liabilities. Clients owe
more than Rs18bn (USDollars 580m) in unpaid bills to the two companies. The
government has announced that it will introduce new laws, carrying stiff
penalties for defaulters, but such measures still need to be enforced on a
large scale to demonstrate that an extensive campaign to recover the money
has prepared the ground to prevent further abuse of the companies.
However, some businessmen are convinced that the most crucial need is to
accelerate the pace of the programme.
'This process must be expedited because the longer these companies remain in
the public sector, the longer will be the demand on the public exchequer,'
says Mr Nisar Memon, Head of IBM's Pakistan operations and president of the
influential Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) which
represents foreign businesses in Pakistan.
Mr Memon is also concerned that the country's bureaucracy is still not
entirely in support, following years of official controls over lucrative
corporations. But he is convinced that such resistance can be easily
removed, if the government continues to press ahead aggressively.
In spite of initial fears of resistance from unions, there are so far few
signs of any labour unrest which could upset the government's plans. Workers
have been assured of job protection for up to one year following
privatisation.
The government has also given a commitment of a 'golden handshake' or a
large sum of money depending on an employee's length of service, if
redundancies are necessary.
However, Mr Memon wants to see new safeguards to prevent any social unrest
such as might resulting from sharp price rises after privatisation of
utilities. Mr Qamar says the government will set up price monitoring bodies
before services are privatised, to protect consumer interests.
However, many officials and businessmen say privately that price increases
are inevitable, especially after years of subsidies to the public sector.
The one important question is whether these price increases can be spread
over a period of time to prevent discontent among consumers.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (7): Bottle bank dilemmas -
Recycling economics are being challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When people think of the contributions they might make towards saving
energy, they often turn to recycling, as well as more direct measures such
as insulating lofts and turning off lights when they leave the room.
Young children frequently lecture their parents on the need to take bottles
to the bottle bank, such is the enthusiasm with which schools have embraced
recycling.
Yet scientists and economists are increasingly questioning whether recycling
household material does have an environmental benefit, and if it does,
whether that benefit justifies spending the considerable sums which modern
recycling systems can demand.
That equivocation, it should be said at the start, does not on the whole
apply to recycling of industrial materials. Many companies have been able
both to cut down their use of raw materials through recycling and to cut
costs.
A prime example is the use of water; the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 largest water and sewage companies in England and Wales,
says that many industrial companies have turned to recycling discharged
water since charges for abstracting water and for discharging waste have
risen.
However, the debate about the virtues of recycling domestic waste has
intensified in the past year since the government began to explore the
adoption of mandatory recycling quotas for packaging. Consumer goods
manufacturers and big retailers could now face a levy to fund the cost of
recovering and recycling waste packaging, which has been put at up to Pounds
100m a year.
In July last year, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told
manufacturers and retailers to devise a voluntary system to increase the
volume of packaging waste recovered or recycled to between 50 per cent and
75 per cent, in line with EU targets.
But industrialists have criticised the targets as potentially meaningless,
given the difficulty in measuring volumes of waste, and differences in the
definition of waste between different types of packaging.
There have also been concerns about the inflationary effect; some industry
estimates put the extra cost of a shopping basket at 1p for every Pounds 10.
None of those estimates is yet firm, nor has the distribution of those
additional costs been agreed. Both industrialists and ministers have an eye
on the catastrophe of German attempts to introduce mandatory recycling
targets, which left unwanted mounds of waste paper trundling along the roads
of neighbouring countries in search of a market. But the size of the costs,
and the controversy about who should bear them, means that all those
embroiled in the debate are taking a harder look at whether the
environmental benefits of recycling justify extra costs.
Take glass for example, one of the most difficult cases, despite the
popularity of bottle banks. Glass is manufactured by heating silica
(essentially sand) and sodium carbonate. It is recycled by remelting broken
shards of glass containers. Whether this produces a net saving in energy or
not is debatable, particularly taking into account the fuel used in
collection of the waste glass.
The Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment at
University College, London, in a report in June for Nuclear Electric, the
generator, said that if a household recycled 52 glass bottles a year this
could save the emission of 6.2kg of carbon a year (carbon dioxide is one of
the gases implicated in global warming).
But it pointed out that these savings would quickly be eroded if people
drove to the bottle bank.
Moreover, much recycled glass is coloured brown or green from beer or wine
bottles, but the demand from manufacturers is for clear glass, for use in
food containers.
CSERGE comments that 'recycling, though one of the most well-known energy
saving measures, has only a small impact on carbon dioxide emissions.
Installing low energy lighting in the home, for example, is over 200 times
more effective than recycling.'
There is least debate over the attractions of recycling aluminium cans, the
most valuable category within household rubbish. According to industry
estimates, recycling can save 95 per cent of the energy used in original
manufacture. In the US, manufacturers suggest that the average smelter to
make new aluminium uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people. A smelter
also costs around 10 times as much as a re-melting plant.
That gives can manufacturers clear incentives to collect used cans. Last
year, for example, the US industry is estimated to have paid out about
Dollars 900m for used cans collected by individuals, schools, churches and
scout troops. About two thirds of cans overall are recycled, the industry
estimates.
But there is more debate over other categories of waste, such as paper.
Although environmentalists argue that newspapers and magazines could
incorporate a higher proportion of recycled material, paper makers say that
if paper is recycled more than three or four times, the fibres become too
short for use in newsprint.
Local councils in the UK which have vigorously pursued recycling of domestic
waste point out too that if such schemes become widespread, the UK could
find that it has created its own version of the German problem: mounds of
expensively-sorted waste for which there is little demand.

Jane Martinson sees ingenuity at work in the UK, US and France

When a full-time energy manager was appointed at Leeds General Infirmary in
northern England last year he found a number of targets for his efficiency
drive.
A year earlier the hospital, which spends an average of Pounds 1.65m a year
on energy, received a 'poor' rating when judged by environment department
guidelines on energy efficiency. Marcus Tunaley, recently-appointed energy
officer at the infirmary, says: 'An environment audit on total energy
consumption in one wing was one of the worst I've ever seen.'
Faced with a National Health Service commitment to cut energy consumption by
15 per cent over the next five years, the hospital is one of a number
managed by NHS trusts to have committed 10 per cent of its annual energy
bill to efficiency measures. Some Pounds 165,000 will be spent in Leeds over
each of the next four years.
The current efficiency measures range from aluminium-clad radiators to
updating the outdated building management system. The old system, which
controls heating and lighting, was unable to adapt to changing needs. 'The
old system provided heat to the hospital 24 hours a day,' says Tunaley. 'We
wanted it to work when it was needed.'
Most measures have focused on the large Clarendon wing of the hospital built
in the early 1970s before the oil crisis encouraged energy savings. 'It was
quite obvious that this wing, lovely as it is, was built when fuel was
cheap,' says Tunaley.
A 'deep plan' building with many windowless rooms, some 40 per cent of its
electricity is used for air conditioning. Frequency inverters and air
quality sensors, which enable the conditioning system to respond to natural
changes in temperature, will save 80 per cent of the electricity used for
the air conditioning alone, says Tunaley. With the new system the
conditioning system works hardest at busy times of the day, in the canteen
at lunchtime for example.
Other savings have resulted from fitting ionic fuel technology to old
boilers (with an energy saving of 8 per cent) and the installation of
high-frequency fluorescent tubes (with a possible electricity saving of 30
per cent).
Environmental concerns are one reason for the hospital's efficiency measures
but the main reason is to save money. 'Efficiency measures represent a good
return on your investment,' he says. 'They are accepted as a good way to
save money.'
The saving also makes sense in the face of the expected increase in gas
prices next year, says Tunaley. He believes that the end of cheap
'interruptible' gas to large consumers because of market liberalisation
could result in the price of gas going up by 25 per cent. The hospital uses
gas to generate electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.
The deregulation of the energy market in the UK has encouraged some large
users to use CHP plants to generate their own power and enhance the security
of their energy supply.
The plants can cut the loss of fuel in energy production by using the heat
from electricity generation for further energy purposes.
The chemicals manufacturing arm of Zeneca, the biosciences group, is to
install two CHP plants to supply 23.5MW for its Huddersfield and Grangemouth
sites in the UK.
The new Pounds 10.6m plant at Huddersfield, to provide the steam and
electricity used in the manufacturing process, aims to save an estimated
Pounds 2.5m a year in energy costs.
Environmental legislation has encouraged the new energy contract. Two of the
plant's boilers, which will be phased out under the new scheme, are over 30
years old and do not include pollution-abatement measures. Bob Thompson,
Zeneca spokesman, said: 'This equipment needs replacing because of our
desire to improve our environmental performance and also because if we don't
we will not meet environmental legislation which is coming into force in the
next few years.'
The new plant would enable the company to keep ahead of controls on carbon
dioxide emissions for example. The plant currently burns some 90,000 tonnes
of coal a year.
In Europe and the US companies have been keen to encourage energy efficiency
to comply with legislation - following government commitments at the Rio
earth summit to bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the
year 2000 - and to enhance their public image.
Electricity companies in the US, for example, entered into a voluntary
agreement, called the Climate Challenge, with the Department of Energy
earlier this year.
The initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gases, was a direct
response to a proposed tax on the number of British Thermal Units (the
common measure of heating energy) last year.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, the largest power utility in the US and a party
to the agreement, has allocated Dollars 2bn to customer energy efficiency
programmes in the 1990s. With this investment the company hopes energy bills
will be cut by more than Dollars 2bn net by 2000.
Last year more than Dollars 186m was spent on some 50 programmes, resulting
in a saving of 491m kwh of electricity. More than 600,000 customers
participated in energy efficiency initiatives last year.
For one scheme last year the company paid Dollars 30,000 to replace 150-watt
incandescent traffic signals with energy-saving 25-watt light emitting
diodes (LEDs) in the city of Davis.
In spite of these efforts, however, the company failed to meet its 1993
targets on energy efficiency, partly, it claims because of reorganisation
and the loss of 3,000 jobs.
In France, the state gas company Gaz de France has a team dedicated to
encouraging energy efficiency particularly through the installation of
combined heat and power plants.
Jean-Pierre Roncato, head of the cogeneration development mission, says that
by using CHP plants 85 per cent of the gas used in generation can be
recovered and used for both electricity and heating.
This year the company has started 30 CHP projects compared with just four in
1991. At the same time it is installing boilers with high-energy conversion
capabilities.
'Being fuel efficient is a strategic idea for us,' says Roncato. 'It's
important as far as our image is concerned to supply an efficient product
which uses natural gas.'
Up to 75 per cent of France's energy needs is supplied by nuclear
electricity. Gaz de France supplies only a fraction of the country's total
energy but is hoping that by stressing fuel efficiency - and by offering
price warranties to allay fears of a gas price rise - it can increase its
share of the market.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): Combined heat and politics
 -Cogeneration industry seeks a boost in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Energy efficiency and environmental cleanliness would make a strong combined
argument for any kind of power generation system, but few, if any, can score
so highly on both counts as combined heat and power.
Unlike most conventional power generating systems, CHP recaptures the waste
heat released during combustion and uses it to make steam for hot water or
heating - as well as electricity.
This can produce total efficiency ratings of up to 90 per cent, compared
with 35 per cent thermal efficiency for the average coal fired power station
or 56-58 per cent for the latest combined cycle systems. As for emissions,
every 1MW of CHP reduces UK carbon emissions by 1,250 tonnes a year.
It might seem odd, therefore, that the popularity of CHP varies so widely
across the European Union, where CHP overall accounts for 6 per cent of
electricity generated. In Holland and Denmark, the figure is 30 per cent,
whereas in France it is only 2 per cent.
In fact, there is a very close link between government policy that promotes
CHP - or at least creates favourable conditions for it to flourish - and its
success in the market place. Where governments are indifferent or allow
uncertainty to develop, CHP finds it harder to prosper.
The UK is a case in point. It is at the low end of the scale compared with
the big European users, with only 4 per cent of its electricity coming from
CHP. But the UK Government has at least set a target - of 5,000MW of CHP by
the end of the century.
Already, the UK has 3,000MW of CHP at work, on more than 700 sites, and
until a few months ago, it looked to be coasting comfortably towards
achieving the 5,000MW target. Over the past three to four years, 1,000MW of
capacity has been added and the country's largest CHP scheme, a 157MW joint
venture between Scottish Hydro-Electric and British Nuclear Fuels at
Sellafield, Cumbria, came on stream earlier this year.
The problem, however, is that the UK does not have a strategy to implement
the target, according to Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and
Power Association. In the past three or four months, few new schemes have
been announced because potential CHP operators feel squeezed between rising
gas prices - one of the main fuels for CHP - and regulated electricity
prices.
There is a 'fundamental uncertainty,' he says, over the course of UK energy
policy, which makes it difficult to invest in CHP with confidence. As a
consequence, Mr Green is now less certain that the 5,000MW target will be
reached.
Before the recent lull, the market had been growing steadily, with a strong
surge of activity in the hotel industry, and a good showing in the paper and
board sector. Relatively unexploited sectors include the chemicals and steel
industry - where companies have held back making investments, perhaps
because of lack of confidence in their own future survival.
According to a report* in July by Marketing Strategies for Industry, the UK
market for industrial CHP generation plant, excluding plants below 100KW,
was Pounds 97.7m last year, up from Pounds 87.2m in 1992 and just Pounds
51.1m in 1989.
The biggest segment last year, based on gas turbines with waste heat
recovery boilers, accounted for Pounds 63.9m of the spending, followed by
combined-cycle CHP with Pounds 25.5m. Use of both types has grown strongly
over the past four years. The remaining Pounds 8.3m was spent on systems
based around reciprocating engines.
The CHPA believes the UK could have 20,000MW of CHP by 2020, but Mr Green
says there will have to be changes in government policy to achieve this. To
turn the widespread support for CHP into reality, it wants new and fair
prices for the electricity from CHP plant, effective investment by the
private and public sectors in community heating, incentives to stimulate
investment by companies in CHP, and action to remove what it calls 'the
distortion and inertia' which limits the wider use of CHP and community
heating.
In contrast, CHP has 'steamed ahead' in Denmark and the Netherlands because
it has been a policy priority, says Mr Michael Brown, the CHPA's assistant
director (Europe). The Netherlands, with its more industrialised economy,
uses CHP both in industry and in district heating, while Denmark's CHP is
much more focused on district heating.
In Italy, the one EU country where electricity supply shortages are an
issue, there has been considerable growth in CHP use, almost entirely in the
industrial sector. Here, and also in Spain, electricity tariff changes have
been an important stimulus.
In Spain, however, a review is now under way after strong growth over the
past three to four years, and a number of projects are on hold.
Mr Brown believes the amount of electricity generated by CHP in the EU can
rise to 8 or 9 per cent by the end of the decade, helped by the planned
entry to the EU of Sweden and Finland. He believes the EU should set an
ambitious target for the average percentage figure, much as has happened in
the UK.
The CHPA, and the recently-formed organisation Cogen Europe which groups it
and six other similar associations in Europe, is hoping it can influence a
number of Brussels initiatives in favour of CHP. These include the
slow-moving plans for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets,
and the controversial suggestion for an EU-wide energy tax to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions.
The CHP industry is also trying to make headway on the European energy
policy green paper now being drawn up by the Commission. An initial document
was fairly thin on environmental issues, says Mr Brown. 'We would like to
see that beefed up.'
A further lobbying front involves the EU's Save programme to promote energy
efficiency. Save I, now drawing to a close, was hamstrung by lack of support
from member States, says Mr Brown. Save 2 is under discussion, and whatever
emerges ought to have legislative teeth, says Mr Brown. Lobbying at national
level, meanwhile, continues.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (4): Alienation tends to breed violence -
Political power has been retained in the hands of an elite group of families

Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition
leader, show no sign of relenting in the bitter feud which has poisoned
Pakistani politics for the past five years.
To the dismay of Pakistanis concerned about the quality of the country's
democracy and about its international image, the consequences of the two
leaders' bad-tempered rivalry were recently put on display in the National
Assembly building.
Addressing a joint meeting of the assembly and the senate, Mr Farooq
Leghari, the president, was barely able to deliver an important policy
speech, as government and opposition members pushed each other about and
exchanged insults at the foot of his podium.
'Leghari thief] Leghari go,' opposition members shouted throughout the
speech. Banners were draped around the hall condemning the government for
alleged corruption. Later, an opposition member was taken to hospital after
being beaten by student supporters of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.
Afterwards, Ms Bhutto blamed the opposition for starting the row. Mr Nawaz
Sharif's Muslim League party retorted that the government had provoked the
attack by arresting Mr Mohammed Sharif, the opposition leader's 75-year-old
father only a day earlier on charges of fraud, forgery and tax evasion.
The roots of the quarrel go back to the conflict between Ms Bhutto's father,
Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime minister, and General Zia-ul-Haq,
the late dictator, who in 1977 imposed military rule and later ordered Mr
Bhutto's execution.
After General Zia's death in 1988, democracy was restored and Ms Bhutto came
to power. But it was only 20 months before the army and bureaucracy chased
her out of office and installed Mr Nawaz Sharif, a protege of General Zia.
However, last year Mr Nawaz Sharif overplayed his hand by provoking rows
with the army, over the appointment of a new chief of staff, and with the
president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, over a plan to curb the presidency's
powers.
After months of turmoil, Ms Bhutto was returned to office in a general
election which was widely seen as the fairest ever held in Pakistan.
But fair elections have not brought political peace. Ms Bhutto is pursuing a
wide-ranging corruption inquiry into the business interests of the Sharif
family, especially its rapid growth during Mr Nawaz Sharif's periods in
office, first as chief minister in Punjab, the largest of Pakistan's four
provinces, in the 1980s and later as prime minister.
Mr Nawaz Sharif has responded with allegations of corruption against Mr Asif
Zardari, Ms Bhutto's husband and a leading businessman. Among the banners
paraded during the stormy demonstration in the National Assembly this month
was one declaring: 'Pakistan for Sale. Contact Zardari and Associates.'
Mr Nawaz Sharif wants Ms Bhutto's resignation and an early general election
 -'she has lost all legitimacy,' he says.
Ms Bhutto insists that despite the confrontation, the corruption charges and
even the scuffles in Parliament, democracy is thriving in Pakistan. Italy
and Japan have also seen parliamentary storms, yet no-one questions their
democratic credentials, she says.
Certainly, the battles are being fought within constitutional norms and, the
army has stayed out of the fray unlike in some previous episodes in
Pakistani history. Moreover, the two main parties have few disagreements on
policy - whether it is over the economy, defence or international relations.
The feud does Pakistan considerable harm, however: first, the leaders set a
poor example for other Pakistanis, some of whom need little encouragement to
try to take the law into their own hands. Next, it harms the country's
international image. Finally, it distracts attention from the country's
deeper political difficulties.
The most immediate need is to deal with the threats to law and order,
especially in Karachi, (as described in a separate article on this page),
and in the tribal areas in the north, where many have died in an insurgency
in Malakand district this year.
The supply of guns and ammunition left over from the anti-Soviet war in
Afghanistan and the spread of the drug trade have put considerable power
into the hands of armed groups. Young men with automatic weapons are almost
every day turning conflicts over religion, politics and crime into vicious
gun-fights.
Deploying the police, paramilitary rangers and the army is only part of the
answer. Without economic, social and political initiatives, the roots of
violence will sink deeper into Pakistani soil. Ms Bhutto's government is
pledged to improve social and economic conditions through its Social Action
Programme, which involves increasing social spending.
But the crux of the matter is that too few Pakistanis are involved in the
running of their country and so feel alienated from authority.
The nation is ruled by an elite of Sindhi and Punjabi feudal landlords,
whose sons (apart from Ms Bhutto, few women are active in public life) fill
the national and provincial assemblies and the upper echelons of the
bureaucracy and army. Over half National Assembly members are rural
landowners. Mr Altaf Gauhar, a veteran political and economic commentator,
estimates that just 500 families rule Pakistan.
The only politician who managed to reach out beyond the land-based elite was
Ms Bhutto's father, Mr Zulfikar Bhutto, a populist who won support from the
urban crowds of Karachi and Lahore. Even though his daughter has claimed Mr
Bhutto's mantle, she has failed to reach the hearts of ordinary Pakistanis
in the same way.
With domination of a small elite, has come the transformation of public life
into the personal fiefdom of a few wealthy families. Corruption and
patronage have become endemic and the law has been turned into a tool of
political manipulation.
To her credit, Ms Bhutto is aware of the challenges involved in making
Pakistan a more just society. Her government has strengthened
anti-corruption laws, tax collection measures and controls to prevent the
powerful extracting excessive loans from banks.
But it is not yet clear that Ms Bhutto has the will to persuade her class to
share at least some of its privileges. As Mr Gauhar says: 'The only way this
problem will be solved is if the poor gang together. Then the elite will
have to change.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (5): Sense of unease stalks the streets -
Karachi's rapid expansion has produced ethnic tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When an army jeep speeds through Liaquatabad market in Karachi, a machine
gun jutting out across the bonnet, the crowds barely give it a second
glance. After more than two years on the city's streets, army patrols have
become a fact of life in Pakistan's commercial capital.
But they have not brought peace. Since the beginning of the year about 500
people have died, mostly in gun-battles between rival armed gangs and the
security forces. About 200 have died since early September. In one incident
this month, a leading local politician was killed with his wife,
sister-in-law and infant son, when gunmen sprayed their car with bullets.
The next day, eight people were killed and 40 injured in revenge attacks and
counter-attacks.
Karachi is not a city in flames. In much of the sprawling metropolis of 12m,
there are no signs of violence. During the day, the soldiers try to be
discreet. Their patrols come out in force only at night, when the gunmen are
also most active. Yet a deep sense of unease stalks Karachi.
'There is a feeling of uncertainty. A lot of people say that in the 1970s
this was a wonderful place to live. They don't say that any more,' says Mr
Suhail Abbas, editor of the Financial Post, a business daily. Mr SM Muneer,
the president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, is more blunt. He told a press conference earlier this month that
there was 'a complete breakdown of law and order.'
The government recognises the urgency of the matter, particularly at a time
when it is encouraging foreign businessmen to send executives to Pakistan -
'peace and tranquillity in the country is our top priority. We can't neglect
law and order if we want economic development,' says Mr Iqbal Haider, the
justice minister in Islamabad.
The origins of violence in Karachi lie in the city's rapid expansion since
independence and the frustrations generated by a constant influx of refugees
and migrants. The biggest wave was composed of the Mohajirs  - people who
fled India in 1947 to escape religious riots and start a new life in a
Moslem country. These Urdu-speaking people established themselves as a
majority in Karachi to the dismay of local Sindhi-speaking farmers.
In the first years after independence, the work of building a new country
kept the latent ethnic strains in check. But arguments over language and
quotas for government jobs and college places gradually polarised the two
communities. The Sindhis resented the well-educated Mohajirs' success in
business; the Mohajirs hated their exclusion from power. They produced
figures showing that despite accounting for about half the population of
Sindh province, Urdu-speakers accounted for only 95,000 of 456,000
provincial government posts.
Other conflicts also surfaced - between Sunni and Shia Moslems, for example,
and between rival criminal gangs. But it was the large and well-organised
Mohajir community that had the biggest impact. In the 1980s, Mr Altaf
Hussain, a charismatic speaker, now 41, launched the Mohajir Qaumi Movement,
which took control of the Karachi Municipal Corporation and won the lion's
share of the city's national and provincial assembly seats.
But successive alliances with Ms Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party
and with Mr Nawaz Sharif's Moslem League failed to bring the MQM tangible
benefits. Frustration pushed militant factions towards political violence
and to crime. With the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan over, guns were easy.
Drug smuggling generated easy money. In June 1992, Mr Nawaz Sharif ordered
the army to send 60,000 troops to restore order in Sindh, including 40,000
in Karachi. More than 400 MQM activists were killed in the first few months
of 'operation clean-up' and hundreds of others arrested. The army promoted
divisions in the MQM, and the growth of a strong faction called MQM
(Haquiqui), which it encouraged to fight against the mainstream groups.
MQM militants fought back. Mr Altaf Hussain, who was in London when the army
started its campaign, refused to return for fear of capture - and continued
to lead his movement from exile. This summer he was sentenced in absentia to
27 years' jail for alleged offences including murder and arson.
The MQM has responded to military pressure with increasingly radical
demands, including this year asking for a new province to be carved out of
southern Sindh, incorporating Karachi. Ms Bhutto and her ministers rule out
such ideas. Yet, government officials and MQM representatives are frequently
in contact. Mr Shoaib Bokhari, the acting MQM opposition leader in the Sindh
assembly, says: 'We don't want separation from Pakistan. We want equal
treatment.'
The violence obscures the fact that many of Karachi's problems are those of
any fast-growing city. Water, sewerage, power and transport services are all
inadequate. While the city generates about 60 per cent of central government
revenues, little is ploughed back into Karachi.
Mr Abbas, the newspaper editor, says, Karachi-ites are self-made dynamic
people. He believes they will respond to the challenge posed by violence.
But, like others, he is not sure how long this may take. For businessmen, it
is a matter of deciding whether potential rewards justify the possible
dangers. Many might agree with Mr Nisar Memon, the country manager of IBM,
the US computer manufacturer, who says: 'It's a risk, but it's a containable
risk.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (6): Wheel turns full circle for
a man from Harwell / Profile of Energy Systems Trade Association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international energy efficiency industry was born 21 years ago when the
armies of Egypt and Syria launched their October offensive against the
Israelis and the Arab oil producing countries dramatically quadrupled the
price of oil to the western world.
The shock sent the industrialised world into headlong flight from oil to
other fuels and prompted energy conservation efforts, such as the Save It
campaign in Britain, more intensive than anything since the Second World
War.
Since then, apart from the the upheaval caused by the Iran revolution of
1979, oil prices have generally drifted downwards to become lower in real
terms than even before the October 1973 war.
Nevertheless, energy efficiency still commands lip-service from politicians,
industrialists and property developers, not only for economic and security
reasons but because of the perceived link between carbon fuels and the
environment.
The preoccupation with energy efficiency is reflected in the durability of
many of the organisations which came into being during the energy crises
which gripped the world throughout the 1970s.
In Britain, these include the Energy Systems Trade Association (Esta), an
umbrella body originally formed to serve manufacturers of waste heat
recovery systems but now representing a diverse range of service and product
suppliers with a growing emphasis on electronic controls.
Esta was founded in 1982 by Dr Glenn Brookes, then a 32 year-old scientist
working on energy efficiency projects at the Atomic Energy Authority's
energy technology support unit (Etsu) at Harwell.
While selecting promising new efficiency methods for government-sponsored
demonstration, Dr Brookes had found that there was no umbrella body to
represent the waste heat recovery industry. He resigned from Harwell, set up
Esta and has never looked back.
The energy efficiency industry, he says 'has come of age'. It no longer
depends for its existence on the armoury of government grants created in the
wake of the world oil crises. It has suffered many casualties but a hard
core has soldiered through and advances with its own momentum.
His own association now represents more than 80 members, with an estimated
turnover of more than Pounds 1bn a year, and comprises six specialist
branches:
14 independent energy consultants, with a Pounds 30m turnover and accounting
for about 60 per cent of their market;
14 contract energy management groups; turnover about Pounds 200m; covers
about 85 per cent of its market;
13 building controls suppliers; turnover Pounds 250m; represent 85 per cent
of their sector;
controls systems specialists: 13 members; turnover Pounds 30m; about 60 per
cent of this sector;
metering and monitoring group: 12 members; Pounds 30m energy efficiency
turnover; represents 90 per cent of this sector;
non-specialists (from heat recovery, lighting and boilers, to discrete
controls and water management): total turnover for all members exceeding
Pounds 500m, employing around 10,000 people and responsible for savings of
around Pounds 250m a year.
In Britain, the building controls market has moved with property values.
After peaking in 1991 at Pounds 344m, building controls sales fell to Pounds
278m in 1992, but rose again last year to Pounds 293m and continues to grow
at a few per centage points a year.
Over the past four years, says Dr Brookes, there has been a 75 per cent
increase in spending on servicing and maintenance of energy efficiency
systems.
The contract energy management group, which includes BP Energy, AHS-Emstar
and subsidiaries of regional electricity companies, operates clients'
heating systems more efficiently than clients feel able to do themselves.
Their activities have grown by about 21 per cent since 1991, and their
workforce has grown at a similar rate to reach a present level of about
2,000. They also cashed in on a 13 per cent growth in public sector
contracts from 1991 to 1992, but this has since levelled out.
Esta's latest initiative, launched a year ago, is a scheme which
independently measures an organisation's achievements in energy efficiency
under nationally applied rules.
Meanwhile, the wheel has turned full circle. Fourteen years after Dr Brookes
took the plunge into the private sector, the organisation from which he
jumped is set to take the same path. In the Queen's Speech, the government
announced its intention to privatise the Atomic Energy Authority, including
its energy technology support unit. Would Dr Brookes be making a bid for it?
'Definitely not', he said.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (5): Tempting the tenants -
David Lawson charts the rise of the state of the art office block
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disappearance of belching smokestacks is generally seen as a sign of how
far we have progressed towards a more efficient, civilised society. Few
would accept living and working in such conditions today.
But most of us still do. Gleaming modern factories, warehouses - and even
homes and office blocks - pour out a noxious wastes. We just cannot see
them.
Buildings emit twice the amount of carbon dioxide as vehicle exhausts,
making a major contribution to fears about global warming. This has led to a
major rethink by the British government in the light of the 1992 Rio de
Janeiro agreement to cut C0 emissions over the next decade.
Housing, for instance, which consumes half the UK's gas and a third of its
electricity, has been uprated under new building regulations. Ministers
claim this will increase energy efficiency by 20 per cent, with a
corresponding reduction in emissions from their chimneys and power station
stacks.
Factories face a similar tough regime, but the ubiquitous office block has
proved more of a problem. Air-conditioning appears to be a minor irritant,
contributing less than 1 per cent of the UK's carbon dioxide output. Yet it
has become a symbol of energy excess in the commercial sector.
Designed to cope with the extra heat generation of electronic equipment,
developers insist it is necessary in town centres, where windows must remain
sealed against dirt and noise. But such energy-hungry techniques became
almost a standard fixture during the property boom no matter where buildings
grew.
Building regulations aimed at restricting this growth were shelved earlier
this year - but only for further investigation into workable rules. Progress
is more likely to come from the bottom up, however. Almost 90 per cent of
occupiers in a study by property consultants Richard Ellis said they did not
want air-conditioning.
A few years ago such complaints might have been ignored. Tenants had to take
what they could get when space was in short supply. Now the boot is on the
other foot. In a market awash with empty buildings, landlords are
desperately trying to anticipate what will attract occupiers.
Air-conditioning will not disappear. Fund managers who have a stranglehold
on development of new buildings insist that it is essential for modern
working conditions. And Mike Warner, a senior partner with Richard Ellis,
admits that occupier complaints probably stem from poor maintenance and
design.
But air-conditioning is only part of a growing demand among occupiers for
cheaper accommodation. These complex networks of ducts and fans add not just
to building costs - which push up rents - but can also add 30 per cent to
service charges, according to another property consultant, Jones Laing
Wootton. The pendulum is now swinging towards buildings which more closely
match occupiers' needs. Heating and ventilation should be both more
user-friendly and energy-efficient in future.
But with so little development taking place, it is hard to find examples of
this change in approach. One is a striking glass and steel block going up at
Finsbury Pavement in the City of London. The 125,000 sq ft of offices over a
Marks &amp; Spencer store is being watched closely by the property industry, as
this is the first important speculative development in the City since the
crash.
Developer London &amp; Manchester called in two pioneers in energy-saving
design, engineer Ove Arup and architect Sheppard Robson. The building makes
maximum use of natural light - one of the key demands by occupiers in the
Richard Ellis survey - controlling solar gain through a system of external
louvres which automatically adjust to internal temperatures.
More significantly, however, this has been balanced by a 'low-tech' method
of cooling known as chilled ceilings, a technology widely used on the
Continent but ignored in favour of energy-hungry variable air volume (VAV)
systems in the UK.
Other developments are also on the drawing board which show how developers
are adjusting to tenant demand. Sheppard Robson is working up plans for a
140,000 sq ft block in Croydon for Norwich Union with a different cooling
system which could cut normal energy costs by 30 per cent. The same
partnership is also considering chilled ceilings for an office block in
central Leeds.
Another investor, the Prudential, may test these waters with a 250,000 sq ft
development in Reading being prepared by Tim Battle, a veteran campaigner
for energy-saving with engineers Rybka Smith Ginsler and Battle.
The whip-hand lies with occupiers, however. Most developers will not start
building until they snare a tenant attracted by such low-energy offers.
London &amp; Manchester has economics on its side, as it pocketed Pounds 75m for
the City site in the boom and then reacquired it for Pounds 17.5m in 1992.
Even if tenants swarm in, however, more efficient new development will
hardly dent the total energy bill of commercial buildings as a whole. More
significant is the constant upgrading by a host of specialists. AHS Emstar,
for instance, claims it can reduce energy costs by up to 30 per cent by
anything from replacement of heating systems to changing the mix of fuels
used.
Emstar cut the energy bill for Hoover in South Wales by Pounds 750,000 a
year, while British Gas saved Inco Alloys in Hereford half its costs by
designing new equipment. Groups such as NatWest and Bass have ordered energy
audits on all their property, says Ken Ordish of ESS Projects. One of his
biggest clients is the health service, as new trusts work their way through
hospitals which have wasted money on poor heating systems for decades.
This kind of energy-saving is likely to accelerate over the next decade.
Occupiers who got into the habit of examining costs more closely during the
slump are now anticipating heavier fuel taxes because of worldwide moves
against global warming. This is proving a fertile area for energy
consultants, particularly with the fierce competition between gas and
electricity suppliers.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (2): Foundations laid for stability - The
economy / new incentives are offered to foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a faster pace than seemed possible a year ago, the government of Ms
Benazir Bhutto has pulled Pakistan out of a foreign exchange crisis and laid
the foundations for economic stability.
Ms Bhutto has also given a new impetus to efforts to attract foreign
investment by offering extra incentives and further liberalising an economy
that was already among the most open in the developing world.
Overseas companies have responded by pouring funds into the stock market and
pledging to increase direct investment, notably in power generation, to
which the government attaches the highest priority.
Yet, as Pakistani and foreign businessmen are united in telling the
government, all this progress in the economy could still be wasted unless
Pakistan also tackles its non-economic problems - above all the crime and
violence in Karachi. As Mr Nisar Memon, general manager of the Pakistani
operations of IBM, the US computer maker, and president of the Overseas
Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says: 'The number one priority
is the law and order situation.'
The economic turnaround dates back to the caretaker government of Mr Moeen
Qureshi, the former World Bank economist, who led the country for three
months last year between the fall of Mr Nawaz Sharif and Ms Bhutto's
election victory. But the new government deserves credit for persevering
with his tough curbs on public spending, bank lending and foreign exchange
outflows.
Since the summer of 1993, the budget deficit has been cut from over 8 per
cent of GDP in the year to June 1993 to 5.8 per cent in 1993-94. The target
for 1994-95 is just 4 per cent.
The expansion of domestic credit has dropped from 24 per cent in 1992-93 to
9.3 per cent last year. Imports, which jumped 12 per cent in 1992-93, fell
almost 15 per cent last year. Foreign exchange reserves have risen from a
low of Dollars 300m to a record USDollars 3bn.
Inflation has fallen but is still to be brought under control. Prices have
been pushed up by increases in power charges and other administered prices
and by the influx of foreign exchange which has expanded the domestic money
supply.
However, the government's short-term economic management has been so good
that it has brought plaudits from international observers including the
International Monetary Fund.
The squeeze on credit, imports and public spending has contributed to a slow
down in economic growth. GDP rose only 4 per cent last year after 2.3 per
cent the year before - down from 7.7 per cent in 1991-92. However, the
government, which is now easing credit restraints, is forecasting a sharp
increase to 6.9 per cent in 1994-95. Much depends on agriculture, especially
the cotton crop, which determines the commercial health not just of cotton
farming but of textiles production, Pakistan's biggest industry and largest
contributor to exports. As Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on
financer, says: 'As far as growth is concerned, the key question is the
cotton crop.'
The drought and disease which have hit cotton in the past two years have
been the principal reason for slow economic growth. This year, the
government is planning for a recovery in cotton production from 7.6m bales
to 9.5m.
Some cotton farmers have said the lingering effects of drought and disease
will hold back output, but no-one can be certain until the harvest reaches
its peak in January. The finance ministry estimates that each 1.5m bales of
cotton output is the equivalent of 1 per cent of GDP.
Given the uncertainties, some economists doubt whether growth will be as
fast as the government plans. They believe 5-6 per cent GDP growth is a more
reasonable target. There is also concern about the state of business
confidence. Power shortages and the disturbances in Karachi have hit
industrial output, which has grown at an average of just 5.5 per cent in the
past two years.
Karachi bankers say that local businessmen are noticeably less enthusiastic
about prospects than foreign companies. One reason is that domestic
companies are more involved than overseas groups and their Pakistani
subsidiaries in the depressed textiles industry. Exports, mainly cotton and
textiles, actually fell last year, albeit by only 0.1 per cent, for the
first time - despite a 10 per cent devaluation in the rupee in mid-1993.
By contrast, foreign investors are responding favourably to the Bhutto
government's initiatives. Foreign investment inflows rose 20 per cent to
Dollars 693m in 1993-94, including Dollars 339m in portfolio investment.
This year's figure could come close to Dollars 2bn, given that the overseas
sales of shares in Pakistan Telecommunications Company, the state-owned
carrier, raised Dollars 900m this autumn and that construction is starting
on the Dollars 1.8bn Hub River power station.
The government is also hoping to attract foreign investment in future
privatisations. Though perhaps not on the scale of PTC, stakes in
state-owned power and gas producers and distributors could also raise large
sums. Even greater is the amount ministers hope to attract into the
construction of new power stations. A new energy policy, launched in March
1994, offering attractive terms to private sector investors, including a
guaranteed price for power purchases, has encouraged US companies to sign
letters of intent for building power stations worth Dollars 4bn. Mr Gordon
Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, has unveiled an even bigger programme,
offering to build generating capacity worth Dollars 8bn.
There is some doubt about how fast these investments, which would almost
double Pakistan's electricity output, might materialise. But for Ms Bhutto
they already represent a powerful boost to confidence in her economy.
These investors are attracted partly by Pakistan's chronic need for power
and partly by the consistency with which successive governments have pursued
market-oriented policies favourable to foreign trade and investment. Despite
the political divide separating them, Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif have few
differences on economic policy.
Ms Bhutto's government has pursued her predecessor's initiatives in
virtually all important areas including liberalising trade through tariff
cuts, deregulating foreign exchange rules and financial markets, and
privatisation.
The sale of shares in a leading state-owned bank, UBL, is top of the
privatisation agenda, to be followed, as mentioned above, by sales of stakes
in utilities currently operated by the Water and Power Development
Authority. Although there were plans to privatise it en bloc, WAPDA is now
seen as too unwieldy for such a sale.
All this is music to businessmens' ears. But the government's tune is in
danger of being drowned out by the country's political turmoil. Investors
can learn to live with chaotic Parliamentary politics, as they have in
Italy, for example. They can also cope with corruption, which is widespread
in Pakistan, but which is common in almost every developing country and most
developed nations as well. But the risk of being robbed or even murdered on
the streets of Karachi has made more than one potential investor think twice
about Pakistan.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (3): Power policy starts to emerge -
Private investment is seen as the key to much-needed improvements in
electricity supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistanis will find it hard to forget this year's long hot summer. Up to
six hours of power cuts in many urban areas caused huge production losses
for businesses and industries. In Karachi, Pakistan's business capital, some
wealthy residential areas were left without electricity for several days.
The cuts were a repeat of widespread black-outs in the early 1990s, at a
time when the gap between supply and demand was widening rapidly.
Yet while, for many Pakistanis, this year's experience may have been
dispiriting, the country's new energy policy aims to improve the electricity
supply by attracting private investment.
A series of complicated bureaucratic layers, which served only to delay new
projects, has been replaced by a 'one window' operation in Islamabad,
capable of processing all inquiries and problems. Businessmen and western
economists have generally welcomed, too, a generous rate of return being
offered to investors.
'There has never been a power policy in this country,' says Mr Shahid Hasan
Khan, the prime minister's adviser on economic affairs, and head of a
special committee which recommended the new incentives - 'the thrust is now
on the private sector,' he says.
Investors will, in other words, be expected to take their cue from the fresh
ground that the government believes it has broken with its new policy.
The government is claiming the credit for commitments worth more than
Dollars 12bn, which have been made since its announcement early this year.
These include a Dollars 8bn coal-fired power generation project being
undertaken by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong-based business leader, and almost
Dollars 3.5bn of investment promised by American businesses.
'We've actually reached a point where a lot of people are very conscious of
Pakistan, and see it as a place in which they can look for investment
opportunities,' says Mr Daniel Michael Woodroffe, chief executive of the
Karachi-based Hub Power project - a joint venture, with Xenel group of Saudi
Arabia and National Power of the UK among the largest sponsors.
The 1,292MW hub-power project, the largest private sector power project in
the developing world, was first conceived eight years ago, and is likely to
begin producing in 1996.
Despite the optimism from many sides over the schemes that have been put in
the pipeline this year, Pakistan still faces the challenge of ensuring that
most of these projects are successfully completed.
Many prospective investors, able to provide between 20 and 30 per cent of
the full costs, are aware of the difficulties involved in arranging full
financing by such means as loans.
'For every four to five dollars of demand worldwide, there's only one dollar
that can be raised. You've got to be very competitive,' says one American
businessman.
'Some (proposals) will fall by the wayside, because they are not well
thought through or because there are problems funding them, but a
significant proportion will come through,' says Mr Woodroffe, who is
optimistic about the future.
However, other businessmen and some officials are less certain. Part of the
concern is tied to the extent to which Pakistan can improve its ailing
transmission infrastructure, to improve the quality of power supply, so that
all power generated reaches consumers.
The government now plans to invite offers for new contracts worth up to
Dollars 5bn for investment in transmission lines and related facilities.
Power tariffs, however, will need to be increased - by some estimates,
between 40 to 50 per cent - in order to pay for the overhaul of the system.
'It is difficult for a political government to raise these in one go,' says
one senior official privately. He explains that a detailed plan to introduce
higher rates, to be phased in over a period of time, will be the most
important element in the success of the new initiative.
Some officials are also concerned that up to 80 per cent of the added load
is expected to come from central and northern parts of the province of
Punjab, at least 1,000 km away from the port city of Karachi. They argue
that new projects set up close to the coast, to avoid breakdowns in the
supply of fuels, could face power losses by the time that the transmitted
energy reaches its destination. Despite such concerns, most officials and
businessmen are convinced that the energy initiative stands at the top of
the government's economic agenda, and that the recent incentives have
improved prospects for new investments - 'the population of investors in
private power has decided that Pakistan is a good place to look (for
opportunities),' adds Mr Woodroffe, describing the mood of prospective
investors after the new energy policy.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): The bird that would not fly
 -Bronwen Maddox describes the fate of a bold Whitehall initiative
</HEADLINE>

Energy efficiency can be a remarkably slippery policy to promote. That is
the experience of the UK government which has seen the Energy Saving Trust,
an election manifesto pledge and one of the fondest creations of its
environmental policy, fail to get off the ground.
According to Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the
Conservation of Energy, the trust's progress is 'a severe disappointment -
it originally represents one of the soundest programmes in the UK for
delivering higher levels of energy efficiency'.
The trust is intended to help the gas and electricity utilities identify
projects which will help their customers use less energy. Ministers planned
that the money to fund the projects would be passed on to all customers of
the utilities through their bills.
In January, Mr John Major, the prime minister, made clear in a high profile
speech to spell out the UK's environmental strategy that he was giving the
trust a central role in the UK's plans for meeting the Rio targets on global
warming. Those targets specify that the UK must draw up plans to bring
emissions of carbon dioxide, which is implicated in global warming, back to
1990 levels in the year 2000. According to estimates compiled by the
Department of Trade and Industry, that means that the UK needs to cut around
10mtC (million tonnes of carbon) from the projected 170mtC in the year 2000.
The government hopes that most of those savings will be generated by
measures - themselves controversial - to raise the price of heating fuel and
petrol.
However, ministers have put a quarter of the burden - 2.5mtC, the biggest
single element - of the required cuts on the trust's shoulders. They have
also estimated that the trust will need to identify about Pounds 400m of
projects a year by the end of the decade in order to reach that target.
It needs to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to meet
government targets, according to its business plan, published in April.
However, so far the trust is not on course to reach anywhere approaching
that figure. According to its chief executive, Mr Eoin Lees, it has looked
at 55 projects, which would cost Pounds 14m to implement. Of these, 25 have
been approved by Offer, the electricity regulator. Last year, it spent
Pounds 4m on pilot projects.
Mr Lees says: 'I think we are on course to spend between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 12m in the year to March 1995.' The projects cover more efficient
light bulbs, and all night lighting for security purposes in communal
housing, which has proved popular with local authorities and housing
associations.
However, although he points out that this spending figure is in line with
the spending the trust had planned to make this year, the obstacles in the
way of further progress, up towards the Pounds 400m level, are considerable.
According to Mr Warren, the projects approved so far 'are tiddlers. This is
no more than money which was agreed 18 months ago'.
Those hurdles lie in the position of the gas and electricity regulators.
They are uncomfortable about allowing the costs of such projects to be
passed on to all customers, even those who have not benefited from the
schemes. On the electricity side, Offer has capped the amount which the
utilities can spend on such projects to Pounds 22m a year until March 1998,
when the industry pricing will be reviewed.
The position of Ofgas, the gas regulator, is even more trenchant. Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, made clear her uneasiness to such
'cost-pass-through' at repeated hearings before parliamentary select
committees. She argued that regulators should not be used to impose charges
which were essentially taxes. Moreover, she made clear, such a tax would be
regressive, hitting the poorer families hardest.
Ministers have also shown uneasiness in private about these implications.
The government's separate proposal to levy value added tax on heating fuel
started a still-simmering political row. Ministers are concerned that an
additional hike in fuel bills would stir the controversy again.
One casualty of the conflict with Ms Spottiswoode is the progress of Homes
2000, a proposed scheme to subsidise home improvements such as insulation
for lofts and external walls, and energy-efficient lights and boilers. The
project, which would pay up to half of the costs of these projects, would
need Pounds 8m next year and Pounds 120m by 2000, the trust has indicated.
There have been other concerns with the trust. It directs almost all its
schemes at owner-occupiers, but, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has
pointed out, owners of accommodation for private rental make the least
investment in energy efficiency, and their tenants could greatly benefit
from such schemes.
For the moment, there is an uneasy peace. Parliamentary committees and Ofgas
have concluded that in deciding whether to approve such projects, Ms
Spottiswoode must balance the regulator's responsibilities to protect the
customer from rising prices with those to promote energy efficiency.
The trust argues that the extra sums on fuel bills need not prove
controversial. Although estimates suggest that households which do not
benefit from the schemes could see annual fuel bills rise by nearly 2 per
cent on top of inflation by 1998, the trust says that most projects will pay
for themselves through energy savings within five years.
But while in theory this allows some projects to progress, the energy
industry and some within the trust feel that in practice few significant
ones are likely to progress.
According to Mr Lees, 'the only way forward now is through new legislation.
The government has to decide how it wants energy efficiency to be taken
forward in the competitive market.'
For that reason, he takes considerable comfort from the fact that gas
regulation was included in the Queen's Speech at the opening of parliament
this month. This offers the chance that regulators could be directed
explicitly to allow such cost-pass through.
Until then, however, the trust is effectively stalled, and its executives
must devote much of their time to pleading behind the scenes with
politicians to clearing a way forward. According to Mr Warren, 'of course
the trust can be saved if there is political will'. It is far from clear,
however, that the political will exists.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (4): Big carrot, little stick -
US has ambitious policies. Frank McGurty asks if they will work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmentalists contend that President Clinton's plan to respond to the
threat of global warming contains too much carrot and not enough stick.
Conservatives say it is an overwrought response to non-existent crisis.
But most agree on at least one point - the programme, unveiled amid great
fanfare a year ago, is comprehensive. It sets forth dozens of separate
initiatives aimed at controlling emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and
other gases, which some scientists believe could drastically alter climate
conditions.
The initial goal is to roll back over the next six years the amount of
so-called 'greenhouse' gases discharged into the atmosphere to 1990 levels.
Without any action, emission levels would increase 7 per cent by the turn of
the century, according to the administration's projections.
From its inception, it was virtually certain 'the climate change action
plan', as it is known, would run up against at least some obstacles. Indeed,
in committing the US for the first time to a specific goal and timetable on
reducing greenhouse emissions, the president was launching a plan as
sweeping and potentially contentious as his ill-starred scheme to reform the
US healthcare system.
A year later, the environmental plan is alive and well, in sharp contrast to
healthcare reform, which is currently trapped in political limbo after a
fierce partisan battle in Congress. During a legislative session when many
of the president's proposals were thwarted, the package survived largely
intact, with 40 out of 47 of its original proposals winning approval.
'Overall, compared to where we were a year ago - when it was simply a
proposal - the plan has been a very substantial success in terms of
beginning to address these issues,' says Mr Wesley Warren, associate
director of the White House Office on Environmental Policy, which is
overseeing a plan that involves six separate federal agencies.
Keeping the programme afloat may indeed qualify as a success for the
president, but the start has not been entirely smooth. With both houses of
Congress to be controlled by the opposition Republicans, the next steps in
implementing the plan are sure to prove more difficult. Already for fiscal
1995, the Democratic-controlled Congress slashed the proposed appropriations
for the plan. There is also evidence to suggest the administration has
underestimated the magnitude of the problem. Its response, if fully funded,
could prove inadequate to the initial goal.
It is much too early to judge whether the specific initiatives are living up
to their advance billing. Many of them have been up and running for only a
month. Nevertheless, even critics of some aspects of the programme credit
the administration with getting most of its proposals off the ground.
'In general, the plan is moving in the right direction,' says Mr Daniel
Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental lobbying group.
The package embraces a pot-pourri of programmes, many of them aimed at
striking partnerships between the private and public sectors. The
initiatives range from adjustments in tax policy on employer-paid parking
privileges to measures to encourage better management of forests, which
combat global warming by absorbing carbon after it has been released into
the atmosphere.
But the cornerstone of the plan is a multi-faceted effort to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases at their source. Energy efficiency is
considered crucial because fossil fuel consumption by homes, offices and
factories is responsible for more than 85 per cent of US greenhouse
emissions.
Many of the plan's initiatives simply expand on existing projects. The
Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights programme, launched three
years ago, offers technical support to businesses which are considering
upgrading their lighting systems. This year 400 new organisations have
signed up, bringing the total to about 1,600.
With each participant realising an average 45 per cent decline in energy
use, the EPA has stepped up its recruitment drive by targeting universities,
churches and other non-profit groups. 'Green Lights has a solid track record
which demonstrates that these types of programmes work,' says Mr Lashof.
Other projects would put fresh ideas into play. Among the most promising is
the Department of Energy's initiative to develop new energy-efficiency
standards for 11 residential appliances.
But in at least one case - hot water heaters - the electric industry is
vigorously opposing the adoption of new rules, which would encourage the use
of a more efficient type of gas-fired heaters.
'That calls into question whether the industry is willing to co-operate
beyond the level of lip service,' says Mr Lashof.
The issue is particularly germane because the administration has chosen to
highlight its relationship with the electric industry as evidence that its
non-confrontational strategy is working well.
The response to the DOE's Climate Challenge is a special source of pride.
More than 800 electric utilities, which represent 80 per cent of US
generating capacity, have agreed to undertake voluntary measures to reduce
their greenhouse emissions, employing a flexible array of options.
The White House projects Dollars 60bn in private investment in
energy-savings technology by the end of the decade, against a commitment of
just Dollars 1.9bn in federal funds, some of which is to be redirected from
other areas.
But public spending is already falling short of the original target. For
fiscal 1995, the plan was granted budget authority of only Dollars 232m,
much less than the Dollars 344m sought by the president. The DOE, the most
important agency involved in the programme, was given a little more than
half its Dollars 208m request.
Last May, Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, told a Senate committee
that deep cuts in funding 'would make the president's commitment virtually
impossible to meet'.
The White House declined to comment specifically on how spending reductions
might affect the plan, but Mr Warren said the administration would press for
extra funding in subsequent years to make up for the shortfall in fiscal
1995.
However, with the Republicans likely to seek cuts in federal income taxes,
and perhaps an amendment to the US constitution to require balanced federal
budgets, funds are most likely to be even more tight as the emissions
deadline nears. Environmentalists such as Mr Lashof also question whether
the adminstration's plan has underestimated the likely rate at which
greenhouse emissions will increase in the coming years, assuming no action
is taken.
Since the plan was unveiled a year ago, both private and government
economists have lifted their estimates of 1994 gross domestic product to
more than 3 per cent, from early forecasts of less than 2.5 per cent.
At the same time, the price of crude oil has fluctuated without showing any
big net increase; the administration assumed higher prices in its emission
projections.
If the economy continues to outperform the forecasts and oil prices stay
low, the natural demand for fossil fuels would surely accelerate, making the
challenge of reducing emissions to 1990 levels even more daunting than a
year ago.
Such questions are to be addressed squarely in about a year. The White House
has promised to re-evaluate and, if necessary, modify the climate programme
next autumn to keep the emission reductions on track.
'We are simply not going to look at this on a month-to-month basis,' Mr
Warren says.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (1): Big test for Benazir Bhutto - In her
second term in office, Pakistan's prime minister has made a good start by
promising a firm response to her country's deep-rooted problems. Now Ms
Bhutto has to prove she can deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister who is visiting the UK this
week, leads a country which is now at a critical point in its history.
In the past five years, Pakistan has made a stormy transition from military
dictatorship to Parliamentary democracy. Despite six changes of government,
it has established a solid consensus in favour of liberalising the economy
and opening up to foreign trade and investment. It has also gone some way
towards improving relations with the US and other western powers, despite
their continuing concern about Pakistan's nuclear programme.
However, these achievements still stand on fragile foundations. Pakistani
politics is riddled with violence and corruption. The small ruling elite has
shown little willingness to share the fruits of prosperity with the great
mass of ordinary Pakistanis, some of whom are falling prey to the
temptations of crime, political extremism and Islamic fundamentalism. And
although Ms Bhutto has a good personal rapport with many westerners, the US
administration and most European capitals remain somewhat wary of Islamabad.
Nevertheless, Pakistan is at least making progress and at a pace which has
quickened noticeably in the year since Ms Bhutto took office for the second
time in last autumn's general election.
In politics, despite persistent efforts by Mr Nawaz Sharif, the ex-prime
minister and Ms Bhutto's bitter enemy, to make trouble , the government has
achieved a measure of political stability. After the storms of 1993, which
culminated in the overthrow of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government, 1994 has, by
Pakistani standards, been fairly calm. Ms Bhutto's government retains a firm
grip on the administration and on Parliament.
In the economic sphere, Ms Bhutto has successfully pulled Pakistan out of a
foreign exchange crisis which loomed large in mid-1993 and has put the
country's finances on an even keel, with the help of a squeeze on credit,
imports and public spending. Foreign exchange reserves have soared from a
paltry USDollars 300m to a record Dollars 3bn.
The feud with Mr Nawaz Sharif has fortunately not prevented Ms Bhutto from
continuing with her predecessor's economic liberalisation programme,
including import tariff cuts, financial deregulation and the most radical
privatisation programme in south Asia. International companies say the
incentives for foreign investors are among the most attractive in the
developing world.
'Pakistan has truly come to believe that foreign investment is a must,' says
Mr Nisar Memon, president of the Overseas Investors' Chamber of Commerce and
Industry in Karachi.
Foreign companies have responded by increasing their actual investments and
pledging a big increase in the future, notably in power, where the
government has collected proposals for new generating stations worth
USDollars 12bn. These would, if realised, double the country's capacity.
In the financial markets, the overseas sale of shares in Pakistan
Telecommunications Company, the state-controlled utility, raised Dollars
900m, a greater figure than all previous portfolio investment in Pakistan.
Yet, despite these gains much more needs to be done if Pakistan is to see
broad-based political, economic and social modernisation. The root cause of
the country's chronic political instability is the failure of the dominant
land-owning elite to share power with the rest of Pakistan's fast-growing
population of 128m.
More than half the members of the National Assembly are feudal landlords,
voted in by their mostly illiterate share-croppers. The country is run by a
few hundred families who inter-marry and place their sons in the three pools
of power - politics, the bureaucracy and the army.
Many of these people, though not all, have come to regard government office
as a personal fiefdom, in which nepotism, tax evasion and corruption
undermine good administration. As Farooq Leghari, the president, said this
month in a Parliamentary policy speech: 'Corruption has permeated all walks
of life.'
The elite has also failed to distribute resources adequately to the great
mass of its fellow countrymen. According to United Nations data, even though
per capita income in Pakistan is considerably higher than in neighbouring
India (Dollars 1,970 per head in 1991 on a purchasing power parity basis
against Dollars 1,150), Pakistan is well behind India in education and
health standards. Only 37 per cent of Pakistanis can read, compared with 50
per cent of Indians, and life expectancy at birth is 58.3 years, compared
with 59.7.
The explanation lies partly in the defence burden imposed on Pakistan by its
feud with India over the troubled region of Kashmir. Fully one third of the
government budget is spent on the military, starving social development of
funds. The scale of military spending also virtually guarantees the generals
a powerful influence over the whole of public life.
Even though General Waheed, the army chief of staff, is avowedly apolitical,
his successors may not be. And while the conflict also puts a strain on
India's public finance and on politics in India, Pakistan is a much smaller
country and less able to contain its baleful effects. Few voices in
Pakistan, however, challenge the consensus that military spending retains a
high priority. Washington, for example, failed in an attempt to secure a cap
on Pakistan's nuclear programme in return for a shipment of F-16 jets:
Islamabad refused to consider such a move unless India did likewise.
The immense distractions of Kashmir have been compounded by the effects of
the continuing fighting in Afghanistan, where Pakistan remains involved in
the rivalry between warring Mujahideen groups. The legacy of the anti-Soviet
war has left huge quantities of arms in Pakistan, particularly in the
lightly-administered mountainous tribal areas in the north, where, under
treaties dating back to independence, the government's writ is limited.
Power rests in the hands of tribal elders, some of whom have used it to
amass fortunes smuggling guns and narcotics. According to the UN, Pakistan,
which knew little even of opium 20 years ago, has become the world's second
largest source of heroin after Burma. It has also spawned 3m drug addicts.
The country's uneven political and social development and its ready access
to guns has created fertile ground for crime and for political and religious
extremism. The most pressing problem is in Karachi, the commercial capital,
where more than two years of army deployment has failed to end criminal and
political violence.
Populated largely by refugees from northern India and their descendants,
Karachi, furnishes about 60 per cent of government revenue but its people
mostly feel excluded from a political system dominated by indigenous Sindhis
and Punjabis - see report, page three.
In the northern tribal areas, some chiefs and militant mullahs have proved
themselves powerful enough to challenge the central government, notably in
Malakand district, where armed supporters of a radical Islamic preacher have
staged two uprisings this year.
To their credit, Ms Bhutto and her ministers recognise the scale of the
problem. She talks of the need for 'social revolution' in Pakistan.
Mr Leghari's speech, cited above, is a model of objective analysis of
matters which many governments would prefer to ignore. As well as dealing
with corruption, he makes tough remarks on drugs, law and order, and the
'woefully low' education standards. Moreover, the government is taking
action. Anti-corruption and anti-narcotics laws have been tightened. Karachi
has been promised better policing and long-term investment in public
services.
Military spending is being kept under close control while social spending is
being increased through a Social Action Programme, backed by international
aid donors, which envisages spending Dollars 7bn over 1993-98 mainly on
education and health.
With luck and good weather, the economy should recover this year after two
sluggish years and give Ms Bhutto some room to manoeuvre in financing these
ambitious plans. She says: We don't believe in talking. We believe in
doing.'
But she has yet to show that she has the determination to force the rural
elite to become more accommodating to the needs of ordinary Pakistanis. One
example of the landowners' reluctance to countenance change has been the
delay over the introduction of an agricultural income tax, imposed on the
feudal elite. This was passed last year by the National Assembly and has
since been ratified by provincial assemblies in Sindh, North-West Frontier
Province and Baluchistan but Punjab, home of the richest farmers, has
refused to comply. If the landowners do not pay tax, who will pay for the
education of their tenants?
Ms Bhutto knows as well as anyone that a powerful and disciplined army can
suppress social conflict but cannot remove its causes. She has made a good
start in her second term in office by identifying Pakistan's deep-rooted
problems and promising a response. She has now to prove she can deliver.

The European Commission is working hard to improve energy efficiency by
EU-wide regulation. But the results fall far short of its ambitions.
Economic pressures, rock-bottom fuel prices and political wrangling between
EU governments have thwarted Brussels on the two main planks of its energy
efficiency campaign - the ill-fated carbon tax and a clutch of energy-saving
programmes. Both initiatives have effectively stalled.
Driving the EU's campaign is a commitment made in the mid-1980s to raise
energy savings by 20 per cent between 1986 and 1995. Current estimates by
the Commission energy directorate are that saving will be only 11-12 per
cent.
Brussels officials partly blame the historically low energy prices.
But confusion over whether the EU's main priorities should be economic or
environmental has also frustrated the Commission.
A second policy commitment, motivated purely by environmental concerns, is
the objective agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth summit to stabilise carbon
dioxide emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000. That target is also
likely to be missed, although estimates vary over the shortfall. Environment
commissioner Yannis Paleokrassas has predicted a shortfall of 15 per cent by
the end of the century.
These two objectives have co-existed uneasily, and much of the blame for the
failure of EU energy-saving policy is attributed to the confusion between
them.
'The carbon tax has actually been the bane of energy efficiency policy
because it has distracted everyone's attention from the other measures,'
says Mr Andrew Warren, director of the London-based Association for the
Conservation of Energy.
But those other measures - led by the Commission's Ecu 35m five-year Save
(Specific Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency) - programme have also
fallen victim to the post-Maastricht Treaty campaign for subsidiarity.
The Commission's energy directorate, DG17, is therefore drawing up a second
Save scheme which will be mainly educational, with none of the
legally-binding directives envisaged in the first one.
The new low-key approach is in stark contrast to Brussels' previous
ambitions, which reached a high peak in 1992 when Carlo Ripa di Meana, then
environment commissioner, proposed the controversial energy tax. Now,
although the Commission continues to promote it, it is generally agreed that
the carbon tax is dead.
According to the original Brussels proposal the tax would have levied
Dollars 10 - later watered down to Dollars 3 - on the equivalent of a barrel
of oil.
Such fiscal interference by the EU has been flatly rejected by the UK, in
defiance of compromise plans tabled by a succession of governments in the
EU's rotating six-month presidency. The EU's southern states also posed
problems, arguing the tax would discriminate against their less developed
economies.
The attempt to break the deadlock this year, when the Greek presidency tried
to tempt the sceptical southern EU states with compensatory 'burden-sharing'
arrangements, did not even address the UK's opposition.
The Commission, supported by the current German presidency, is now pushing
this debate in a far less controversial direction. The latest suggestions,
yet to translate into any formal proposal, are to attack CO emissions
through the EU's regime for excise duties and VAT on fuel.
The UK, although still deeply opposed to relax its grip over fiscal policy,
has to some extent led the way along this path by imposing VAT on domestic
electricity - a move estimated to achieve 25 per cent of Britain's targeted
reduction in carbon emissions.
The EU excise and VAT system, established at the start of 1993, is due for
review by the end of the year but is likely to be delayed into the next
Commission, which takes office in January.
The debate is still likely to be dogged by arguments over sovereignty,
however.
Meanwhile, Brussels is adapting its other energy-saving programmes to the
new political climate. Gone are its ambitions to set EU- wide
fuel-conservation standards on building construction and management - a key
failure of the original Save programme which led to the watering down of six
directives.
Instead the Commission plans to limit legislation to areas covered by
existing EU internal market rules - in other words in traded goods, such as
fridges and boilers, where Save has already had some success. Gone also is
the idea of overruling national laws with new directives from Brussels.
'From now on we are following the added-value concept - what can Save add to
the national programmes,' says the Commission.
The new approach, expected to be spelled out by the German presidency at a
Council of Environment ministers in Brussels next month, is also geared more
closely to market realities. For example, the new proposed directive on
third party financing would create incentives for banks to fund energy
saving at public institutions such as hospitals.
Increasingly funds are being directed at projects for eastern Europe, both
from Save and from the EU's Pounds 700m five-year Thermie programme, which
aims to promote new energy-saving technologies.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (1): Better technologies reap
big rewards - Anxiety over global warming is now the strongest impetus for
saving energy. But fear of oil scarcities is a more durable argument

Not long ago, the impetus for energy efficiency came from traditional
concerns: the high cost of energy, the need to conserve finite resources,
and a desire by countries to reduce their dependence on imports for national
security reasons.
Today, all those concerns have weakened. Despite a recent blip, the price of
oil is at its lowest point in real terms since the early 1970s. World
reserves of oil and gas have been boosted by large finds in places as far
apart as Colombia, Vietnam and the Shetland Isles. The lowering of East-West
tensions and the decline in Opec's power have reduced worries about import
reliance.
But in their place, there is a new worry. As Mr David Nemtzow of America's
Alliance to Save Energy puts it: 'The politics have changed. Now, it is
overwhelmingly driven by the environment.'
Specifically, the worry is over global warming, and the threat to the
climate posed by growing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
More than 100 countries are signatories to the 1992 Rio convention which
requires countries to try and bring CO emissions back to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. But while this has given a fresh impetus to energy saving, it has
yet to prove particularly strong.
The global improvement in energy efficiency which occurred in the 1970s and
1980s has flattened out in the last few years. This should improve this year
because the world economic recovery will bring on stream efficient new
plant, and people will buy new cars and appliances which need less energy.
But on the whole, progress is disappointing.
The threat of global warming is not as potent as the fear of oil running
out. Individuals who care deeply about the environment have been slow to
insulate their homes or drive smaller cars. And businesses  - apart from
those where energy is a major cost - tend to treat energy saving as
secondary.
At a recent conference in India, Mr Michael Jefferson, deputy secretary
general of the World Energy Council (WEC), said: 'There is little evidence
that either energy consumers or most energy policy-makers recognise the
importance of raising energy efficiency and conserving energy in terms of
effective action, or that this situation will change in the near future.'
The fact is that governments have been reluctant to pass draconian laws to
enforce greater energy efficiency. Most of them have preferred to set up
'partnerships' with energy users in which the main role is played by
publicity, persuasion and a few tightly focused - and tightly financed -
projects to promote energy saving technologies and information.
'We want to avoid excessive command and control,' says Mrs Christine Ervin,
the US assistant secretary of state for energy efficiency who oversees a
broad range of initiatives designed to encourage electric utilities,
appliance manufacturers, car makers and businesses to produce more with
less.
The low cost of energy in most countries is one of the greatest stumbling
blocks to the elimination of waste. Mr Andrew Brown of the energy efficiency
division of the EU Commission in Brussels, (which has several information
and technology programmes of its own) says: 'The challenge we face is
detaching energy efficiency from prices,' and that will probably have to be
done by persuading people that environmental damage is a 'cost' which
everyone will ultimately have to bear.
But until that detachment comes about, the raising of energy prices through
taxation is still seen as one way of driving home the message. Several
European countries including the UK have recently introduced forms of energy
tax. But even here, achievements have been mixed.
President Clinton failed to gain acceptance for his BTU tax last year, and
the EU's proposed carbon tax has yet to leave the drawing board.
But there are other methods. One is technology. The energy efficiency
industry has made great strides in producing new methods and products:
refrigerators which consume 30 per cent less electricity, boilers with high
energy conversion capabilities, sophisticated thermostats and switches,
demand side controls.
The modernisation of the highly inefficient economies of East Europe, and
construction of new power plants in China should also help the global
picture.
Alongside these developments, there is the rapid growth of consultancies and
energy contract managers who make a living by cutting other people's energy
costs.
Mr Robert Skinner, director of the office of policy analysis at the
International Energy Agency in Paris, believes that much of the change will
be driven by technology.
'Traditional policies are almost irrelevant to what's going on,' he says.
'Technology is moving at such a pace that governments which take the
old-style approach will get left behind.'
However, one weakness of technology is that much of it still requires
subsidy: for example 'renewable' technologies such as wind power or bio-mass
combustion, or some of the more exotic gadgetry. Others, such as combined
heat and power where the heat from electricity generation is used for
industrial or residential purposes, encounter institutional obstacles, even
though their efficiency is high.
Mr Ton van der Does, chairman of Cogen Europe, the CHP trade group, believes
that Europe's tradition of large, state-owned power stations stands in the
way of CHP schemes which, by their nature, are local and entrepreneurial.
'The industry is still shaped by the old structures,' he says. 'The trend
towards energy efficiency is not going as fast as everyone would like. But
there is a change of mentality, specially with regard to co-generation, and
that is important.'
A further element in the debate is competition. In many countries, the
absence of free pricing of energy or of free access for new suppliers is a
major obstacle to efficiency.
Although many countries are now following the UK in privatising their
electricity industries, this process has a long way to go. But, as the UK
has discovered, it can be a double-edged sword: greater competition also
means cheaper energy, and that works against greater energy efficiency.
In the medium term, the drive for energy efficiency will be dictated -
barring an unexpected leap in energy prices - by the strength of countries'
commitment to the Rio convention. It is still too early to say whether the
CO reduction targets will be met.
But over the coming months, signatories will be preparing for the March 1995
conference in Berlin where they will review progress and take the first
steps towards setting further targets for beyond 2000.
Mr Michael Grubb, who heads the energy and environmental programme of
London's Royal Institute of International Affairs, says that 'much of the
steam has gone out of it' because the public and the media have turned their
attention elsewhere.
This makes him doubtful that solid progress will be achieved in Berlin. On
the other hand, 'no country can backtrack now', he says. Moreover, the
latest scientific evidence tends to reinforce the view that the global
warming threat is real, so the pressure for action will remain.
