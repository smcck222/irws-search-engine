FT  26 NOV 94 / Lib Dems get tough on gas guzzlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday proposed a dramatic cut in vehicle excise
duty for smaller cars, combined with an increase in petrol taxes, to reduce
traffic congestion and air pollution.
The party said in a policy paper fleshing out aspects of its alternative
Budget proposals that a rise of 20p a gallon in fuel duty would fund a
Pounds 120 a year cut in duty for cars up to 1,500cc.
Mr Matthew Taylor, environment spokesman, said the proposals would shift the
burden of taxation away from car ownership on to 'excessive' use, especially
by owners of inefficient vehicles.
He said that the UK's 'addiction' to big cars cost the economy up to Pounds
17bn a year, compared with revenue of Pounds 16.6bn.
Mr Taylor said that the combination of a Pounds 10 duty and dearer petrol
would cut motoring bills by Pounds 75 a year for average rural drivers,
Pounds 90 for average urban drivers and Pounds 85 for drivers travelling
less than 7,000 miles a year.
Costs would rise by Pounds 60 for the average driver of a 2,000cc car, but
would fall by Pounds 135 a year for a 1,300cc vehicle.
A business driver averaging 20,000 miles a year in a 2,800cc car at 24 miles
a gallon would face an extra bill of Pounds 165. Owning a 1,500cc car would
save this driver Pounds 55.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Bids sought for adviser to Railtrack sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading investment banks were yesterday invited to bid to advise on the
privatisation of Railtrack, the company running British Rail's track,
signalling and stations.
The government has given investment banks between two and three weeks to
submit proposals. It then expects to decide by Christmas.
The Railtrack privatisation is the last significant sell-off for the
foreseeable future. The mandate represents a last chance for banks to build
a record for advising on privatisation.
There is nevertheless some concern that rail privatisation will get caught
up in the political battle in the run-up to the next election.
Mr Christopher Clarke, a director at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank,
said: 'I think that anybody who works for government has to recognise that
there are political considerations as well as the vagaries of the market.'
Leading contenders are thought by the investment banking sector to include
the UK houses with long track records in privatisation.
These include Kleinwort Benson, which advised on the privatisation of the
electricity industry.
It believes that the experience of restructuring a sector before sale will
prove particularly relevant to the Railtrack bid.
Kleinwort laid claim to expertise in the sector with an analyst's report
putting a real market value on Railtrack of between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds
4.3bn.
Samuel Montagu said it would bid in conjunction with James Capel, its sister
broker, and perhaps a third party, notwithstanding its role in advising the
government on rail privatisation in general.
SG Warburg, the Barings group, and Schroders are also believed to be
potential bidders.
But Barclays de Zoete Wedd, which some tipped as a competitor, said it did
not think it would go for the mandate.
An executive said: 'It is going to be quite difficult and terribly
resource-intensive.' BZW is already involved in the flotation of coal
company RJB Mining and several other privatisation-related transactions.
NM Rothschild is unlikely to make a bid as it already advises Railtrack on
privatisation.

FT  26 NOV 94 / The price is wrong for some motorists: Why sales to private
car buyers are declining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motor trade is starting to fear that sales of new cars to private buyers
are plunging - not because of a lack of consumer confidence, but because of
discontent with high prices and depreciation.
Evidence is mounting that private motorists who can afford to buy new cars
are instead buying cars which are one or two years old. This leaves the
heaviest burden of depreciation to be borne by the companies which bought
them new - often at deeply discounted prices which disillusioned private
motorists believe they subsidise.
Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff
Business School, said improvements to the quality of cars meant that private
buyers were finding such second-hand purchases largely problem-free, and
many might never return to the new car market - 'at least not until. . . new
car prices come down to the value-for-money level offered by cars in North
America'.
The National Franchised Dealers Association, which represents franchised
motor dealers, said carmakers' 'fleets first' marketing priorities meant the
average price of a medium-size family car was Pounds 2,000 higher than it
would otherwise be.
Mr Alan Pulham, association director, said this reflected two factors: The
need to fund the discounts, free servicing and other inducements to fleets
not normally available to private buyers. These perks were paid for in the
main by private motorists paying close to the manufacturer's list price.
Cars available to private buyers often had higher specifications than they
wanted or could afford as they were aimed mainly at fleets.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that new
car registrations rose 8.5 per cent in the first 10 months of this year to
1.71m, compared with the same period last year.
But this was led overwhelmingly by the business car sector - which accounts
for nearly 60 per cent of the total - with a rise of 15.8 per cent.
Even taking into account the August rush, when private buyers usually
predominate, registrations to private buyers rose just 2.2 per cent. If the
August factor is removed registrations to private buyers fell 5 per cent in
the first half of the year, in spite of a 14 per cent rise in total
registrations.
But a more telling pointer to a consumer revolt comes in the latest
quarterly statistical bulletin from HPI, the motor trade finance
organisation. This shows that the number of new cars bought on credit is
ahead of last year but that the rate of increase has fallen in each of the
past three quarters.
Many businesses, as well as private motorists, buy new cars on credit. So
the weakening of new cars bought on credit understates the rate of decline
among private buyers.
In contrast, purchases of used cars on credit have been rising for most of
the past year. HPI's data for last month shows another year-on-year rise of
11.1 per cent - almost twice the new car level.
Carmakers have made much of price cuts - or at least the absence of sizeable
price increases - as showing fierce competition.
Yet an analysis by Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group,
concludes that the price restraint is more apparent than real. The analysis
shows the list price of a typical best-selling car to have risen just 3.7
per cent between 1991 and this year. In that period the 10 per cent special
car tax has been removed and dealers have had their profit margins cut -
slashing the discounts they could offer private buyers.
The study concludes: 'The average new car should be around 13 per cer cent
cheaper because of the abolition of special car tax and the introduction of
lower dealer margins.'
Prof Rhys said that the view of private buyers that they were subsiding
fleet buyers was misguided because the sheer size of the fleet market helped
to cover costs which would otherwise fall on private buyers.
But the crunch for carmakers, he said, was that their costs were too high
and that 'for the first time British buyers are becoming aware of the car
value that Americans get for their money'.
He added: 'Prices of new cars in Europe must come down in real terms to
North American levels. That's when the fur will fly. There are simply too
many carmakers in Europe and they can't all survive.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Increased production fails to prevent motor trade deficit
doubling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motor industry's balance of trade deficit nearly doubled last year to
Pounds 5.1bn from Pounds 2.8bn in 1992, John Griffiths writes.
The deterioration came in spite of UK vehicle production reaching its
highest level for 20 years.
It was caused mainly by vehicle markets in continental Europe suffering one
of the steepest falls since the second world war.
This restricted UK exports, while simultaneously focusing Continental
manufacturers' attention on the UK vehicle market, the only significant one
in Europe to experience growth last year.
Car exports by value increased 10 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn, including a rise
of 57 per cent in the value of exports to non-European Union destinations
and a reduction of only 1 per cent to other EU states.
This was more than offset by car imports, which rose 21 per cent in value to
Pounds 7.9bn.
The total value of exports, including commercial vehicles and parts and
accessories, fell 1 per cent to Pounds 11bn, with exports outside the EU
rising 36 per cent to Pounds 3.6bn. However, total imports rose 16 per cent,
to Pounds 16.1bn.
The deficit is expected to have fallen during this year, mainly as a result
of continuing recovery in continental Europe.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Relief on interest -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mortgage on my sole residence is with a lender, Western Trust &amp; Savings,
but its interest rate is not particularly competitive.
If I re-mortgage with a different lender, will I still be able to claim tax
relief on the interest charged? The present loan is under Miras and I am a
standard-rate taxpayer.
In principle the answer is 'yes', by virtue of section 354(1)(c) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. This gives relief for interest paid
'on a loan to defray money applied . . . in paying off another loan if
interest on that other loan would have been eligible for relief under
section 353 had the loan not been paid off . . .' However, the answer would
be 'not entirely' - because of the restrictions imposed by section 355(2A &amp;
2B) - if, for example, part of your existing mortgage covered 'money applied
in improving or developing land or buildings on land, otherwise than by the
erection of a new building (which is not part of an existing residence) on
land which, immediately before the improvement or development began, had no
building on it'.
We could have given you a simpler and more helpful reply if you had given us
more precise background facts.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Are bonds the answer? -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am a married man, now retired, with two sons and I have been considering
possible ways of reducing the burden of inheritance tax - perhaps through
some form of trust arrangement - when my wife and I die.
A couple of financial advisers have provided information concerning 'will
trusts' and 'inheritance trusts' (also referred to as 'loan trusts'). Each
recommends buying single-premium insurance bonds as a way of passing capital
into a trust for the ultimate use of beneficiaries when the surviving spouse
dies.
What do you think?
A bond can be helpful in the process of IHT planning but, clearly, it should
be considered with all other forms of planning. Such bonds do generate
commission for those who sell them.
You need to determine the income required by the surviving spouse. If
certain assets and the income arising from them could be left in trust to
the children on the first death, possibly by way of a trust, then this would
be an easy way to utilise the nil rate band and ensure that assets are
passed on in a tax-efficient manner.
But if all the assets are required to meet the ongoing needs of the
surviving spouse, then this might not be a practical route for you.
You could consider owning the house as tenants in common, rather than under
a joint tenancy, and then leaving a half share in trust to the children,
possibly with the wife as a trustee.
This does not provide a cast-iron protection for the surviving spouse (also,
the children might be able to force a sale through the courts) but it is
worthy of consideration.
Much depends upon the present and likely future relationships between the
family and the income requirements. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant
Stoy Hayward).

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): 13-year hitch -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 13 years ago, I had a company which sold products to a company in
Georgetown, Guyana. It paid by cheque but the money never got further than
the Bank of Guyana, which advised me that payment was held up due to
'insufficient international funds'. The story has been the same ever since
despite repeated queries.
I estimate that I am now owed Pounds 6,000 in interest and costs and I do
not see why I should write this off. I sold the goods in good faith and the
customer paid for them. So why should a bank grab the money?
Our feeling is that 'insufficient international funds' may well be a
smoke-screen suggesting that the Guyana company is in financial difficulty.
To find out more about its financial standing, it could be worth contacting
an accountancy firm in Georgetown, the capital. These firms may be able to
assist: Jack A. Ali Sons &amp; Company, 145 Crown Street 6, Georgetown; and DRT
International, PO Box 10506, 77 Brickdam Stabroek. Georgetown. (Reply by

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Trusts zero in on
pensions - Life offices' monopoly is under threat as deadline nears for
disclosure of charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment and unit trust groups are gearing up to take a larger slice of
the personal pension market and break the virtual monopoly of the life
offices.
Dunedin is the latest to launch an investment trust personal plan, following
Foreign &amp; Colonial's successful venture earlier this year, while
Framlington's plan brings the number of unit trust personal pensions to four
including Gartmore, Invesco and Rothschild Asset Management. (Mercury offers
a low-cost plan through its life arm while Fidelity and Murray Johnstone
offer group, but not individual, plans).
Dunedin and Framlington claim to offer low-cost products. Both have a set-up
charge of Pounds 100 and an annual fee thereafter of Pounds 50.
Framlington's plan looks particularly attractive for higher premiums. For
contributions over Pounds 2,000, the initial charge of 3 per cent (5 per
cent for lower premiums) is competitive while the annual management charge
of 0.4 per cent is very low. Dunedin also offers good value, with no initial
charge and an annual management charge of 1 per cent.
It is difficult at present for consumers to compare these costs with life
office plans because life offices do not have to reveal their true charges
until January. But one of the advantages of unit and investment trusts is
that charges must be explicit, although not all of the plans available are
low cost.
Trusts use single-premium pricing, which means that the charges you pay
relate only to that premium. With a typical regular-premium life office
plan, the charges are weighted heavily to the early years so, if you stop
payments during this period, you will have little or nothing to show for
your money.
With unit trust and investment trust plans, there are no penalties if you
stop or reduce premiums or want to transfer your fund to another provider.
Several life offices have switched already to single-premium pricing, or
plan to do so.
This is because they believe that after January, when consumers can see the
effect that charges have on their investments, they will avoid plans that
incorporate high up-front costs and inflexible contract terms.
There are other options for those interested in unit and investment trusts.
Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the pensions for partnerships department at
consulting actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Investors prepared to pay larger
contributions should also consider a self-invested personal pension (Sipp).'
Sipps separate the administration and investment management and, for larger
contributions, offer a comparatively low-cost route to virtually any form of
investment including almost all the unit and investment trust funds.
Contacts: Framlington, tel: 0345-775 511; Dunedin, 0722-415 890. Both groups
offer a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) to top up
company pensions.
You should always seek independent financial advice before selecting a
pension plan.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Growth forecasts pass 4% mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading City securities houses have increased their forecasts for UK
economic growth next year to more than 4 per cent.
If the forecasts are proved correct the UK will enjoy economic growth on a
scale not seen since the 'Lawson boom' of the mid-1980s.
SG Warburg's research team has increased its forecast for 1995 growth from
3.8 per cent to 4.5 per cent - the highest prediction from the City - after
a rate of just over 4 per cent this year. The main reason for the higher
forecast is a better export performance.
The long-term trend growth rate of the economy is normally believed to be
between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. Economists say a long period of
above-trend growth - such as from 1985 to 1988, when growth was 4 per cent
or above in every year - eventually brings inflation.
That has certainly been the view of the team at UBS, led by Mr Bill Martin.
UBS has increased its 1995 GDP growth forecast to 4.25 per cent.
But while UBS previously felt that the economy would overheat next year, it
now predicts this problem will not occur until 1996. 'This forecast change
therefore offers postponment rather than absolution from a day of
reckoning,' said Mr Martin.
The SG Warburg team thinks that underlying inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) will be 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of next year
and 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1996. Such a modest acceleration
would still mean that the government failed to achieve its aim of reducing
inflation to the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range by
the end of this parliament.
Meanwhile, a third securities house, Kleinwort Benson, has also increased
its GDP forecast for next year, but only to 2.7 per cent from 2.2 per cent.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Bill Whitbread, 'fireball' brewer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colonel Bill Whitbread, who has died aged 93, was one of the leading family
brewers of the 20th century.
While typifying the old family brewer of an earlier age - a landowner with a
love of hunting, shooting and riding - he took his family business into a
more modern age with a jolt in the 1950s and 1960s.
As chairman of Whitbread &amp; Co from 1944 to 1971 he reorganised the company's
antiquated financial structure and devised a shareholding formula, based on
A and B shares and a separate investment company, which preserved family
control while providing for the injection of much-needed capital.
He invented the 'Whitbread umbrella', a series of equity capital exchanges
which enabled more than 30 family brewing companies threatened by takeover
to shelter under Whitbread's wing. Later, when circumstances forced the
abandonment of the umbrella, he led his company in a determined strategy of
acquisition, rationalisation of productive capacity, and the establishment
of national beer brands.
Whitbread was the great-great-great grandson of Samuel Whitbread, who
founded the company in 1742, and the son of HW 'Harry' Whitbread. Educated
at Eton and at Corpus Christi Cambridge, where he studied history, he
trained as a brewer at Truman Hanbury Buxton in Burton-upon-Trent (1921-23),
then worked at Fisons' Thetford maltings before going to Whitbread
headquarters at Chiswell Street, London, in 1924.
He became a managing director in 1927 and served on the board until 1979.
The year 1927 was significant for the company because Whitbread embarked on
a big expansion in south-east England by acquiring three Kentish breweries
and the Mackeson stout brand.
His absence on military service during the second world war weakened the
company's management when British brewing was required to maintain its
output with depleted manpower and depreciating capital resources.
It was in the difficult post-war years that 'Colonel Bill' came into his
own. In 1948 he steered through the reorganisation of the company's capital.
A quarter of the equity was placed on the market by Barings and Schroders.
Six years later Whitbread Investment, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was
established to acquire the umbrella shareholdings. This became the vehicle
for the directors' retention of a controlling interest in the expanding
company.
Described by the company's historian as a 'fireball', Whitbread could be
impatient and rude. Perceptive about the industry, but strongly wedded to
family loyalties and paternalism, he needed a foil. This he found in FOAG
'Alex' Bennett, who succeeded him as chairman in 1971.
The Whitbread-Bennett partnership set the company on the right road in the
turmoil of mergers and acquisitions which characterised the industry from
the late 1950s to the early 1970s.
Under Whitbread the company was transformed from a relatively small,
under-capitalised concern - in spite of its claims to 'national' status - to
one of Britain's big six brewers. The umbrella certainly protected the
independence of some companies. For others, it was the first step to full
merger with Whitbread in the more competitive conditions of the 1960s. More
than 23 companies were acquired in the period 1961-71.
The merger programme strained the company's management resources, while the
acquisition of numerous small productive sites necessitated a comprehensive
programme of rationalisation. Yet while the company had to transform its
organisation to match its growth, it always had a reputation for sound
management.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Labour attacks 'covert' links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of 'covertly encouraging' business
links between Britain and Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'We know that
a number of British businesses have encouraged Iraqi industrialists to talk
about contracts. All this seems to be an abuse of UN mandatory economic
sanctions against Iraq.'
Mr Cunningham was responding to a report in yesterday's Financial Times that
British companies were preparing - with the approval of the Department of
Trade and Industry - to resume trade with President Saddam Hussein's regime
when sanctions are lifted.
The DTI has issued licences to the British organisers of two trade fairs in
Baghdad due to start tomorrow. The DTI said last night that it had issued
the licences to allow the companies to talk to the Iraqis about humanitarian
aid. The department added: 'We consider this falls within the boundaries set
by the UN sanctions regime.'
Other government departments yesterday distanced themselves from moves to
build stronger trade links with Iraq. The Foreign Office said that Mr
Stephen Crouch, the director-general of Iraqi British Interests Group, a
commercial lobby association, did not represent the government's position.
Mr Crouch was in Jordan on September 3 with Mr Henry Bellingham, the
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary.
Mr Michael Colvin, chairman of the Conservative foreign affairs committee,
said yesterday that he had met Mr Crouch 'two or three times' and that he
had given informal advice to him relating to UN sanctions.
He said: 'What I have been saying to Crouch is build up contacts with
businesses in Iraq if you want, so when sanctions are lifted you are in a
position to go.'
Reports of these growing business links drew an angry response from the
Iraqi opposition last night.
Mr Hoshya Zebari, an executive council member of the Iraqi National
Congress, the main opposition grouping, said: 'Trade delegations by British
and other European businessmen are very detrimental to the cause of the
majority of the Iraqi people. This kind of business-as-usual attitude has
encouraged Saddam to go to war in the past.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Tackling the numbers problem: The profession's troubled
search for cohesion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the public, accountants are all the same. Proof of this can be seen on a
video being shown at a series of accountancy conferences.
In it people are waylaid in the street and asked what they know about
accountants. The answer is very little, beyond a vague idea that the
'chartered' ones are trained.
Given this public perception of unity it is ironic that the profession is
spending a great deal of time and money trying to achieve a cohesion most
people think it already has.
But leaders of the profession are worried that this vague recognition is not
enough. They want a 'single voice', and a strong lobbying group, to fight
against government intervention and steer the profession towards unity in
the next century.
The present structure of the accountancy profession is anything but uniform.
There are six professional bodies, six presidents, different training
schemes, different qualifications, different headquarters, and different
styles.
As Mr Tom Glancy, president of the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants, told a meeting in Solihull, West Midlands, earlier this week on
proposals to merge the bodies: 'It's like six cats hissing over their
territory.'
The meeting was one of a series of 'pan-professionals' discussing broad
proposals for merger, common qualifications, and training.
The mood of the meeting - which was probably more positive towards merger
than others held in London and Leeds - was best summed up by Mr David
Bishop, the chairman of the working party which produced the principles.
He said: 'We can't stay where we are. We can agree on where we want to go.
What we can't agree is how to get there.'
By the end of the meeting there was widespread agreement that accountants
differed more within their separate organisations than between them. The
principle of rationalisation seems to be widely accepted. The details may
yet prove intractable.
Mr Roy Loader, a former west Midlands president of the Institute for
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said that keeping up standards
was the big issue. There might be a 'dilution' of standards in a merger.
This produced the most awkward moment of the evening. Heads were shaken in
embarrassment and eyes turned heavenwards. Mr Bishop, a certified accountant
and a member of the Financial Reporting Council, pointed out: 'We have been
developing these standards together.'
Mr David Delve, a practitioner from Birmingham, complained that the process
had been 'top down and not bottom up. I can see nothing in it for me - am I
missing something?'
Mr John Sarrington, a management accountant from Corby, Northamptonshire,
said: 'Will the remaining bodies go on if one of the bodies says no?' Mr
Bishop refused to be drawn but pointed out that 'they are still all at the
table'.
Mr Bob Fisher, a chartered accountant from Solihull, said a better job was
needed on propaganda as members had been allowed to 'wallow' on the issue.
'If we don't get together we shall fail the future and fail our country,' he
said.
Mr Martin Heathcock from Stourbridge, West Midlands, a chartered accountant
with a certified accountant as a partner, said: 'I am very much in favour of
these proposals.' He won the loudest applause of the evening.
Mr Mike Robinson from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, immediate past president
of the chartered institute's district branch, said the damage had been done
by the press, which portrayed the so-called Bishop plan as dead.
A warning was left by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
whose booming voice overlays the beginning of the conference video,
exhorting accountants to speak with a single voice but adding with
exasperation: 'I have been saying this for 20 years.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Accounts bodies' merger supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial Bishop proposals for the restructuring of the accountancy
profession yesterday won support from surveys of two of the leading
representative bodies.
Research by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
showed that 73 per cent of its members were in favour of merging some of the
six professional bodies.
In order to achieve reorganisation, 58 per cent were willing to share the
respected title of 'chartered accountant'. The strongest opposition came
from recently qualified members under 35.
The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants will publish a survey on
Monday showing that 90 per cent of its members want to see a reduction in
the number of bodies.
A similar proportion want the negotiations under the committee chaired by Mr
David Bishop to continue.
Both surveys, while indicating support for ending the confusion and rivalry
between the six bodies, point to some obstacles ahead.
Mr Roger Lawson, president of the chartered institute, said the concerns of
younger members needed to be considered. 'They are looking for further
reassurance, particularly in the area of education and training, before they
will willingly share the title of chartered accountant,' he said.
The management accountants' survey shows that 74 per cent want to make sure
the audit profession does not dominate management accounting in any new
institute. And 59 per cent said they would wish to be called chartered
management accountants after restructuring.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Collapse of bus group prompts MMC probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate bus services in the
north-east of England after the collapse of the municipally owned Darlington
Transport two weeks ago.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday called for
an investigation of services in the area. The commission will have six
months to make its report to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
The Office of Fair Trading emphasised that the investigation would look at
all bus services, but Sir Bryan said he was particularly concerned about an
offer of free fares by Busways Travel Services, part of Stagecoach Holdings.
This was one of the reasons for the demise of Darlington Transport, which is
in administration.
The monopolies review represents another clash between Stagecoach and the
competition authorities over the tactics adopted by the Perth-based company
to further its ambitious expansion plans.
The OFT has launched a number of investigations into potential monopolies in
the bus system since the deregulation of the industry outside London in
1985. Stagecoach, the biggest UK bus operator, has been subject to 20
investigations and received three adverse rulings.
Mr Brian Souter, Stagecoach chairman, denied that the company was
anti-competitive and said he welcomed the monopolies inquiry in the
north-east.
He said: 'Our aim is to increase bus usage by improving the service quality
for passengers. We do this by investing in new buses, offering a
comprehensive network and introducing new services and selective discounts.'
The OFT said the investigation would look at competition between bus
companies in Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Cleveland following complaints
from other bus operators about Busways.
The allegations include predatory pricing and putting excessive numbers of
buses on a particular route to force competitors to withdraw from the market
in Darlington and South Shields.
Sir Bryan said: 'I believe that (the Busways' free fares) offer may have
contributed to the decision of Darlington Transport to cease operating.
Efficiency of operation should determine who should provide the service, not
possession of the resources to oust competitors.'
Mr David Walsh, chairman of Cleveland County Council's transport committee,
called for a meeting of local bus companies to avoid 'a full-scale bus war'
in the county.
If the MMC finds that there is a monopoly which acts against the public
interest Mr Heseltine has the power to order the abuses to be remedied or to
ask the OFT to obtain undertakings from the offending company that it will
not be repeated.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Jobcentre staff asked to cut hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff in the government's employment service in London and the south-east
are being urged to take unpaid leave over Christmas or cut their working
hours because of overspending in the service's budget and the drop in the
volume of work because of falling unemployment.
Mr David Lifton, the service's deputy regional director, says in a letter to
11,500 Jobcentre staff that the situation has arisen 'because the numbers of
unemployed in the region have fallen much faster than anticipated'.
Mr Lifton tells staff that the service will have to shed staff because of
the continuing fall in unemployment.
He adds that the service has laid off 750 casual staff as a cost-cutting
measure but is replacing them with staff from offices outside London who are
staying at hotels and given travel allowances and Pounds 20 per day
expenses.
The abolition of casual worker contracts is aimed to contain spending and
match staff levels more closely with workloads. Paid overtime has also been
ended.
The London and south-east region is offering a number of options for staff
who might be considering work breaks or a reduction in their working hours.
This can involve unpaid leave from December 5 to January 5, unpaid leave
during January to March, or a cut in hours and/or the possibility of a job
share.
A spokesman from the Department of Employment said no other region was
suffering from the same problem as London and the south-east.
Mr Ian McCartney, Labour's shadow employment minister, accused Mr Michael
Portillo, the employment secretary, of being 'unable to manage the spending
of his own department'.
He said: 'It seems to be a complete shambles. There must be a full, frank
and public explanation about how this farce has been allowed to come about.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Saving and Borrowing): Tempting the tepid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVE THOMPSON, Moneyfacts and CHRISTINE BAYLISS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenders have been offering gifts in various guises all year to tempt the
lukewarm house-buyer. Indeed, by abolishing mortgage indemnity premiums
(Mips), Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester might have thought it was offering the
ultimate gift. Yet, this is of real interest only to those with a small
deposit, writes Olive Thompson of Moneyfacts.
Moreover, although radical (in that it applies to all mortgages), it is not
an entirely new initiative. Leeds and Holbeck waive the premium on their
new, discounted, variable-rate deals for first-time buyers.
Other lenders which do not charge Mips on specific products include Portman,
Skipton, Melton Mowbray, Citibank, Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages, Homeloans
Direct, Legal &amp; General, The Mortgage Business and UCB.
Some lenders are more flexible than others where premiums are concerned.
Northern Rock now allows them to be added to the loan, as do Yorkshire BS
and Lambeth, but Greenwich and Derbyshire insist on the payment up-front.
Increasing the debt could be the easy option, but do not overlook the fact
that interest will be charged - and can mount up - if the premium is not
paid off during the first year of the mortgage.
Cash rebates can be particularly useful to a first-time buyer to offset the
cost of Mips, which could be Pounds 880 on a property valued at Pounds
55,000, with a 5 per cent deposit.
The Pounds 1,000 rebate offered by Chelsea is for advances over Pounds
40,000 - for advances up to and including Pounds 40,000, the rebate is
Pounds 500.
Fixed-rate mortgages for three years can still be found at less than the
standard variable rate. The Woolwich recently reduced its two-year fixed
rate by 1 per cent to 7.49 per cent.
Longer-term fixes may be attractive for those who want peace of mind: the
TSB has revised its five-year fixed rate down by 0.24 per cent to a
comparative 8.95 per cent.
Although the majority of banks and building societies have increased their
savings rates following September's base rate rise, a number still have not
passed on the benefits to their investors, writes Christine Bayliss. The
Scarborough has actually cut rates by 0.5 per cent on its Scarborough '94
account.
Fixed-rate products - both flat and escalating rates - continue to be
popular. Indeed, the demand has been such that bonds from the Chelsea and
West Bromwich were available for only a short time before being withdrawn.
Rates of around the 8 per cent mark are available for two to four years. The
highest comes from the Confederation Bank: 9 per cent for five years.
Offshore institutions have, in the main, also followed events onshore. With
higher balances, they often pay more, the bonus being that the interest is
paid gross. While it is taxable and must be declared by UK residents, the
interest received can be re-invested for maximum benefit until the tax bill
is due. In some cases, it is possible for investors to choose when the
interest is paid to make maximum use of this advantage.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Hotels find room for optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The confidence of hoteliers rose markedly in the third quarter, boosted by
an increasingly optimistic outlook in Northern Ireland, according to BDO
Hospitality Consulting.
The proportion of hoteliers who were optimistic or very optimistic about the
next three months rose to 80.5 per cent, compared with 73.8 per cent in the
second quarter.
The consulting group said the figures had been lifted by the ceasefire in
Northern Ireland. All respondents to the survey in Northern Ireland said
they were optimistic.
More than three-quarters of UK hoteliers said they expected to increase
their room rates in the next year.
Most said their revenues were ahead of the same period last year, although
13.2 per cent said revenues had fallen.
Business travel was the main reason for the revenue rise. Three-quarters of
hoteliers said business travel revenues were higher than last year.
Fewer than half reported a rise in revenues from leisure travellers.
Staff numbers increased in 30.3 per cent of hotels in the third quarter but
fell in 14.5 per cent. Although 31.2 per cent of hoteliers said they
expected employee numbers to rise in the fourth quarter the proportion
expecting to cut staff rose to 23.4 per cent.
The consulting group said that while the high proportion of establishments
planning to reduce staff numbers was partly seasonal, hoteliers were showing
greater readiness to lay employees off during slack periods.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Disabled may get cash in lieu of community care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced plans to devolve some of the funding for
disabled people from local authorities to recipients of services, allowing
them to purchase their own care for the first time.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said cash payments would initially
be limited to 'a relatively small group, probably those disabled people who
are able and willing to manage their care'.
The devolution of funding will require legislation, and could pave the way
to a more radical shift of funding as an extension of the government's care
in the community programme.
The funding proposal follows the announcement earlier this week of
legislation to protect disabled people against discrimination at work.
Mrs Bottomley said the funding legislation would be permissive, enabling but
not obliging local authorities to make direct cash payments to some disabled
people in lieu of community care.
She said: 'Direct payments are a logical extension of the Citizen's Charter.
They will give disabled people greater independence and choice and involve
them and their carers more fully in their own care.'
She conceded, however, that the making of direct payments 'carried some
risks'. Local authorities will be given responsibility for deciding whether
to make payments. 'There will be no overlap with social security benefits,'
she added.
The health department refused to be drawn on the amounts it would like to
see devolved to individuals, stressing that it still had to consult with
'key interests to make sure the details are right'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a
building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption
date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your
investments only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of
capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table
shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not
obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the
market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and
sell.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds to coax the
cautious - Regular incomes, third of a series by Debbie Harrison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
s week, we look at two types of bond for the cautious investor who is
seeking to guarantee income and preserve his capital.
Gilts, certain corporate bonds and sterling foreign government bonds held to
maturity effectively represent an IOU - you lend the money and, in return,
the borrower promises to repay the loan in full at a fixed date in the
future.
With conventional gilts and bonds, the borrower pays interest, known as the
coupon, twice a year at a fixed rate. As a general rule, the longer the
term, the higher the income - but also the greater the drop in the real
value of your capital.
Gilts pay interest gross if you buy through the National Savings Stock
Register (NSSR). This is particularly convenient for non-taxpayers and also
the cheapest way to purchase. But NSSR applications are made by post, so you
will not know in advance what the buying price will be.
Both gilts and qualifying bonds (not including convertible and preference
shares) are free of capital gains tax on any profits. Bond income is
unfranked because it is classed as interest and not as dividends. This means
it is paid net of 25 per cent tax, all of which can be reclaimed by
non-taxpayers. With shares, only 20 per cent can be reclaimed.
When assessing the income from gilts (and bonds), you need to look at three
figures. The nominal value represents the original purchase price (not
necessarily the one at which you buy) and is the amount you receive at
redemption. The coupon tells you the interest rate that applies to the
nominal value throughout the term. The market price is the present value if
you buy or sell.
Thus, the coupon and nominal amount determine the level of interest but the
actual return or yield will depend on the buying price.
The important difference between gilts and other bonds is the nature of the
guarantee. Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, says: 'Gilts are
guaranteed by the government and this is the best credit you can have. Other
bonds might be guaranteed by banks, companies and foreign governments, so
there is an element of credit risk which is compensated for by a higher
yield - usually about 0.3 per cent above gilt yields.'
One other point on security: in the event of the borrower becoming
insolvent, bonds rank before shares in the creditors' pecking order.
Gilts and bonds are traded during the loan period, and there are no
guarantees on the return of capital if you sell before the redemption date.
Prices tend to reflect the market's view on future interest rates. Over an
exceptional six-month period earlier this year, gilts fell by as much as 15
to 20 per cent.
Interest is paid in advance, so the price will also take into account
whether a recent interest payment has been made to the holder - in which
case, the price is 'ex-dividend'. If the interest is still to be paid, the
price is 'cum-dividend'. The price quoted in the FT is the mid-point between
buying and selling prices.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Gilt issues - best
value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
All gilts with a fixed redemption date have two yields. The current
yield (also known as the interest yield) relates the coupon to the
current share price and tells you what your current income is. The
redemption yield also takes account of the capital gain - or loss - you
can expect to make if you hold the stock until redemption in order to
calculate your total return. Our table shows that total return net of
income tax for different types of taxpayer. Your capital gain on a gilt
 -a UK government bond - is tax free. However, you pay tax on the
interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a higher proportion of their
total return as capital gain are more tax efficient, and - other things
being equal - more attractive to higher rate taxpayers.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Fayed cleared over allegations of blackmail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed, chairman of Harrods, was cleared yesterday of allegations
that he attempted to blackmail the government in the controversy over MPs
accepting money to ask parliamentary questions.
The Crown Prosecution Service announced there was no evidence Mr Fayed had
committed any criminal offence, and that police would not investigate
further.
The allegations centred on a meeting on September 29 between Mr John Major,
the prime minister, and an intermediary - widely believed to be Mr Brian
Hitchen, the Sunday Express editor.
The intermediary said Mr Fayed wanted a meeting with Mr Major to discuss the
Department of Trade and Industry report on the takeover of the House of
Fraser. He was also said to be contemplating passing on allegations about
the conduct of ministers.
Mr Major told MPs he had passed a note of the meeting to the prosecution
service.
The CPS said: 'Having considered the available evidence . . . it does not
disclose the commission of any criminal offence by Mr Fayed.'
Mr Fayed, who later made a series of allegations about Tory MPs through The
Guardian newspaper, said: 'Allegations were made about me . . . that were
unfair and untrue and to which I could not respond during the currency of
the inquiry. I trust that the prime minister will take the earliest
opportunity to set the record straight.'
Mr Fayed's cash-for-questions allegations against Mr Neil Hamilton,
corporate affairs minister, forced him to resign although he denied them.
They also led to the resignation of Mr Tim Smith, a junior Northern Ireland
minister, who admitted not declaring links with Mr Fayed.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief
secretary to the Treasury, were both cleared of any impropriety in an
inquiry carried out by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary.
Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, said: 'I never thought there was
anything to this except another wild diversion. I am glad this has now been
acknowledged.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Trident submarine escapes protest net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FASLANE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greenpeace protesters yesterday tried to stop the nuclear submarine HMS
Vanguard from leaving its dock at Faslane near Glasgow as it was moving to a
nearby dock at Coulport to have its Trident II nuclear warheads loaded for
the first time, Bernard Gray in Faslane writes.
A Greenpeace tug, Solo, and inflatable rafts tried to block Vanguard's path
through a narrow channel in Gare Loch, which leads into the river Clyde. The
protesters also attempted to tie a fishing net across the bows of the
submarine. The net was removed by Vanguard crew members (above).
Vanguard, Britain's first Trident submarine, was en route to Britain's main
nuclear weapons storage base at Coulport. The submarine has completed its
trials and nuclear warheads are being added to its missiles in preparation
for its first deterrent patrol due to start in the next few weeks.
A small group of anti-nuclear protestors also demonstrated outside the gates
of the Faslane submarine dock as Vanguard began its early morning voyage
which marked the start of its effective operational deployment.
To load the warheads on to Vanguard's missiles, the 16,000-tonne submarine,
which is almost as large as the Invincible class aircraft carriers, will be
raised out of the water on a giant 85,000-tonne floating dock and shiplift.
Raising the boat will take several hours.
The delicate task of fitting the warheads will begin today and last until
the middle of next week. The floating dock and shiplift are needed to
provide maximum stability and to avoid an accident while loading the
plutonium-powered, thermo-nuclear bombs.
After completion of final tests once the warheads are fitted, Vanguard will
begin its first operational patrol, replacing one of Britain's two remaining
Polaris nuclear submarines.
Cmdr Peter Wilkinson, who will captain Vanguard's first patrol, said he was
'well aware of the awesome responsibility' which he carried. He added that
in spite of the end of the cold war the nuclear deterrent fleet carried out
its mission exactly as it had always done.
Cmdr Wilkinson acknowledged, however, that following an agreement between Mr
John Major, the prime minister, and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the
submarine's missiles were aimed on an empty spot in the ocean. Switching the
missiles to military or civilian targets would take 'a finite amount of
time'. Just how finite was not made clear.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Lloyd's makes regulatory services appointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has appointed Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, chief executive of the
Building Societies Commission, as director of its regulatory services
department, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mrs Gilmore, who has previously worked at the Treasury and the World Bank in
Washington, will be responsible for overseeing Lloyd's system of
self-regulation. The 200-strong department also oversees litigation - a
sensitive issue given that Lloyd's is embroiled in several legal disputes
with lossmaking Names.
Lloyd's would not comment on Mrs Gilmore's salary but according to the
insurance market's latest annual report her predecessor earned between
Pounds 130,000 and Pounds 140,000 last year, including performance related
bonuses and other benefits. A spokesman at the Building Societies
Commission, the statutory regulator and supervisor of UK building societies,
said Mrs Gilmore's current salary was a little over Pounds 60,000.
At the Treasury Mrs Gilmore ran the financial institutions division that was
responsible for legislation including the 1979 Banking Act. She was
appointed a non-executive member of the Securities and Investments Board
last year.
Mrs Gilmore succeeds Mr Bob Hewes who was appointed Lloyd's finance director
earlier this year.

FT  26 NOV 94 / MPs reject brewers' call for cut in duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A committee of MPs yesterday rejected on economic and health grounds a call
by brewers for beer duty to be halved to curb cross-Channel imports and
stimulate flagging UK sales.
The Treasury select committee said imports of alcohol and tobacco were 'not
seriously undermining receipts of excise duty'. But it cautioned Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, against widening the differential between UK and
Continental duties.
The MPs' report on cross-Channel shopping expressed doubt about the brewers'
case. They had argued that the loss of UK beer sales was damaging pubs and
off-licences. A cut in duty would revive sales, they argued.
Cross-border shopping is 'clearly having a serious impact on the activities
of legitimate traders,' the MPs said. But 'changing consumption patterns,
however, make it exceedingly difficult to isolate the loss of sales directly
attributable to cross-border shopping'. Claims that there is a link 'have to
be treated with considerable caution'.
Moreover, brewers' costs and margins have driven up the price of beer, the
MPs said. 'Until it addresses these issues, the industry cannot expect the
taxpayer to subsidise its operations by reducing excise duties.'
On health grounds, a government could never consider a large cut in duties
if they led to increased consumption of alcohol and tobacco, the MPs said.
They recommended, instead, that the government seek to persuade Continental
governments to raise their taxes to make cross-border shopping less
attractive.
The report drew an angry response from Whitbread, one of the brewers which
has been leading the campaign. Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said:
'They're a set of wishy-washy recommendations from a rushed inquiry which
failed to get the facts.'
The government has already said it is unwilling to cut excise duties. The
chancellor indicated in last year's Budgets that alcohol duties were
unlikely to rise faster than inflation.
The MPs found a closer link between tobacco imports and damage to the
domestic industry, most particularly in tobacco for hand-rolled cigarettes.
Tobacco accounted for the 'vast bulk of smuggled goods' and the high profits
had attracted 'serious criminals'.
The MPs recommended that the Customs service deploy 'substantially
increased' staff to try to stem the illegal import of alcohol and tobacco.
The National Union of Civil and Public Servants warned yesterday, however,
that the Budget on Tuesday would include proposals to cut 4,000 jobs out of
Customs service's 25,000.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Judge lets Lloyd's probe continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulators from Lloyd's, the insurance market, can continue with their loss
review into syndicates 80 and 843, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice MacPherson dismissed an application by Mr John Macmillan, the
former underwriter for the syndicates, for the review to be stopped.
Mr Macmillan said that if the loss review continued it would prejudice the
civil case brought by Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market - against his managing agency, RAF
Macmillan. He said transcripts of his interviews could be used as evidence
in court.
The judge ruled, however, that the public interest in the review being
completed outweighed any possibility that the civil action might be
prejudiced. He said there was no risk of serious prejudice being caused and
that publication of the interviews might assist all concerned in the action.
About half of the 1,050 Names on the two syndicates are suing the managing
agents for negligence over losses sustained in the 1988 year of account.
They are claiming damages of Pounds 20m.
The review into syndicates 80 and 843 is expected to be completed and
published early next new year.
The ruling provides Lloyd's with general guidelines about proceeding with
other loss reviews when legal actions are running in parallel. The judge
said issues of possible prejudice would have to be considered in each case.
The loss review department is carrying out seven reviews.
Lawyers for Mr Macmillan were yesterday considering an appeal against the
ruling.

Buckingham Palace is to publish annual accounts detailing how Pounds 20m of
taxpayers' money is spent running royal palaces. The first annual report
will be published in July.
This follows a call by the Commons public accounts committee in September
for greater 'public visibility' of how public money was spent at the royal
palaces. Yesterday the government recommended publication of the royal
household's annual accounts.
The palace said the royal household had nothing to hide and would be
delighted to publish a full annual report.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Company failures continued to fall in the third quarter, figures from KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, show. A total of 6,140 bankruptcies was
recorded in the quarter, a fall of 14.4 per cent compared with the same
period last year. Liquidations fell 15.3 per cent to 3,623.
The recovery recorded by KPMG varies across the country. The north-east saw
a fall of nearly 20 per cent in liquidations between the second and third
quarter while the Midlands and north-west saw increases.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG, said: 'A year ago the
recovery was at a very fragile point. There is a more robust feeling in the
economy now and companies, with the support of their banks, are gearing up
for an improving economy.'

Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has stepped up his efforts to force

Sinn Fein, David Owen and John Murray Brown write.
He said he had written to the prime minister to ensure there was 'no
confusion or time lost over arranging such matters as delegations, venues
and times'. He added: 'All of these issues can and should be sorted out
now.'
Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Major had received the letter but
officials were not sure whether he had had time to study it. They said the
government would move ahead with talks 'at the pace it determined to be
correct'.
Ministers have said a preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein would begin before
Christmas if the IRA ceasefire, now nearly three months old, held. Talks
with loyalist political representatives would start soon afterwards.
Mr Adams told Downing Street that the Sinn Fein team in the talks would be
led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president. He said that the ground to be
covered should include 'demilitarisation and other issues'.
A week ago Mr Adams accused the government of dragging its feet on efforts
to forge a lasting settlement in the province.
Yesterday Mr Pat Doherty, another Sinn Fein vice-president, speaking at
Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, called on both London and
Dublin to convene all-party talks to find a settlement.
Fine Gael, the Irish republic's main opposition party, said explosives and
guns had to be decommissioned before full political talks involving Sinn
Fein could start.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): When figures mislead -
Performance tables aren't always the whole story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance tables are always of interest if you have money to invest and
are wondering where to put it - but they can be misleading.
Weekend Money has recently excluded a trust called Manakin from its tables
of top-performers because the trust's special circumstances and history mean
it is not really comparable with its peers.
Manakin is a small venture capital investment trust known formerly as
Abingworth. It appeared two weeks ago as the top-performing investment trust
over both three and five years - but it has been in liquidation since 1991.
Its assets are being sold off and the profits returned to investors; the
process is due to be completed within a year or two.
Over the past three years, Manakin has repaid a total of 380p a share,
starting with a payment of 260p in December 1991; hence the dramatic drop in
share price shown in the graph. Its appearance in the best-performer tables
is due to the large cash repayments it has been making to existing
investors, and its slow recovery from the low point it hit after the October
1987 crash.
Long wind-ups and capital repayments are particularly common with venture
capital investment trusts. The nature of their holdings - mainly in unquoted
companies - means portfolios cannot be liquidated overnight. It takes years
rather than months as investment managers find buyers for their stakes or
help companies float on a stock market.
Heavy reliance on performance tables can be equally hazardous when it
involves small investment trusts with assets of less than Pounds 20m or so.
One or two well-chosen investments can make a huge difference to a small
trust's portfolio, but the performance is not usually repeatable.
Larger funds have much more diversified portfolios, so one or two
spectacular performers are less likely to push them to the top of the
tables.
If a small fund does hit the top of the tables, buyers should beware. There
might be a sudden rush of demand which could push the shares to a completely
unjustifiable premium.
Anyone who buys at that point is likely to end up with painfully charred
fingers - something that happened a few years ago with a tiny, mainly
privately-owned, trust called Capital Gearing.
After it appeared as top performer, its shares were ramped to a premium of
almost 100 per cent for a short while, only to revert to more normal levels
once investors saw sense.
If a fund's place in the performance table makes it seem attractive, always
check whether there are any particular reasons for the outperformance. The
health warning that 'past performance is not a guide to the future' can be
particularly apt for small, specialised investment trusts.

<TEXT>
The largest transaction of the week was at Gerrard and National Holdings, a
financial house that announced interim results on October 27 showing a good
increase on the same period last year, writes Vivien MacDonald of The Inside
Track.
Chairman Robert Williamson was also upbeat in his message to shareholders.
For personal reasons, however, executive director Mark Davies has sold
359,000 shares at 470p.
Hewden Stuart, a Glasgow-based plant hire company, announced improved
interims last month. The sale by Ronald Stuart, deputy chairman, leaves him
with more than 750,000 shares.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): A classic case of risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have traditionally fared well in UK privatisations. There have
been a few notable exceptions, as shareholders in British Steel can testify,
but the vast majority of companies sold off by the state in the past 10
years have seen their shares outperform the market, some by a considerable
margin.
What, then, should investors make of the opportunity that will soon arise to
invest in the UK coal industry when it is privatised later this year?
British Coal is no ordinary privatisation. The government has conducted most
sell-offs by putting a price on the assets and then floating the company,
complete with management, on the stock market at an appropriate price. Coal
is being sold differently, in part because it is seen as being a risky
business. Ministers thought asking institutions and small investors to
subscribe might lead to trouble and decided instead on a 'trade sale' to
existing companies.
Last month, RJB Mining emerged as the government's preferred choice for the
three English regions of British Coal. These comprise 15 of the 16 remaining
operating deep mines and account for more than 85 per cent of UK coal
production.
RJB is, however, a relatively small company. Whereas it is capitalised on
the stock exchange at less than Pounds 160m, it needs to raise up to Pounds
1.05bn to finance its Pounds 914m bid. Outside investors will be able to
take part because RJB, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, plans to raise up
to Pounds 425m through issuing shares.
Institutional investors, including pension funds, will be the prime target
but RJB is planning to set aside 5 per cent of shares for an offer for sale
in which retail (private) investors will be asked to subscribe. This will
rise to 15 per cent if demand is high enough.
Investors should not expect an advertising campaign along the lines of the
'Tell Sid' strategy which accompanied British Gas's move into the private
sector. RJB's share offer will be for the 'sophisticated' investor - often,
a euphemism for the rich. Stockbrokers are likely to advise clients that no
one should put their last pennies and pounds into RJB.
The company, led by chief executive Richard Budge, has a good track record
in spite of its association with AF Budge, the engineering company from
which it emerged two years ago shortly before that company went into
receivership. RJB is well respected in the mining industry, where it made
its name largely as an opencast operator.
Its problem - or potential problem - is the speed of its growth. Last year
was its first year as a quoted company and it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
12m on turnover of Pounds 75m. Assuming it completes its British Coal
acquisitions, RJB expects to be making Pounds 220m annually on sales of
Pounds 1.2bn by the end of the century.
It is this confidence that enabled the company to offer at least 50 per cent
more than the nearest rival for the English coal regions. But some analysts
and quite a few executives in both the coal and electricity sectors believe
RJB has over-stretched itself.
RJB's assumptions on the size of future coal markets, and the prices at
which it can sell, are at the top of industry expectations. Even its
'conservative case' calculations are regarded as ambitious by coal analysts,
including McCloskey Coal Information.
RJB is offering handsome rewards for shareholders who are prepared to wait a
few years. The expected dividend yield starts at 4.5 per cent in the first
year, about the market average, but RJB is promising a policy of rapid
dividend growth with 'substantial increases' after debt is reduced.
The company expects virtually all debt to be paid off by 1998. But with up
to Pounds 528m of borrowings needed, the company's critics think that is far
too optimistic. Some are predicting RJB could get into financial trouble.
Potential investors will have a chance to make their own minds up when the
pathfinder prospectus for the share issue comes out in the next few days. It
will be a classic case of deciding whether the rich rewards on offer are
worth the perceived risk of investing.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Gas boss's pay 'adds Pounds 1.6m to pension cost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 205,000 pay rise recently awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, chief
executive of British Gas, has increased the cost of providing him with a
company pension by about Pounds 1.6m, according to a study.
Mr Bryn Davies, an actuary who advises trade unions on company pension
schemes, said the current value of Mr Brown's future pension payments was
Pounds 3.9m, compared with Pounds 2.3m before he received the 75 per cent
rise in basic pay.
Mr Davies said: 'The value of his expected pension, like his pay, has gone
up by more than 70 per cent. I have calculated that his pay increase has
pushed the worth of his pension benefits up by a further Pounds 1.6m.'
Details of Mr Brown's pay rise emerged last week. His basic pay has been
increased to Pounds 475,000 from Pounds 270,000. Other executive directors
of British Gas received rises of up to 50 per cent.
Mr Brown is a member of the British Gas staff pension scheme which provides
pensions depending on members' earnings just before they retire.
Mr Davies's calculations assume that Mr Brown, 59, will retire in just over
two years' time. British Gas said that he had at least 35 years' pension
scheme service.
Mr Brown contributes 4 per cent of his basic salary into the scheme each
year, so his Pounds 205,000 pay rise means he will be paying more into the
pension fund.
Asked to comment on Mr Davies's calculations, British Gas said yesterday
that Mr Brown was a member of 'a group pension scheme with a common
contribution rate so we do not define the costs for individuals'.
Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, chairman of TR High Income Trust which holds
400,000 British Gas shares, said he would be writing to British Gas asking
for an explanation for the increased pension costs.
He said: 'If we do not get a satisfactory response then we will consider
using our votes in the appropriate manner at the company's annual general
meeting.'
Trade union officials representing industrial workers at British Gas have
submitted a claim for a pay rise next year.
Mr Donald Macgregor, a senior GMB union official, said yesterday that it was
likely that Mr Brown's pay would affect of negotiations. He said: 'It is
inconceivable that such over-the-top treatment for a chief executive can be
ignored by industrial employees.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Postal sell-off lacked fan mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a small fraction of responses to the government's consultation paper on
the Post Office were in favour of privatisation, Mr Tim Eggar, industry
minister, disclosed yesterday.
Mr Eggar said in a parliamentary written answer that about 60 responses  -
or less than than 0.4 per cent of the 15,400 received - were 'positively in
favour' of full or partial privatisation.
He said most replies took the form of 'standard form' letters and postcards
issued by organisations campaigning against the government's proposals.
Ministers were forced this month to cancel plans to privatise the Royal Mail
letters division of the Post Office because of the implacable opposition of
a small number of Conservative backbenchers.
Mr Eggar was replying to a question by Mr Gordon Prentice, Labour MP for
Pendle. Labour has indicated it intends to inflict fresh embarrassment on
the government by inviting Tories who opposed a sell-off to back a Commons
motion giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Vodafone's crime bill - Company
in the News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IBM executive neglected his lunch as he recounted, sourly, how his
cellular telephone had been ripped from his car by a bicycle-mounted thief
in south London. He had become another victim in a crime wave in which
15,000 such phones are stolen every month.
Vodafone, the UK market leader in mobile phones, can count itself a victim
of the same phenomenon. Its interim results this week showed profits in the
first half of the year were dented by fraud and criminal activity at home.
Abroad, it was held back by heavier than expected start-up costs, amounting
to Pounds 40m in the half year. Nevertheless, it managed to come in ahead of
most analysts' estimates, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 186.4m on sales of
Pounds 560.7m compared with predictions of Pounds 175m to Pounds 185m.
One reason for Vodafone's success is that the market for mobile phones has
expanded beyond all expectations in the past year. The growth has favoured
mainly the established companies, Vodafone and Cellnet, offering mature and
proven analogue systems, over newcomers Mercury One-2-One and Orange. Their
digital networks cover less of the country and still have performance
problems.
This Christmas should see an unprecedented boom in mobile phone sales.
Looking further ahead, analysts think there could be 10m subscribers to
cellular services by 2000 compared with estimates of 8m a year ago.
Vodafone's share of the growth over the past year was 263,000, an increase
of 140 per cent over the same period last year. But the expansion in numbers
brought an increase in fraud and 'low-quality' subscribers - people who take
the service with no intention of paying and must eventually be disconnected.
'Phantom' subscribers, signed up by unscrupulous dealers to secure
commissions, and 're-chippers' - people who alter the electrical identity of
portable phones to make calls at other subscribers' expense  - have added to
the problems.
The cost to the company of various forms of fraud is about 1 per cent of
turnover. Indeed, Vodafone has been making clear to analysts that the
problems of fraud and low-quality subscribers have not been eliminated
fully, and that low numbers of net connections compared with the rival
Cellnet are expected to continue for the next two months.
Abroad, Vodafone's businesses in Hong Kong and Malta are profitable while
Greece and South Africa have performed well. It also belongs to a
consortium, led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which leads in the battle to get a
mobile telephony licence in Spain.
A big question for Vodafone and its competitors is how long prices can
remain stable. They have held up strongly over the past year, helped by the
declaration in June by chief executive Gerry Whent that Vodafone would not
cut its tariffs this year.
Inevitably, however, they will fall. And, at the same time, much of the new
growth is coming from the residential sector - which is inherently less
profitable than the business market.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Rolls-Royce - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce's proposed acquisition of Allison Engine makes sound industrial
and commercial sense. It takes the UK company into new niches within the
defence market - for example, large turbo-prop engines and small engines
used by light helicopters - and broadens its offering in civil markets.
The deal appears to make financial sense as well, even if Allison has an
uninspiring sales record and is only now making a nominal operating profit
after three years of losses. For next year, there is little danger of
dilution: Rolls-Royce's shares are rated at about 25 times next year's
expected earnings and recovery at Allison need not be too pronounced to
enhance earnings overall. Thereafter, it may be trickier as, for 1996, the
rating drops to more modest levels in line with an expected upsurge in
Rolls-Royce profits. But Rolls-Royce has done its sums and predicts
'unbelievable' cost savings as it cuts research and development expenditure
further and extracts operating and administrative efficiencies. Revenues are
also set to rise as four new engines go into production.
The transaction will give Rolls-Royce greater clout with its powerful North
American customers, and reduce its vulnerability to fluctuations in the
dollar. But the deal does not answer the big question hanging over
Rolls-Royce's future, which is whether the UK group has the financial and
market muscle to compete with Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric over the
long run. Nor does it do anything to remove scepticism about the Rolls-Royce
share rating, which is taking rather too much in the way of cyclical
recovery for granted.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Thorn EMI - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's 2 per cent drop in Thorn EMI's share price was an exaggerated
response to a solid set of interim figures. There were some modest
disappointments - for example, continuing problems at Rumbelows and evidence
of intensifying competition in the US rentals market - but these were slight
in the context of the robust 15 per cent growth in core operating profits
and the 8.3 per cent increase in the interim dividend.
The higher than expected payout is an expression of the group's confidence
in the future. Investors should share this. The management will soon be able
to take the strategic tidying-up exercise a stage further with Thorn EMI's
expected withdrawal from its defence interests. Meanwhile, the margin
enhancement targets it has set for both music and rentals seem achievable.
Even if return on sales in the music division did not improve in the first
half, the full-year figures should show progress towards the medium-term aim
of 16 per cent. As for rentals, the improvement in margins in the first six
months was impressive given difficult market conditions. Assuming pre-tax
profits of more than Pounds 400m for the full year, the shares are on a
deserved, if not generous, premium to the market. The near 5 per cent
prospective yield provides support. But sustained outperformance is likely
only when and if the management revives the demerger plans, now shelved,
which so delighted the market earlier this year.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Granada - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada has become the latest British group to toy with the idea of buying
back its shares or paying special dividends. Doing so is clearly not its
priority. Gerry Robinson, chief executive, would much prefer to find more
acquisitions into which to pour his energies. Indeed, the evidence to date
on the LWT and Sutcliffe purchases seems to show that Granada is adept at
adding value through acquisition. The snag is that suitable avenues for
expansion are hard to find. During the summer, caterer Gardner Merchant
spurned Granada's advances; moreover, the government is unlikely soon to
change rules preventing the group buying another ITV company. So, Granada is
having to scout around for catering acquisitions on the Continent.
The company generates cash at a prodigious rate. If no further acquisitions
are made, Granada will be debt-free in three years and still hold a Pounds
400m investment in BSkyB. Under such a scenario, share buy-backs would
clearly be sensible. Investors should also be reassured by the implication
that the management is not so desperate for deals that it will overpay:
preliminary results show how tightly the business is being managed. The
improvement in margins was particularly gratifying. But it is hard to argue
that Granada is undervalued. The predictability of its rental and catering
arms may compensate for their dullness. But a prospective price/earnings
premium to the market of around 10 per cent looks large enough.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Privatisation on track - Pick of
Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Running railways, as the US railroad barons demonstrated in the late 19th
century, can prove hugely lucrative. Whether Railtrack can emulate them, or
ends up a mere puffing billy, remains unclear.
In theory, Railtrack should prove the former. On the cost side it can, like
the utilities, make substantial post-privatisation savings. Prospects are
also promising for revenues. Railtrack should significantly increase yields
on its Pounds 2bn property portfolio, currently at just 7 per cent. It may
also repeat BAA's trick of raising passenger spending at retail outlets at
its stations.
Admittedly, Railtrack's main income will initially come from fees paid by
train companies for using its network, and their level will be set by a
regulator. But if privatisation is successful in generating greater usage of
the rail network, revenues from track fees could rise, too. With petrol
prices due to increase in real terms over coming years, halting the
long-term decline in rail travel may not prove the tall order that some
think.
If the opportunities are considerable, so also are the risks. A brake van on
the company's progress will be politics. Labour, well ahead in the opinion
polls, remains implacably hostile to private ownership of the railways.
Although a Labour government would probably not renationalise Railtrack, it
might well interfere with its regulatory framework.
By contrast, while the Tories remain in power, there will be doubts about
their commitment to subsidise heavily loss-making routes in the long term.
Such concerns may not derail privatisation, but they could reduce the amount
Railtrack fetches.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Quebec separatist ardour cools: The confrontational tactics
of the past few months have failed to produce the desired results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A military college, a trade mission to China and an ailing St Lawrence River
shipyard are among the disparate issues which Quebec's newly elected
separatist government has pounced on to promote its case for independence
from Canada.
The steadily growing list comes as no surprise. Political observers
predicted in the wake of last September's election that the Parti Quebecois
would waste no time shaking every tree it could to prove that the
francophone province was getting a raw deal from the rest of the country.
The surprise is that the shaking has borne little fruit. The skirmishes have
generated endless articles in the Quebec media about alleged slights and
inequities and the PQ has often succeeded in putting the federal government
in Ottawa on the defensive.
However, Quebecois appear to be unimpressed. According to the latest opinion
poll conducted by Leger and Leger of Montreal, support for sovereignty
(which has the connotation of a 'soft' form of independence) has slipped to
40 per cent from more than 50 per cent before the election. Other polls put
the number as low as 33 per cent.
The issues which the PQ has seized on in the past two months illustrate both
the opportunities and the pitfalls of beating the separatist drum.
Even before taking office the PQ kicked up a storm over a federal plan to
trim defence spending by closing the College Militaire Royal at Saint-Jean,
south-east of Montreal. The college is the armed forces' only training
centre for French-speaking officers.
Quebec's protests have forced Ottawa to offer a compromise, which would
allow the facility to stay open as a language school. The PQ has rejected
the proposal. It has offered instead to pay itself for St-Jean to remain a
military training college. But by doing so it has laid itself open to
concerns that it is preparing to organise a Quebec army.
On another front, Mr Jacques Parizeau, PQ leader and premier, refused to
join a trade mission to China earlier this month which was led by prime
minister Jean Chretien and included the premiers of all nine other
provinces.
Mr Chretien at first appeared on the defensive by refusing to accept Mr
Parizeau's suggestion that Quebec's deputy premier go in his place. In the
end, however, the mission's success - including contracts signed by several
high-profile Quebec companies - did the separatist cause no good.
The latest fuss has erupted over the future of MIL Davie, a Quebec City
shipyard. The company is on the point of collapse, unless it receives new
government contracts or an infusion of cash for a modernisation programme.
The cash-strapped federal government, in keeping with a policy of letting
troubled businesses sort out their own problems, has so far declined to come
to the shipyard's rescue.
The PQ has lambasted Ottawa for putting 2,300 Quebec jobs in jeopardy, and
has offered to put up CDollars 60m-CDollars 70m (Pounds 28m-Pounds 32.7m) of
its own taxpayers' money for a new ferry, which would keep the shipyard in
business for at least the next few years. Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer who
heads the Council for Canadian Unity, says that 'the population knows that
they (the PQ) are fabricating these issues to some degree. I don't think the
mood of the province is to pick fights.'
Another observer suggests that Quebecois are as fed up as English-speaking
Canadians with the debate over the francophone province's place in Canada.
This view is reflected in the refusal of both Mr Chretien and the provincial
Liberal party, which was defeated in the recent elections, to assuage Quebec
nationalism by reopening the constitutional talks which have been a hallmark
of Canadian politics for the past decade.
Despite his apparent inability to win converts to independence, Mr Parizeau
has so far stuck to his pre-election promise of a sovereignty referendum
before the end of 1995. The PQ is gearing up its organisation for a campaign
starting early next year.
But there is a growing feeling in Montreal that the separatists may be
forced to change tack if the confrontational tactics of the past few months
fail to produce results soon.
However, a shift in strategy would require some agile footwork by Mr
Parizeau, and could risk deepening divisions in the party. The alternatives
include delaying the referendum, or framing the question so vaguely that
even a Yes vote would fall far short of a mandate for outright independence.
Some political observers suggest that the PQ may even adopt a more
conciliatory approach to the rest of the country. This prediction is
reinforced by the impression that last September's election result reflects
Quebecois' desire for better government and some extra areas of provincial
jurisdiction, rather than the risks of independence.
Whatever course the PQ chooses, one conclusion is hard to escape. It seems
increasingly unlikely that Canada's most vexing question - will Quebec stay
or leave? - will be conclusively answered within the next 12 months.
Quebec's government faced its first setback yesterday when a cabinet
minister resigned after admitting she voted illegally in elections before
becoming a citizen, Reuter adds from Montreal. Ms Marie Malavoy, culture and
communications minister, whose parents moved to Quebec from France when she
was a child, wrote in her resignation letter: 'I participated as a voter,
before (becoming a citizen), in many Canadian and Quebec elections although
the law did not allow me to do so.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): New issues

<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK investors applying for shares in BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting group,
will be able to specify a price level beyond which they do not want to go,
writes David Blackwell. Applications will be based on the amount of money
people want to invest, rather than on the number of shares, as the price
will not be decided until December 8 - the day dealings start. The minimum
investment is Pounds 500.
Yesterday, the group launched its UK retail offer of 36.4m shares, part of
the global offer of 343m. They will be priced somewhere between 233p and
268p, and the allocations will be decided after the offer closes on December
6.
The price range gives the group a valuation between Pounds 4bn and Pounds
4.6bn.
Twelve share shops where investors can register have been established at
various high street banks and institutions. There will also be application
forms in the national press.
Earlier this week, the flotation of Telewest Communications indicated strong
interest by investors in broadcasting - the offer was six times subscribed.
The shares were priced at 182p on Wednesday, valuing the group at Pounds
1.8bn.
Telewest, a 50-50 joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US cable
operator, and US West, the regional telephone company, will be the first UK
cable company to join the London Stock Exchange. Dealing is expected to
begin in London and the Nasdaq exchange in New York on Wednesday.
Research Machines, a supplier of computers and computer software to schools
and colleges, said on Thursday that it was coming to the market not to raise
money but to raise its profile. The group, relatively unknown outside the UK
education market, is making a placing likely to value it at about Pounds
30m.
On Monday, Samax, which is developing mines in Africa, postponed its float
until early next year. It had planned to raise Pounds 16m by the end of this
month via a placing by stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, on terms that
would have valued the company at about Pounds 50m. Samax blamed adverse
conditions in the new issues market.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
D-day approaches for shareholders in Attwoods, the waste services company
fighting a Pounds 391m hostile cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of
the US, writes Peggy Hollinger. When the more than 70 per cent of Attwoods
shareholders who are based in the US come back from their Thanksgiving
holiday, they will have just five days to decide which side to back.
Acceptances are due in by 1pm on Friday.
It appeared last week that some had already made up their minds. 'Cash today
as opposed to promises tomorrow is a lot more attractive,' said one
institutional investor. BFI is expected on Monday to reveal the level of
acceptances it has received so far.
Attwoods is fighting the bid by promising investors greater value from
breaking itself up. It has lined up a number of potential purchasers for its
UK business, and possible buyers or merger partners for the US operation.
Waste Management International, the UK arm of WMX - another US company - is
the only one so far to have made its interest known. But buyers are believed
to be reluctant to lay their cards on the table until they are confident BFI
will go away.
That appears unlikely at this stage. BFI's original offer of 109p has been
increased to 116.75, plus a 3.25p dividend. With the shares at 116p, the
market appears to think the game is all but over.
Meanwhile, the other serious bid to pre-occupy the market this week has been
the ongoing battle between British Aerospace and GEC for control of VSEL,
which makes submarines. VSEL changed its company articles to allow GEC to
take over the company at an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday night.
Approval for BAe's bid was given at a similar meeting on November 9. The two
companies are now free to acquire VSEL provided they receive clearance from
the Office of Fair Trading, due to report by December 7.
But VSEL's company rules mean that neither can buy more than 15 per cent of
VSEL's shares until its bid is declared unconditional. Since GEC already
owns 14.9 per cent of VSEL, it is effectively barred from further purchases
until it has acceptances for more than 50 per cent of the shares. BAe has a
small shareholding and could increase its stake.
There was some speculation that GEC might be tempted to break this rule, but
most analysts thought it unlikely.
GEC has assured the Ministry of Defence that it will keep the Yarrow yard on
the Clyde open for at least seven years. This addresses fears that if both
Yarrow and Barrow were owned by GEC, one would be closed.
BAe issued a document slating GEC's export record and abilities as a prime
contractor. The company was arguing this week that its variable-size
'trombone' rights issue to fund the VSEL bid put it back on an even footing
with GEC. VSEL's shares closed 25p up at 1520p as the impact of BAe's
increased offer sank in. BAe rose 9p to 452p, and GEC closed down 3 1/2 p at
274p.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Food for thought - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Analysts expect Christian Salvesen, the distribution and specialist
hire group, to report interim pre-tax profits up modestly from Pounds 41.1m
to between Pounds 42m and Pounds 42.5m, representing some recovery since
January's profits warning. Problems at Aggreko, the specialist plant-hire
business which has been the engine of growth in recent years, have been
addressed and its European operation is expected to have done well. But food
performances probably will be flat.
TUESDAY: Severn Trent is expected to report interim profits about 7 per cent
ahead to Pounds 157m. Investors will be looking for a substantial
improvement at the group's waste services division, Biffa, along with
information on cost control.
WEDNESDAY: Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer and owner
of the Safeway chain, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of
Pounds 206m. This marks an increase from Pounds 199m previously, after
re-stating the figures to allow for the group's decision a year ago to start
depreciating its store values. The group, which in October sold 101 of its
remaining Lo-Cost discount stores, is thought to be improving net margins
through tight cost control.
THURSDAY: Seeboard will kick off what is expected to be a controversial
interims season for the England and Wales regional electricity companies
(RECs) when it reports. Profit figures for the first half of the year are
always of limited significance but the RECs' dividend rises inevitably
provoke criticism. Seeboard is expected to be relatively restrained, with
analysts forecasting rises of about 16 per cent. But some of its peers are
likely to go beyond 20 per cent. The Labour Party seems bound to renew calls
for a windfall tax on utilities.
THURSDAY: Another hefty re-structuring charge will depress pre-tax profits
at Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, by Pounds 280m to around
Pounds 650m for the year ended September. A similar charge a year earlier
cut profits to Pounds 630m.
The City hopes GrandMet will spell out what the charge, announced in
October, will entail. The other key area is the performance of IDV, its
spirits business, particularly in the US.
THURSDAY: Hanson's full-year figures Thursday are expected to show a modest
increase in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1bn before disposal gains of
more than Pounds 300m. Underlying earnings per share are forecast to show
little change at 14p.
Strong growth at the operating level will have continued in the fourth
quarter, with trading profits rising by almost a third in the year. But the
impact will have been largely offset by a Pounds 250m swing in the interest
bill.
This stems from the increase in US debt following the Pounds 2.1bn
acquisition of Quantum Chemical at the start of the year, combined with
lower income on Hanson's sterling deposits.
Hanson has signalled already that it will pay a fourth quarterly dividend of
3p, making a total for the year to 11.7p - a rise of 2.6 per cent.
THURSDAY: Forecasts for Royal Bank of Scotland's pre-tax profits for the
full year centre on a range between Pounds 508m and Pounds 528m (Pounds 258m
last time), taking account of the payment announced last year to Peter Wood,
chief executive and founder of Direct Line, the group's motor insurer, of
Pounds 21m and the extra Pounds 50m from Royal Bank's disposal of its stake
in 3i.
Forecasts for the full-year dividend range from 12.5p to 13.8p, against 11p.
The interim dividend was 4p.

<TEXT>
South African officials set out for the world's financial centres today to
prepare for a return to foreign capital markets after a two-year absence,
finance minister Chris Liebenberg said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
He emphasised the mission was not designed to raise funds yet, but to pave
the way for future funding when appropriate. He said the high-powered
roadshow was the first opportunity the government, which took power after
the country's first all-race elections in April, had had to go abroad to
market the country's policies and philosophy.
The officials would use the credit ratings assigned to South Africa in
October by American and Japanese risk assessment agencies 'to establish
ourselves in the minds of potential investors'.
Moody's Investors Service and Nippon Investors Service gave the country
investment grade ratings, while Standard &amp; Poor's gave it its top
speculative ranking, with a 'positive' outlook.
The ratings will enable South Africa to tap a wider range of markets and
investors than would otherwise be possible.
Mr Liebenberg said three teams of officials would travel to Europe, east
Asia and the US. Apart from Mr Liebenberg, they would include Reserve Bank
governor Chris Stals, deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, and labour
minister Tito Mboweni.
The officials would be accompanied by represen- tatives of Goldman, Sachs
and Swiss Bank Corporation, which have been named lead managers for the
country's first global offering.
The national budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year ending in March provided for
R1.8bn (Pounds 327m) in possible foreign loans, but Mr Liebenberg said South
Africa did not need to borrow abroad to meet the budget.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Gingrich warned on role in Congress

<TEXT>
The outgoing leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives
yesterday warned his successors against letting power go to their heads
after their sweeping triumph in this month's congressional elections.
Mr Bob Michel, who is retiring after 38 years in the House and 14 as leader
of the Republican minority, said he did not care for the plans of Mr Newt
Gingrich, who will succeed him as Republican leader and take over as speaker
of the House in January, to concentrate more power in the speaker's office.
'I didn't crave power when I was leader - I don't know if it would have
changed if I were speaker. I just hope it doesn't go to our newly elected
leaders' heads,' Mr Michel told the Chicago Tribune newspaper.
'Newt knows what he's doing,' Mr Michel said, but warned that the pugnacious
Georgian was 'more of a theoretician than he is a parliamentarian'.
'Overplaying your hand in the majority can lend itself to the minority in
justifying itself in really sticking it to you,' he said.
This is not the first time Mr Michel has bemoaned the more partisan style of
politics that has taken over Congress, but his warnings to Mr Gingrich were
unusually pointed. They could foreshadow clashes in style between Mr
Gingrich and Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republicans in the
Senate and who is more of a parliamentarian than the new speaker.
Mr Michel also criticised the 'Contract with America', a list of campaign
pledges espoused by most Republican candidates in the November 8 election,
saying its promise of tax cuts without offsetting spending cuts did not add
up to a balanced budget.
Mr Ray LaHood, a Michel aide who won his seat representing Peoria, Illinois,
was one of the few Republicans who did not sign the contract.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Eight die in Palestinian gun battles: Fighting in Lebanese
refugee camp over Mideast peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gun battles between supporters and opponents of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, left at least eight Palestinians
dead yesterday in Lebanon's biggest refugee camp.
The day-long fighting with machine guns and anti-tank rockets has sparked
fears of an eruption of internal Palestinian violence among the 400,000
Palestinian refugees camped in Lebanon.
The fighting marks the spread of tension between Palestinians supporting and
opposing Mr Arafat's peace agreement with Israel, and the anger about last
Friday's killing of 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by Mr Arafat's
Palestinian police force.
It also exposes the deepening divisions within Mr Arafat's Fatah faction and
more widely within the PLO, traditionally dominated by Fatah, and the
mounting challenge to Mr Arafat's leadership.
Fighting broke out before dawn when 400 pro-Arafat guerrillas seized six
military posts manned by 200 dissidents in the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp
near the southern port of Tyre.
The dissident group is led by Lt-Col Munir Maqdah, the former military head
of Fatah who was dismissed by Mr Arafat last year after he called for the
PLO chairman's resignation over the peace agreement.
'The traitor Arafat has to move away from our Palestinian people,' Lt-Col
Maqdah was quoted as saying yesterday after he described last Friday's
clashes as 'massacres' committed by Mr Arafat.
Armed Palestinian factions backed by Syria and opposed to the peace deal
have a strong presence in Lebanon's 12 refugee camps and many refugees feel
the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement has permanently ended the right of
return to their homeland which has been the central rallying call of the PLO
for decades.
Neither Lebanon nor Syria has so far tried to move into the camps to disarm
the guerrillas. Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has also
publicly criticised Mr Arafat's peace agreement with Israel.
'Syria is anxious to prove that Arafat's problems are not localised to Gaza
but spread across the Palestinian diaspora nation and across the entire Arab
world,' said a Beirut observer.
In Gaza the militant Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement, which has blamed Mr
Arafat for last Friday's killings, postponed a large rally until today.
Hamas, which leads the Palestinian opposition to the peace process, said it
expected 20,000 people to attend the rally to demonstrate the strength of
opposition to Mr Arafat's peace deal. Earlier in the week up to 10,000
supporters of Fatah demonstrated in Gaza.
In Israel, the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said carrying out a death
sentence given yesterday by an Israeli military court to a Palestinian
guerrilla from the Hamas group would be a 'blunder'. Mr Rabin said he
opposed execution of a Palestinian sentenced to death for carrying out a bus
bomb attack in April that killed six people. 'To this day Israel has not put
a single Palestinian terrorist to death and I think this was correct,' he
said.
Leaders of Hamas said the death sentence would only encourage further
Islamic suicide attacks against Israelis, not deter them as the military
court argued.

<TEXT>
The killing of five people in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, yesterday
during a shoot-out between South African police and warring minibus-taxi
operators has added to a taxi-related death toll that has started to claim
more lives than political violence.
Despite calls for calm from the government and repeated attempts by Mr Mac
Maharaj, transport minister, to broker truces between rival groups, fierce
competition over lucrative routes around the country has resulted in an
upsurge in violent confrontation, with hapless commuters caught in the
crossfire.
Police say that 200 people have been killed this year and more than 110
injured as a result of clashes between opposing taxi organisations, dubbed
locally as 'taxi wars'.
In large part this reflects the fact that taxi groupings are increasingly
taking on criminal characteristics as shadowy operators hire hitmen to kill
their rivals and destroy their vehicles. A report on the issue by the South
African Police Services, submitted to parliament earlier this month,
concludes that the situation is likely to deteriorate further unless there
is an immediate clampdown on lawless elements in the industry.
'Taxi associations have developed a distinctive, Mafia-like character to
reach economic objectives and to counter economic threats. They frequently
strengthen their power bases by using armed units which have no qualms about
using violence and committing murder,' the police report observes.
The spark for this year's sudden surge in violence was the financial
collapse of the South African Black Taxi Association in September 1993. Up
to that point Sabta, which was formed in 1986, had been able to act as a
loose umbrella for the industry's many regional associations.
It had managed to sort out many conflicts internally.
But even if an attempt, currently under way, to revive Sabta is successful,
it leaves unresolved the underlying economic causes of the conflict.
When the minibus industry started in the early 1980s it was hailed as an
example of successful black entrepreneurship and by 1990 had managed to
claim 44 per cent of the black commuter transport market.
Since then the situation has changed drastically.
Although no accurate figures of its size exits, analysts estimate that the
industry is worth somewhere between R5bn and R8bn (Pounds 909m-Pounds
1.45bn) and employs more than 70,000 people as drivers and ancillary
workers. However, since 1990 the number of taxis has continued to grow while
the number of commuters has dropped slightly because of the recession.
The result is a classic case of an overcrowded market: there are too many
taxis and too few commuters.
The obvious solution for the government is to impose strict regulation on
the industry, curtailing the number of operators on big routes.
However, Mr Maharaj is constrained by the fear of causing further job losses
and concern that tighter regulation will merely increase the number of
pirate taxis in operation. This would exacerbate the violence rather than
help eliminate it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong is expected to produce its lowest annual inflation rate since 1988
this year. The government has revised its inflation forecast down to 8 per
cent for the year from a previously estimated 8.5 per cent.
The easing of inflationary pressures was not, however, seen as a harbinger
of slower economic activity. The government left unchanged its forecast of a
5.7 per cent real expansion in the economy for 1994.
The revised inflation forecast came with the release of the government's
quarterly economic report which showed that gross domestic product expanded
by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the second quarter of the year compared
with a year earlier. This was a slightly slower rate than the 5.7 per cent
in the first quarter of the year.
Inflation has been one of the government's biggest political problems. Its
easing appears in part to be a combination of a slower growth in personal
consumption and reduced activity in Hong Kong's residential property market.
Prices for flats have eased by 10-20 per cent since a package of measures
was introduced to curb speculative activity.
The colony's growth rate has been propelled by a strong external trade
performance. Exports, for which more recent data are available, were up 11
per cent in real terms in the third quarter, while re-exports were 14 per
cent higher in real terms than in the previous corresponding period.
Growth in retained imports of capital goods was 17 per cent in real terms in
the third quarter over a year earlier, compared with a real growth of 6 per
cent during the first half.

Mr Bernard Tapie, the French businessman-politician, yesterday won a few

examination of whether his companies should be placed under court
administration, a possible first step to bankruptcy.
Credit Lyonnais, Mr Tapie's main banker, forced the issue last week by
blocking the account of Bernard Tapie Finance, the holding companies which
controls La Vie Claire, a chain of health food shops, and Testut and
Terraillon, which makes industrial weighing machines.

The wave of industrial action threatened by some large union wage claims in
Australia got under way yesterday. About 1,500 members of the Transport
Workers' Union, which is pursuing a 15 per cent wage claim to be spread over
two years, decided to strike over the weekend. Their action is targeted at
supermarkets, and is expected to leave many stores without food or milk
deliveries.
This could be followed by a 24-hour strike by aircraft refuellers and oil
tanker drivers on Monday. The federal Industrial Relations Commission ruled
yesterday that the TWU was seeking to avoid enterprise bargaining by lodging
a sector-wide pay claim, and withdrew the union's right to strike on Monday
without risking heavy fines. Despite this, there were indications that
workers still plan to go ahead with the action. If the action does take
place, it is expected severely to disrupt domestic and international airline
services.

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have told Tanzania's
government its finance minister should be removed, officials in Dar es
Salaam said yesterday. They said IMF and World Bank representatives said the
scheduling of a new meeting of Paris Club creditor countries and the
resumption of aid by Norway and Sweden depended on Mr Kigoma Malima's
departure.
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi last week appealed to donors and international
agencies to keep giving his government aid during an official investigation
into rampant tax evasion, which cost an estimated Dollars 125m (Pounds
76.2m) in lost revenues last year. Sweden and Norway froze a total of
Dollars 28.5m in aid to Tanzania last week, citing concern at the evasion.
The officials said foreign donors had reserved the right to commission an
independent audit on the report on the tax evasion investigation being
carried out by the controller and auditor general. Other donors could
suspend aid as Norway and Sweden have done if the president ignored this
condition, they added.

The annual inflation rate in west Germany slowed from 2.8 per cent to 2.6
per cent in the month to mid-November, according to preliminary data from
the federal statistics office yesterday. With prices continuing to
stabilise, and a strong D-Mark defending the economy against imported
inflation, economists suggested the Bundesbank still had room to reduce its
short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, central bank data issued yesterday
showed that a deficit of DM7.7bn (Pounds 3.14bn) on the pan-German services
trade balance made the largest contribution to an unexpectedly big total
current account deficit of DM5.2bn during September. The aggregate deficit
for the first three quarters of the year rose accordingly to DM41.9bn.
Visible imports, up 5.2 per cent, grew more than forecast, leaving the trade
surplus at DM5.8bn, down from DM7.1bn in August.
Mr Horst Schulmann, a Bundesbank council member and president of the
regional central bank in the state of Hesse, has died. He had been ill for
some time.

<TEXT>
Norway yesterday announced a controversial plan to plug a loophole in the
petroleum tax regime which it says has cost state coffers losses estimated
at NKr300m (Pounds 28m) a year in inflated profit repatriation by foreign
oil companies. The state accuses oil companies of boosting profit
repatriation by building up debt in their Norwegian subsidiaries and
offsetting the financing costs against local taxes. The finance ministry
proposal would require the companies to maintain their equity capital at a
minimum of 20 per cent or be penalised by higher taxes.
The so-called 'thin capitalisation rule' will be retroactive to the
beginning of 1994 if it is approved by parliament. 'The proposition means
that a higher equity capital share than 20 per cent will have consequences
for taxation since the rights to deduct net financial costs will be limited
in proportion to a maximum debt ratio of 80 per cent,' the ministry said.

<TEXT>
The Nicaraguan congress has approved constitutional reforms which ban close
relatives of President Violeta Chamorro (left) from standing for the
presidency, in a move to shift powers from the executive to parliament. The
reforms, which allow for a second but not consecutive presidential term, are
a defeat for Ms Chamorro's son-in-law, Mr Antonio Lacayo, the minister of
the presidency and de facto prime minister. He was hoping to stand for
president in May 1996.
The vote means the hardline Sandinista leader and former president Mr Daniel
Ortega may stand in 1996. But his plan to negotiate with Mr Lacayo the
removal of the consanguinity ban - in exchange for a law to legalise
Sandinista ownership of some properties confiscated during the party's
1979-90 administration - has been scuppered. It was supported by 32 moderate
Sandinista congressmen out of a total of 39, in defiance of Mr Ortega and
the Sandinista assembly. 'This is an enormous political defeat for Daniel
Ortega and Antonio Lacayo,' says Mr Carlos Tunnerman, a former Sandinista
ambassador to Washington, who has left the party. 'The division in the party
is irreconcilable and a split is inevitable.'
The vote cuts the presidential term from six to five years, obliges the
government to seek congressional approval for international loans and trade
negotiations, and makes the army more accountable to civil authority.

<TEXT>
Direct-dial telephone service opened last night between the US and Cuba for
the first time in 30 years. Both AT&amp;T and MCI were due to open telephone
lines to Cuba yesterday evening, offering a much easier and cheaper service
to Cuban exiles, who have had to resort to special services in Canada and
Italy to get around a bottleneck that restricted the number of calls to the
Caribbean island.
Telephone service is the one significant area in which the US has wanted to
ease its long-standing embargo against the government of President Fidel
Castro. The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, which otherwise tightened the embargo,
offered new opportunities to improve telecommunications links.
Much of Cuba's telecommunications equipment dates from the 1920s, and only
an estimated 1 per cent of the 60m calls placed from the US to Cuba go
through. But upgrading the link has been complicated by disputes over how to
handle Cuba's share of the revenue from telephone calls.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: What is a share option?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A share option is a right to acquire shares in the future at a price which
is usually fixed when the option is granted, writes David Cohen. Virtually
every big UK company has an approved 'executive' scheme under which the
directors and chosen executives can receive an option over shares worth up
to four times their salary.
The price payable when such an option is 'exercised' - that is, converted
into shares - will generally be the share price at the grant date.
There is a set period during which options can be exercised, at the end of
which they expire. Exercising options more than three years but less than 10
after the grant date gives some tax advantages.
Suppose, say, that you are head-hunted to be finance director of a quoted
company at a salary of Pounds 150,000, and that you are also promised a
four-times-salary share option. The option is granted in November 1994 when
the share price is Pounds 2.
You will, therefore, have the right to buy 300,000 shares (Pounds 150,000 x
4 / 2) any time between 1998 and 2004.
If your prime aim is to make as much money as possible out of your option -
rather than to become a shareholder in your employer - you will wait until
you think the share price has peaked. Then you will buy the shares and sell
them immediately.
The profit you make will be highly sensitive to movements in the share
price. For example, while a sale price of Pounds 2.40 will net you Pounds
120,000 (40p x 300,000), a price rise of a further 10 per cent to Pounds
2.60 will boost your windfall by 50 per cent to Pounds 180,000 (60p x
300,000). This gearing effect is, of course, characteristic of traded
options and other 'derivative' instruments.
The real joy of executive options is that there is no risk of losing money.
Having paid nothing for his right, the executive will exercise it only if he
can do so profitably. If he cannot, he simply ditches it or allows it to
lapse.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Executive gluttony under attack - Fury over
British Gas pay rises is fuelling demands for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the price British Gas directors are paying for their spectacular pay
increases is the scrapping of 'automatic' share option grants. But the
context for this apparent sacrifice is a growing consensus that the options
gravy train is in danger of hitting the buffers.
Executives aboard this financial express have had a very satisfactory ride,
but shareholders and the public have felt increasingly that they were being
taken for a ride.
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that the raison d'etre of share
incentives is to motivate executives, so boosting corporate performance.
Shareholders may see their slice of the cake reduced because extra shares
are issued to managers - but they will be better off if they are compensated
for that reduction by the cake-expanding skills of those same managers.
Critics of conventional share options question whether the behaviour of a
company's share price is the best indicator of the performance of its senior
executives. Overall stock market conditions will exert a strong influence on
most companies' prices. The boss of a company which excels in a bear market
could still be left with worthless options; by contrast, those whose
companies perform indifferently during a bull phase will, usually, be
rewarded.
The anomaly can be even more glaring where a whole sector has outperformed.
Which of the electricity overlords would have the chutzpah to claim the
credit for the more-than-threefold increase in all the Regional Electricity
Companies' (recs) share prices since privatisation? Yet, those increases
have been the sole basis for those executives' vast options gains.
One solution is to prevent options from being exercised unless, during the
option period, the share price meets a relative performance target. This
could be beating the FT-SE index or coming in the top half or quartile in
the company's own sector. The option-holder's actual gain would still
reflect the absolute price movement, but receiving that gain would depend on
whether the relative hurdle had been cleared.
To extend this argument: if the objective is to reward executives who do
well for their shareholders, then options should be linked to total
shareholder return. This would encompass not just share price growth but
also the value of dividends received during the option period.
It seems that this concept of overall return is to be the linchpin of the
new British Gas executive share option scheme. The peer group against which
performance is to be measured will be the companies making up the FT-SE 100
index.
There is, however, a widespread feeling that the inadequacy of share prices
as a yardstick of performance cannot be cured simply by tagging on a
relative target. Instead, it is argued, the benchmark of success should be
management's ability to enhance earnings per share.
Options should be realisable only if EPS growth beats a target. This can be
by reference to the average EPS increase of other companies - constituents
of an index or companies in the same sector - or linked to an external
variable such as the retail prices index. Each of these alternative
approaches has its strengths and weaknesses, and each can produce arbitrary
results. Let us revert for a moment to the electricity companies.
All had embarrassingly large cash mountains which they have been shrinking
either by paying extraordinary dividends to shareholders or buying back
their own shares. No doubt a good corporate case can be made out for either
alternative. Yet, a super-dividend will work immediate wonders for overall
shareholder return but do nothing at all for EPS, while a buy-back will have
precisely the opposite effect.
The British Gas share option scheme has no performance conditions. Indeed,
one of the justifications being suggested for the huge increases in basic
salaries is that the executives are sacrificing 'automatic' option gains for
a much riskier performance-related alternative.
Yet, Gas is hardly alone in making this switch. Hundreds of quoted companies
have revamped their incentives by introducing performance criteria in recent
years.
Is this the result of board members developing guilty consciences after
raking in easy winnings for so long? A more plausible explanation is that
companies have been responding to a statement in July 1993 by the
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension
Funds.
This called for all executive options to be subject to targets requiring
'sustained and significant improvement in underlying financial performance'.
Since insurance companies and pension funds are by far the most influential
blocs of shareholders in quoted companies, few have stood out against this
institutional diktat. And since the main motivation has been to appease the
institutions, the specific targets selected have, predictably, tended to
follow the wishes of the ABI, the more assertive of the powerful twins. So,
most companies have plumped for a target of EPS growth beating the average
rate for comparable companies, or exceeding RPI increases by at least 2 per
cent a year.
In spite of these improvements, some still see the concept of share options
as fundamentally flawed. Special criticism is directed at the high gearing
effect which magnifies and distorts the impact of share price movement. This
has prompted several major plcs - although not, apparently, British Gas - to
replace their option schemes with long-term incentive plans which deliver
free shares to executives provided they stay put for a set period (usually
five years) and their company meets pre-determined performance targets
(usually similar to those now being set for option schemes).
Meanwhile, the Labour party has put Revenue-approved options high on its
tax-avoidance hit list and has vowed to treat option gains as income rather
than capital. All in all, it does seem clear that top directors probably
should hedge their bets by buying some lottery tickets.

FT  26 NOV 94 / S Korean opposition chief quits parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lee Ki-taek, South Korea's main opposition leader, resigned his
parliamentary seat yesterday in protest at the recent decision by the
government not to prosecute two former presidents for their role in a 1979
military coup that brought them to power.
Mr Lee, who has blocked parliamentary proceedings for the last three weeks
over the issue, called on other MPs to follow his example and force a
general election. But analysts believe his surprise move may instead cost
him the leadership of the Democratic party (DP) because some party officials
regard his position as too extreme.
'He has painted himself into a corner,' said one aide to Mr Kim Dae-jung,
the former DP head.
Mr Lee, who has been criticised for his hapless leadership since becoming
party head two years ago, sought to use the government's failure to
prosecute former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as an issue to
strengthen his position within the party. By confronting the government, he
hoped to rally support behind his leadership.
Many DP members opposed the military government after the coup leaders
violently suppressed a 1980 revolt in the city of Kwangju, the party's main
power base.
But some senior DP officials, including the party's founder Mr Kim, have
urged Mr Lee to abandon his hardline attitude and resume parliamentary
proceedings, which will include the scheduled approval of South Korea's
membership of the World Trade Organisation.
The fate of former presidents Chun and Roh has also posed a political
problem for the current President Kim Young-sam, who was an opponent of
military rule in the 1980s.
President Kim favoured leniency for the two former presidents because he
feared that prosecuting them could lead to a split within the ruling
Democratic Liberal party.
Prosecutors said Mr Chun and Mr Roh would not be charged with military
rebellion because of their subsequent service to the country.
The majority of DLP MPs are allies of Mr Chun and Mr Roh. The DLP was
created in 1991 following a merger between then-president Roh's ruling party
and Mr Kim's smaller opposition group.
There have been persistent rumours that conservative MPs may soon quit the
DLP and form a new party to oppose President Kim because of concerns that
they will not be renominated for parliamentary seats in the 1996 elections.

Police shot dead seven people and injured 100 yesterday when they opened
fire on a crowd of students in Kannur district, in the southern Indian state
of Kerala.
Police said they fired at the crowd after protesters attacked the car of a
visiting state minister during a demonstration by the youth and student
wings of the Communist Party of India - part of widespread action against
the state government's education policy.
It was the third consecutive day in which police have resorted to violence
to quell demonstrations, in unrelated incidents in different parts of the
country.
At least 120 people died in a stampede in Nagpur, Maharashtra state, on
Wednesday after police used batons on a group of tribal demonstrators to
stop them breaking through a cordon around the state legislature. On
Thursday at least two people were killed in the eastern sector of New Delhi,
the capital, when police opened fire on a mob they said stoned a squad of
the Delhi Development Authority as it attempted to demolish an unauthorised
construction.
Maoist guerrillas in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh kidnapped a
relative of prime minister P V Narasimha Rao ahead of an election rally the
Indian leader was set to address yesterday, police said, Reuter reports from
Warangal.
They said guerrillas of the Praja Pratighatna group, a breakaway faction of
the main Maoist People's War Group, were demanding a Rs1m (Pounds 20,400)
ransom for the brother of Mr Rao's son-in-law. The Maoists defied a
paramilitary crackdown on Thursday to lead a strike against what they say
will be fraudulent state assembly elections on December 5.

FT  26 NOV 94 / No room in the Vietnamese inns: Scarce accommodation hinders
business stormtroopers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A serviced apartment building is going up on the shore of Hanoi's famous Ho
Tay or West Lake. The price for a spacious, but by no means luxurious,
two-bedroomed flat is Dollars 8,000 (Pounds 5,000) a month, plus some
service charges.
The rush to Vietnam is on. Encouraged by the lifting of the US trade embargo
this year, foreigners are charging into Vietnam in ever greater numbers,
seeking business opportunities on what many see as Asia's new frontier.
But there is little room for these stormtroopers of the business world.
Hotels in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the former Saigon) are often
booked out months in advance. Room rates, although not necessarily
facilities and service, are equivalent to Singapore or Sydney. Tourist
arrivals have gone up from 250,000 in 1990 to a forecast of nearly 1m this
year.
The pressure on accommodation is immense. 'It's a bizarre situation,' said
one Hanoi-based foreign oil company manager.
'I'm living in a city which has 1930s facilities but I'm paying modern-day
Hong Kong rents.'
Property developers, led by Singaporean, Malaysian and Hong Kong-based
companies, have moved in to take advantage of the dramatic upswing in the
number of people seeking not only hotel accommodation but homes and offices
for rent. According to official figures, 95 joint local/foreign hotel
projects worth a total of nearly Dollars 2bn have been approved over the
last two years.
Piling machines are making their way down Hanoi's narrow streets. Cranes dot
the Ho Chi Minh city skyline. But the developers are not having an easy
time.
One of the first problems any investor in Vietnam faces is the lack of a
comprehensive system of commercial regulations and law. Developers find that
under Vietnamese law all land belongs to the state and cannot be sold.
Establishing title to land involves lengthy negotiations with numerous,
often competing, authorities, including politically powerful local people's
committees. Local estate agents may claim to have rights to the land they
are selling but, in fact, they often have only doctored papers which one
government department may accept and another reject.
Nonetheless, local speculators have used gold stashed away during recent
years or money from relatives overseas to gain control of property in the
hope of a foreign rush for land and building space.
Mr Huynh Buu Son, deputy director of the Saigon Bank for Industry and Trade,
says that prices in parts of Ho Chi Minh City have peaked. 'Some local banks
which have supported the speculators are going to get into trouble. Locals
who bought at inflated prices now can't find buyers for their property.'
With the absence of a proper land title system and no mortgage laws, foreign
developers find that their banks are often unwilling to offer financing in
such an uncertain market. Instead, companies have to rely on their own cash
reserves.
Having found a site to develop, the next problem is compensation and
resettlement for those living there. Hanoi and Hon Chi Minh City are two of
the most densely populated urban centres in Asia; the density in parts of Ho
Chi Minh City is greater than in Hong Kong, while Hanoi's population has
risen from 500,000 inhabitants in the 1950s to more than 3m today.
Foreign developers, as well as diplomatic missions and company executives,
have been keen to renovate and rent some of Hanoi's crumbling French
colonial-style villas. The authorities give the go-ahead but say those
inhabiting such properties must be compensated.
That can be an expensive proposition. The authorities recently found that
more than 1,000 families were living in 150 villas in the centre of Hanoi.
Compensation claims are often grossly inflated.
Several foreign-backed projects have either been abandoned or are still only
in the planning stage. Work on a French/Vietnamese joint venture project to
build a hotel near the site of the Hanoi Opera House has still not started,
nearly two years after winning initial approval from the authorities. A
Scandinavian/Vietnamese venture to build a hotel near the city's Lenin Park
has apparently run into financing difficulties.
The Dollars 63m New World in Ho Chi Minh City, described as the southern
city's largest luxury hotel, finally opened in October after six years of
squabbling over land agreements and compensation claims.
Some Vietnamese are wary of the foreign property developers. Officials
insist that they do not want Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City to fall into the same
haphazard development cycle as cities like Bangkok. Some criticise the
emphasis on luxury hotels and resorts, out of reach of all but a small
minority of Vietnamese, while farmers have objected to precious agricultural
land and water resources being used for golf courses.
Mr Peter Purcell, an Australian property developer, is managing a project to
build an exclusive recreation club on the shore of Hanoi's West Lake.
Although building on the project has yet to start, companies are already
advancing Dollars 15,000 membership fees.
Several luxury hotel developments are planned nearby. 'Things take longer to
do here,' says Mr Purcell. 'It's not like Singapore or Malaysia, where, if
the authorities tell people to move off the land, that's it. Even the
lowliest worker has a say. Small-scale projects are fine but I'd be wary of
getting involved in any big property deal.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Tokyo breaks silence over plutonium stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government disclosed the country's plutonium stockpiles for the
first time yesterday in an effort to increase transparency of its nuclear
fuel programme.
Tokyo has long been secretive about its ambitious plutonium programme on
grounds of security.
However, concern over its plutonium policy was aired last year by some
Japanese MPs, ahead of the British government's authorisation of the
controversial launch of British Nuclear Fuel's Thorp plant at Sellafield.
They opposed the start of Thorp's operations, claiming that Japan, a leading
customer of the nuclear reprocessing plant, would be left holding excessive
amounts of plutonium.
International concern over global nuclear proliferation and heightened
criticism over North Korea's nuclear developments have also prompted the
Tokyo government to provide more information to the public.
The stocks were listed in the nuclear energy white paper put together by the
Science and Technology Agency. Agency officials said the amounts had been
disclosed to reconfirm the government's plan of not holding more plutonium
than the programme required.
The white paper said 1,286kg of plutonium were held in the UK and 4,911kg in
France at the end of last year. Since Japan has as yet no fully fledged
commercial-use reprocessing facilities, British Nuclear Fuel and Cogema of
France are reprocessing nuclear fuel into plutonium.
Of the 4,684kg held in Japan, 326kg were situated at reprocessing facilities
in Tokai, north of Tokyo, and 3,269kg at the site's fuel fabrication
facilities. A further 1,089kg were at the country's fast breeder reactors.
The government's announcement comes ahead of the shipment next February of
high density nuclear waste originating from Japanese used nuclear fuel
processed by Cogema. A total of 28 stainless steel containers of nuclear
waste moulded together with glass will be shipped back to Japan from France.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Japan's tax reforms clear Diet: Measures aim to encourage
purchases of imported goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's upper house of parliament yesterday gave final approval, as
expected, for tax reforms to stimulate the weak recovery in the short term
and restrain growth in state borrowing after 1997.
This fulfils a promise made by prime minister Tomiichi Murayama at the Group
of Seven summit in July to cut income tax as a means to encourage more
Japanese to buy imported goods and lower the world's largest and most
politically contentious trade surplus.
The first part of the package consists of Y16,500bn (Pounds 107bn) of income
tax cuts spread over the next three years, worth Y5,500bn annually. Of the
annual total, Y3,500bn will continue after 1997 as a permanent reduction.
In the second stage of tax reform, starting in the fiscal year beginning
April 1997, sales tax will rise from its internationally low 3 per cent to 5
per cent. This is needed to finance the tax cuts, and over the longer term
compensate for the shrinkage in the income tax base caused by Japan's
fast-ageing population profile.
The sales tax rise is smaller than the fiscally conservative finance
ministry had wanted, because of its obvious political unpopularity. However,
a clause in yesterday's tax bill empowers the government to raise sales tax
by more than 5 points, depending on the state of the economy and
administrative spending.
To win support, even for the smaller figure, from members of the three-party
ruling coalition, Mr Murayama promised to cut spending on the public
administration. His government reiterated that pledge yesterday. It planned
to produce by the end of March a list of state bodies due to be slimmed,
merged or closed, said Mr Masahiko Komura, director general of the Economic
Planning Agency.
Consumer prices in Tokyo, an early indicator of nationwide inflation, rose
1.1 per cent in November from the same month a year ago. However, most of
that was caused by a freak rise in food prices.
Taking out food, the core Tokyo inflation rate was a mere 0.5 per cent
year-on-year, down 0.1 per cent on October, confirming inflation continues
to be almost non-existent.
One reason for this is the pressure on prices from bargain-conscious
consumers, shown yesterday by a 2.6 per cent year-on-year fall in department
store sales in October, the 32nd consecutive month of decline. Business,
meanwhile, is expanding fast at discount supermarkets, opening up at a rate
of 80 per month nationwide.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UN and Nato in struggle over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UN has in effect recaptured from Nato the main diplomatic initiative
over the Bosnian conflict, in a fresh setback for the prestige of the
Atlantic alliance.
The pivotal role of the UN was illustrated yesterday by the mediation
efforts of General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, and a comment
from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, that he was in
touch with all the warring parties.
Shrugging some off some harsh criticism from Bosnia's Moslem-led government,
the British general yesterday took advantage of the apparent exhaustion -
albeit temporary - of both parties in the Bihac enclave to broke a
ceasefire.
The visibility of the British UN commander pointed to a renewed emphasis on
pragmatic, ad hoc mediation efforts - which avoid passing judgment on the
parties - and a setback for the interventionist philosophy which the US has
urged on its Nato partners.
Amid confused reports of Nato aerial activity over Bihac last night, it
seemed clear that the UN was sticking to insistence on making only the most
sparing use of of air power.
Nato ambassadors failed on Thursday to reach agreement on a US plan for
demilitarising the Bihac area, and they said they were referring the
proposal to the UN for further elaboration.
There was little sign, however, of that elaboration taking place yesterday
because the problem raised by France over the US proposal - the lack of
ground troops to oversee demilitarisation - seems a virtually insoluble one.
It was becoming clearer that the US hopes of a Nato imprimatur for firm
intervention in the conflict, with tough use of air power to shore up the
military fortunes of the Bosnian government, have been dashed.
State Department deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly said last night the
ceasefire was not holding in Bihac, but said Nato should not be blamed for
the failure. 'Nato is not an independent player in Bosnia. It's there in
support of the UN.'
Mr Willy Claes, the new secretary-general of Nato, acknowledged yesterday
that he was disappointed by the allies' failure to agree. 'They should have
been able to push further,' he said.
Yesterday's developments were only the latest in a series of setbacks to the
prestige of Nato's political machinery.
In theory, the US should always find it easier to win approval for its
policies in Nato - where it is by far the biggest military power - than in
the UN, a where it has to contend with the influence of Russia and China.
But last week, as air attacks from Serb-held Croatia brought the Bihac
crisis to a head, US diplomacy appeared to be homing in more strongly on the
UN, where the Security Council passed an emergency resolution late last
Saturday.
US officials are understood to have had some frank discussions with Mr
Boutros Ghali about the need for tougher action in Bosnia.
Recent electoral victories by US Republicans have increased pressure for an
outright lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia - something that would
almost certainly make the UN's continued presence in the republic untenable
and force a humiliating withdrawal.
Mr Boutros Ghali is believed to be well aware of that consideration as he
formulates policy towards Bosnia and tries to head off the danger that
peace-keeping in former Yugoslavia will end in the same humiliating way as
the UN mission to Somalia.
Yet the secretary general has other factors to take into account, including
the delicacy of the situation on the ground, and the impossibility of
intervening with air strikes in hand-to-hand fighting.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Atlantic storm does its worst -
London / And shares remain vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saloon bar weather forecasters were definite. 'Roses still blooming in
November? It's not natural. It can't last,' they declared at the start of
the week. 'The Footsie still over 3,100, with 10-year gilts yielding 8.6 per
cent? It can't last,' echoed the gloomier City forecasters.
The meteorological cold snap has yet to arrive, but the financial storm duly
hit on Tuesday. The map looked all too familiar, with low pressure over the
Atlantic leading to precipitating share prices in London.
The FT-SE 100 index lost 42.3 points on Tuesday as New York started to
slide, and tumbled another 51.2 points on Wednesday after Wall Street ended
the session down almost 2 1/2 per cent. With Wall Street closed for
Thanksgiving on Thursday, there was then a nervous calm as the City peered
at its barometer. Members of the Michael Fish school of forecasting
('hurricane, what hurricane?') saw the events as a healthy correction. Those
of a more apocalyptic frame of mind announced the beginning of the end.
Nick Knight, equity strategist at Nomura, advised investors to 'sell while
you still can'. His equally gloomy rival at Panmure Gordon, Robin Aspinall,
declared himself 'quite certain' the Footsie would hit 2,750 before
Christmas on the way to 2,200.
That might still happen. But when New York traders returned to their desks
yesterday, full of turkey and pumpkin pie, the wind had dropped. New York
started brightly and there was little change in London shares, leaving the
Footsie at 3,033.5, down almost 100 points on the week.
There was plenty to worry about at home, too. Despite the cabinet's
so-called suicide threat, it seemed at least possible that Tory
back-benchers would call its bluff over the European Union finance bill on
Monday. And there was mounting unease about what Tuesday's Budget might
bring.
In particular, the fear has re-surfaced that chancellor Kenneth Clarke will
return to the subject of advance corporation tax. The cut from 25 per cent
to 20 per cent, announced by Norman Lamont in March last year, released
Pounds 1bn annually for the exchequer by reducing the tax credit that
pension funds, and other tax-exempt investors, can claim on dividends.
The money was generated at relatively little political cost, and there must
be a chance that Clarke will come back for more. But reducing the rate cuts
institutions' income from equities - so such a move would hit share prices,
particularly high-yielding utilities, by making them less attractive
compared with gilts.
UK institutions have been moving into gilts over the past couple of months,
narrowing the yield premium they offer over US government bonds and over UK
equities. The process accelerated sharply this week, with the yield on
10-year gilts falling from 8.6 per cent to below 8.5 per cent while the
yield on the FT All-Share index pushed back through the 4 per cent level.
That cut the ratio of yields on gilts and equities from 2.23 to just over
2.13. The doomsters point out that, at present gilt yields, the FT-SE 100
index would have to fall to 2,600 to bring the yield ratio down to its
opening year levels.
But the ratio is now close to its long-run average. As for the comparison
with US Treasuries, gilts have further ground to make up, given the UK's
better inflation outlook.
There were some warning signs this week. The Confederation of British
Industry's monthly survey showed an increased proportion of manufacturers
planning to raise prices to offset higher raw materials costs. Earlier in
the week, Courtaulds joined the chorus of companies complaining about
squeezed margins and said it would put up its fibre prices by between 5 and
15 per cent in January.
Yet, even if these increases stick, it is debatable if they will be passed
on to consumers. Still suffering from the over-expansion of the 1980s,
retailers are finding it extremely difficult to push through price rises -
as BHS and Mothercare admitted this week.
All this is encouraging City economists to stick to their inflation
predictions. Indeed, Bill Martin of UBS, one of the leading pessimists, has
just cut his inflation forecast for next year by 1.25 points to 3.5 per
cent. As a result, he now forecasts base rates of 8 per cent at the end of
1995, rather less than the markets are expecting. Lower inflation means
investors will require a lower yield on equities, so UBS has increased its
target for the FT-SE 100 to 3,200 for the middle of next year and 3,400 by
the end.
Meanwhile, the interim reporting season continued to produce very healthy
dividend increases. Granada, Tate &amp; Lyle and Vodafone all announced rises of
more than 10 per cent and water company shareholders felt the benefits of
the industry's comfortable new price corsets. Even the back marker, South
West Water, offered an 8.3 per cent rise, while Yorkshire pledged to provide
growth of 5 per cent per annum after inflation for the next five years.
The market was not impressed, though, with both water and electricity shares
having a poor week. In part, this reflected nothing more sinister than a bit
of profit-taking. But there were also also renewed worries about Labour's
proposed windfall tax on the profits of utilities.
That apart, the climate looks quite favourable for equities. Yet, UK share
prices will remain vulnerable to turbulence in New York, where the behaviour
of retail investors could be critical.
With interest rates rising and share prices returning to the level where
many investors bought, it would be no surprise to see a rush for the door.
Until that threat passes, UK equities are unlikely to enjoy an Indian
summer.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Wheeler-dealers with bottomless
wallets - Pharmaceuticals / Nearly Dollars 25bn has been spent this year
within the industry - but why?
</HEADLINE>

What on earth are drugs companies doing? On Monday, Switzerland's Ciba
raised its stake in Chiron, a US biotechnology company, from 4 per cent to
49.9 per cent, valuing the 13-year old California business at Pounds 2.7bn.
On Wednesday, the UK's SmithKline Beecham sold its animal health business
for Dollars 1.45bn to Pfizer, a US drugs giant.
These deals were just the latest in a series in which almost Dollars 25bn
has been spent in pharmaceuticals this year. But there appear to be few
common threads other than the vast sums involved.
Take SmithKline Beecham. Like Ciba, it has small stakes in biotechnology
companies. But, in May, it spent Dollars 2.3bn buying a US drugs distributor
and another Dollars 2.9bn in July on a company specialising in
over-the-counter branded medicines. The seller in the second deal was
Eastman Kodak, which sold the rest of its drugs business - prescription
products - to Elf Sanofi of France for Dollars 1.7bn.
Meanwhile, Switzerland's Roche, which already has more than 60 per cent of
one of the biggest biotech companies, Genentech, paid Dollars 5.3bn for a
conventional US drugs company, Syntex. Another drugs company, American
Cyanamid, went to rival American Home Products for almost Dollars 10bn,
while US drugs-maker Eli Lilly picked on a distributor and paid Dollars 4bn.
Such furious deal-making is exceptional in any industry but doubly so for
pharmaceuticals: during the 1980s, there were a a mere handful of large
mergers and virtually no acquisitions. In those days, though, drugs company
executives were happy with their lot and confident of the future.
In the US, especially, new products were launched at premium prices.
Patients demanded the best, doctors prescribed the new products - and billed
the insurance company. Not surprisingly, the profits of drugs companies
increased every year.
No more. In the 1990s, those who pick up the bill are learning how to drive
a bargain. Outside the US, this means government legislation to cut prices:
earlier this year, Japan forced through a 6 per cent cut, while Italy
reduced the number of drugs available on its national health service.
In the US, the payers are mostly employers who offer health insurance to
their staff. A decade ago, they began to use companies called health
management organisations (HMOs) to buy medical services and drugs
cost-effectively.
Today, one-fifth of those holding health insurance policies in the US are in
'managed care'. Their doctors are under pressure to prescribe drugs from an
approved list of products which the HMO has obtained at cut prices. The
effect has been salutary.
'Drugs company chiefs recognise that profits are going to be harder to come
by,' says Jacqueline Cantle, pharmaceuticals analyst at stockbroker Smith
New Court. 'One solution is to get bigger - hence the deal-making.'
Yet, as any corporate raider will tell you, finding good buys is difficult.
Each of the acquisitions this year appears to have flaws. The distributors
are tiny businesses in highly competitive markets. Syntex and American
Cyanamid are companies which have seen better days.
The biotechnology sector is having one of the worst years in its short
history. The average price of the 250-odd quoted US biotechnology companies
has fallen by almost 30 per cent. In the UK, three companies were among the
worst performers of the 130-plus stock market flotations of the past year.
Only SmithKline Beecham has so far put its deal-mania into a wider setting.
It says it is now a human health-care provider. It does not treat animals
and is not confined solely to drugs. That means a halt to the deal-making,
said Jan Leschly, its chief executive.
He added: 'I can't rule out further acquisitions, but what's next is to make
sure that we make the most of our investments through synergy and
restructuring.'
Still, while one company apparently bows out of the deal-making arena,
another steps in. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive,
indicated that he had only just begun his series of acquisitions. And many
other companies - notably Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs company - have yet
to start.
The fountain of cash from the drugs sector has not dried up.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The market gives a simple message -
Wall Street / The reasons for a fall which had to happen sooner or later
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the benefit of hindsight, this week's plunge on Wall Street was an
accident waiting to happen. For months, bonds had been getting cheaper and
stocks had not. Last week's sharp rise in the discount rate merely prodded
stocks into action. Whether they are back into line is a more ticklish
question.
The point is illustrated by one simple statistic. At the start of February,
just before the Fed first raised rates, the long bond was yielding 6.3 per
cent and equities 2.7 per cent. By last week, the bond yield had risen to
8.2 per cent and equities to only 2.9 per cent.
To put the same point in a different way, the yield ratio rose over the
period from 2.4 to over 2.8. Though this may seem a little arcane, its
significance lies in the fact that the normal range for this ratio is
between 2.2 and 2.6. The last time it reached 2.8 - that is, the last time
equities were so expensive relative to bonds - was before the crash of 1987
(it went on to peak at the crazy level of nearly 3.6).
It might seem surprising that retail investors, at least, should have
tolerated this. After all, one of the most striking phenomena for equities
in the early 1990s was the surge of private savings into mutual funds, when
the return on cash was very low. When the Fed began to push rates up in
February, that money ought to have started moving out. Instead, investors
seem to have assumed that the strength of US economic recovery would push up
corporate earnings and therefore stock prices, thus providing capital gains
to make good the shortfall in income.
It therefore came as a blow to realise last week that the US economic cycle
seems finally to be turning down; or if not, that the Fed has every
intention of pushing up rates until it does turn down. The third quarter
results season just ended brought a string of record earnings from a wide
range of companies, not merely the traditional cyclical sectors, and that
may continue for another quarter or so. Nevertheless, the market senses that
the earnings recovery is faltering.
An oblique but powerful piece of supporting evidence comes from companies
themselves. This week, Walt Disney capped a record year of earnings by
saying it had spent Dollars 920m since May buying back its shares, and that
it planned to spend up to Dollars 4.5bn doing the same in future. On the
same day Merck said it was going to spend Dollars 2bn on its shares, a sharp
increase on its previous buyback programme. The day after, the electronics
giant AMP (market value Dollars 7.3bn) said it too would start buybacks,
under a programme already in place but not yet implemented.
Now, there are two ways of raising earnings per share: increase the earnings
for a given number of shares, or reduce the shares for a given amount of
earnings. Not all these companies believe their earnings growth will falter:
indeed, AMP specifically said it expects record earnings for the next two
quarters. But in general terms, when companies can find nothing better to do
with their cash than retire their own equity, it is likely there are squalls
ahead.
The Fed's actions apart, the other factor weighing on the market's mind is
political. It is clear by now that the crushing success of the Republicans
in the mid-term elections could prove a mixed blessing. To be sure, the
Republicans can be expected to press for a lightening of regulatory and
other burdens. But they also stand for low taxation. Cutting taxes is
quicker and easier than cutting spending, particularly for a party which is
committed to halting the cuts in the defence budget.
Other things being equal, in other words, the risk is that the budget
deficit will worsen. This might seem a paradox for a party which contains
such powerful figures as Senator Phil Gramm, who believes the constitution
should be amended to prohibit the government from borrowing at all. But for
the bond market, even the outside chance of increased supply would tend to
push yields up as well; and the last thing the equity market needs now is a
weak bond market.
As for the week ahead, the market's indecision was shown by yesterday's
thinly-traded holiday rally. There are at least two reasons for thinking the
nervousness may not be over. First, though the Dow has fallen further in the
past week than the broader-based S&amp;P 500, it has fallen by less since the
start of the year. In other words, the big leading stocks may still be a
touch overvalued relative to the market as a whole.
Second, watch that yield ratio. At around 2.7, it is still on the high side.
It is always possible that the bond market will save the day by staging a
rally. The toughness of the Fed's recent actions reinforces its inflationary
credentials; and if, as its critics charge, it risks slowing the real
economy too sharply, there is nothing the bond market likes better than a
good recession. Either way, the past week has rammed home one simple
message. If you want to know where equities are headed these days, all you
need do is work out where bonds are going first.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The Icarus Syndrome - In the Pink /
Why hot managers usually melt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN TRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Train is chairman of Montrose Advisers, investment counsel in New York.
He is the author of The Money Masters and The New Money Masters, and his
latest book, The Craft of Investing, has just been published.
Hot managers as a class often lose more money than they make, even though
they display wonderful records. The reason is that when a hot manager's
technique is really working, he can pocket fees of tens of millions of
dollars a month - even Dollars 100m from time to time - so the temptation to
stay on board the bandwagon too long becomes irresistible.
Sooner or later, though, the good times end - often because he is managing
too much money for his method to cope with - and the record collapses. By
then, though, the hot manager may be running hundreds of times more money
than at the time of his wonderful performance. So, in absolute terms, his
losses may well exceed his gains.
An interesting example surfaced recently when the most famous short-selling
partnership in history closed its doors. It was run by a team of brothers,
the Feshbachs, in California and, at its peak, reached Dollars 500m dollars.
But the burn-out factor eventually took its toll. Performance slumped and
the team decided - after waiting much too long - to wind down the
partnership.
Over its 20-year life, it had a total gain of 10 per cent net of fees, or
0.6 per cent a year compounded. Well, not the end of the world, you say. But
in the very first reporting period after its inception, from February 15 to
June 30 1985, it jumped 49 per cent, which elevated its record wonderfully
thereafter. Yet, at the outset, the capital of the entire partnership was
just over Dollars 3m. So, in absolute terms, the gain represented only
Dollars 1.5m.
In the first quarter after reaching its peak of Dollars 533m, the
partnership actually dropped 39 per cent, losing more than Dollars 200m. So
while, in percentage terms, those two particular quarters more or less
cancelled each other out, in absolute terms the partners had, on balance,
lost Dollars 200m.
Incidentally, the statistical abuse of running up a wonderful record with a
tiny amount of money, so giving the impression of extraordinary skill
forever after, is notorious. In its worst variation, managers of families of
funds privately incubate hatcheries of little wonders, waiting for a
stand-out to emerge with a marvellous early record that can be taken public
to form the basis for a throbbing sales campaign. In statistics, this is
called 'survivorship bias'.
Why does Icarus, so much more heavily-freighted at his apogee than at his
take-off, usually tumble to earth? I see four different reasons: his own
increased tonnage; an excess of imitation; the reversal of a major trend
that the arrival of these same imitators has prolonged unduly; and his own
hubris.
First, taking on too much money. When a hedge fund artist makes Dollars 503m
on a single bet, such as George Soros against sterling, his own reward can
be Dollars 100m. Thus, it is inordinately tempting to keep trying. But why
does he not just refuse to accept new clients at some point?
Interestingly enough, the investment managers preferred by other managers
often do just that. Warren Buffet turned his original clientele over to Bill
Ruane, whose Sequoia fund has been closed for years now. A number of US
money managers recently named Ralph Wanger, of Chicago, as their own choice
 -yet, his Acorn Fund has not taken new money for a long time, either.
For that matter, why do South American dictators not step down modestly with
a few hundred millions instead of clinging on until they are deposed and
exiled, killed or put on trial? The answer is, of course, ambition - 'the
last infirmity of noble minds'.
Money is a form of power and, in matters of power, most men are insatiable.
It seems as important to make the next billion as it was to make the first
million. Thus, the skilful manager of a Dollars 100m partnership might
become the hopelessly overloaded administrator of Dollars 10bn.
As to imitators, the forces are obvious. Almost all hot managers once worked
for someone else, and split off to make their fortunes. Their own
lieutenants have every incentive to do the same thing. When the number two
man in Whizzkid Partners hangs up his own shingle, he does not fail to
invoke the success of the predecessor organisation and suggest that the new
fund, being so much smaller, will be more manageable.
This is very possibly true so the clones, and close copies, proliferate. But
to go on achieving their prodigious results, they assume increasing risk,
skating on thinner and thinner ice. Eventually, it must break.
Suppose, for instance, that the big idea of the moment is small-cap stocks.
Of these, there is only a limited supply. Suppose further that, at the
outset of the move, they were underpriced. But as new fund after new fund
piles in, the small-cap boom will, by the nature of things, be reinforced
until it has gone much too far. Nothing exceeds like success] So the
collapse, when it comes, is devastating.
As to hubris, we all see it around us in every domain. 'La fortune se plait
a nous faire de ces coups/Tout vaingueur insolent a sa perte travaille,'*
says La Fontaine. After enough success, one fancies oneself god-like, stops
concentrating and becomes overbearing and jealous. But Someone Up There, I
observe, notices with a frown: 'Oh, he thinks that, does he? He says that,
does he?' Zap]
I think that today's Icarus syndrome - the spawning we see of ever more
supposedly hot managers, and hot managers of hot managers, is an obvious
symptom of a bull market blow-off phase. Why? Because it happens only in a
time of unreasonable expectations, when the public is not investing but
speculating. But times of unreasonable expectations are dangerous to your
wealth.
*'Fortune likes to deal us those blows/Every proud victor works his own
undoing.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Russian duma deflects budget row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian parliament last night stepped back from confrontation with the
government over the budget by calling for a 'conciliation commission' to
'check on the basic figures' of next year's budget before a vote is taken.
The commission is due to report by December 10.
However, the debate yesterday in the state duma (lower house) and comments
by leading deputies leave little doubt that the budget as it stands -
promoted by the government as a strategy which will finally puncture high
inflation and stabilise the rouble - would be voted down by the duma.
According to Mr Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the duma budget committee,
only the liberal Russia's Choice party led by Mr Yegor Gaidar would vote for
it.
The government has made clear it is open to proposals to tinker with the
figures, but will reject all efforts at strategic shifts. The budget
envisages no central bank credits for the government next year, the sale of
a massive Rbs70,000bn worth of treasury bills, and support, largely from the
International Monetary Fund, of nearly Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8bn) - at the
present exchange rate, around one third of the projected yearly income.
Mr Zadornov attacked each part of the budget strategy. He said treasury
bills would not be sold in large amounts at a time of high inflation, that
the projected level of taxes could not be gathered and that the projected
level of expenditure was far too low given commitments already made and
debts which had to be paid.
Mr Vladimir Panskov, the new finance minister, yesterday revealed the
parlous state of the government's finances - admitting that it could not pay
Rbs3,000bn it owes to defence equipment companies. However, he said that the
nearly Rbs2,000bn debt owed in back wages to state employees had been
reduced to Rbs600bn.
The discussions are now very bitter. Mr Alexander Pochinok, the Russia's
Choice member who is deputy chairman of the budget committee, yesterday
attacked Mr Zadornov and other leading members for refusing to realise how
essential the budget was to save the country from continuing decline.
To derision from his colleagues and from many of the press, Mr Pochinok
said: 'If we want to live reasonably, we have to learn how to produce and
how to sell. People buy imported goods because they are better - it's that
simple.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Austria's new coalition agrees big spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seven weeks after suffering big losses at the hands of disillusioned voters,
Austria's two main parties agreed yesterday to form a new coalition
government and make large cuts in government spending.
Weathering protests by trade union and various interests groups, the Social
Democratic party and the conservative People's party agreed to cut spending
by Sch250bn (Pounds 14.5bn) over four years, curtail several social
programmes and make some steps toward more flexible labour laws.
In an all-night negotiating session, the two parties resisted pressures to
drop key parts of their austerity plan, but left some details open for
future talks with the trade unions. If fully implemented, the cuts would
mark a significant departure from Austrian traditional policies of big
government spending and generous social benefits.
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a Social Democrat, and conservative leader
Erhard Busek are hoping to reduce the budget deficit, which is projected at
Sch117bn next year, and bring it in line with the convergence criteria of
the Maastricht treaty. Austria will join the European Union on January 1 and
wants to be in the core group for monetary union.
Among the most painful measures is a pledge to limit public sector pay rises
to 2 per cent in 1995, below the projected inflation rate of 2.5 per cent.
The key positions in the new cabinet will remain unchanged, however, despite
promises of a new start and a reshuffle by both parties. In the elections
last month, the Social Democrats dropped from 80 seats to 65 seats in the
183-seat parliament, and the conservatives fell from 60 to 52 seats. The big
winner was the right-wing Freedom party, which capitalised on voter
disillusionment with the abuse of power and patronage by the governing
parties. It gained nine seats to 42 seats.
The Freedom party leader, the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, is hoping to break
the coalition before its regular term ends in 1998 and become chancellor
after the next elections. Public discontent with the spending cuts could
hurt the governing parties in the short term.
But the accord should also help maintain market confidence in the Austrian
economy and its currency. The two parties also resolved a dispute over who
should be in charge of EU policy.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Western interest fails to allay Gazprom fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign appetite for shares in Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly which
is the world's largest supplier and the country's biggest company, has
created huge disparities in its market price ahead of the sale of 9 per cent
of its stock to international investors, planned to take place by the end of
the year.
The price of Gazprom shares quoted on the Vladivostok stock exchange has
soared to Rbs15,510, according to Gazprom officials. This is more than 17
times greater than the Rbs880 quoted by Moscow brokers, and reflects the
fact that foreign investors, who can trade on the Vladivostok exchange
following a test offering last month, are pushing up the price.
The Vladivostok price would mean that the 9 per cent offered abroad would be
worth around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn) - on the Moscow price it would be
worth under Dollars 600m. However, both prices are highly artificial, since
nothing is known of how the shares will be offered, and there are doubts
surround the title to any future shares and even about whether Gazprom has
the right to sell them to foreigners.
Gazprom is, after the oil companies, the largest earner of hard currency for
Russia. Its annual contract with the German company Ruhrgas - its largest
foreign client - is worth DM2.6bn (Pounds 1bn) a year.
However, according to brokers and financial executives in Moscow yesterday,
the doubts surrounding the shares may mean that the price will be lower than
Gazprom is hoping for - though they concede that a company as potentially
rich as this may be forgiven a good deal of uncertainty. Kleinwort Benson,
the London merchant bank handling the sale, refuses to give any details,
citing the need to observe US legislation on non-disclosure of information
before a sale.
The problems cited by the Moscow analysts are:
Lack of information on how the shares are to be offered - whether to chosen
investors or sold freely.
Lack of ability to prove title to the shares - which, though they have a
price, are barely traded outside Vladivostok. A clause in the company's
charter which forbids it to sell shares to foreigners. Though it can
probably circumvent the clause by creating a special class of foreign
shares, it might leave itself open to legal challenge.
Though its reserves are vast - estimated to be worth between Dollars 1,500bn
to Dollars 2,000bn - it is subject to Russian government policy of
controlling energy prices and cannot collect some of its largest debts, from
other former Soviet republics.
Gazprom has received substantial credits from the Italian and German credit
agencies, but in both cases can offer gas supplied to these countries as
collateral.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is working with the
company on an ambitious plan to identify investment opportunities on its
220,000km of pipeline but has as yet not decided to invest in the company.
By contrast Lukoil, the next biggest energy company, has delayed its stock
offer to demonstrate accounts diligence.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Flight cancellations, delays and scattered clashes between ground staff of
the state-owned Iberia airline and police yesterday at Madrid's Barajas
airport were a foretaste of the chaos that could afflict air traffic to
Spain in the days ahead.
Some 30 Madrid-Barcelona shuttle service and other morning rush-hour flights
to Spain's main cities were grounded as police took four hours to restore
calm to the domestic terminal. At several airports, works committees began
sit-ins.
International flights were not affected yesterday but airlines were bracing
themselves for a worsening situation next week. 'We're not cancelling
anything at this stage and we'll just have to wait and see,' said Air
France.
Yesterday's incidents were caused by Iberia employees affiliated to minority
unions. The disruptions are likely to increase on Monday when the main
unions will join the protest against a drastic restructuring plan drawn up
by the management that involves redundancy notices for 20 per cent of the
company's 25,000 employees and the sell-off of most subsidiaries.
The powerful Iberia pilots union, which had so far stood back from the
dispute, said it would support strike action and would also take the
airline's management to court if it pressed ahead with the break-up of the
company.
The main concern is that wildcat action could close domestic airports.
Extremists are calling on Iberia employees to block runways and to cause
disruptions similar to those during the violent Air France strike a year
ago.
The airline is expected to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 218m) and it could face
bankruptcy next year unless it severely reduces its costs and raises fresh
capital through disposals.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Maastricht speech adds to EU row

<TEXT>
Mr Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for external political affairs, has
risked inflaming divisions in the ruling Conservative party in Britain with
a call for weakening national veto powers in the European Union.
Mr van den Broek, who will assume wider authority in external relations in
the incoming Commission of Mr Jacques Santer of Luxembourg - successor to Mr
Jacques Delors, who leaves the presidency of the European Commission in
January - said it was time to consider new constitutional arrangements to
allow a vanguard of integrationist-minded states to move ahead in a
multi-speed Europe.
He suggested that changes in the Maastricht, Rome or other EU treaties
should enter into force when four-fifths of the EU's population and member
states have ratified - a challenge to the 36-year-old principle that treaty
changes must be unanimous.
Mr van den Broek's speech, in the Hague on Thursday night, came at the end
of a turbulent week in British politics, with the UK government threatening
to call an election if it loses a parliamentary vote next Monday on raising
UK contributions to the EU budget.
His thoughts reflect broad but by no means overwhelming sentiment among
governments in Germany, the Benelux countries, and, to a degree, France, in
favour of a multi-speed Europe built around an inner core of committed
integrationists.
Aides said the speech would serve as a marker ahead of the 1996
inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty, but British
officials noted that the Dutch commissioner had touched 'the most neuralgic
point' of the Rome treaty. Others warned that forcing the pace of
integration by diluting national veto powers could 'break the Union'.
According to a text distributed in Brussels yesterday, Mr van den Broek
said: 'I believe that the majority view in the Union is that all members
should move ahead together wherever possible - but if a smaller group wish
to push ahead towards closer integration then they should be allowed to do
so.'
In a side-swipe at Britain and Denmark, who won opt-outs in the 1991
Maastricht treaty on monetary union, Mr van den Broek said: 'A few years ago
some member states were competing for opt-outs. Now, the competition should
be for opt-ins.' Last month, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, called for an extension of majority voting, declaring that the
need for unanimity and the exercise of national vetoes could lead only to
blocking effective action.
Mr Dehaene proposed that the Commission should decide which countries met
the conditions for a multi-speed approach, with a final decision made by a
qualified majority of member states.
Despite these interventions, senior British officials remain confident that
the 1996 conference will not lead to wholesale revisions in the Maastricht
treaty and a substantial weakening of veto powers.
In the UK government's view, France remains the swing country in 1996.
Official predictions assume that a sovereignty-conscious French government
will resist German pressure to form a genuine European political union with
the Commission as the new executive government of Europe.
However, there is some concern about the possibility that Mr Delors may
enter and win next year's presidential race in France. The prospect of Mr
Delors joining Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in a reinvigorated
Franco-German axis is not viewed with relish in London.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Halifax and Leeds to form bank: Building societies' merger
will create company with assets of Pounds 90bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Halifax and the Leeds, two of the UK's largest building societies, have
agreed to merge and convert into a fully-fledged bank and a public limited
company.
The deal is a significant move in the restructuring of the personal
financial services industry. If it goes ahead, it will create the
third-largest high street bank, with about Pounds 90bn in assets and a
quarter of new mortgages.
Mr Jon Foulds, Halifax chairman, said the societies had 'the opportunity to
create a Yorkshire based world-class alternative to the clearing banks',
which would continue to focus on savings, mortgages and insurance.
In contrast to traditional society mergers, members will not benefit from a
bonus distribution of funds if the merger is approved. But they will later
get shares in the new company.
At today's stock market values, the combined organisation would have a
market capitalisation of Pounds 8bn-Pounds 9bn, which would mean shares
worth between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 on average for members.
Under the merger, the Halifax will take over the Leeds, with the 10m members
of both societies voting on the deal in spring 1995. Then, if members
approve in a second vote, the enlarged group will convert itself to a plc
with a full banking licence.
The new organisation will keep the Halifax name, chairman, chief executive
and head office. Five non-executive directors and two executive directors
from the Leeds board will join the Halifax board, and some of Leeds' product
names - such as the Liquid Gold savings account - will be retained.
At its annual general meeting this year, the Halifax said it was seeking a
merger with another society. The Leeds had been intending to merge with the
National &amp; Provincial building society but talks were called off in October
1993. It has been without a chief executive since February 1993, when Mr
Mike Blackburn left to become chief executive of the Halifax.
The deal must overcome several regulatory and legal hurdles in order to
succeed. These include a decision by the Department of Trade and Industry
about whether the merger should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The two societies have about 20 per cent of outstanding UK mortgage balances
and about 24 per cent of new mortgage business. They are no longer offering
new customers the opportunity to become members by opening savings accounts.
New investors will be offered non-voting deposit accounts.
The conversion would represent the largest single extension of share
ownership in the UK. It would be the first such move since Abbey National
converted to plc status in July 1989.
Rival financial services executives were divided yesterday about the impact
of the merger on competition. Some societies argued they would benefit more
from the removal of Leeds, the fifth-largest society, as a separate presence
than they would lose from Halifax becoming even larger. It is already almost
twice the size of the next largest, Nationwide Building Society.
Nonetheless, the deal may encourage other societies to press ahead with
mergers. And it is likely to reignite interest in coverting to plc status
and to intensify the search for cost savings.
The overlap between the 1,100 branches of the two societies has already led
to fears of job losses among their 27,000 or so staff, although the
societies said they expected job losses to found through natural wastage.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Hurd floats possibility of EU referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, floated the possibility of a referendum
on further European integration yesterday as rightwing Tory MPs claimed they
had been threatened with deselection if they vote against the EU finance
bill.
Amid an increasingly bitter battle over Monday's crucial second reading vote
on the bill, ministers said there was no prospect of a general election or a
successful rightwing challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Tory
party.
Frenzied head counting at Westminster, indicated that 18 Tory backbenchers -
just enough to block the EU finance bill - had signed a rebel motion giving
the Commons public accounts committee power to block UK contributions to the
EU budget.
And in a development certain to inflame Eurosceptic anger, Mr Hans van den
Broek, EU commissioner for external political affairs, called for a new
constitutional deal to end the UK's right to veto further integration.
Mr van den Broek said that four-fifths of the EU's population and member
states should have the right to over-ride national vetos, challenging the
36-year-old principle that treaty changes must have unanimous support. Mr
Hurd's admission that a referendum on further EU integration had not been
ruled out was seen as an attempt to defuse the European issue by suggesting
that voters may have the final say.
Mr Hurd said he was 'temperamentally opposed' to referendums, but only
parliament could decide whether to hold one. 'It is a great mistake to say
never in this world and you will see I am not saying never,' he told BBC
radio. Downing Street said the prime minister remained 'sceptical' about
referendums, but did not rule out the idea.
A pledge of tough action against EU fraud will form the centrepiece of the
government's defence of the finance bill. Potential rebels said they were
coming under intense pressure to fall into line before the vote.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said that Conservative central office
had threatened to disband her constituency party and install another
candidate if it refused to deselect her. Central office said the party's
voluntary area chairmen had simply explained the party's rules to the
constituencies.
Underlining the government's nervousness, Mr Michael Howard, the rightwing
home secretary, warned that the party needed 'unity and discipline.'
The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday cleared Mr Mohamad Fayed, the owner
of Harrods, of allegations that he tried to blackmail the prime minister by
threatening to disclose impropriety by ministers.
Mr Fayed said he was 'totally vindicated' and demanded an apology from Mr
Major. Downing Street said there was 'no question' of an apology.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Founders reject Pounds 650m sale of National Car Parks group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 650m sale of the company that owns National Car Parks collapsed
yesterday after its largest shareholders would not accept the final deal.
The sale, to Prudential Venture Managers and a consortium of venture capital
backers, would have been the largest leveraged buy-out in the UK this year.
Negotiations had dragged on for more than eight months.
It is understood that Sir Donald Gosling and Mr Ronald Hobson - the founders
and 72 per cent shareholders of National Parking Corporation (NPC) - valued
the company at almost Pounds 50m more than PruVen was ready to pay.
PruVen, part of the Prudential insurance group, is believed to have offered
about Pounds 550m cash, with a further Pounds 100m if NPC met performance
targets.
Both sides emphasised that the parting was amicable. PruVen remains NPC's
second-largest institutional shareholder.
'Nothing in the due diligence (the report into the company's finances)
suggested that the company was anything other than what we had thought it
was,' said Mr Martin Clarke, a director at PruVen. 'We were paying a full
price, they wanted a slightly fuller price, and we couldn't make the two
meet.'
PruVen's consortium included Charterhouse Development Capital, Cinven,
Electra, Montagu Private Equity, NatWest Ventures and Royal Bank Development
Capital.
NPC's shares , which are traded on a matched bargain basis, fell 100p
yesterday to 450p. They reached 630p earlier this year following
expectations that a deal could be worth up to Pounds 1bn.
NPC's two key operating companies are National Car Parks and Green Flag,
which owns National Breakdown Recovery and Home Emergency Service.
The group published net assets of Pounds 242m as at March 1994, but the car
parks are valued at cost and analysts put the asset value closer to Pounds
400m. NPC made a Pounds 50.5m pre-tax profit last year.
Sir Donald and Mr Hobson, the joint chairmen, founded the company in 1949,
buying bomb sites and using them as temporary car parks. It now runs 600.
PruVen planned to bring in Mr Bob McKenzie, former BET finance director, as
a new chief executive, but would have left the remaining management
structure intact.
The deal was to have been only 50 per cent funded by debt, an unusually low
level for a venture capital buy-out.
Sir Donald and Mr Hobson will continue to manage the group, but it is
expected that they will search for an alternative buyer at a later stage.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: The Budget and you - Scheherazade Daneshkhu
ponders what the chancellor has in store
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Life will become more expensive for most people from April because of tax
increases already scheduled from the last Budget (see left). Some
concessions have been given to the elderly, such as an increase in the
married couple's allowance for those aged 65 and over and help with fuel
bills - but there is room for more.
What can savers and investors expect when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
stands up on Tuesday? Can they expect a reprieve - or to be hit for more?
Clarke has not held out much hope of tax cuts saying these would be
premature but, with the next general election only two to three years away,
he might try to engineer some kind of 'feel-good' factor. Some of the
analysts' predictions are listed on the right. Clarke could decide to help
the long-term unemployed and working parents, perhaps by lowering National
Insurance contributions for companies giving work to the former, and tax
relief on child-care costs for the latter.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TUESDAY'S NEWS
The sugar coating
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Self assessment
More legislation on tax self-assessment, scheduled for 1996-97
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Income tax
Lower 20 per cent band likely to be widened from first Pounds 3,000 to
Pounds 3,500 or more
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal allowances
Single person's allowance of Pounds 3,445, frozen for past two years,
may be raised with inflation. Married couple's allowance for under 65s
likely to be restricted to 10 per cent from April 1996
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
National Insurance
Legislation likely to stop employers avoiding NICs by paying bonuses
in kind. NICs and income tax could be more integrated
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Saving and investment
Tessa tax-free deposit accounts begin maturing January 1996. Possible
extension to seven years or new tax-free personal equity plans (Peps)
may be capped. Optimists think rules may be simplified
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Capital gains tax/inheritance tax
Thresholds may be raised. Simplification of CGT possible
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pensions
Personal pension holders may be given flexibility about when they buy
their annuity. Possible plans to raise tax from pensions
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Venture capital
Detail expected on venture capital trusts, designed to encourage
investment in smallest start-up companies. Possible changes to make
Enterprise Investment Scheme more attractive
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Smoking and drinking
Duty on tobacco already scheduled for 3 per cent increase after
inflation but might go up by even more. Beer and wine could escape
increased duties to ease cross-Channel price differences
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cars
Road fuel duties due to rise by 5 per cent next year but could be higher
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Surprises
Housing: Hopes for good news to cheer lacklustre housing market. Needed
to balance possible moves to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to
10 per cent from April 1996
Tax relief: Possible new form of tax relief, perhaps a deduction in cost
of childcare or relief for train and bus season tickets

FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Top quality wines to savour - Jancis
Robinson goes upmarket for her seasonal wine-buying spree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last four years, with a conscientious nod to the recession, this
pre-Christmas wine buying column has concentrated on inexpensive chainstore
wines. This year things are looking up. If FT readers cannot afford to
splash out a little on a special bottle or two for the holiday season, who
can?
And when it comes to wines selling above Pounds 6 or so a bottle, the best
independent wine merchants have much more to offer than most supermarkets
and high street chains.
The most reliable guide to finding the best independent wine merchants all
over the UK is the (almost) annual Which? Wine Guide.
The 1995 edition is just out, published at Pounds 13.99 by the Consumers
Association under the editorship of Harry Eyres, one of our more fastidious
wine writers.
He chooses as independent wine merchant of the year Lea &amp; Sandeman, of
London SW10 and W8 - a slightly Sloaney firm of which I am also a great
admirer.
A good measure of an independent wine merchant is how it buys. Deduct 10
points for those who simply ring around the wholesale importers; add 15 for
those who, like Charles Lea, take the trouble to scout around the byways of
the world's wine regions in search of exclusive little trouvailles.
Actually Lea &amp; Sandeman's prowls are pretty much confined to France and
Italy. They have some clever choices from the New World but limit themselves
to two very un-Australian Australian Chardonnays.
Their strength is in the wine world's classics (of which they have a
constantly changing stock), characterful bargains from southern France,
Valdespino's connoisseur sherries, and evidence of the Italian wine
revolution that is shamefully rare in Britain.
Wine merchant of the year, so far as this year's WINE Magazine International
Challenge was concerned was, yet again, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, surely
Britain's most confidently innovative wine merchant.
This much larger outfit, run with flair by Simon Loftus, can afford many
more passions than L &amp; S - indeed the annual game with its instructive and
attractive list is to spot this year's weakness or two rather than a
particular strength.
The May list is supplemented throughout the year with a series of pamphlet
enthusiasms which have recently included Australia, Austria, Alsace and,
evidence that their approach is non-alphabetical, the Southern Rhone.
Lea &amp; Sandeman's shop prices per bottle tend to be about 10 per cent higher
than Adnams', but then premises in London tend to be rather more expensive
than in Suffolk market towns, even charming old Southwold. Mail order prices
from the two merchants (those quoted below) are much the same, with delivery
free for those spending more than 150 with L &amp; S, and for those buying at
least 24 (assorted) bottles from Adnams.
Adnams is a member of The Bunch group of wine merchants (together with John
Armit of London W11, Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1, Lay &amp; Wheeler, Laytons
of London NW1, Tanners, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire and Yapp Bros, of Mere,
Wiltshire) which is doing its best to instill confidence in the independent
wine trade.
Below are some representative examples (whites before reds in ascending
price order) of the exciting wines currently listed by these wine merchants
 -each demonstrating the sort of individuality that is all too rare on the
shelves of the chains and supermarkets.
Oddbins is the exception to this rule, continuing to offer wine drinkers
evidence that it is on the cutting edge of the wine world. Some of its best
buys this winter are therefore also included below.
But for really personal service, you could do very much worse than track
down your nearest independent wine merchant, who is probably motivated
chiefly by his or her product and a giant helping of enthusiasm.
LEA &amp; SANDEMAN, 301 Fulham Road, London SW10 (071- 376 4767) &amp; 211
Kensington Church Street, London W8 (071- 221 1982).
Domaine de Joy Cuvee Speciale 1992, Pounds 5.87. Oak-aged tangy dry white
made mainly from Manseng grapes (of Jurancon fame). Long, lively and so much
easier to drink without food than Chardonnay.
Monbazillac 1990 Domaine de l'Ancienne Cure, Pounds 8.95. Most wine
merchants worth their salt have gone scouting for a Monbazillac from this
first class sweet white vintage. This one might need a little more acid for
long term development but is just the luscious thing for drinking this
winter.
Chablis Premier Cru Beauroy 1992 Tribut-Dauvissat, Pounds 13.33. Fine,
sleek, classic Chablis with terroir in spades. Its assertive acidity should
revive jaded palates.
Cuvee Pierre Audonnet 1993 Domaine Piquemal, Pounds 4.58. A frank, glossy
Merlot-based vin de pays from Roussillon that would make a delightful house
red.
Les Dolomies Coteaux du Languedoc 1993, Pounds 5.58. Seductively scented
Syrah from the Garrigue. Full, rich and flattering.
Cabernet Sauvignon Olimpo 1992, Pounds 5.98. The bottle alone looks worth
double the price. Aromatic cold turkey red.
Domaine du Deffends Clos de la Truffiere 1990 Coteaux Varois, Pounds 7.34. A
great find. Handsome Provencal blend of concentrated Cabernet and Syrah that
should please and impress a wide range of palates. A particularly stylish
magnum (Pounds 16.95 each) would make a delicious present.
Ch Le Grand Bourdieu 1990 Graves, Pounds 7.34. Appetising, crisp, classic
Graves with lots of fruit and chew.
Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva 1990 Dei, Pounds 9.40. Lots of punch
and vigour; a good Boxing Day restorative.
Savigny les Beaune Les Lavieres 1989 Domaine Chandon de Briailles, Pounds
11.95. House wine of Moet &amp;, this soft red burgundy would make a perfect
accompaniment for turkey et al with gorgeous Pinot Noir fruit and nice,
appetising zip.
Cote-Rotie 1991 Domaine Clusel-Roch, Pounds 15.86. Top quality northern
Rhone red made by talented team whose sophisticated winemaking delivers a
plummy, rich wine that can already delight but will be better still at the
turn of the century.
Camartina 1990 Querciabella, Pounds 17.62. Sumptuous blend of Cabernet and
Sangiovese. Scented, well balanced and already approachable (although better
cellared for three or four years).
ADNAMS, The Crown, Southwold, Suffolk (0502-724222).
Pinot Blanc Rosenbourg 1992 P Blanck, Pounds 6.15. Really rather serious for
this useful, keenly-priced appellation. A good house aperitif for
connoisseurs while the rest of the household might appreciate the more
obvious charms of the Pfaffenheim 1993 Pinot Blanc at Pounds 4.95.
Dr Loosen Riesling 1992, Pounds 6.20. First-class aperitif. Dryish,
refreshing yet scented. Thresher with all their buying power charge Pounds
5.99, without delivery.
Scheurebe Kabinett Trocken 1993 Lingenfelder, Pounds 9.75. The modern face
of German wine - a dry white with lashings of flavour and concentration.
Albarino Morgadio 1992, Pounds 10.75. Galicia's finest - a fine dry white
palate sharpener from Atlantic-cooled Spain.
Le Marigny Vouvray Moelleux 1990, Pounds 14.75. Great honeyed mouthfuls for
the end of the meal without any heady or excess of alcohol or sickly lack of
acidity.
Puligny-Montrachet Clavoillon 1992 Domaine Leflaive, Pounds 25.50. A treat.
A relatively early maturing white burgundy from Puligny's best address.
Lirac, Les Queyrades 1990 Andre Mejan, Pounds 5.95. Full, powerful,
licorice-scented mouthful of southern warmth.
M Shiraz/Pinot Noir 1992 Victoria, Pounds 6.20. A blend of Rhone and
Burgundy red grape varieties overtly traditional in Australia, a more
clandestine marrage of convenience in old-fashioned burgundy, is
surprisingly successful. Slightly jammy but fruit in all the right places
and ready to drink now.
Domaine du Grand Cres 1991 Corbieres, Pounds 6.45. Wild southern French wine
made by an ex-Domaine de la Romanee-Conti perfectionist from a high,
isolated, beautiful vineyard.
Sablet 1993 Ch de Trignon, Pounds 6.75. Lively Cotes du Rhone. Villages red
that should continue to improve over the next two years but could be order
from Adnams' current Rhone offer in time for Christmas drinking.
Vacqueyras 1990 Cuvee Les Templiers, Pounds 6.95. Amazingly deep colour and
very, very deep flavours. Lots of Syrah grapes in this blend which still has
considerable life in it. Probably the best bargain of these three Rhones
from Adnams.
Dry Country Grenache 1992 Rockford, Pounds 7.20. Non-irrigated yet juicy
Barossa version of Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
Lady Langoa 1990 St Julien, Pounds 9.75. Second wine of second growth
bordeaux Ch Leoville-Barton, consistently reliable and under-priced.
Joseph Cabernet/Merlot 1992 Moda Amarone, Grilli, Pounds 12.55. South
Australia meets north east Italy in this impressively balanced red
concentrated by drying the grapes before fermentation. Vibrant, lively,
beautifully constructed.
ODDBINS
Nearly 200 shops around the country which try to offer the full range via
well-educated staff. There are also Fine Wine Shops in London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Oxford and Cambridge which sell smaller parcels of fine wines,
notably the gorgeous Moss Wood Chardonnay at Pounds 10.99.
Reuilly 1993 Aujard Mabillot, Pounds 5.99. Very convincingly fruity
Sauvignon from this close relative to Sancerre. (Buy the Menetou Salon Cuvee
Vanessa for Pounds 1 more if appropriate, or the Chilean Santa Isabel
Sauvignon 1994 for a rather fruitier style.)
Various north American Chardonnays Pounds 5.99 - Pounds 12.99 Some real
substance here, even in the Rex Hill and Sterling versions at the bottom end
of this price bracket. At the top Newton and Landmark Damaris can also offer
gloss and some prospect of further development.
St Veran 1993, Domaine des Deux Roches, Pounds 6.49. Not a Macon trying to
taste like a Cote d'or wine but an utterly satisfying rendition of this
useful appellation, ultra-ripe for enjoying this winter.
Late Harvest Botrytis Semillons 1992, Pounds 7.49 and Pounds 6.99 a half,
from McWilliams and Yalumba. Great rich sweet wines. Just the thing to make
a meal memorable. Pity that now that the EU will allow these 'stickies' in,
Australian growers have lost patience with producing them. Buy in quantity,
especially the rather more concentrated Yalumba version.
Various 1993 Alsace whites, Domaine Weinbach, Pounds 6.99 - Pounds 15.99.
These Faller wines are a dream - very rich and powerful, even the Sylvaner.
Both the Gewurztraminer Reserve and the Riesling Ste Catherine are sublime
(Pounds 10.99 and Pounds 15.99 respectively). The less expensive Sylvaner
and Pinot Blanc would make great aperitifs.
Chablis Premier Cru Montee de Tonnerre 1992 Louis Michel, Pounds 11.99.
Lively, pure, very slightly lean. Just the ticket for mornings, or evenings,
after - and a very good price.
Condrieu 1993 Cuilleron, Pounds 19.99. Not cheap but a taste thrill for most
who encounter this extremely well made old-vine version of fashionable
Viognier in its home town. Ch-Grillet lookalike bottle.
Peter Lehmann Vine Vale Shiraz 1992, Pounds 3.99. Very silly price for a
wine with this much bang. Great value for enthusiasts of Barossa's
chocolate-thick reds.
Havenscourt Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon, Pounds 4.99 each. California
is awash with well-made wine available in bulk (no-one wants to sully their
carefully cultivated winery name with cheap estate-bottled stuff). Typical
of Oddbins to create its own label to take advantage of this phenomenon.
Best value by far are these two reds, the Pinot Noir having a bit of age and
richness to it, the Cabernet being a mouthful of very frank, lively fruit.
Peter Lehmann Clancy's 1992, Pounds 6.49. A Barossa Valley blended red with
an element of sophistication.
Chateau Reynella Basket Press Cabernet/Merlot and Shiraz 1992 Pounds 6.49
each. Terrible labels but great value for extremely traditionally made wines
from McClaren Vale. A brace of exciting, old-fashioned, thoroughly
full-bodied reds.
Sterling St Dunstans Reserve 1991, Pounds 6.99. Bargain price for a
mineral-scented Cabernet blend from one of the Napa Valley's pioneer
wineries (not coincidentally owned, like Oddbins, by Seagram).
St-Joseph Vieilles Vignes 1992 Cuilleron, Pounds 10.99. Scented, full, very
sleek and modern. Ready to beguile already. Not a rough edge in sight.
Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Beaunes 1992, Jayer-Gilles Pounds 11.99. Scented
Pinot Noir fruit with good, serious concentration. Just the thing for
turkey.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Sweet and golden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a theory, in the arcane subject of matching food and wine, that a
region's own liquid produce generally goes best with its solid (edible)
matter. It seems rather tenuous to me. Whisky may be delicious with haggis
and Ribera del Duero with the pitifully short-limbed milk-fed lamb eaten in
that part of Spain, but gin with jellied eels? Bandol with bouillabaisse?
We could discuss this fascinating subject for many weeks, and certainly the
wines that go best with foie gras are in general produced in regions where
ducks and geese are never allowed to be peckish.
Because foie gras is so rich, it tends to make all but the most sumptuous
red wine taste rather thin and puny, whereas a sweet, golden liquid can seem
just the job - especially when the foie gras is served with something sweet
as it so often is.
The south-west is not just France's centre for foie gras production, but
also for her sweet wines: Sauternes most notably but also Monbazillac and,
from further into foie gras territory, moelleux (sweet) versions of Jurancon
and Pacherenc du Vic-Bihl. These last two are often easier and more
refreshing to drink young (ie in single-figure prices per bottle) and in my
experience go particularly well with foie gras. Try Adnams of Southwold,
Suffolk, Lea &amp; Sandeman of London SW10 and, of course, the determinedly
francophile Nicolas shops in London for examples of these appellations.
On the opposite side of the hexagone both foie gras and some sweet white
wine to drink with it can be found in Alsace - although it can be devilishly
difficult to tell from the label just how sweet an Alsace Vendange Tardive
or Selection de Grains Nobles actually is. Many less expensive Alsace wines
without these riper-sounding words on the label are actually made quite
sweet enough to drink with foie gras. Rolly Gassmann from Bibendum, London
NW1, Schoffitt from Oddbins and Adnams, and Faller from O W Loeb,
traditional independent merchants and now Oddbins spring to mind. For a wide
range of Alsace wines, La Vigneronne of London SW7 and Wine Rack are hard to
beat.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Foie gras feasts - Philippa
Davenport tells you all about fattened duck and goose liver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smoked salmon was first, followed by oysters, as the choice items that
greedy people bought for themselves and sent to their friends as mail-order
presents for the festive season. Now foie gras, long favoured at top tables,
is the most fashionable fare with which to celebrate the feast of Christmas.
Foie gras is a more ticklish proposition to buy than smoked salmon or
oysters because, unlike those very British foods, foie gras is foreign
territory. Valiantly, however, the Weekend FT's food and drink team agreed
to research and sample what is available to establish best buys for readers.
First, a few basic facts about foie gras. Foie gras, which simply means
fattened liver, can come from goose (oie) or duck (canard). Whether goose
makes superior foie gras to duck, or vice versa, is open to endless
argument.
Goose is rarer now, and more expensive, because these birds are more labour
intensive to raise. Experts agree generally that goose foie gras is richer
and smoother, although duck tends to be fuller-flavoured.
Foie gras may be sold raw or cooked to varying degrees. Raw and
vacuum-packed, it keeps for just two weeks and must be refrigerated.
Cooked lightly and freshly (called fresh in English, mi-cuit in French),
wrapped in foil and vacuum-packed, and kept in the refrigerator, it has a
shelf life of three to four weeks.
The next rung up the preservation ladder is known as semi-conserved in
English, demi-conserve in French. Bottled or tinned, this also must be
stored in the refrigerator, where it will keep for about four months.
Finally, there is fully-preserved foie gras - what the French call en
conserve - which is cooked at length and sterilised in jars or tins so that
it does not need refrigeration. It can be stored safely in a larder or cool
larder-cupboard and will keep for about two years.
As preserved foie gras is the only sort suitable for sending by mail order,
we restricted our comparative tasting to products in this category.
We aimed to get our supplies from the food halls of department stores,
importers prepared to sell retail as well as wholesale, and small specialist
companies.
The services offered were varied, to say the least. This soon became clear
to the Weekend FT's Anna Lambert, who organised the orders to be despatched
for our tasting.
Food halls generally seemed impersonal and expensive, geared better to
selling hampers than the single jar or tin of foie gras that more suitable
for mailing to great-uncle George.
What is more - and presumably with the flashy end of their lucrative
international clientele in mind - they seemed to concentrate on foie gras
products with truffles and other fancy trimmings rather than good, plain
foie gras entier.
Of the importers, W. G. White was wonderfully informative and helpful: alas,
its business is wholesale so it does not offer mail-order service.
Repertoire, which does, showed a willing spirit initially but inefficiency
in practice.
After four frustrating attempts to contact Cutters (none of our calls was
returned) we gave up on them.
We found that only the very small specialist companies were knowledgeable
about their products and willing and able to talk to us. They tended to be
much better at supplying orders exactly as requested, and delivering them
when they promised.
We asked for three different sorts of preserved foie gras, all 100 per cent
pure and simple.
Foie gras d'oie entier en conserve.
Entier is a key word here. Foie gras labelled like this must legally consist
of whole lobes or a large piece of liver (with a small piece permitted only
to make up weight). Samples tried were:
1. Andignac of Landes (supplied by Gourmet Products of France, Pounds 22.00
for a 180 gram jar).
2. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord, (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 19.50
a 130 gram tin).
3. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 25 per
160 gram jar).
Goose generally found less favour than duck but one taster voted the Picot
goose a close second best to the overall winner, approving its 'fine colour,
strong appetising nose and good length'.
Others enthused less, describing it, among other things, as 'somewhat
stiff','dense', 'too rich' and 'a little lacking in flavour'.
The Andignac sample pleased by virtue of its 'pink flush appearance', 'good
texture' and 'very good flavour - but not what I would expect from goose'.
It was also rated 'rather coarse', 'chewy in the mouth' and 'cloying in
aftertaste'.
The Cyprien sample, approved by some for its texture and 'mealy' flavour on
the one hand, also provoked the comment 'rather coarse, more like a brawn or
a pork terrine'.
Foie gras de canard entier en conserve.
Whole lobes once again but this time duck rather than goose livers. Samples
tried:
1. Andignac of Landes (supplied by Gourmet Products of France, Pounds 17.50
per 180 gram jar).
2. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 18 per
130 gram tin).
3. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 24.50
per 160 gram jar).
We all prefered duck foie gras to goose, and were unanimous in giving our
top vote to the Cyprien duck. The general gist of our comments here was good
clean taste, good texture, good finish, good value.
Again opinions were fairly united about the Andignac sample: 'dense
flavour', 'quite full in the mouth', 'almost sweet' and the word 'buttery'
cropped up repeatedly; while the Picot sample elicited the description
'cheesey' from almost all the tasters.
Bloc de foie gras de canard en conserve.
Bloc or loaf is a cheaper way to eat 100 per cent foie gras, a smooth blend
of foie gras trimmings that is usually, but not always, studded with little
nuggets of lobe - look for the words 'avec morceaux' on the label. Samples
tried:
1. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 12.75
per 130 gram tin).
2. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 7 per
65 gram tin).
Only two samples of bloc as Gourmet Products of France sell it fresh not
fully preserved. Results were disappointing here. 'Quite nice flavour and
good length but not special' was the most enthusiastic response that could
be mustered for the Cyprien sample.
Picot fared little better. Indeed it was described as 'meatily unsubtle,
cloying, coating the mouth disagreeably' by one of our team.
The overall winner by far, the best buy on all counts by common consent, was
the foie gras de canard entier in a tin by Auguste Cyprien from Clark
Trading. The only pity, we agreed, is that glass jars make more handsome and
impressive gifts than tins. But taste is the most important thing, and the
fact that tins are lighter and less fragile is an obvious postal advantage.
It is undeniably true that the much more perishable fresh or mi-cuit foie
gras is superior to fully preserved - the lesser heat treatment it has
undergone permits texture and flavour to retain greater delicacy.
With this in mind, Londoners may like to note that Gourmet Products of
France sells fresh whole lobes of goose at Pounds 35 and duck at Pounds 29
per 300 grams, and en bloc of duck at Pounds 16 per 250 grams. Traiteur
Pagnol also sells fresh lobes at Pounds 29 and Pounds 25 per lb for goose
and duck respectively. Remember, these products need to be kept under
refrigeration so take a cool bag when shopping. They are unsuitable for
mailing.
The greatest treat of all - as dazzlingly different as fresh alpine
strawberries just picked from the wild versus a jar of ordinary strawberry
jam - is high quality raw foie gras cooked to order.
Foie gras lightly sauteed and served hot on salads, or garnished with
quickly fried slices of apple or gently warmed grapes, makes an exquisite
fast feast for a deux occasions. The other great foie gras delicacy is a
freshly-made terrine. This has to be cooked ahead and is a spectacular party
piece.
To remind ourselves of this fact we tasted a terrine of foie gras specially
prepared for us by Gordon Ramsay, of the much-lauded Aubergine restaurant at
11 Park Walk, London SW10 (tel:071-352 3449). Silkily smooth, with a
sensuous melt-in-the-mouth texture, fine lingering flavour and a shiver of
shimmering jelly on the side, it was food for the gods.
As my colleague Nicholas Lander pointed out, when you taste something like
this, and you think of the time and ingredients that have gone into its
making, the restaurant charge of Pounds 12 per portion does not seem
exorbitant.
Aubergine does not, alas, sell its terrine of foie gras as a take-away.
However, terrine of foie gras can be cooked to order for collection from the
House of Albert Roux.
Or, if you have the time and enjoy culinary adventures, you could buy raw
foie gras and make your own terrine at home. Gourmet Products of France
sells raw duck foie gras at Pounds 40 per kilo as does House of Roux at
Pounds 18.50 per lb. A recipe for terrine of foie gras will follow next
week.

Klockner Werke, the German industrial group which shed its steel interests
last year, yesterday said it was back in profit.
The group, now centred on its car parts division and bottling plants, made a
DM5m (Dollars 3m) profit following a DM196m loss last year, according to
preliminary figures for the year to September. Final results will be
available in February. Operating profit rose to DM106m, compared with a loss
of DM324m last year, while turnover fell to DM4.1bn from DM6.1bn following
the sale of the group's steel works.
The company said it would make 'further significant improvements' next year.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean tourism promises an upturn -
Improved outlook in customer countries and marketing drive lift prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean tourism's high season, which begins in mid-December, promises to
be better than hoteliers were expecting. Consistently occupied hotel rooms
in Caribbean resorts please not only hoteliers, but also finance ministers.
Tourism brought Dollars 10bn to the region last year and Caribbean economies
have become increasingly dependent on tourism, particularly because of
uncertainty in traditional commodity markets.
Recession in the leading tourist markets, particularly in North America, was
blamed for a reduction in the growth rate of visitor arrivals. 'The economic
climate in these major markets has improved, and with it the fortunes of
Caribbean tourism,' said Mr Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean
Tourism Organi-sation.
Hoteliers are now more confident as advance bookings for the forthcoming
season are high. In addition to the improved economic outlook in North
America and Europe, the Caribbean has launched a very intensive marketing
and promotion campaign.
Initial fears that US military intervention in Haiti would adversely affect
tourism have not materialised. The region was visited by 13m stayover
visitors last year, and by 8.8m others who came on cruise ships. The
tourists spent about Dollars 10bn last year, according to the Caribbean
Tourism Organisation. This represented a slight improvement in the number of
visitors and in expenditure over 1992.
Hoteliers, government ministers and other administrators of Caribbean
tourism are, however, frequently reminded of the fickle nature of the
tourism industry. Prospects have been enhanced by currency fluctuations;
Caribbean currencies are pegged to the US dollar, and the recent weakening
of the dollar makes the region a better bargain for European visitors. For
North Americans, a European holiday becomes more expensive than one in the
Caribbean and two out of every three tourists visiting the Caribbean come
from the US.
Competition for Caribbean tourism is coming not only from other established
resort regions, but also from the increasing efforts of several US states to
offer cheaper and safer holidays as an alternative to the Caribbean
following adverse publicity about crime in some Caribbean resorts, an issue
nagging the tourism industry.
Caribbean resort countries have implemented a multi-million dollar
advertising programme to market the region as a single destination to
potential visitors from North America. Prospective visitors make little
distinction between countries.
'Regrettably, geography is not a very strong subject,' said Mr Carlyle
Dunkley, Jamaica's tourism minister. 'Many people believe you can take a
stroll from Port of Spain (Trinidad) to Port-au-Prince (Haiti), and it is
not quite so.' Despite the joint marketing of the region, there is
increasing competition among several resorts which are seeking new markets.
Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, recently warned of the
dangers of price cutting. Competing on price and price alone dilutes the
quality of the Caribbean tourism product, Sir Colin told a meeting of
tourism interests.
'Cut-price competition creates a spiral dive from which it is extremely
difficult to recover,' he said.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Vote opens way for Turkish privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's parliament approved a framework privatisation law yesterday,
opening the way to sell nearly all the country's loss-making state
companies.
Approval of the law, by 193 votes to 25, was a welcome political victory for
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, whose fractious coalition government has faced
collapse in recent weeks.
The law gives the PPA broad authority to sell more than 100 companies
without prior parliamentary approval for each sale. Proceeds will finance
infrastructure projects and fund severance payments for workers who lose
their jobs.
The Erdemir steel company and the Petrol Ofisi chain of petrol stations and
oil refineries are expected to be among the first companies to be
privatised. Officials expect to raise Dollars 4bn from privatisation next
year.
The state telephone company has a special constitutional status, so cannot
be privatised at present. However, the government will be able to license
new private telephone services.
This is the first structural reform measure parliament has approved since
Mrs Ciller in April adopted an emergency package of tax increases and
spending cuts after a balance of payments crisis. Both the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, which support her policies, had become
exasperated at the slow pace of public sector reform.
State companies control or dominate the telecommunications, airline, iron
and steel, mining, petroleum and electric power industries. Last year, they
contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars
29.72bn.
Politicians have resisted privatisation because state companies are a
valuable source of patronage. Earlier this year, Mrs Ciller tried to impose
privatisation by decree. But the SHP social democratic party, her junior
coalition partner, appealed to the constitutional court. It ruled that the
government must win parliamentary approval first. Her conservative DYP party
only won the SHP's grudging support by promising to relax Turkey's strict
security laws.
However, Mrs Ciller now faces mounting opposition from trade unions. On
Wednesday, demonstrators paralysed the city of Zonguldak, home to the Demir
Celik steel company, to protest against privatisation, which is likely to
cost 80 per cent of the com-pany's 8,700 jobs.

<TEXT>
The treaty granting legal recognition to Europol, the embryonic European
police force, has been delayed by disagreement among European Union members,
Netherlands' justice minister Winnie Sorgdrager told the Dutch parliament
yesterday. Europol was set up in February to share information between EU
police forces in their fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.
It went into action without a formal legal basis, and the treaty supporting
it was scheduled for signing next week. But questions over the treaty's
compatibility with laws in member states have put this target beyond reach,
the minister said.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Move to root out corruption in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wide-ranging proposals aimed at stemming corruption in French political life
were yesterday tabled by an all-party group of deputies in France's National
Assembly.
Among other things, the proposals would reduce the share of corporate cash
in political party coffers, submit politicians to audits of their personal
wealth and make it harder for them to hold national and local posts
simultaneously, and increase transparency and controls on the awarding of
public contracts.
It is unlikely all 18 legislative proposals in the group's 650-page report
would become law, even though representatives of almost all the assembly's
577 deputies sat in the group, chaired by Mr Philippe Seguin, assembly
president. This fact did not commit parliamentary parties to backing the
report, Mr Seguin said yesterday.
The reforms could be debated by the assembly in mid-December, he declared.
But the government is master of the parliament's agenda. Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur is reluctant to introduce new legislation on corruption,
arguing the current investigations of senior politicians and company heads
show existing anti-corruption laws are working.
To avoid being accused in next spring's presidential election of being lax
on the issue, Mr Balladur is likely to react to reforms which Mr Seguin said
were aimed at 'helping dissolve suspicion of public officials and restoring
confidence in democracy'.
The premier has already given his backing to minor amendments to audit
politicians' personal wealth and to reverse his own government's easing of
the provisions of a 1993 law governing procedures on public contract awards.
In one respect, yesterday's report goes less far than Mr Balladur, who said
he was open to a total ban on corporate contributions to political parties
for an experimental three years. The report suggests that the state could
fund more political expenses and increase tax incentives for individuals to
give more money to the party of their choice, so indirectly lessening the
weight of corporate gifts.
But one proposal would drastically change French politicians' careers by
preventing them 'accumulating mandates'. At present, of the 577 deputies, 83
are also mayors of big cities, 22 preside over departmental councils and
nine preside over regional councils. Under the proposed reform, they would
have to choose either the national or local post.

FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tax-related activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in London was inflated late in the day by a spate of very large
deals believed to represent tax-related activity ahead of the Budget.
Transport group NFC gained a penny at 172p in turnover of 22m. Volume in
Reuters was boosted by a block of 8.9m shares placed at 470p one minute
before the close of trading. The underlying shares closed 3 up at 470p.
Tightly traded Smith &amp; Nephew rose 4 to 151p, one of the best Footsie
performances. Shortly before the close, large blocks of shares were placed,
sending turnover to 6.7m.
Engineering shares had a mostly negative day, overshadowed by profit-taking
and mixed results. Precious metals group Johnson Matthey was a clear victim
of the former, closing 7 lower at 550p, having risen to 561p immediately
after strong interims.
The results were ahead of analysts' expectations and so was the 4.2p interim
dividend. BZW upgraded its full-year profits estimate, adding an extra
Pounds 5m at Pounds 95m, where the propective p/e of 16.5 is what the
investment bankers feel is a 'fully justified' 20 per cent premium to the
market.
Energy engineer Babcock International, which has been bumping along within a
whisker of its low for the year all this week, barely blinked when the
interim results weighed in woefully short of brokers' estimates, closing
marginally easier at 26 1/2 p in turnover of less than 1m shares.
Analysts have been progressively lowering their sights on Babcock's earnings
since late summer and they were again hard at it yesterday. BZW reduced its
full-year estimate from Pounds 19m to Pounds 13m - a figure which compares
starkly with the Pounds 56m Babcock notched up in 1991-92.
A boardroom shake-up and a warning about full-year losses pushed precision
engineer J. Billam down to 115p at one point during the day, before ending a
net 19 off at 123p.
High street retailer WH Smith fell 14 1/2 to 447 1/2 p after Cazenove, the
company's broker, cut current year profits estimates. The house was said to
have reduced profits expectations by Pounds 7m to Pounds 138m and to have
cited a lower than anticipated pension credit and worries about trading
during the upcoming Christmas trading season.
Those concerns about Christmas period trading were also heard around
Storehouse, which pleased the market with its full-year results. Traders
also said the figures had already been discounted and the stock ended the
day 5 lower at 214p.
Sears managed to resist the poor sentiment surrounding Christmas trading and
the shares hardened 3 to 106 1/2 p amid heavy trading of 13m.
The reduction of profits estimates by several brokers hit shares in Allied
Domecq after the group posted disappointing interim figures.
Profits rose from Pounds 266m to Pounds 310m but fell short of market
expectations, and analysts were particularly disappointed by what one called
the 'flat trading performance'.
It was the second time this week that brokers had cut profits forecasts and
the shares tumbled 19 to 555 1/2 p in heavy trade of 6.6m. BZW reduced its
12 months' forecast by Pounds 8m to Pounds 714m, while NatWest Securities
cut by Pounds 28m to arrive at the same figure of Pounds 714m.
The poor sentiment in Allied Domecq was said to have spread to several other
stocks in the sector, Bass losing 5 at 522p and Whitbread declining 8 1/2 to
538 1/2 p.
BT firmed 3 1/2 to 372 1/2 p, helped by an upbeat presentation to analysts
by the group's Cellnet mobile phone joint venture. Good increases in usage
was the main thrust of Cellnet's message.
Manchester United's virtual elimination from the European Champions Cup
competition saw the shares slide 14 to 625p.
News that the parent of the Telegraph had been buying back shares in the
newspaper helped the stock rise 8 to 354p.

FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBoS concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perception that the insurance arm of Royal Bank of Scotland was not a
one-way bet sent a shiver through the Scottish clearer's shares ahead of the
bank's preliminary figures, expected next Thursday.
However, some analysts claimed that their rivals had 'over-egged' their
expectations for Direct Line's growth prospects, and the sell-off in RBoS,
which fell 17 1/2 to 425p, was merely the reflection of a return to reality.
The insurance team at Smith New Court said that although Direct Line was
still a 'high growth company that benefits from higher margins than anyone
else', banking specialists might not have appreciated that the pressures on
private car and household insurance were not going to go away.
NatWest Securities cut its forecast for the year to September 1995 by Pounds
20m to Pounds 140m and SG Warburg was said to be arguing that the company
would stop growing by 1996.
Nevertheless, broker Credit Lyonnais Laing is confident that the Scottish
clearer will achieve profits of Pounds 551m and a dividend of 13.5p - top of
the range estimates - and was using yesterday's weakness as a buying
opportunity. The two-way pull on the stock prompted exceptionally high
turnover of 7.6m shares

FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Budget fears hit utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the regional electricity companies (recs) fell sharply after the
Labour party's shadow chancellor reiterated plans for a tax on windfall
gains arising from the sale of the National Grid.
Sentiment was further hit by speculation that the government might actually
introduce a watered down version of the tax in the Budget, although
political jitters ahead of next Monday's crucial vote in the House of
Commons on UK contributions to the EU budget were said to have been a more
important factor.
However, strategists also pointed out that part of the slide could be
attributed to profit-taking after the recent strong performance of the
sector. One trader simply said he was 'squaring the books' in calling the
sector lower.
The day's main casualties included East Midlands, down 27 at 734p, Midlands,
which also retreated 27, to 740p, South Wales, 34 lighter at 760p, Southern,
21 weaker at 765p, and South West, which surrendered 31 at 732p.
Mr Doug Falconer at Yamaichi said that as a result of the statement from
Labour 'it is extremely likely electricity companies will feel under
pressure to announce special dividends sooner rather than later'. He remains
positive on the sector, with Southern among his favoured stocks.

FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Wall Street out of action for Thanksgiving, stock index futures drifted
for most of the session, moving modestly higher in low trading volume,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
Activity dwindled to nominal levels, with just 7,015 contracts contrasting
starkly with the near 20,000 notched up in the previous session following
Tuesday's big sell-off on Wall Street.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,034 at the close of pit trading,
clawing back nine points of the 115 lost in the previous three days.
There was a premium to the cash market of around 10 points through most of
the session, but in the final hour this shaded dramatically and at the
official 4.10pm close December had swung to a two-point discount, or nine
points under fair value.
Traders were mostly disappointed by the day's performance. Many had expected
the future to show more determined recovery given Wall Street's relatively
neutral close on Wednesday.
Traded options also paused for breath after the previous day's excitement
when a major securities house pushed through a record 20,000 January puts.
Total volume was 26,574 lots, down from 80,984 on Wednesday. FT-SE and Euro
FT-SE trading accounted for just over 11,000 lots. Eastern Electricity was
the busiest stock option, with 1,600 contracts dealt.

FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices rally in subdued trading
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The big sell-off in the UK equity market was halted yesterday after Wall
Street's late recovery overnight. But a promising rally in London was
showing ominous signs of running out of steam as the day wore on.
Dragging on sentiment was an underlying worry about Wall Street and the
chances of renewed weakness there, plus nagging concerns about Monday's EU
vote in the House of Commons which has been turned into a government
resignation question by the prime minister.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which had fallen 103.5 since the start of the week,
moved ahead early in the session before slipping back to close a net 9.1 up
at 3,036.6. The second liners, on the other hand, continued to suffer, with
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finally 7.6 lower at 3,481.2, extending the fall
over the past four sessions to 94.4, or 2.6 per cent.
The absence of any US influences - the US was closed for the Thanksgiving
Day holiday - was welcomed by traders throughout Europe, who said markets
needed time to assess the big shift in market sentiment following this
week's steep slide on Wall Street.
There were renewed worries in the City with the not unexpected news that the
Office of Fair Trading decided that Stock Exchange rules allowing
marketmakers to delay the reporting of above-average sized trades for 90
minutes, and in some cases for up to five trading days, 'restricted or
distorted competition to a significant extent'.
'The OFT report spells trouble for the existing system,' said one dealer.
'The process of change in the way we deal does seem to be speeding up,' he
added.
Wall Street's recovery from an early 37-point decline to close only three
points off, and the continued strength of treasury bonds, promoted an early
mark-up for leading UK stocks. The FT-SE 100 opened some 10 points higher
and gradually improved to a day's peak of 3,044.7, up 17.2, in mid-morning.
Although there was no real selling pressure in London, buying interest
simply faded away, with most marketmakers happy to close their books early.
Turnover was a subdued 576.9m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing
around 57 per cent of the total. Customer business on Wednesday, when the
market was in freefall, was revealed as reaching Pounds 1.5bn.
Marketmakers remained extremely cautious about short-term trends in the
market, with some expressing increasing concern that the recent pressures on
Wall Street, stemming from worries about the impact of recent US interest
rate increases on corporate profits, could rebuild when US markets reopen
today, albeit for a truncated session.
'If Wall Street begins to wilt, then we are in trouble again,' said a senior
trader in London. 'The feeling is that we will be testing 3,000 on the FT-SE
100 and possibly 2,980 in short order.'
Electricity and water stocks caught the eye as the Labour party threatened
windfall profits taxation in its Opposition Budget; and there was a hint
that the chancellor may have prepared a lesser version of the same for
Tuesday's Budget.
The day's big company news items failed to trigger much enthusiasm. Allied
Domecq was a sharp faller after releasing slightly disappointing interims,
as was Storehousem where the performance of the Mothercare division was said
to have disappointed analysts.
Preliminary results from the hugely successly Direct Line telephone
insurance company were more than doubled, but they disappointed some of the
market's super-optimists. Consequently, Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct
Line's parent, attracted keen selling ahead of its preliminary figures
scheduled for Thursday; dealers still expect a near 20 per cent increase in
the bank's dividend.

Toronto responded to bargain hunting by Canadian investors and ended solidly

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rallies following weakness in
bank sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices in Brazil staged a rally yesterday after a traumatic few days'
trading which briefly saw the main Bovespa index down 12 per cent from a
week ago.
By yesterday's close the Bovespa had regained 4.1 per cent at 45,734,
compared to its Monday opening of 47,124.
Analysts said the market was worried by domestic factors, as well as the
sell-off on global markets. The liquidation early in the week of two small
banks and a higher than expected inflation figure for November both pointed
to the fragility of the government's anti-inflation plan and the new Real
currency.
Analysts are also waiting for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the
president-elect, to announce his plans for privatisation and economic
reforms to underpin the Real. Although the stock market is expected to do
well under Mr Cardoso's presidency, uncertainty ahead of his January 1
inauguration has led to profit-taking.
Since his election, when the Bovespa index hit 54,840, the market has fallen
some 15 per cent. Even so, the index is still 21 per cent up since the
Real's introduction on July 1. Among the constituents of the IFC's emerging
markets index, Brazil has shown by far the best performance in dollar terms
on the year to date, with a gain of more than 80 per cent.
Mr Cardoso is not expected to make any significant announcements until the
middle of next month. Markets may, therefore, remain nervous over the next
few weeks, especially since some smaller banks are still rumoured to face
liquidity problems.
The new currency and a liquidity squeeze have seriously pressured some
smaller financial institutions, and the central bank has liquidated seven
banks since the Real's launch. Although these banks are small, the market is
worried about the potential knock-on effect to bigger institutions,
especially the financially troubled state banking sector.
A central bank announcement, which said that it was slightly relaxing
liquidity to support smaller banks, helped to lift sentiment yesterday. Mr
Pedro Malan, the bank governor, also told senators that the financial
markets were exaggerating the scale of the banking problems. However, at
least five more small banks are thought to be experiencing liquidity
problems or seeking help from the central bank.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: De Beers advances 3% as Namibia takes
stake in diamond operations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities finished firmer, although trade was cautious in the absence of a
lead from the US. Brokers said most of the overseas buying had come from the
UK.
The overall index rose 67.4 to 5,866.8 after a 109-point decline on
Wednesday; industrials put on 83 at 6,949.9; and the golds index was 20.4
higher at 2,067.7 after a static afternoon performance.
De Beers advanced R2.75 to R95.75 as the group announced that the Namibian
government had taken a 50 per cent stake in its diamond mining operations
there.
Anglos was unchanged at R234 and Minorco moved ahead R1.65 to R98.15. SAB
recovered some of Wednesday's loss, improving R2 to R99, while Barlows
appreciated R1 to R34.25.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US worries drive Nikkei
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting concern over US share prices prompted arbitrage unwinding and
profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost 1.4 per cent in spite of
active buying by public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
After ranging between 18,877.08 and 18,688.74, the index ended 261.75 off at
18,701.24, its lowest since a 18,648.36 close on January 25.
Overseas investors took profits, while individuals who had bought shares on
margin were forced to liquidate stock. A fall in futures prices prompted
arbitrage-linked selling. The decline slowed in the afternoon, when share
prices managed to recoup some of their loss thanks to buying by corporations
and financial institutions, including public funds.
However, selling continued throughout the day, and the Nikkei finally closed
lower. More than 200 stocks hit new lows for the year, and some traders
expect the next tech-nical support line to be around 17,600.
The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 18.76 or 1.3 per cent
to 1,484.16, the lowest since January 7. The index fell through the 1,500
level for the first time since January 24. The Nikkei 300 dipped 3.15 to
272.67. Declines overwhelmed rises by 982 to 93, with 103 issues unchanged.
But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.32 to 1,220.79.
All sectors declined, with the retail group hit the most with a drop of 1.98
per cent, and warehousing falling 1.84 per cent.
Steels were traded actively. Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day,
slipped Y2 to Y375, while Kawasaki Steel softened Y2 to Y410. Shipbuilders
were also weak, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries down Y12 to Y727.
Sony receded Y80 to a new low for the year of Y5,030, posting its fourth
consecutive retreat. Other high-technology stocks were also weak, with
Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y30 to Y1,490 and Hitachi off Y18 at
Y940.
Privatised companies were down sharply. Japan Tobacco relinquished Y18,000
at Y965,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y14,000 to Y829,000.
Financials were down. Banks, which reported poor interim earnings yesterday,
declined. Fuji Bank fell Y40 to Y1,900 and Sumitomo Bank lost Y50 at Y1,670.
Brokers were also lower, on fears of poor earnings due to the weak stock
market. Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y1,890 and Nikko Securities dipped Y20
to Y1,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 313.97 to 20,789.81 in volume of 31.7m
shares.
Roundup
The region's markets recovered from Wednesday's losses, although sentiment
remained nervous.
HONG KONG made a concerted early attempt to move higher, after the sharp
losses of the previous two sessions, but gains were subsequently reduced by
profit-taking and futures-related selling. The Hang Seng index, which
rallied 2 per cent to a peak of 8,747.86, finished 71.83 ahead on the day at
8,647.86.
Turnover came to a provisional HKDollars 4.38bn, compared with a revised
HKDollars 6.08bn on Wednesday.
Analysts noted that index futures remained at a discount to the cash market
throughout the day, helping to drag it down during the afternoon.
Shui Hing topped the net gainers, rising 30 per cent to HKDollars 13.05 in
response to higher profits. Television Broadcasts added HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 31, while Swire Pacific 'A' rose HKDollars 2.95 to HKDollars
51.75.
SINGAPORE was helped ahead by bargain hunting in blue chips, although
dealers noted that a bearish mood still prevailed. European and Hong Kong
funds were said to be buyers, with US funds still net sellers.
The Straits Times Industrial index ended 18.59 stronger at 2,236.40, but was
off a high of 2,244.64.
KUALA LUMPUR also saw late buying of index stocks, taking the composite
index 5.74 higher to 1,007.54.
Several foreign funds were said to be switching out of equities and into the
money market, however, and the rebalancing of funds' portfolios would
continue to dampen the index in the days ahead.
SYDNEY closed higher on bargain hunting, with the All Ordinaries index
moving forward 28.6 to 1,885.7 to finish just off its high for the day of
1,886.6. Turnover amounted to ADollars 502m.
Brokers said the cash market was led forward by strength in futures: the
December futures contract advanced 35 to 1,870.
The banks sector firmed following higher than expected profits from ANZ
earlier in the week. ANZ shares climbed 18 cents yesterday to ADollars 3.93.
NAB put on 18 cents at ADollars 10.72 and Westpac strengthened 16 cents to
ADollars 4.28.
TAIPEI was unable to maintain its advance as profit-taking in textiles and
papers pushed the market lower. The weighted index dipped 31.46 or 0.5 per
cent to 6,340.02. Turnover expanded to TDollars 47bn from TDollars 39.4bn.
Among textiles, Shinkong retreated 40 cents to TDollars 31.80, but Hualon
outperformed the market with a rise of 60 cents to TDollars 23.30.
In spite of speculation that the government might support the stock market
before the December 3 elections, brokers believed that equities would
consolidate around the 6,400 level.
MANILA was slightly stronger on local buying, the composite index firming
4.18 to 2,730.47. Turnover improved to 2.17bn pesos from 1.93bn pesos.
The property sector led the advance, the sub-index adding 1.44 at 104.92,
while the commercial and industrial group receded 4.06 to 4,046.30.
BANGKOK settled at the session's high after bargain hunting accelerated in
the afternoon.
The SET index put on 24.44 or 1.83 per cent at 1,357.29 in turnover of
Bt6.53bn.
Local investors were seen buying banking, property and communication stocks,
especially in the afternoon period, while foreign managers concentrated on
blue chips.
TelecomAsia appreciated Bt5 to Bt80.50, while Bangkok Bank moved up Bt3 to
Bt192 and Bangkok Land added Bt4.50 at Bt57.50.
SEOUL continued to fall for a sixth consecutive day, in spite of some late
institutional buying of primary blue chips. The composite index declined
10.81 to 1,085.16.
Brokers commented that the continued consolidation of blue chips and concern
about a liquidity squeeze had taken their toll on the market. The central
bank soaked up Won3,500bn on Wednesday by issuing repos.
Profit-taking by foreign investors ahead of the lifting of the foreign stock
ownership ceiling next month also put pressure on the market.
In spite of the broadly based falls, some shares with good corporate
earnings prospects continued to attract investors. Sanung Up Securities went
limit up, advancing Won1,000 to Won26,800.
BOMBAY rose towards the close on heavy buying by local mutual funds and on
short-covering by investors on the last day of the account.
The BSE-30 index closed 52.72 higher at 4,075.39 after funds and financial
institutions picked up issues in the specified shares group. Foreign funds,
which were net sellers on Wednesday, were inactive.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strategists bearish as bourses
stage recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses recovered yesterday, but strategists were not encouraging, writes
Our Markets Staff. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura raised the spectre of US
mutual fund redemptions and forecast further significant downside distress.
FRANKFURT extended Wednesday afternoon's gentle recovery, the Dax index
rising 22.66 to 2,055.97 on the session, and by an Ibis-indicated 18.74 to
2,058.79 in the post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM5.1bn. The talk was of short-covering: above
average gains by the end of the afternoon, for Deutsche Bank, Hoechst in
chemicals and one or two engineers, were registered mainly by the shares
worst hit during the falls of the previous two days.
One of the main contrasts during the session was a DM7.10 gain to DM309.70
for BASF, on nine-month figures far better than expected; Henkel, at the
less cyclical end of the chemicals sector, produced a progress report in
line with expectations, was totally outfaced by the BASF performance, and
fell DM6 to DM576.
Other fallers included Metallgesellschaft, returning from suspension to an
intraday low of DM95, and a post-bourse close DM31 lower at DM111.
Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, was still not
attracted to the metals trader. Its planned capital reduction, he said,
meant an effective price for the shares of DM220, on which the company might
be capable of earning DM10 a share at peak.
MILAN struggled to keep pace with political developments, the Comit index
rising 3.01 to 626.65 in a technical rebound after the 3.9 per cent slide
during the previous two sessions. The mood remained tense, and trading was
said to be exceptionally thin.
Among the day's best gainers was RAS, L285 higher at L15,073 amid arbitrage
between the ordinaries and rights.
Fininvest's Standa rose L800 to L35,000, but in very thin volume of just
1,500 shares, and Mondadori was L30 higher at L13,830 after Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, said he would sell his Fininvest companies.
AMSTERDAM regained Wednesday's losses, and saw a rise in the AEX index of
4.81 or 1.2 per cent to 406.81.
ING helped the market as the banking and insurance group turned in better
than expected third quarter figures and the shares rose Fl 1.80 or 2.3 per
cent to Fl 80.00.
Philips did even better on the day as some US funds returned as buyers,
lifting the shares Fl 1.70 or 3.4 per cent to Fl 52.30. Analysts noted that
the shares had been oversold following third quarter results earlier this
month which were seen as being at the high end of forecasts.
PARIS greeted the first day of the December account with a rise of 2.2 per
cent, the CAC-40 index
gaining 41.59 to 1,934.68 in turnover estimated at FFr3.6bn.
During the October account the market rose 2.7 per cent, only the third time
that it had risen during 1994.
While activity was generally muted a few issues stood out, most notably
Eurotunnel, which climbed 6.5 per cent to FFr21.95, as some investors took
the view that recent weakness had been overdone.
Alcatel Alsthom, another stock which has suffered heavy falls in recent
weeks, added to Wednesday's gain with a rise of FFr20.60 to FFr440.20.
Danone, which said that it had bought a majority stake in a leading
Argentine biscuit manufacturer, rose FFr8 to FFr774.
ZURICH's mood was improved by stronger bonds and the stabilisation of the
dollar, and the SMI index rose 22.5 to 2,568.6.
UBS bearers fell another SFr7 to SFr1,118, after a low of SFr1,108, in
further reaction to Tuesday's vote for a unitary share. The registered stock
was down SFr4 to SFr248. By contrast, SBC and CS Holding bearers both gained
SFr10, to SFr362 and SFr546 respectively, continuing to benefit from
switching out of UBS.
Von Roll bearers fell SFr235 to SFr190 after being suspended from trading on
Wednesday when the company announced a restructuring programme which
included a 90 per cent capital cut. The steel and engineering group's losses
ballooned last year to SFr441m.
STOCKHOLM recovered 1.6 per cent, helped by a good nine-month package from
the forestry products group, MoDo.
The Affarsvarlden General index closed 23.60 higher at 1,499.00. MoDo
increased its profits forecast for 1994, and said it intended to simplify
its share structure. Its B shares jumped SKr16 to SKr349. Trygg-Hansa, the
insurer, saw its B shares gain SKr5.50 to SKr75.50 on a bullish newspaper
article.
TEL AVIV offered only a token recovery, the Mishtanim index rising 1.29 to
166.24. The blue chip index, by Wednesday, had dropped 31 per cent this
year. At a conference in London yesterday fund managers urged the country to
broaden its shareholder base, noting that just 1 per cent of equity was
currently held by foreigners.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Uncertain outlook for Oslo
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norwegian share prices face a volatile period after next Monday's referendum
on membership of the European Union, say analysts, irrespective of the
outcome of the vote.
'The most unsettling outcome of the referendum will not be rejection of
membership, but a 'yes' win so slim as to put in doubt the process of
ratification,' says Enskilda Corporate in London.
The official outcome will be known by Tuesday morning, and the Storting, or
parliament, will meet on Wednesday to set the agenda for a debate and the
subsequent ratification vote which could take place one or two weeks later.
Enskilda says that extreme political uncertainty is likely to follow a 'yes'
vote, which would result in rapidly increasing volatility in the stock
market. Prices would be likely to fall even more than if there were a 'no'
vote, says the broker, which expects the market to test its all-time high
within two or three months of the issue being resolved, irrespective of the
outcome.
In the event that voters approve EU membership, ratification by the Storting
needs a 75 per cent majority. But the main opposition, the anti-EU Centre
and Socialist Left parties, have threatened to block ratification if they
consider that a 'yes' majority is not large enough to be representative of
the whole country.
Oslo's all-share index reached an historic peak of 688.23 on February 4.
Since then share prices have been unstable and are currently around 11 per
cent below their record, largely due to interest rates which have risen
strongly since August in response to inflationary fears over consumer
spending and the weaker krone against the Ecu.
Yesterday the all-share rose 6.78 to 603.07 in relatively thin trade. The US
investment house, Goldman Sachs, believes that the market could rise 15 to
20 per cent over the next 12 months in the event of a 'no' vote. If
membership were approved, however, the investment bank reckons that the
market could climb between 20 to 25 per cent, based on a favourable macro
outlook, strong earnings growth prospects and the scope for sustained
profitability and competitiveness in the export industry.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Markets Report: UK political woes cause sterling to weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling came under some pressure on the foreign exchanges yesterday amid
talk of the government resigning if it were defeated next week in
legislation over Europe, writes Philip Gawith.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed that he would ask the Queen to
dissolve parliament if the government lost a vote on the European Union
budget.
The pound finished half a pfennig lower in London, at DM2.4339, from
DM2.4394. Against the dollar, it closed at Dollars 1.5621 from Dollars
1.5701.
Although sterling was the issue on the minds of traders, the level of market
activity was low. With the US market closed for Thanksgiving, many investors
took to the sidelines. 'People do not want to do anything until we get full
liquidity back on Monday,' commented Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior
international economist at UBS in London. For this reason, trading is
expected to be quiet again today.
Elsewhere, the lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L1,034, but
sentiment remained nervous amid ongoing uncertainty about the political
longevity of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his government.
With Wall Street closed, there was little impetus for the dollar, which
traded sideways to finish at DM1.5582, from DM1.5537, and Y98.435 from
Y98.335.
With little market activity to comment on, it was no surprise that analysts
resorted to outdoing each other with Thanksgiving metaphors. Thus Swiss Bank
advised its clients: 'Better give some of that turkey to the dollar as it is
going to need every ounce of strength to stay at current levels for the
remainder of this year.'
In fact, the dollar has been quite well supported in recent days, bolstered
by the good performance of US treasuries, and lingering speculation about
the possibility of a German rate cut.
Yesterday, however, was not the day for lower interest rates. The Bundesbank
council wasted little time in deciding to leave interest rates unchanged -
the repo rate at 4.85 per cent, the discount rate at 4.5 per cent and the
Lombard rate at 6 per cent.
There had been little expectation of a move in official rates, but some
speculation about a return to a variable rate repo. Mr Julian Jessop,
international economist at Midland Global Markets, said one reason why the
Bundesbank avoided this route was that the objective would be to let the
repo rate fall ahead of a cut in the discount rate.
At the end of the month, however, when banks need to meet reserve
requirements, there is a risk of the repo rate being bid up by an accident
of liquidity.
Also, 'the Bundesbank would only ease rates if it were confident that the
bond market would benefit', said Mr Jessop. Given continuing uncertainty
about fiscal policy and next year's pay rises, he said any sign of weakness
would not be well received.
The next few days are potentially turbulent ones for sterling. Monday sees
the crucial vote on EU contributions, Tuesday is Budget day and Wednesday is
the deadline for any challenge this year to Prime Minister John Major as
party leader.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in London,
commented: 'The weakness of sterling is limited at current levels. Once the
Wednesday deadline is out of the way, sterling will have a firm foundation
for some future strength.'
Mr Persaud said this consisted of the unusual nature of the UK economic
recovery: very low core inflation, combined with a pre-emptive rise in
interest rates; and strong economic growth, alongside an improving current
account.
In spite of short term difficulties over the EU bill, Mr Persaud said it was
arguable that political risk in the UK had actually fallen. 'Even though
there is a significant chance of this government being defeated at the next
election, the opposition does not appear to be offering a very different
stance in terms of monetary or fiscal policy.'
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 100m of assistance
at established rates, and Pounds 330m of late support, after forecasting a
Pounds 650m shortage.
Overnight money traded between 4 3/4 and 7 per cent. Three-month LIBOR eased
to 6 per cent from 6 1/16 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers and Namibia reach
accord on diamond operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MURRAY and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond business,
yesterday secured its position in Namibia for the next 25 years - or until
the diamonds run out - by effectively handing over to the government there
50 per cent of its subsidiary, CDM.
The company will be reconstituted as Namdeb Diamond Corporation in which De
Beers and the Namibian government will each own 50 per cent. The government
will not be putting any capital into the new organisation.
Mr Sam Nujoma, Namibia's president, said yesterday that his country would,
via tax and dividends, collect additional revenue from the country's diamond
operations. For the present financial year Namibia has budgeted to collect
USDollars 56m in taxes and duties from these operations, based on depressed
1993 earnings.
Nevertheless, the signs are that De Beers is pleased with the deal,
completed after two years of tough negotiations and similar to its
arrangement with the Botswana government.
The accord signed in Windhoek gives De Beers:
The assurance that it will be able to continue to exploit its existing on
and off-shore assets in the country and that its renewable prospecting
licences will protected;
A guarantee that all of Namdeb's output will be marketed through De Beers'
London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of
world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds;
Retained control of De Beers Marine, the company that provides the
technology and equipment for off-shore diamond mining. Debmarine, which last
year, in terms of carats, accounted for about one quarter of the diamonds
CDM produced, will have only a contractual relationship with Namdeb.
Also, CDM's part-interest in the Navachab gold mine, near Karibib, will be
retained by De Beers under the accord.
Revenues from diamonds account for 11 per cent of Namibia's gross domestic
product and 34 per cent of its export earnings.
Mr Nujoma said yesterday: 'No longer will Namibia's diamond industry lurk in
the darkness of suspicion and strike; we are now forging an equal
partnership subject to the disciplines of both public scrutiny and the
private market.'
CDM, which moves huge tonnages of beach sands to find most of its diamonds,
is by no means De Beers' largest producer. Its output, down from 1.5m carats
in 1992 to 1.1m last year, is overshadowed by Botswana's 14.7m carats, down
from nearly 16m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond market undermined by
Russians says De Beers chief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia continued to 'undermine the delicate equilibrium and confidence
necessary for the diamond industry,' said Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De
Beers' chairman, last night. 'Competing interests (in Russia) have not
adhered to the necessary disciplines and have been leaking diamonds on to
the open market in contravention of the contracts with the Central Selling
Organisation,' he complained. This placed Russia 'in the role of competitor
with the other diamond producers'. But De Beers had dealt with similar
problems in the past 60 years 'and on each occasion the CSO and the industry
have emerged stronger than before'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices at auctions this week were generally firm, and wool was in
sufficiently good demand for clearances to the trade to be good. There was
no clear rise in the market, however, and without this incentive business is
very quiet. The usual pattern is of better business in November, but this
month has been quiet throughout Europe. Order books were filled quite far
ahead two or three months ago, also unusually timed, so there is no special
anxiety about activity at present.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Steichen backs 'mini-CAP' for
eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rene Steichen, the European Union's agriculture commissioner, set the
scene yesterday for a heated debate on the future of the common agricultural
policy when he endorsed a 'mini-CAP' to help eastern European farm
industries.
He told a conference that he favoured extending some farm price support
mechanisms to countries in eastern Europe to revive their agricultural
sectors and enable them to join the EU.
But Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said that such a plan
'would be flying in the face of reality'. He said it would be unwise to
encourage eastern European countries to take decisions based on the fact
that the EU's pricing policy would eventually be extended to them.
Mr Steichen said that by fixing price supports at fairly low levels, a
so-called 'mini-CAP' for eastern Europe could be accommodated within the
EU's current farm budget guidelines. This could involve fixing support
prices at Dollars 5 a tonne above world rates - lower than EU internal
prices.
Speaking at a conference organised by Reading University's Centre for
Agricultural Strategy, Mr Steichen said that price supports would allow farm
industries in eastern Europe to converge with those in the EU over the next
10 years.
'Without a certain price stabilisation, there is no certainty that it would
be possible to create a stable environment allowing farmers to plan for the
long term or to encourage them to invest and produce for the market,' he
said.
Mr Steichen does not believe the EU will ever find the political will to
abandon the CAP in order to enlarge to the east. But he suggested that there
could be a progressive lowering of internal EU price support over the next
decade as EU farms become more efficient and increase in size. This would
allow convergence between east and west within the framework of the CAP.
However, his suggestions are unlikely to satisfy some of the CAP's harsher
critics. Even within the commission there are differing views over the
evolution of agricultural policy in a larger union.
Mr Waldegrave called for a 'root and branch' reform of the CAP to make it
possible to extend a slimmer version of the current policy to eastern
Europe.
'We need to establish the right framework for a CAP which would be
appropriate to the needs of an enlarged EU. The pressures are compelling.
And the status quo is not an option,' he said.
Mr Steichen said that a 'mini CAP' for eastern Europe would not cost much
more than Ecu700m. This could be funded by the existing Phare programme,
which channels around Ecu200m a year in aid programmes to eastern Europe. It
could also be met from money saved on the current Ecu36bn farm budget, which
Mr Steichen said will be underspent by around Ecu3.6bn this year.
'If we pay for the whole plan, the EU would have to increase its aid, but I
can imagine a joint venture with these countries with a lowering of our
support and a raising of theirs,' he said.
He implied that cost objections were short-sighted: 'If we want to have
peace in the East, it has to cost us something'. Mr Waldegrave agreed that
if price support for eastern Europe could be met without additional
spending, it might be possible to agree it, but he said it would be
extremely difficult to justify any increase in spending in coming years.
Mr Waldegrave said there would be extreme pressures for reforming the CAP
again over the next five to 10 years. 'It is likely the current MacSharry
reforms won't automatically run into the buffers in the next 18 months.' But
he said mighty pressures for reform would be building in 1996.
Mr Steichen also wants the EU to advise eastern European countries on
setting up land banks in order to establish a proper market for farmland as
a way of modernising their agriculture industries.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans defend EU banana
regime against US criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean banana producers have told the US trade representative that there
is no merit in claims from US producers that the European Union's banana
import regime discriminates against US companies and represents unfair trade
practices.
Responding to charges from Chiquita Brands International, which produces
banana in Latin America, and the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association, the
Caribbean producers said that, contrary to the claims, shipments by Latin
American countries and US companies in that region had been increasing.
The charge of discrimination was filed under Section 301 of the US trade
act, and was supported by claims that the EU's import regime, implemented in
July 1993, discriminated against fruit from Latin America.
The import regime gives special access to exporters in the African,
Caribbean and Pacific group, comprising about 70 former European colonies,
which has a trade treaty with the EU.
'The message we are sending to the US trade representative in reply to its
request for a response to the charges, is that there is no merit in the
claims made by the US-owned banana companies,' said Mr Owen Arthur, prime
minister of Barbados, and chairman of the Caribbean Community (Caricom).
In what officials described as a 'detailed' reply to the request of the US
Trade Representative, Caricom dismissed the claims of the Hawaiian Banana
Industry Association, saying the Hawaiians did not produce enough bananas to
satisfy their own market, and did not export any fruit.
The community said also that Chiquita Brands and other producers in Latin
America had been enjoying growth in the volume of their exports over the
past two years, and were unaffected by the EU regime. 'We have only to look
at the situation in Ecuador, which will this year export over 3m tonnes of
bananas - a record for this country,' said a St Lucian government official.
The intervention of the US trade representative in the banana dispute
follows months of almost unrelenting attacks on the EU regime by several
Latin American governments and by Germany. Caribbean banana exporters claim
that a loss of preferences will destroy many island economies, mainly those
in the four Windward islands - Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent.
'The Caribbean producers supply 5 per cent of the world banana market and
for this the US government risks destroying the democracies of small
Caribbean states,' said Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary general of Caricom.
Chiquita's sales in 1992 were two and a half times the cumulative gross
domestic product of the four Windward Islands, reported another Caricom
official.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European potato prices double
as production falls to five-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European potato prices have doubled in recent months as production has
fallen to its lowest level for five years, according to a survey by the UK's
Potato Marketing Board. Output for 1994 is forecast to be 5m tonnes lower
than last year at 42.3m tonnes following dry weather in the summer growing
season.
The drop in production and poor quality of part of the crop has taken prices
in the Netherlands to the equivalent of Pounds 185 to Pounds 192 a tonne for
processing quality potatoes - up from Pounds 55 a tonne last year.
The board's provisional figures show that all European Union countries have
seen a drop in production except for Ireland, Spain and Greece. The dry
weather also affected quality of 40 per cent of the crop in the Netherlands,
Belgium and parts of France.
Quality problems could lead to an even greater reduction in the crop as
potatoes fail to meet storage standards. Potato traders estimate that some
5m tubers could fail quality tests.
In France, prices have doubled to Pounds 118 a tonne from the same period
last year and in the UK the average price has increased to Pounds 146 a
tonne from Pounds 69 a tonne in November 1993.
'Consumers are likely to see some increase in price, but we don't know how
much of these rises will be passed on and potato consumption is not usually
affected by higher prices as they are regarded as staples,' said Ms Diana
Rees at the PMB.
Potato futures prices have soared indicating traders' expectation that
wholesale prices will increase further. Futures prices in the Netherlands
are showing a price of Pounds 320 a tonne for April delivery.
Britain's crop has not been so badly affected by the drought as almost half
the production area is irrigated, against 30 per cent on the continent.
Germany has been hit particularly hard with output falling from 12.3m tonnes
last year to 9.3m tonnes.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia's biggest LNG project
overcomes setbacks - The North West Shelf plant's major expansion is close
after a year of delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flies and the gales have descended on this remote coastal settlement in
the Australian north west as spring turns to summer.
The landscape is hard and parched: ridges of shattered red granite with the
occasional gum tree and kangaroo are the only sights provided by nature. But
amid the desolation stands a giant stack of shining tubes topped by bright
orange flares: the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas plant.
Just five years old, the site is the largest resource project of its kind in
Australia, with investment of over Dollars A10bn (Pounds 4.85bn), and it is
about to undergo further expansion after a year of frustrating delays.
The 6m tonne-a-year plant was built in 1989 to service the gas fields which
had earlier been found 125km offshore. Up till now, only one field, North
Rankin, has been operational, producing over 40m cubic metres a day. Part of
the gas is piped to Perth and other domestic consumers. But most of it is
liquefied for export, mainly to Japanese electric utilities.
The plant was expanded from two trains to three in 1992. and over the past
year or so, the bottlenecks in the production lines have been relieved.
Output is now up to 7m tonnes, and will eventually reach 7.5m when the
overhaul is complete. An eighth LNG carrier is being added to the fleet of
seven which ply the 10-day route up to Japan.
However, next January will see the completion of the major engineering feat
that lies behind the plant's next stage of growth: the start-up of
production from the Goodwyn field to the west of Rankin.
Goodwyn was supposed to start last year. But it was found that the piling
tubes which had been driven deep into the ocean floor to support the
platform had buckled, preventing the piles themselves being inserted into 11
of the 16 points that had been prepared. Special jacks had to be designed
and forced through the 4ft diameter tubes to straighten them. The work was
enormously expensive and time-consuming, but it was successful. The piles
were completed and the platform put in place. Most of the repair cost of
Dollars A330m was recovered from insurance.
Engineers now expect Goodwyn to start in January. It has the capacity to
produce 25m cu m of gas a day. But just as valuable is the 60,000 barrels of
condensate which it is expected to produce as well.
The NWS LNG project is a complex joint venture shared equally between six
companies: Woodside, Shell, BHP, Chevron, BP and and a company jointly owned
by Mitsubishi and Mitsui. Since Shell also owns one third of Woodside it is
effectively the first among equals in the partnership.
The confidence with which the owners are expanding the operation is based on
forecasts of steadily rising demand in the Pacific area. But though the
Japanese utilities have been willing to take delivery of additional cargoes
of LNG (especially last summer when exceptional heat boosted demand for air
conditioning) they are not able to absorb all the output. The challenge for
the plant, therefore, is to find additional buyers for the surplus.
So far, one cargo has gone to Korea, and several more to Spain. Woodside
predicts that demand for LNG in the Pacific area will double from about 50m
tonnes a year to around 100m tonnes by early next century. However, there is
a growing number of suppliers in the region, including Malaysia, Brunei and
Indonesia where Bontang, the world's largest LNG plant, is about to undergo
expansion as well.
A further difficulty is that the Karratha plant was originally designed with
Dollars 25-a-barrel oil in view. The fact that the price is now languishing
several dollars below that is putting pressure on the plant's margins, and
delicate negotiations are currently proceeding with the Japanese to
renegotiate the selling price.
According to Mr Cyril Huijsmans, the plant manager, the company is trying to
squeeze Dollars 100m a year in costs out of the operation in order to ease
the pressure on margins. The tightness of the margins also means that the
plant cannot afford to miss a single shipment, each of which is worth
Dollars 10m. So far the regular three-day loading schedule has not been
missed.
There is a degree of caution, therefore, over talk of adding capacity to the
Karratha plant - the site was designed to accommodate two further trains.
Enlarged capacity would require a second pipeline in from the gasfields and
other expensive infrastructure, which would boost the total cost close to
Dollars A1.8bn, according to Mr Bill Brehaut, the technical manager.
The project would also have to firm up more reserves, though with an active
exploration programme afoot and some promising finds already noted, that may
already be happening.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK tin mine seeks cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new owners of South Crofty, the UK's last operating tin mine, are
seeking between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m from investors to increase output
from just over 2,000 tonnes this year to 2,900 tonnes by the year 2000.
The mine has been starved of cash because of the depressed tin price,
according to Mr David Williamson, whose consultancy is arranging the
financing. 'Both the shaft system and the mine concentrator are capable of
handling up to 40 per cent more throughput if underground development can be
accelerated,' he suggests.
In August South Crofty raised about Pounds 1.3m from 1,700 investors after
the UK government and RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, said they
would agree to waive loans totalling Pounds 30m if the company could raise a
minimum of Pounds 1m to keep itself going.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Irish SFr150m issue enlivens a quiet
day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issuance in the eurobond market virtually ground to a halt yesterday
with the US closed for holidays.
Only the Swiss franc market saw any degree of activity with two deals
prompted by the rally in the Swiss government bond market this week.
'There is a flight of hot money out of equities and into bonds, which is
boosting most bond markets, including the Swiss market,' said one trader.
'Lower Swiss short-term money rates are also forcing investors in Swiss
francs farther out along the yield curve.'
Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency launched a SFr150m issue of
four-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.375 per cent.
Lead manager UBS said the bonds were placed with Swiss retail investors.
Sources said a funding level of 10 basis points below Libor had been
achieved.
Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign borrowing at the NTMA, said the offering
was part of Ireland's borrowing programme for 1995, when it planned to raise
about IPounds 1.4bn to replace maturing debt. He said the proceeds from the
offering were not swapped.
He added that Ireland was still considering coming to the euroyen market
within the next few weeks with an offering of around Y30bn, 'preferably in
the 10-year area'.
Postsparkasse, the Austrian state postal authority, launched a SFr250m issue
of eight-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.625 per cent and fungible with a
SFr200m issue launched in September.
In the Dutch guilder sector, BNG launched a Fl 500m offering of 10-year
bonds priced to yield 31 basis points over Dutch government bonds. Joint
lead manager Rabobank said the bonds were placed with domestic institutions.
The proceeds from the offering were not swapped out of Dutch guilders,
market sources said.
Dealers reported some buying of eurobonds in the dollar sector by investors
keen to exploit the recent widening of spreads.
'They think that now is the time to buy while spreads are wide and before
they close back in when the Treasury market falls again,' said one dealer.
There are rumours that Spain is considering a euroyen offering around the
10-year area over the next week. Exim is rumoured to be coming to the
eurodollar market with a long-dated offering.
Traders said that the EIB was also considering a eurodollar offering around
the 10-year area, although EIB officials were unable to confirm this
yesterday.
IBCA, the European credit rating agency, is reviewing the AA credit status
of Sweden.
'Sweden has a very high and rising debt to GDP ratio and it is important to
assess the new government's plans to stabilise and reduce it,' IBCA said
yesterday.
Sweden's rating is also under review by Moody's, the US credit rating
agency, from which it has an Aa2 rating.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: BIS survey finds sentiment
switching to euronotes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult conditions for borrowers in the international bond markets have
benefited other sectors, such as euronotes and syndicated loans, where
issuance has risen sharply this year.
According to the Bank of International Settlements' latest quarterly report
on financial market trends*, the euronote sector, which includes short and
medium-term notes, has seen record volumes of supply. In the first nine
months of this year, net issuance under all types of facilities amounted to
Dollars 111.3bn, compared with Dollars 47.9bn in the same period of 1993.
The bulk of euronote issuance has been through euro medium-term note
programmes (EMTN). This enables borrowers to issue debt with varying
maturities, currencies and volumes under the same master documentation, and
makes them cheaper and more flexible than international or domestic straight
bond issues, which require separate documentation for each deal.
The bulk of new euronote drawings was denominated in currencies other than
US dollars, with borrowers taking advantage of the flexible structure of
EMTN programmes to select the currencies offering the highest absorption
capacity and best foreign exchange prospects, the report states.
In particular, Japanese investors' preference for domestic currency assets
prompted the issuance of a heavy volume of yen-denominated paper, which
accounted for 38 per cent of total market expansion in the first half,
according to the BIS.
Meanwhile, the syndicated credits sector, which is predominantly of a
floating-rate nature, remained buoyant, with a total of Dollars 59.3bn of
new facilities arranged during the third quarter, on top of Dollars 118.3bn
in the first two quarters.
'The high volume of loanable funds stimulated competition to win business:
the average maturity of loans was increased, spreads charged over inter-bank
rates were reduced and covenant clauses were further relaxed,' the BIS
reports.
Moreover, institutional investors' reluctance to commit funds at fixed
interest rates for long periods led an increasing number of lower-rated or
lesser-known borrowers to turn to syndicated loan credits to take advantage
of easing market conditions. This led some market participants and
regulators to caution against the risk of a reversion to the low credit
standards which prevailed in the late 1980s.
Loan facilities provided to US borrowers continued to reflect merger and
acquisition activity there, while various 'jumbo' loans were launched for
financing or refinancing purposes. These include the Ecu6bn revolving
facility arranged in September for Spain with a spread of only 4.5 basis
points above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor). Outside the OECD,
Asian borrowers raised some Dollars 7.7bn through syndicated loans, while
new facilities arranged for Latin American entities amounted to Dollars
1.8bn, according to the BIS.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Investors harbour concern over political
moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK and Italian bond markets were overshadowed by political worries yesterday
although they took their lead from Germany where prices rallied on the
better tone for bonds after Wednesday's market shift in the US.
Dealers and analysts believe investors will be waiting to see if US
Treasuries continue to benefit from a switching out of equities today after
yesterday's Thanksgiving holiday when the US market was closed. Volumes
across Europe were light.
Mr Mark Cliffe, international economist at Midland Global Markets said:
'There has been a lot of talk about the switch out of equities into bonds
but not a lot of action. It is difficult to believe there will be a rally in
the US bond market even if stocks fall. If the Fed is raising rates it is
not the time to be rushing into US bonds.'
German government bonds rose yesterday as investors moved to pull out of
short positions.
The December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 91.29, up 0.39 on the
day.
Trading was quiet in the morning but lower-than-expected inflation news in
the states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg led to buying.
The Bundesbank council meeting left rates unchanged.
Mr Bob Tyley at Paribas Capital Markets said: 'Nothing has happened in core
European markets to create a change this week. But because of what has
happened in the US, people have been covering themselves in case there is a
change here. But a pull out of equities need not be positive for bunds, it
might be for cash.'
UK government bonds started the day by slipping, largely due to the fall in
sterling due to political worries over talk of the Conservative government
resigning if it was defeated over legislation on the UK contribution to the
European Union budget.
However, gilts shrugged off those worries and perked up on the back of
bunds, and by the end of the day the December long gilt future had moved up
 3/32 of a point to trade around 103 5/16 . The yield spread over bunds had
moved out from 123 to around 128.
Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg, said: 'We are getting used
to these crises. They come and go.'
Mr Cliffe at Midland said: 'Considering the pre-occupation that political
problems are in other European markets it is remarkable how sanguine people
are in the UK. They are working on the assumption that the threat from the
government will work, but the implications of the bill not passing are
rather disturbing. One wonders if the market will pay this more attention
later.'
The yield on Italian government bonds fell yesterday as bond prices followed
the positive tone on bunds. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds
fell 7 basis points to 12.07 per cent.
However, Mr Pio de Gregoria at NatWest Markets said: 'Until the political
situation is clear and the budget is passed there is very little scope for
the bond market to recover. There is enormous uncertainty and if the
political crisis becomes even worse than it is now then it could hamper the
pace of the recovery because confidence could be damaged.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Tisa loan in general
syndication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 1.1bn syndicated loan for Spain's Telefonica Internacional (Tisa),
a subsidiary of Telefonica de Espana, has been launched into general
syndication, Reuter reports.
The seven-year loan, which carries a spread of 27.5 basis points over London
inter-bank offered rate (Libor), is a refinancing of a Dollars 1bn
seven-month bridging facility signed in May to buy two Peruvian
telecommunications companies.
Arrangers of the syndicated loan are ABN-Amro Bank and Banco de Negocios
Argentaria, together with underwriters Bank of Tokyo, Fuji Bank, Banque
Nationale de Paris and Bank of America.
An Dollars 850m revolving credit for Saga Petroleum, the Norwegian energy
group, has also been launched into general syndication, writes Martin Brice.
Arrangers are ABN Amro, Deutsche and Barclays, with co-arrangers Christiania
Bank and Den norske Bank.
The seven-year loan is priced at 30 basis points over Libor for years one to
five and 35 over for years six and seven, with undrawn facilities at 15
basis points for years one to five and 17 1/2 for years six and seven.
Underwriting for the Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 5bn syndicated loan should
be complete by the middle of next week, said Ms Christine Holm of the
Swedish National Debt Office.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental, the German tyre maker, yesterday said growing competition and a
19 per cent rise in the price of natural rubber meant that turnover rose
only slightly in the first nine months, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn.
The group said its pre-tax earnings for 1994 were likely to be higher than
the DM65.1m (Dollars 41.9m) reported last year, but would give no further
details. Turnover in the period rose 2.6 per cent over the year-ago term.
Including new acquisitions, among them Barum, the Czech producer, sales rose
7.1 per cent.
Sales of passenger and commercial tyres, which represent about 40 per cent
of group turnover, rose 2.3 per cent to DM3.58bn. However, the company hopes
to boost sales next year with a new range of summer and winter tyres made
with silica, a compound which is said to reduce petrol consumption by about
5 per cent.
General Tire, the US subsidiary, is likely to report a loss for the full
year because of continuing restructuring costs. ContiTech, the non-tyre
division, saw sales rise 23.2 per cent following new acquisitions.

<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities, posted
nine-month net profits of CDollars 405m (USDollars 295m), up 4.9 per cent
from a year earlier, with stronger domestic demand and a rate increase from
May, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Revenue from power sales was CDollars 5.4bn, up 4.7 per cent. Expenses rose
2.9 per cent mainly because of high depreciation, amortisation and taxes.
Interest expense rose 8.6 per cent due to the lower Canadian dollar and
heavy equipment commissionings.
Capital spending will be CDollars 3.4bn for all 1994, against an earlier
estimate of CDollars 3.9bn.
In the first nine months new borrowing totalled CDollars 2.9bn, completing
the 1994 financing programme.

Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based trading group, is to acquire a 25 per cent stake
in Schweitzer, the Austrian electrotechnical materials distributor, as a
first step towards acquiring majority control later in the 1990s, writes
Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
The Austrian company, the largest of its kind in the eastern part of the
country, has turnover equivalent to more than Fl 150m (Dollars 85m) and a
workforce of 200. It is being sold by Bank Austria Handelsholding. Financial
details were not disclosed.
Hagemeyer described the Schweitzer deal, which must still be approved by
Austria's cartel authorities, as giving it an important gateway to markets
in eastern Europe. In recent years Hagemeyer has made a series of
electrotechnical acquisitions in Germany, the UK and Ireland, taking its
annual turnover in electrotechnical distribution to about Fl 2.5bn.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Barings raises Dollars 180m for
east Europe fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Barings group of the UK has raised Dollars 180m for a new investment
vehicle for the former Soviet Union, taking the pool of funds targeted at
eastern Europe to more than Dollars 1bn.
The First NIS Regional Fund announced yesterday that it had indications of
Dollars 160m of equity commitments and a further Dollars 20m of guaranteed
debt financing.
Baring Brothers, the merchant banking subsidiary, sponsored the placing and
Baring International Investment Management is to manage the fund.
The fund has come to the market at the same time as Invesco's East Europe
Development Fund, which last week announced it had raised Dollars 75m,
taking its net asset value to Dollars 170m. First NIS Regional Fund will be
one of the largest three east European funds, alongside EEDF and CS First
Boston's Central European Growth Fund, which raised Dollars 200m on its
launch earlier this year.
Barings already manages the Barings Emerging Europe Trust and it issued and
placed the latest EEDF transaction.
Core investors in First NIS Regional Fund are the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation.
The EBRD committed Dollars 20m.
Barings, like most managers of funds in the region, said it was aiming for
long-term capital growth. However, it said it expected a large proportion of
the fund's investments would be unlisted or, if listed, illiquid.

Optus Vision, the recently-formed joint venture involving Mr Kerry Packer's
Nine Network, Continental Cablevision of the US and Australia's Optus
Communications, yesterday threatened to drop its plans to build a national
cable network for Australia after the federal government said it would allow
duplicate cabling by rival provider Telstra.
Telstra, better known as Telecom in its home market, has recently linked
with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to develop a cable infrastructure,
primarily for the provision of pay-TV. The Optus Vision network, by
contrast, would be used for pay-TV and interactive services, but would also
aim to carry local telephony facilities.
Mr Michael Lee, the federal communications minister, yesterday said
monopolies in cable infrastructure would not be allowed, and that the
government would not act to stop duplication of cable networks being laid by
the Optus Vision and Telecom/News Corporation consortia.
Optus Vision had proposed a mechanism by which the two network providers
would not build rival cable networks in any area before one cable was built
to all populated areas of Australia. After Mr Lee's statement, it noted that
if it pulled out of the infrastructure race, Telecom's monopoly over local
telephone services would be preserved. 'The prospect of local phone calls
becoming cheaper will effectively disappear,' said Mr Bob Mansfield, chief
executive of Optus.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructure of Cadillac Fairview
proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of creditors led by New York investment bank Goldman Sachs has
proposed a financial restructuring of Cadillac Fairview, the troubled
Canadian property group owning significant downtown office buildings and
shopping centres and assets of about CDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 3.3bn),
writes Robert Gibbens.
Cadillac said it welcomed the proposal but would not reveal details. It will
be considered along with bids from other groups including Rouse of the US
and the Reichmann family of Toronto.
Together the creditors hold about CDollars 345m of Cadillac long-term debt,
including CDollars 220m acquired this summer by Goldman Sachs. Cadillac
posted a 1993 loss of CDollars 2.7bn, including heavy write-downs, and has
been trying to restructure about CDollars 3bn of debt, raise new equity and
sell assets.
Cadillac was acquired from the Montreal Bronfman family in 1987 by a group
of US pension funds.

Optus Vision, the recently-formed joint venture involving Mr Kerry Packer's
Nine Network, Continental Cablevision of the US and Australia's Optus
Communications, yesterday threatened to drop its plans to build a national
cable network for Australia after the federal government said it would allow
duplicate cabling by rival provider Telstra.
Telstra, better known as Telecom in its home market, has recently linked
with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to develop a cable infrastructure,
primarily for the provision of pay-TV. The Optus Vision network, by
contrast, would be used for pay-TV and interactive services, but would also
aim to carry local telephony facilities.
In a long-awaited statement yesterday, Mr Michael Lee, the federal
communications minister, said that monopolies in cable infrastructure would
not be allowed, and that the government would not act to stop duplication of
cable networks being laid by the Optus Vision and Telecom/News Corporation
consortia.
'I see no merit in either myself or any regulator drawing lines on maps to
give carriers monopolies over this infrastructure,' he said.
Optus Vision had proposed a mechanism by which the two network providers
would not build rival cable networks in any area before one cable was built
to all populated areas of Australia. After Mr Lee's statement, it noted that
if it pulled out of the infrastructure race, Telecom's monopoly over local
telephone services would be preserved. 'The prospect of local phone calls
becoming cheaper will effectively disappear,' said Mr Bob Mansfield, chief
executive of Optus.
However, Mr Lee said he had no intention of backing down. 'If the price of
Optus entering this market to compete is that they have to be given a
monopoly over part of the country, then that's a price the government is not
prepared to wear,' he said.
Optus Vision said that, if the government stance did not change, it would
seek to become a pay-TV service provider on the Telecom infrastructure
'provided it obtains assurances from the government that the same carriage
rates will be available to it as are available to the Telecom/News joint
venture.'

<TEXT>
ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, reported an 18.7 per cent
rise in nine-month net profit to Fl 1.65bn (Dollars 943m) from Fl 1.39bn, as
both banking and insurance operations recorded strong gains.
The nine-month performance, which exceeded analysts' expectations, prompted
ING to forecast that net profit per share in 1994 will be higher than the Fl
8.04 posted in 1993. Previously, ING had predicted that per-share earnings
would at least match those of last year.
In the third quarter alone, net profit rose by 18.4 per cent to Fl 580m from
Fl 490m a year ago, the company said.
In insurance, pre-tax results for the first nine months rose by 26.0 per
cent to Fl 1.25bn, with Dutch operations in particular contributing to the
strength of the increase. Life insurance showed a 23.2 per cent increase,
while non-life insurance jumped by 96.3 per cent, though this was due partly
to the deconsolidation in April 1993 of Orion, ING's UK subsidiary.
ING noted that non-life results in the US fell into loss because of extreme
weather in the early part of the year.
Pre-tax banking results were up 19.4 per cent at Fl 1.14bn for the first
nine months, reflecting improved interest margins and expanded business
volumes.
ING's banking arm was also helped by the recent recovery in the price of
Latin American bonds. In the first six months, sharp price declines caused
the group's results from financial transactions, securities and
participations to fall into a loss of Fl 8m from a profit of Fl 566m.
However, at the nine-month stage, trading results were back in the black at
Fl 404m, though still well below last year's Fl 777m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bad loans continue to hit
Japan's banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rising interest rates, falling demand for bank lending and the continuing
need to write off bad loans combined to produce another grim reporting
period for Japan's leading banks in the six months to the end of September.
Aggregate pre-tax profits at the 11 'city' banks, the country's main retail
banks, fell by more than 40 per cent from the same period a year earlier.
Operating profit from the banks' core business activities declined by 6 per
cent.
During the period both short-term and long-term interest rates ended their
three-year decline and since the summer have been rising steadily. The
structure of the city banks' assets and liabilities means that their
borrowing costs change more quickly than the rates at which they lend. As
rates began to rise, therefore, their already wafer-thin margins were
squeezed further.
Worse, in spite of gradual economic recovery, demand for bank lending
remains depressed as companies continue to adjust their balance sheets to
rid themselves of the over-accumulation of capital investment in the late
1980s. Total lending by the main banks has been registering consistent
monthly falls for the last six months. The slump in demand caused a fall in
combined operating revenues of 5 per cent from a year earlier to Y10,602bn
(Dollars 108m).
At the pre-tax level, banks continued to suffer sharp falls as a result of
their belated, but increasingly aggressive, provisioning for bad loans.
Write-offs of non-performing loans were Y1,340.8bn, up by 35 per cent on a
year earlier.
The total of disclosed outstanding non-performing loans was Y8,726bn, down
by Y222bn from the end of March. However, these figures include only loans
to bankrupt customers and loans on which no interest has been received for
at least six months. They do not include restructured loans, where interest
rates have been cut to keep borrowers afloat. Many analysts believe that if
these figures were added to the disclosed bad loan figure, total
non-performing loans would double.
Most banks continued to offset the damaging effects of the write-offs on
their profits by selling part of their substantial holdings of equities in
other companies. The largest six banks sold stocks on average to the value
of two-thirds of their write-offs of bad loans. Without such sales profits
would have been substantially lower.
Against the trend, and analysts' expectations, two of the city banks managed
to report increases in pre-tax profits. Sakura Bank, which has one of the
highest proportions of non-performing loans on its books, saw pre-tax
profits rise by 15 per cent to Y40.6bn.
However, two factors helped the bank's performance: it sold the largest
amount of equities of any of the banks - a total of Y153bn - and at the same
time wrote off a smaller proportion of its bad loans. As a result the bank's
disclosed bad loans, at Y1,446bn, are still above 4 per cent of its total
loans.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which saw pre-tax profits rise by 24 per cent to
Y25.5bn, also wrote off a relatively small amount of non-performing loans.
The unique treatment of bad loans by Japanese banks was challenged in the
wake of the mid-term results by a senior managing director at the largest
bank. Mr Yoshifumo Nishikawa, of Sumitomo Bank, said it was time for banks
to be more open about their non-performing loan totals and to move in to
line with international practice by disclosing the real totals including
restructured loans.
Sumitomo has been the quickest of the banks to acknowledge the scale of its
bad loans, and yesterday announced that it had written off Y196.7bn in the
six months to September, and planned to write off an additional Y300bn in
the second half of the year, compared with Y228.4bn for the whole of the
previous financial year.
The depressed lending market forced most banks to forecast substantial falls
in operating, pre-tax and net profits for the full year to next March. The
backlog of bad loans is likely to take several years to clear.

Y6.16bn

Japan Telecom yesterday announced a 42 per cent slide in interim
unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to
Y6.16bn (Dollars 63m) from Y10.63bn a year ago.
JT is one of the leading domestic long-distance telecommunications concerns,
and listed on the second section of the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges in
September this year.
At the net level, profits declined by 29 per cent to Y4.05bn, compared with
Y5.66bn, on sales 36 per cent higher at Y149.75bn, compared with Y110.38bn.
JT attributed the rise in sales largely to long-distance domestic phone
services and its personal handyphone system (PHS), launched with a Tokyo
Electric Power subsidiary. By products, domestic long distance and public
telephone line service sales grew 36 per cent to Y132.77bn, lease line
service sales grew 5.4 per cent to Y11.20bn, and PHS sales were almost three
times higher at Y5.78bn.
There was a steep drop in operating costs to Y33.15bn from Y51.14bn as a
result of sharp cuts in retail, advertising, personnel and management costs,
JT reported. However, the operating profit advanced only 0.1 per cent to
Y16.29bn because of a Y62.71bn access charge paid to Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone (NTT) to connect JT's lines to NTT's. Previously, the access
charge had been added to customers' bills instead of being paid directly by
Japan Telecom.
Japan Telecom also reported an Y5.47bn fee for listing on the Japanese
equities market in September, affecting earnings growth at pre-tax and net
profit levels.
For the full year to end-March 1995, Japan Telecom is forecasting recurring
profits of Y17bn, against an earlier forecast of Y16.02 and last year's
actual Y16.23bn, net profits of Y9.2bn (Y8.54bn, Y8.42bn) and sales of
Y309bn (Y325.47bn, Y250.75bn).
In Tokyo yesterday, Japan Telecom's share price closed Y18,000 lower at
Y965,000.
In August, Japan Telecom and Nissan Motor announced they would establish a
joint venture company, called Digital Tu-Ka Chugoku, to provide a mobile
phone business in western Japan.

China Everbright group, a diversified mainland conglomerate with activities
ranging from financial services to property development and trading, is to
pay HKDollars 555m (USDollars 72m) for a 5 per cent stake in National Mutual
Asia, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Australian insurance group.
The National Mutual Group will take an 8.7 per cent shareholding in China
Everbright-IHD Pacific, which is controlled by the Hong Kong listed China
Everbright International, for HKDollars 168m.
The deal is designed to further National Mutual's plans to penetrate the
mainland insurance market, which is gradually opening up to foreign groups.
Securing a China partner will help National Mutual enter the market and
develop business there.
Mr Wang Yake, the vice-chairman and chief executive officer of China
Everbright-IHD, will join the board of National Mutual Asia. A formal deal
is expected to be completed next month.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Torras files debt proposals to
lift receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's investment arm in Spain, has
filed a payment proposal to 3,369 creditors aimed at lifting a two-year old
receivership, Reuter reports from Madrid.
The proposal offers 97 per cent of debts owed to small creditors of Torras,
while creditors related to KIO are being offered just over 10 per cent.
The debt owed by Grupo Torras to KIO-related companies accounts for 93.5 per
cent of total debt to unsecured creditors which amounted to Pta219.87bn
(Dollars 1.69bn) when it suspended payments. Of this, Pta205.45bn was owed
to KIO.
A source close to the negotiations said the proposal implies KIO-related
companies taking a write-down of Pta184.45bn, just less than 90 per cent of
Torras's debt to them. The total payments Grupo Torras would make under the
plan was Pta27.73bn.
The deadline for creditors to respond is January 21 1995. A creditors'
committee will be set up, comprising two creditors, a representative of the
company and two from the receivers.
Grupo Torras filed for receivership in December 1992, in spite of the KIO
injecting Pta338bn into the group in the preceding 30 months.
Torras said the receivership report confirmed that part of this capital was
provided by the KIO during the Gulf war, contradicting claims by former
management that it was channelled back to Kuwait and left the group
decapitalised.
KIO filed suit in Madrid in January 1993 against its former agent in Spain,
Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier, as well as seven other former
KIO and Torras executives. Mr De la Rosa is in jail facing separate charges
of fraud in his Grand Tibidabo leisure group.
In its suit, KIO-Torras said the former executives, who resigned in
mid-1992, were responsible through fraud and misrepresenting accounts for
losses of Dollars 1bn and that KIO's Dollars 5bn investment in Spain had
been squandered. The case is still before the Spanish courts.
Torras said KIO financial backing had been crucial in avoiding a collapse in
its Spanish investments, pointing to Pta102bn for paper company Torraspapel,
chemicals group Ercros, real estate firm Prima Inmobiliaria and Industrias
Bures between May-December 1992. It said following agreement with the
Spanish government in early 1993, KIO committed to injecting Dollars 20m
into Torraspapel. In April that year, Torras capitalised its Pta23.5bn debt
with Torraspapel.
With a loan of Pta14.8bn from the state Instituto de Credito Oficial, yet to
be authorised, and Pta3.5bn in working capital earmarked by the KIO between
1993 and 1994, it said Torraspapel was on the way to recovery.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABB merges robotics and paint
units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, is merging its robotics
and paint finishing businesses into a single company with 3,700 employees
worldwide and expected sales this year of Dollars 1.1bn.
The new company, ABB Flexible Automation, will account for about 10 per cent
of ABB's industrial systems and products segment.
It represents another step by Zurich-based ABB to simplify its structure,
save on administrative costs and boost its market presence.
The former ABB Robotics claimed to be the world's largest supplier of robots
and the paint finishing business was a leading supplier in the automotive
paint systems market, worth about Dollars 2.5bn a year.
Both have been expanding through organic growth and acquisitions of
companies such as Trallfa and Ransburg.
Mr Stelio Demark, president of the new company, said yesterday that, by
merging the two businesses and exploiting their synergies, 'we are in a good
position to improve the overall profitability of our businesses'.
The merger will not lead to any job cuts, said Mr Roland Nordstrom, chief
executive of the UK arm of ABB Flexible Automation.
But savings could be made by merging administrative and other functions, and
co-operating in research and development, he said.
The new name is seen by ABB as better reflecting the real capabilities of
the business.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bologna banks plan a 'merger of
equals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credito Romagnolo and Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna yesterday claimed their
planned merger would eventually realise commercial and efficiency savings of
more than L700bn (Dollars 435.6m) before tax over 10 years, and improve
customer service.
The two banks, both based in Bologna, announced a merger at the beginning of
this month, shortly after Credito Italiano (Credit) of Milan revealed it was
planning a L2,000bn bid for control of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo).
Yesterday the groups' chairmen refused to take questions about the promised
hostile bid from Credit. But they continued the policy of stirring up local
pressure against the Milanese bid by underlining the strong regional
identity of their own banks.
The merger, which will be submitted to Rolo's shareholders for approval on
December 19, has a head-start over Credit's plan because it has already been
approved by the Bank of Italy, which supervises the Italian banking sector.
Credit has remained silent about its bid plans, while the central bank
continues to examine the proposals.
Rolo, whose shares are quoted in Milan, will merge with CAER, the unquoted
parent of Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo).
The banks yesterday described their plan as 'a merger of equals'. The
foundation which controls CAER will have a 30.7 per cent stake in the
enlarged group, and former Rolo shareholders will control 64.5 per cent.
The two companies plan to protect minority shareholders' interests with a
list-voting system allowing them to nominate board members. Rolo's limit of
10 per cent on voting rights will also be maintained at all ordinary
shareholder meetings.
Together the two banks will have assets of L61,056bn, and more than 500
branches, making them the 10th largest bank in Italy's fragmented financial
sector. They also claim they would be the fourth most efficient bank.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Danone acquires controlling
stake in Argentine group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Danone, France's largest food group, yesterday took a significant step in
its strategy of expanding in South America, announcing it was paying
USDollars 240m for a controlling stake in Bagley, an Argentine biscuit
manufacturer.
Under the terms of the agreement, which gives Danone its first foothold in
Argentina, the French group is to take a shareholding of just over 50 per
cent in Bagley.
The Argentine company, founded in 1864, has more than 30 per cent of the
country's biscuit market. It has an annual turnover of about USDollars 300m,
80 per cent of which comes from biscuit sales.
The company's principal brands include Criollitas, Traviata and Kesitas. It
has two production sites, in Buenos Aires and in San Luis.
According to Danone, the Argentine biscuit market is the most dynamic in
Latin America, expanding by 11 per cent in 1993. In terms of size it is
second to Brazil, where Danone is present in biscuits and yoghurt products.
Yesterday's deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by the French
group, which is seeking to expand its presence in Asian and American markets
and in fast-growing sectors.
In May, when the group said it was changing its name from BSN, it announced
that it was taking a 49 per cent stake in Campineira de Alimentos, the
Brazilian biscuit group, establishing a dairy joint venture in Russia, and
raising from 24 per cent to 100 per cent its holding in San Miguel, the
Spanish brewer. Danone has subsequently expressed interest in acquiring the
Colman's food and drinks businesses of Reckitt and Colman of the UK.
A spokesman for the group said that it was not necessary to raise fresh
capital for the acquisition of Bagley. He said that the gearing level of the
company was about 25 per cent, based on net debts of FFr11bn (Dollars
2.06bn) at the end of June. Annual cash flow at Danone is about FFr3.5bn.

BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, has raised its dividend for the
twenty-second consecutive year, but warned that the increase may be the last
for a while.
The quarterly dividend, payable to shareholders registered on December 15,
will rise by one cent a share to 68 cents.
The Montreal-based company, whose subsidiaries include Northern Telecom and
Bell Canada, the country's biggest phone company, said that it planned to
review its dividend policy next year 'in the light of widespread changes in
the telecommunications industry, which are creating growth opportunities for
investment in new technologies and in new businesses'.
Separately, Bell Canada International, BCE's offshore arm, named Mr Robert
Kearney, a former chief executive of Bell Canada, to spearhead its expanding
UK interests.
Belfast-born Mr Kearney, who was due to retire at the end of this year, will
become deputy chairman of Bell Canada International Management, based in
London.
BCE has a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications and a 42 per cent
interest in Bell Cablemedia, the UK's third-biggest cable-TV operator.

Banco Central Hispano (BCH), Spain's second biggest bank, yesterday cut its
interim dividend by 31.8 per cent from Pta110 to Pta75.
At the nine-month stage BCH posted a 37.6 per cent fall in its pre-tax
profits to Pta45.3bn (Dollars 349m) after putting aside Pta106.6bn in
provisions, 33.7 per cent more than in January-September last year.
The dividend move, which was welcomed by analysts and institutions, is an
unusual step for a domestic bank.
Ms Anna Macdonald of brokers Smith New Court said the cut had been expected.
'When a bank is losing deposits and loans it has no option but to strengthen
its balance sheet.'
BCH's decision comes as it is improving its core banking business. At the
end of September it had raised operating profit by 17.5 per cent to
Pta104.9bn and net interest income by 4.1 per cent to Pta235.3bn.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Why history has a habit of
repeating itself at Hilton Hotels - Chief executive Barron Hilton is once
again considering a sale or break-up of the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilton Hotels, the US hotel and casino group, has enjoyed three-quarters of
a century of independence since Conrad Hilton went into business with his
first hotel in Cisco, Texas, in 1919. Now, however, that era may be coming
to an end.
Last week Hilton Hotels announced that it had appointed Smith Barney, the
Wall Street investment bank, to explore the possibilities for 'enhancing
shareholder value'. Top of the list of options was a possible sale or
break-up of the company.
It was an unusual move: companies quoted on the stock market are more often
seen resisting bids than inviting them. But Hilton Hotels' history helps
explain why.
When Conrad Hilton died in 1979 - after a colourful life which included
three marriages, one to the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor - he left nearly
everything, including his 28 per cent stake in Hilton Hotels, to a charity
set up to support Roman Catholic nuns.
Conrad's son Barron, chief executive of the company since 1966, spent 10
years challenging the will, arguing that his father had wanted the company
to stay under the family's control.
Within weeks of triumphing and taking most of the charity's shares, he was
inviting offers, saying he was only doing what his father would have done if
he had seen the prices people were paying for prime hotels.
The expected rush of buyers, however, did not emerge. Some potential US
buyers were out of action after the collapse of the junk bond market in
autumn 1989. Japanese investors stayed away because of the controversy
aroused by other recent Japanese acquisitions in the US; and other foreign
buyers may have been deterred by the fact that Hilton Hotels had largely
removed itself from overseas markets by selling its Hilton International
division in 1966.
In the end, only two offers were received, both worth about Dollars 76 a
share - less than Mr Hilton was prepared to accept. But it was perhaps only
a matter of time before he returned to try again.
The company today has more than 200 hotels in the US, mostly trading under
the Hilton name, and a handful overseas, mainly trading under the Conrad
name. More than half its operating profits - 64 per cent last year - come
from its gaming interests, consisting mainly of its Nevada hotel-casinos.
Hilton Hotels' past financial performance has not been particularly
impressive. Net income has moved sideways for a decade, fluctuating around
the Dollars 100m mark (see graphic); last year the company made Dollars
106.1m.
This year, however, profits have been picking up. Although the gaming side
has been suffering from the effects of increased competition in Las Vegas,
the hotels have been benefiting from the strength of the US economy, which
has brought better occupancy levels and rising room rates. Net income in the
quarter to September rose by 32 per cent to Dollars 27m.
Stock market analysts say the company should fetch at least Dollars 80 a
share, or Dollars 3.8bn, in an outright sale. Mr Bruce Thorp, an analyst at
PNC Bank, points out that the company has some very attractive assets, such
as the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York and the Hilton Hawaiian Village in
Hawaii. Mr Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, says: 'The brand name
alone must be worth Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m.'
One company cited as a possible buyer is ITT, the US financial, leisure and
manufacturing conglomerate. ITT recently put its ITT Financial subsidiary on
the market at an asking price of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn, saying it
wanted to use the proceeds to expand in leisure and entertainment. ITT
already owns the Sheraton hotel chain and has been planning to enter the Las
Vegas gaming market.
Another possible buyer could be Ladbroke, the UK leisure and entertainment
group; Ladbroke already owns Hilton International and has been seeking to
expand its gaming interests.
Still, Mr Vogel thinks Mr Hilton may consider alternatives to an outright
sale: for example, he could spin off the gaming interests and keep the hotel
business that bears the family name.
Mr Terry Bivens, an analyst at Argus Research, agrees. 'Mr Hilton has some
very definite tax considerations at this point,' he says - meaning that if
Mr Hilton were to sell his 24.5 per cent stake in the company for cash,
virtually all his profits would be taxable. Some other kind of deal - for
example, a spin-off involving a stock swap - might give him the opportunity
to take his profits over a longer period.
Not surprisingly, the uncertainty has led to caution in the stock market.
Last time Hilton Hotels was put up for sale, many investors got their
fingers burned: the company's share price plunged from Dollars 115 1/2 at
the peak of optimism about a deal to Dollars 49 7/8 when the auction was
called off. On Wednesday, the shares closed at Dollars 69 3/4, well below
what analysts think an outright sale could fetch. Wall Street, it seems, has
a long memory.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: French champion is left reeling
on the ropes - Alcatel Alsthom has been shaken by shifting markets and
corruption probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a punch-drunk boxer, Alcatel Alsthom is reeling from a series of body
blows that have rocked the French telecoms, transport and engineering group
since the beginning of the year.
Since Monday, Mr Pierre Guichet, head of Alcatel CIT, the group's telecoms
equipment subsidiary, has been detained in prison by an investigating
magistrate probing alleged overbilling of France Telecom, the state telecoms
operator which is one of the company's largest clients.
In July, Mr Pierre Suard, the company chairman, was placed under
investigation on charges he used company funds for use on his private
properties. Alcatel Alsthom's engineering joint venture with GEC of the UK
has endured a strike which has halted production at several factories at the
Belfort site in eastern France since the beginning of the month. It has
issued two warnings concerning its expected profits for the year, while its
share price has collapsed, falling by more than 50 per cent since its
January high of FFr913.
The blows are all the more spectacular given the company's previous rise to
the top of French industry. After taking the helm in 1986, Mr Suard built
the company into one of the country's most profitable and most respected
business groups. In 1993, it racked up profits of FFr7.1bn (Dollars 1.33bn),
more than any other private-sector French group.
This year, net profits of about FFr4bn are expected - still a tidy sum, but
the first fall since the company's rapid expansion was launched in 1987 with
the acquisition of the European telecoms equipment operations of ITT of the
US. Combined with its other woes, this has left investors shaken and rivals
with a sense of Schadenfreude.
'It is quite a reversal,' says one Paris banker. 'People are now asking
whether the giant has feet of clay.' That is one important question. Others
concern the reasons behind the company's change in fortunes and whether it
can respond to such setbacks.
The company's ordeals partly reflect two fundamental trends confronting
French industry: a campaign against corruption launched by an increasingly
assertive judiciary, and the weakening of traditional ties between European
state monopolies and private-sector suppliers. 'Alcatel is a symbol of the
challenges facing some big French industrial groups,' says one electronics
analyst.
On the first count, Alcatel's legal woes are among the most intractable of a
series of corruption investigations which have hit several French business
leaders. Although little has been heard of Mr Suard's personal case since
July, when he was placed under investigation, the probe into Alcatel CIT,
the company's telecoms equipment subsidiary, has broadened.
Mr Jean-Marie D'Huy, the magistrate pursuing the case, is assessing whether
the company established a system of overcharging France Telecom for
equipment. He has widened the investigation from transmission systems to
alleged malpractice in the supply of switching systems.
Alcatel firmly rejects any wrongdoing with respect to the ongoing probes. Mr
Suard lambasted the failure to observe judicial secrecy in his investigation
and has attacked the high-profile methods used by the magistrate. Mr Gerard
Dega, vice-chairman of Alcatel CIT, said on Tuesday that 'this claim of
overbilling is aberrant and absolutely does not apply'.
The implications, however, are potentially worrying. 'It is serious,' says
Professor Elie Cohen, director of CNRS, a research institute. He claims
Alcatel, like other European telecoms suppliers, has enjoyed a privileged
relationship with the state telecoms monopoly but that such close ties are
unravelling. This trend is a result of deregulation and increasing emphasis
on profitability by national operators preparing for privatisation and
increased competition. 'The big problem for Alcatel is that this change in
the relationship is now taking place in a poisoned climate,' says Prof
Cohen.
Alcatel does not break down its sales figures with respect to clients, but
France Telecom is estimated to account for half Alcatel CIT's annual sales
of FFr14bn. Contracts for the next two years are being negotiated.
Moves towards liberalisation in the telecoms equipment market have cost the
company dear in Germany. The shift by Deutsche Telekom towards international
specifications and tenders for its supplies has prompted a sharp fall in
prices for companies such as Siemens and Alcatel. The average price of
switching equipment has fallen by about 15 per cent in Germany this year.
At Alcatel SEL, the company's German subsidiary, the effects have been
devastating. Mr Gerhard Ziedler, the chairman of Alcatel SEL says losses are
DM1m (Dollars 643,500) a day.
Losses in Germany are one of the principal factors in the forecast reduction
in profits at the group and have prompted a significant restructuring. This
month Alcatel SEL said it planned to cut 5,300 jobs  - almost one-quarter of
the workforce - by the end of 1995.
Industry observers have welcomed the move. 'They are finally biting the
bullet in Germany,' said one electronics analyst at a French securities
company. But he expressed concern that Alcatel had taken so long to realise
the extent of the problem.
The bigger question is whether Mr Suard's group can respond to the threats
facing it. The chairman believes it can, arguing that 1994 will be the low
point of the group's fortunes and next year will see an improvement.
Mr Suard will be helped in his struggle by several positive factors. In
particular, Alcatel Alsthom is buttressed by its diversity, in terms of
products and geographical spread, and by its strength in new technologies.
While the European telecoms market is proving an Achilles' heel, the company
has made significant progress in emerging markets, particularly China. This
year it expects to supply the Chinese market with about 7m lines of
switching equipment, more than for the whole of Europe.
Several operating divisions are also performing strongly. The acquisition
this year of STC Submarine Systems from Northern Telecom of Canada has
strengthened the cable division. In the US, Alcatel Network Systems has won
significant broadband and switching equipment contracts from Pacific Bell,
Bell Atlantic and other US telecoms groups.
Ironically, the profitability of GEC Alsthom - which manufactures power
generating and transport equipment - has been a factor in the strike at
several of its plants.
Trade unions, which are seeking to press companies to raise pay against a
background of economic revival, claim that the company's financial position
justifies their demands for a monthly salary increase of FFr1,500 - even
though weakness in markets for some of its products, such as the high-speed
train, the TGV, has prompted a cautious outlook from management.
The dispute is now winding down following a vote on Tuesday in which the
majority of workers favoured a return to work and a call yesterday by the
communist-led CGT union for the removal of pickets.
As for new products, the group reports strong success in its ATM and SDH
systems. ATM, the latest generation of switching and transmission systems,
is expected to play a strong role in the upgrading international
telecommunications networks and the shift towards information superhighways.
Similarly, the SDH, a digital transmission system, is enjoying strong
demand, particularly in the US, where the company expects to book orders of
Dollars 700m this year, Dollars 200m more than expected.
Many industry observers concur. 'Alcatel is in a solid position for the
medium term,' says Mr Jean Danjou, an analyst at Societe Generale.
The problem, however, is the short term. The group is precariously
positioned, confronted by a downward trend in profits and an increasingly
complex legal tangle. It has yet to demonstrate it can respond.

Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, plans to invest
NKr700m (Dollars 102.9m) to increase the capacity of its PVC plants in the
UK and Norway.
It is also scrapping plans for a new plant in Rafnes, Norway, and will not
expand output in Stenungsund, Sweden.
The company will strengthen its position in the UK market by upgrading
capacity by 60,000 tonnes at its PVC plant at Aycliffe, north-east England.
The plant has annual production capacity of 130,000 tonnes.
Hydro is the UK's second-largest supplier of PVC and commands about 25 per
cent of the market.
In Heroeya, Norway, where it has a PVC plant with an expected lifetime of no
more than three years, the company intends to lift annual production by
15,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes. Production in Norway is aimed primarily at
the Scandinavian market, where Hydro has a 40 per cent market share.
The company believes worldwide consumption of PVC will rise by 5 per cent
annually towards the year 2000.
'Today, PVC production in Europe does not fully cover demand, and PVC prices
are rising,' said Mr Haakon Langballe, president of Hydro's petrochemicals
division.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bayer, Hoechst in dye venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer and Hoechst are to merge their textile dyes operations into a 50:50
joint venture in an attempt to revive profits and defend their market shares
against low-cost competitors in Asia.
The new company, expected to be established in mid-1995 and with aggregate
annual turnover of DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), will mark a further important step
in the consolidation of the German chemicals business.
It follows a series of cross-border and inter-company deals which started in
the recent recession as German chemicals groups strove to regain
competitiveness and reinforce their companies better to withstand future
cyclical slumps.
Hoechst said markets for dyes had been subjected to deep-seated changes by
new producers, notably in low-wage countries in Asia, which had led to
losses.
'It is to be expected that this situation will become more severe,' it
added.
The new company will be based in Germany, while US operations are expected
to be joined in a partnership.
Most of Hoechst's PVC business has already been merged with the German
chemical group Wacker's operations in a new company, Vinnolit, which is
looking for a further partner to increase its critical mass.
The group's plant protection business has also merged with that of Schering
into a so-far successful venture, AgrEvo, which recently forecast sales of
DM3.35bn this year and profits of about DM270m.
AgrEvo yesterday announced the purchase of a majority stake in Stefes, a
private agricultural chemicals distribution company with annual turnover of
DM80m.
Net earnings at Henkel, the German chemicals and consumer products group,
rose 15 per cent to DM485m in the first three quarters of the current year
as restructuring measures started to pay off.
Sales rose marginally to DM10.5bn, according to an interim report, but fell
in Germany.
Reporting sales increases of 16 per cent in Asia and 12 per cent in the US,
Mr Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus, chairman, said he aimed to reduce the company's
dependence on Europe, and improve its position in consumer markets where
there was an increasing tendency for retailers to stock only the top two or
three leading brands.

<TEXT>
Shares in MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, rose 5 per cent yesterday
after it announced better-than-expected results for the first nine months,
and painted a bright picture of prospects.
Profit after financial items soared to SKr1.01bn (Dollars 136.8m) from a
SKr427m loss in the same 1993 period, as rising prices and strong demand
drove up capacity utilisation and sales.
It upgraded its full-year profit forecast to between SKr1.7bn and SKr1.9bn,
excluding one-off items, mainly because of the higher prices. Last year, it
suffered a SKr449m loss.
The company also announced SKr3bn worth of new investments, including a
SKr2.1bn outlay on a new newsprint machine at its Braviken plant. The
machine will have a capacity of 270,000 tonnes a year.
MoDo's results echoed the strong trend already displayed by Sweden's other
big forestry groups, Stora, SCA and AssiDoman. Group sales rose 15 per cent
to SKr14.4bn; operating profits increased to SKr1.65bn from SKr456m; and
financial expenses fell to SKr638m from SKr883m.
Mr Bengt Pettersson, chief executive, said: 'Continued high capacity
utilisation and the successive impact of price rises have led to strong
growth in the third quarter. All our business areas showed better results.'
The biggest turnround was at the group's fine paper unit, MoDo Paper, which
swung from a SKr403m operating loss to a SKr387m profit.
However, the forestry, packaging and paperboard units also staged a strong
profits recovery. Foreign units, where currency factors had earlier hit
competitiveness, returned to profit in the third quarter.
MoDo has recently agreed to sell its packaging division and stakes in Swiss
and Canadian operations. The disposals will release around SKr1.6bn of
capital. Its B shares - briefly suspended before the results announcement -
closed at SKr349, up SKr16.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Atlas advances 44% in term
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlas Copco, the Swedish engineering group, yesterday announced nine-month
profits of SKr1.31bn (Dollars 176m), up 44 per cent from SKr910m in the same
1993 period.
It reiterated its forecast that full-year earnings would be 'considerably
higher' than last year's SKr1.32bn profit.
Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr15.2bn, due mainly to increased volumes.
The group said it had achieved significantly higher sales in France, Germany
and the UK during the third quarter.
However, it said the trend in Japan, the Middle East and North Africa
remained weak.
Orders were 13 per cent higher at SKr16.0bn.
Mr Michael Treschow, president, said: 'The level of orders received from the
manufacturing industry and the mining sector is expected to continue to
improve in Atlas Copco's main markets.'
Compressor technique and industrial technique were the strongest divisions,
both in terms of results and orders.
The compressor technique division saw earnings rise 45 per cent to
SKr1.03bn, mainly because of increased volumes which lifted sales by 16 per
cent to SKr7.22bn.
Orders were 14 per cent higher at SKr7.50bn.
Profits in the industrial technique division also benefited from higher
volumes, rising 105 per cent to SKr308m.
A weaker trend was seen in the construction and mining division, where
profits fell to SKr32m from SKr97m because of restructuring costs.
The company said it planned to close its Bremen drilling equipment plant in
Germany, switching production to Orebro in Sweden to achieve synergies.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: BASF sees further strong growth
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, expects a 50 per cent increase in pre-tax
earnings to DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.03bn) this year, after profits more than
trebled in the third quarter.
Forecasting further growth for the coming two years, Mr Jurgen Strube,
chairman, said he expected his main objective - a 10 per cent return on
capital - to be achieved in 1996. After that, he was counting on less
pronounced expansion and increased competition in the closing years of the
decade.
Mr Strube yesterday announced a 99 per cent rise in earnings for the first
nine months, to DM1.2bn, on sales up 7.6 per cent at DM32.4bn.
Although the sharpness of the recovery was gratifying, he said he was not
satisfied with profitability, and would press on with cost reductions. This
would entail a further 4,000 job losses during 1995, following more cuts in
the current year.
Mr Strube said fixed costs had been cut by DM1.4bn in the past three years,
and further economies worth DM100m had been made in the nine months to the
end of September. Group payroll costs in the review period had fallen 3.3
per cent.
He said the company would reinforce its less cyclical businesses - including
pharmaceuticals, natural gas, plant protection and fine chemicals - as he
noted continuing pressure on producer prices while raw material costs
continued to rise.
Pharmaceuticals sales are expected to rise by a third to DM3bn when
negotiations to buy the drugs operations of Boots, the UK group, are
concluded.
Mr Strube said he expected the talks to be completed by the end of the year,
and be followed by an integration programme. Apart from the geographical
synergies between the two groups' drugs operations, he said Boots' blood
pressure and diabetes treatments were especially interesting. Addressing
workers' concerns over possible job losses, he said adjustments would be
required on all sides.
According to an interim report published yesterday, operating profits rose
in all divisions except oil and gas, although earnings were once again
reduced by extraordinary items, especially write-offs of plastics, fibres
and consumer products plant in the US.
North American sales rose 3 per cent in the review period and, while
European sales increased 8.5 per cent, turnover in Germany fell 0.6 per
cent. Asian, Australian and African sales showed the strongest growth, up 12
per cent.

FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield returns to
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, said yesterday
increased sales, higher prices and cost-cutting had underpinned a strong
swing into the black at the nine-month stage.
The group, 49.9 per cent-owned by British Steel, had profits of SKr858m
(Dollars 116.2m) compared with a SKr77m loss in the same 1993 period, after
a strong third quarter when profits surged to SKr427m from a SKr56m deficit.
Avesta forecast a further improvement in the final three months. It said
volume and productivity gains achieved in the first half would allow higher
prices to translate into stronger results in the quarter.
Mr Per Molin, president, said: 'The strength of European and world demand
has been maintained through the summer period and appears to be firm into
1995. Prices and margins continue to improve.'
The group saw nine-month sales rise to SKr12.3bn from SKr10.7bn.
Third-quarter sales were up 13 per cent at SKr3.97bn, in spite of the
seasonal holiday slowdown.
Avesta said the recovery in the European stainless market had continued. It
noted that European producers had increased deliveries of cold-rolled flat
products by 27 per cent in the third quarter, while prices were 24 per cent
higher than in the first three months. In the US and Asian markets, demand
was also strong.

<TEXT>
Toronto Dominion Bank more than doubled earnings in its latest fiscal year,
and has raised its dividend.
The bank, Canada's fifth largest, lifted earnings to CDollars 683m
(USDollars 497.5m), or CDollars 2.14 a share, in the 12 months to October
31, from CDollars 275m, or 82 cents, a year earlier. The quarterly dividend
has been increased to 22 cents from 20 cents a share.
Fourth-quarter earnings soared to CDollars 195m, or 62 cents a share, from
CDollars 82m, or 25 cents.
The bank said it was especially pleased with the improvement in its loans
portfolio.
Loan losses, originally forecast at CDollars 450m, totalled CDollars 345m,
in spite of an extra general provision of CDollars 38m.
As a result, fourth-quarter write-downs were only CDollars 32m, down from
CDollars 150m last year.
Non-performing loans dropped to CDollars 727m on October 31 from CDollars
1.22bn a year earlier.
The bank forecast a further improvement in 1995, based on continued economic
recovery and momentum in new businesses such as expanded discount brokerage
and credit-card activities.

amid row

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International investment banks in Budapest yesterday accused Hungary of
scuttling the sale of Hungarhotels, the country's largest hotel chain. They
also cast doubt over the country's commitment to privatisation.
The row broke out as negotiations collapsed between Hungary's State Property
Agency and American General Hospitality (AGH) of the US over the tender for
51 per cent in state-owned Hungarhotels.
However, Mr Ferenc Bartha, privatisation commissioner, said: 'We are in
negotiation . . . and the board will decide.'
Western investors and their advisers were using the deal as a litmus test of
the socialist government's intentions on privatisation. The controversy mars
Hungary's efforts to sell shareholdings in telecommunications, electricity
and gas utilities, and to raise Dollars 1.5bn over the next 12 months.
AGH was last week named preferred tenderer after bidding Dollars 61m for the
stake in Hungarhotels to beat a rival offer of about Dollars 45m from
Intercontinental Hotels of Japan.
However, the social security fund, led by allies of the socialist
government, has mounted a campaign to stop the deal. Intercontinental also
lobbied against the tender outcome, which would have left it without a
flagship hotel in Budapest.
The Hungarian negotiators demanded that AGH pay a 25 per cent premium, and
investment bankers said they suspected the authorities wanted to force AGH
to withdraw.
It would require a climbdown by the State Property Agency at a meeting next
week to save the deal.
The government had previously promised to speed up privatisation and foreign
investment. However, only one significant sale to western investors has gone
through since the former communists returned to power after elections last
May.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rooney takes the helm at Atreus - Former
Spring Ram chief makes City comeback in Pounds 6.6m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Rooney, former chief executive of Spring Ram, yesterday returned to
the City to announce a Pounds 6.6m deal to take control of Atreus, the
bathroom goods supplier.
Mr Rooney, who will become chairman of the recently floated company, heads a
consortium which is investing Pounds 4.8m in Atreus shares and convertible
loan notes.
His family trusts are also underwriting an open offer of 18m new shares to
shareholders at 10p, on a one-for-two basis.
Atreus shares closed up 4p at 13p yesterday.
The investment comes 14 months after institutional investors forced Mr
Rooney off the Spring Ram board.
His departure followed revelations of false accounting at its Balterley
Bathrooms subsidiary and three profit warnings in eight months. Before this,
the group had enjoyed 13 years of spectacular growth.
Mr Rooney is joined at Atreus by Mr Alan Bell, former chief executive of
Spring Ram's kitchen division, and Mr Ron Farr, former chief executive of
Spring Ram's special products business.
Mr Rooney said: 'We saw ourselves coming back to the City in three or four
years' time, after the dust had settled, but Atreus approached us. With our
expertise and cash, they felt we had a nice partnership.'
The subscription and open offer is expected to raise about Pounds 6.4m net
of expenses to fund new products and acquisitions in related sectors of the
home improvement market.
Alongside the takeover deal, Atreus announced the acquisition of Samson
Stairs, which manufactures wooden balustrade systems, in return for 2m
ordinary shares.
Mr Bell, the new chief executive of Atreus, said: 'If we cannot treble what
we have in two or three years, we might as well go home.
'It is very exciting to go into the 1990s with a clean sheet, but it is
unlikely we will be building too many large factories in the next few
years.'
Atreus gained an official listing in March 1993 by a reverse takeover of the
shell company URS International. The group had a market value of Pounds
7.76m after a placing and public offer of 27.5m shares at 20p each.
At the time the board said it wanted to grow by expanding its product range.
However, the company issued a profit warning last January, saying that the
company had suffered pressure on margins.
Atreus yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 551,000
profit) on turnover of Pounds 2.94m (Pounds 3.78m) in the six months to
September 30.
Mr Charles Gillams, chairman, said the losses reflected the cost of an
overhead reduction programme and weak consumer spending.
The board did not declare an interim dividend.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Babcock back in the black with Pounds 2.83m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Babcock International, the engineering contractor, materials handling and
facilities management group, returned to profit in the half year to
September 30, but is again omitting its interim dividend.
The group, which is in the first few months of a three-year restructuring
plan, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m, compared with losses of Pounds
9.18m.
Mr John Parker, chairman, said the modest profit was in line with the
corporate plan, which was on schedule, and profitability would improve in
the second half.
However, higher then expected losses in the group's main problem area, its
energy division, caused analysts to downgrade full-year profit forecasts.
Turnover fell from Pounds 413m to Pounds 349m, partly reflecting the
contraction of the energy division and reduced revenues from Babcock's Drax
flue gas desulphurisation contract for National Power, now approaching
completion.
The group order book fell from Pounds 608m to a 'satisfactory' level of
Pounds 569m, which excludes the Pounds 100m-plus refit contract for HMS
Superb, to be handled by the Rosyth Royal dockyard.
The loss at the energy division was reduced to Pounds 6.85m (Pounds 13.7m),
on turnover down from Pounds 178m to Pounds 108m. Its restructuring was
proving to be tough and demanding, said Mr Parker, and had required wider
management changes than originally envisaged.
Additional costs have been identified on some older contracts and there was
no gross margin on about Pounds 25m turnover elsewhere. Also, tendering
costs were heavy, as winning a large power plant order remained a priority.
Babcock is awaiting decisions on 14 big power plant tenders, and - in
consortium - is one of four groups bidding for National Power's Pembroke FGD
contract. That would be worth about Pounds 100m to Babcock, said Mr Nick
Salmon, chief executive.
The best performing division was facilities management, where profits were
Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.2m) on turnover of Pounds 98.1m (Pounds 101m). Babcock
is the sole bidder for Rosyth dockyard, where it has a management contract
until March 1996.
Mr Parker said Babcock Rosyth Defence, as the dockyard operator, could end
up leasing the facilities from Rosyth 2000, a consortium of which it is a
member. The consortium is a separate initiative from the proposed
privatisation.
Net cash at September 30 was higher than expected at Pounds 53.7m (Pounds
10m debt). Earnings per share were 0.17p (1.59p losses).
COMMENT
This was always going to be a transitional year for Babcock, with its new
management team and strategy. The more optimistic full-year forecasts, of as
much as Pounds 25m pre-tax - against a Pounds 41.2m loss - implied that the
energy division would break even, which is clearly wide of the mark. House
brokers Smith New Court have revised their forecast down from Pounds 17m to
Pounds 13m, giving earnings of 1p and a prospective p/e of 26. Shareholders,
however, should focus on prospects for the following years, where the
groundwork for a solid recovery in profits and dividends has been laid. The
dividend question will be reviewed at the year-end.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Selecting a steady growth path - Andrew
Bolger reports on the recruitment agency's expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Select Appointments (Holdings), the UK-based recruitment agency which was
rescued from financial collapse three years ago by a group of Swiss
investors, has renewed its ambitions to become a leading international
group.
The USM-quoted company has made seven acquisitions this year and now
operates in 12 countries. Its market value, which slipped to Pounds 540,000
before the 1991 takeover, now stands at Pounds 77m, following a Pounds 44m
rights issue in August.
Select is backed by former managers of Adia, the Swiss-based recruitment
agency. Floated in 1987, the agency had seen its profits and share price
collapse after a period of debt-financed overseas expansion.
Mr Tony Martin, a former Adia director who became chairman and chief
executive of Select in 1992, said: 'We are trying to take the cyclicality
out of the business, which has been the weak point of recruitment.'
Mr Martin said the aim was to build a group which was diversified both
geographically and sectorally. Currently more than half the group's turnover
is in the US, but expansion into continental European is a priority.
Mr Martin believes that companies are realising the need to manage their
payroll actively - often their biggest single cost. 'The days of everyone
working from nine-to-five, five days a week are over. Most companies now
have core workers, surrounded by contract workers and then temps,' he said.
The increasing involvement of women was also leading to more flexible
working patterns. Mr Martin said that in 1992, 1 per cent of the US
workforce was placed in temporary jobs by private agencies - and that
proportion had now nearly doubled.
'The process is more advanced in the US, but we expect to see a similar rate
of progress in the UK. About 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now
temporary or part-timers, and that proportion is expected to rise to about
25 per cent over the next three to four years,' he said.
His clients were starting to restructure their staffing levels. 'More and
more of our business is planned, long-term contract labour.'
Select also points to a skills shortage, which has emerged unusually early
in the recovery. In the UK, the agency has jobs for 100 heavy goods vehicle
drivers and for word processor operators, if they can handle a broad range
of software packages.
Mr Martin commented: 'If we really are in for several years of steady
growth, as the politicians suggest, these shortages will become really
acute.'
The Swiss investors in Select launched a Pounds 7.5m rescue, injecting
Pounds 2.5m in exchange for 90 per cent of the equity, Pounds 2.5m to cut
debt and Pounds 2.5m for working capital. Operations in the US, Australasia
and France were sold.
The Swiss have so far invested a total of Pounds 35m in Select, although
their share of the equity fell to 80 per cent following the August rights
issue. The investors intend to keep their money in the group, but want
institutional investors to dilute the Swiss equity stake to about 50 per
cent as a result of further acquisitions and rights issues.
At the time of the takeover, Select had 30 branches for secretarial and
administration staff in the UK, mainly in the south-east of England. It now
has 51 branches in the UK, spread from Newcastle to Bristol, and has moved
into computing, accounting and light industrial vacancies, such as drivers.
Select also has small operations in Switzerland, Hungary and Greece - but
acknowledges that it must get into the European heartland of Germany, France
and the Netherlands. Other operations are in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong
and Japan.
Mr Zach Miles, finance director, said the agency sought businesses with
further growth potential run by experienced local managers, who knew the
country and culture and kept an equity stake in the business, the local name
of which would be retained.
The group is not just expanding by acquisition - it has started up new
ventures in Hungary, South Africa and Singapore. It is also prepared to
franchise operations and inject cash into businesses.
Since acquiring a Californian accountancy agency for Pounds 4.2m last year,
the number of branches has grown from eight to 12.
Select suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000 in 1993, but is forecast to
make Pounds 2.5m this year and Pounds 7.5m next year.
Select claims to be building its network with an eye to the bad times, not
the good. Mr Martin said: 'We are prepared to forego some profitability in
the good times to avoid the expense of laying off staff and closing branches
when next there is a downturn.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Clydeport placing gives Pounds 55m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in shares of Clydeport, the privatised port operator on the river
Clyde, will begin on December 8, following the placing with institutions of
43 per cent of the company's issued share capital. The placing, at 133p per
share, values the company at Pounds 54.9m.
Some 14.1m shares were sold on behalf of existing shareholders, while a
further 3.76m shares were issued by the company, raising Pounds 4.1m net of
expenses to redeem preference shares and provide cash.
Montagu Private Equity has reduced its stake in the company from 28 per cent
to 6 per cent, and the stake held by the company's management, employees and
their families has fallen from 67 per cent to 45 per cent. 3i is retaining
its 5 per cent stake.
In the 40 weeks to October 7 1994 Clydeport made pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.1m, including an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.45m from property
transactions, on turnover of Pounds 11.98m. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m
(before the exceptional item) are forecast for the full year.
Earnings per share for the 40 week period to October 7, excluding the
exceptional gain, were 7.66p.
Net dividend for the 40 week period was 1.86p and the notional net dividend
for 1993 would be 3.51p.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RPC edges ahead to Pounds 4.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an increase in the cost of raw materials of up to 60 per cent,
interim pre-tax profits at RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging
manufacturer, edged ahead from Pounds 4.24m to Pounds 4.4m.
Turnover from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 36.5m)
for the half-year to September 30. However, acquisitions took total sales to
Pounds 37m. The accounting period was one week longer in the previous
half-year.
Shares in RPC, which came to the market in May last year, firmed 5p to close
at 144p.
Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said trading for the period had 'gathered
pace after a slow start'. Demand for paint containers was depressed at
first, but activity had picked up well in the second quarter.
Operating margins rose from 12 per cent to 12.6 per cent despite rising
costs for plastic polymers of between 30 and 60 per cent. Mr Marsh said the
group had been able to pass on those costs to customers.
Operating profits on continuing operations rose 5 per cent to Pounds 4.6m
(Pounds 4.39m). Interest payable rose to Pounds 261,000 (Pounds 154,000),
following the acquisition of the industrial containers business of Lawson
Mardon and McKechnie's UK packaging business. Gearing increased from 14 per
cent to 42 per cent.
RPC had negotiated a number of long-term contracts, including Heinz, Colman
and ICI. Some had 'secured the group's supply position well into the second
half of the decade', Mr Marsh said.
Earnings per share slipped 0.1p to 5.3p. The interim dividend is 1.1p (1p).

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forward edges ahead and makes Pounds 3m
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forward Group, the USM-quoted specialist circuit board maker, yesterday
reported a small increase in interim profits and the Pounds 2.96m sale of
its Chemical Express offshoot to its management.
Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 940,000 in the six months to
July 31, on turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.2m). Earnings per share
dipped to 7.5p (8p), but the interim dividend is raised by 25 per cent to
2.5p (2p).
Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said the result, though in line with
expectations, was affected by temporary disruption which occured at Forward
Circuits' Tamworth factory, while a large-scale investment programme in new
inner layer manufacturing capacity was undergoing commissioning trials.
Margins fell temporarily as certain sub-contract services had to be
purchased, he explained. This situation would also have an impact on
second-half results, he said, but trading prospects 'remain very positive.'
Chemical Express together with its subsidiary, the One Stop Chemical Shop,
makes and markets a range of cleaning, maintenance and janitorial products.
But because it is no longer considered part of the group's strategic plan,
it is being sold in a cash deal, which will in the short term, substantially
reduce gearing.
However, Mr Chamberlain said: 'We are currently considering a number of
business opportunities and should negotiations be successfully concluded,
then a substantial proportion of the proceeds will be reinvested in
businesses which strengthen the core activities.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Monarch Resources back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monarch Resources, the London and Toronto-listed group that mines gold in
Venezuela, has reported net income in the third quarter of Dollars 317,000
(Pounds 193,292) compared with a loss of Dollars 1.25m in the comparable
period.
The improvement reflected an 'excellent' performance at the troublesome
Revemin processing plant and the start-up of the low-cost La Comorra mine
during the three months.
The company has decided to change its primary stock exchange listing to
Toronto from December 31 and has advised the London exchange of this
decision.
La Comorra, which started up in the second half of August, produced 3,440
troy ounces of gold at a cash cost of Dollars 292 an ounce. There was an
operating profit of Dollars 270,000 from the mine.
In the quarter the Revemin plant produced 5,103 ounces of gold (4,699 ounces
in 1993) at a cash cost of Dollars 334 an ounce (Dollars 477).
Monarch's net income for the nine months to September 30 was Dollars 835,000
(net loss of Dollars 2.85m). Gold production reached 27,066 ounces (13,995
ounces). The average gold price received in the nine months was Dollars 384
an ounce (Dollars 350).

As forewarned in September, Tomkinsons, the carpet manufacturer, reported a
36 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the year ended October 1 from Pounds
1.13m to Pounds 718,000.
Sales in the period fell to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 20.5m), but margins
suffered from tough market conditions, including 'severe price cutting' and
came through at 4 per cent, against 5.5 per cent previously.
Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, said yesterday that Tomkinsons had experienced
only five months of reasonable trading activity in the 12 months.
On the day in September that the company warned on trading, its shares
declined from 240p to 215p. yesterday they added 2p to 216p.
The final dividend is maintained at 8p, making an unchanged total of 11.5p.
Earnings per share were 7.7p (12.2p).

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Concentric maintains growth with 9%
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concentric, the West Midlands-based engineering group with 60 per cent of
its sales in automotive markets, continued its earnings growth with a 9 per
cent rise in profits and predicted further gains in 1994-95.
The group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits for the year to September
30 were Pounds 10.24m, compared with Pounds 9.36m previously. This puts
earnings comfortably above the level of 1990, the peak year before
recession.
On earnings per share at 12.73p (12.03p), Concentric is lifting the dividend
by 5 per cent from 5.86p to 6.15p, with a recommended final payment of
4.29p.
'We are able to be competitive in most countries and our products and
technology are considered to be attractive. It is from that secure base that
we expect to make further progress this year,' said Mr Tony Firth, the
chairman.
Helped by expanding sales in North America and East Asia, with a stronger
domestic market - 'Europe has been an economic non-event for years,'
according to Mr Firth - Concentric's turnover rose to Pounds 127.9m (Pounds
116.4m). Exports accounted for 32 per cent of sales.
But like other engineering groups, Concentric is experiencing sustained
pressure on its margins. It is, as Mr Firth put it, 'the pig in the middle'
of rising raw material prices and the demands of customers to hold selling
prices. 'We did quite well to hold our margins,' he said.
The pressure on margins led both to further restructuring which cost Pounds
0.4m and to continued capital invest-ment.
Concentric last year spent Pounds 7m on investment, compared with Pounds 8m
in 1992-93, and expects spending to be maintained around this level in
1994-95. 'If you don't spend a lot of money, you're out of the race,'
commented Mr Firth.
The group ended the year with net cash balances of Pounds 8.3m, which is
Pounds 0.4m less than a year before.
The shares were unchanged at 178p.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Strong sales growth lifts CPL Aromas to
Pounds 930,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CPL Aromas, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company floated in June,
boosted interim profits by almost 35 per cent on the back of strong sales
growth.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September rose from Pounds
690,000 to Pounds 930,000. Sales, which are split 40/60 between the UK and
overseas markets, grew from Pounds 8.43m to Pounds 9.76m.
The shares, which were placed at 150p, closed up 1p at 201p yesterday.
Mr Terry Pickthall, the founder and chairman whose family still holds 36 per
cent of the shares, said the group had experienced organic growth across the
board in its markets. 'It's nice to see that our existing operations can
achieve this organic growth before our Aromachem operation starts.'
The group, which raised Pounds 4m in the flotation, is investing in a new
aroma chemicals facility on Teesside. It is expected to start production
next summer, and contribute to profits in 1996-97.
Margins remained flat at 10 per cent in spite of raw material price
increases. Mr Pickthall said the group had been able to find alternative
sources of supply to offset some of the rises.
Net cash at the period-end was Pounds 1.18m. Interest payable fell from
Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 55,000.
Earnings per share were 6.6p (5.9p), and the interim dividend is 1.2p.

IWP International, the Irish household and personal care products and
packaging group, reported a 69 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
IPounds 4.52m to IPounds 7.64m (Pounds 7.54m) for the half year to September
30. Levendaal, the Netherlands-based toiletries group, acquired in October
1993, made a significant contribution.
Mr Joe Moran, chief executive, said: 'The performance was better than we
expected.' He pointed to the 20 per cent rise in earnings per share to
14.53p (12.11p).
Turnover grew 49 per cent to IPounds 72m (IPounds 48.3m), with the
Netherlands accounting for 43 per cent. UK sales fell in the period, while
Irish turnover rose slightly.
The group, which is listed in Dublin and London, has about 20 diversified
subsidiaries in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.
Levendaal's performance more than made up for a static UK market. IWP paid
IPounds 51m for Levendaal. As a result gearing had risen to 76 per cent at
the end of the period.
IWP also announced that it was 'within two weeks' of finalising a management
buy-out of Questel, its UK-based lossmaking television company.
IWP is reviewing marketing strategy to target European countries,
particularly Germany and Scandinavia. It is appointing Mr Neil Popham,
formerly with BP's nutrition subsidiary, as director in charge of household
products and personal care.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.6p (3.25p).

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JM upbeat after jump to Pounds 45m - Strong
performance expected to continue in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, yesterday reported a
record first-half performance and said there was every chance that this
would continue in the second half.
Pre-tax profits increased 28 per cent from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 45.2m,
well ahead of analysts' forecasts. However, the share price fell by 7p to
550p because of market concerns about JM's intentions following its recently
aborted merger talks with Cookson, the specialist industrial materials
group.
Mr David Davies, JM chairman, described the negotiations as 'a worthwhile
exercise', but 'we were two successful companies looking into the future, so
it was not surprising we had differing views about what our values are.'
JM was now seeking selective acquisitions and looking at eight or nine
potential purchases in the electronics field, mainly in North America. The
first should be completed before the end of 1994.
Mr Davies said that JM's determination to reduce costs was bearing fruit.
Net revenues from continuing operations in the six months to September 30
rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 201.5m.
To underline its confidence JM is lifting the interim dividend by 24 per
cent to 4.2p (3.4p) on earnings per share of 16p (14.6p).
On a divisional basis, operating profit rose 36 per cent to Pounds 18.3m in
materials technology; catalytic systems increased 20 per cent to Pounds
15.9m; precious metals' input was up by 7 per cent to 10.8m; and profit in
colour and print (now merged into Cookson Matthey Ceramics) advanced by 25
per cent to Pounds 6.4m.
COMMENT
It must have been frustrating for Mr Davies to have reported record interim
results, promised a similar performance in the second half and then seen
Johnson Matthey's share price fall. But he must take some of the blame.
First came his comments in his annual statement last year about wanting JM
to become a FT-SE 100 stock and then there were the recent Cookson capers.
So the market is understandably nervous about the possibility of a big
acquisition that would require a substantial issue of new equity. Mr Davies
was telling analysts yesterday that there would not be a hostile bid from
either side while the present JM and Cookson management teams were in place.
He indicated that JM would return to its old style - getting bigger via
friendly acquisitions and organic growth. But it will take time for the
market to regain confidence. That aside, there is no doubting JM's
potential. The group will probably earn at least Pounds 90m before tax for
the full year and last night's share price represented 16 times earnings.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia Investments declines to Pounds
22.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family,
saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 25m to Pounds 22.7m in the six months
to September 30 and warned that it would be 'challenging' to improve on last
year's record Pounds 45.2m annual profits.
The shares fell 25p to 660p, compared with net assets of 645p, down from
681p at the start of the year.
Operating profits, which exclude disposal gains, edged up to Pounds 23m
(Pounds 22m) helped by a strong improvement at Exco, the recently floated
money broker where Caledonia retains a 27 per cent stake.
But Exco has warned of subdued trading in the third quarter, while Bristow
Helicopters, Caledonia's other large associate, is suffering from increased
competition and reduced activity in the North Sea.
In addition, Caledonia has made two significant investments recently which
will not contribute to its results until next year.
It has spent Dollars 44m (Pounds 26.8m) on a one-third interest in Sun
International Investments, which owns the Paradise Island resort in the
Bahamas; and it has paid Pounds 20m for a 29.9 per cent holding in Ivory &amp;
Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group.
After a higher tax charge, earnings per share dropped to 16p (18.9p), but
the interim dividend is raised by 0.3p to 5.7p.
Of the 36p drop in assets per share over the first half, 20p represents the
write-off of goodwill on the Ivory &amp; Sime acquisition. Caledonia has written
off a total of 60p a share of purchased goodwill. 'By any objective
yardstick it is hard to regard this write-off as necessary,' the company
said. Assets per share have also been affected in the period by the fall in
value of Caledonia's stakes in The Telegraph and Close Brothers.
Trading profits rose to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.3m) reflecting progress at
Amber, Abacus and, particularly, Clan Asset Management.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlain Phipps rises fourfold in maiden
interims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe components and footwear group, reported maiden
interim results showing a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits, and
announced its first acquisition since it returned to the market in August.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 jumped from Pounds 1.05m to
Pounds 4.5m, on turnover doubled from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 66.6m. The
profits figure included an Pounds 800,000 reorganisation charge and, for the
first time, results from Chamberlain's French operations bought just over a
year ago.
Mr Dan Sullivan, the US-born chairman, said that, on a like-for-like basis,
pre-tax profits for the half-year rose by about 21 per cent to just over
Pounds 5m. Sales on a like-for-like basis, excluding disposals, had been
flat.
The materials division, which includes the footwear components business
formerly owned by Evode, improved operating profits from Pounds 1.32m to
Pounds 1.62m, on sales 23 per cent down at Pounds 19.6m. Mr Sullivan said
trading in the UK continued to be difficult, although the division had
enjoyed strong export growth of about 15 per cent.
The footwear business, including SAC and Thierry which were not consolidated
into the group's results at flotation, increased operating profits from
Pounds 391,000 to Pounds 4.19m. Sales jumped from Pounds 6.59m to Pounds
47m.
Chamberlain also announced a conditional agreement to acquire Ouest Parts,
the largest supplier of components to the French shoe industry, for about
FFr74m (Pounds 8.79m) in cash. Last year the group returned profits of about
Pounds 1.4m and had net assets of about Pounds 2.2m. Mr Sullivan said he
expected to expand further in continental Europe, and Chamberlain was
currently in discussions about a second purchase.
Chamberlain finished the first half with net debt representing almost 90 per
cent of shareholders' funds. This was expected to fall to about 60 per cent
by the year-end.
The group declared a maiden dividend of 2.7p. Earnings rose from 6.7p to
7.9p. On a pro forma basis earnings rose to 7.7p.
Chamberlain's shares, floated at 165p in August, closed 3p up at 183p.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kleeneze warns of only small profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleeneze Holdings' shares lost 12 per cent yesterday after the home shopping
concern warned that it expected only a small profit for the year to August
31, compared with Pounds 1.06m.
However as a mark of its confidence in its prospects, it said the full year
dividend would be not less than 1.5p, against 1p.
The shares fell 18p to 138p yesterday.
The company blamed weak control over the recruitment of new agents during
1993 and 1994, which had led to the need for a bad debt provision of about
Pounds 1m.
This was in addition to the previously announced adverse impact of operating
losses and losses on the disposal of The Leading Edge, estimated at Pounds
1.5m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Osborne &amp; Little rises 60%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing recovery in the UK coupled with a 28 per cent rise in US sales
enabled Osborne &amp; Little, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics group, to
hoist pre-tax profits by 60 per cent from Pounds 947,000 to Pounds 1.51m in
the six months to September 30.
With turnover up 28 per cent at Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 9.1m) continued cost
controls helped operating margins rise 2 percentage points to 12.8 per cent.
Earnings were 15.15p (9.33p) and the interim dividend is raised to 3.5p
(2.5p).
Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said the second half continued to perform well.
Although the company would incur the initial costs of setting up its French
operation and an additional UK warehouse, he was 'confident of an excellent
outcome for the year.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Continuing problems at ASME hit Billam
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing problems at its Aircraft and Sheet Metal Engineers subsidiary are
expected to lead to J Billam, the precision engineering company, reporting a
loss for the calendar year.
The shares fell 19p to 123p yesterday. After the company warned of a
downturn at ASME 12 months ago the shares fell 50p to 219p and they ended
10p down at 134p in September after reorganisation costs at the offshoot
contributed to lower interim pre-tax profits.
The Sheffield-based company also announced that it had appointed Mr Barry
Truman, as group chief executive, to help sort out ASME and then return
Billam to growth. Mr Truman, has been a non-executive director for almost
five years and has served in senior management positions within the
industry.
Mr Stephen Ingram, chairman, said the problems at ASME were irritating and
frustrating. 'We have not lost any customers, but the disruption caused by
the restructuring and the state of the aerospace market have left the
company in losses.
'We are paying the short-term price for longer term benefits.'
He added that the restructuring was almost complete and 1995 should see a
return to profits.
Billam's other activities were performing satisfactorily, but were not
making enough to cover the ASME losses. However, the company expects to be
able to hold the final dividend at 3.1p for an unchanged total of 5.3p.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL shareholders resolve to keep 'playing
fields level'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in VSEL, the nuclear submarine builder which is the subject of
competing bids from GEC and British Aerospace, last night voted unanimously
for a resolution enabling GEC to buy more than 15 per cent of its shares -
but only if and when an unconditional offer from the company is accepted by
a majority of VSEL shareholders, writes Our Financial Staff.
The resolution, passed at an egm, was similar to one passed which allows BAe
to acquire more than 15 per cent if its offer is accepted. VSEL chairman
Lord Chalfont said the latest move was an enabling measure to keep the
playing fields level.
Lord Chalfont said his company was still advising shareholders to take no
action over either bid until competition issues are settled by the Office of
Fair Trading.
He said he hoped that a simultaneous decision on whether to refer bids to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would be taken by December 7.
Shareholders are awaiting a response from GEC to the revised Pounds 573m bid
made for VSEL by BAe last Friday, topping GEC's bid by Pounds 41m.

Kiln Capital, a planned new listed company investing in Lloyd's of London,
has raised Pounds 25m via a share placing.
Kiln plans to invest exclusively in insurance syndicates managed by the RJ
Kiln managing agency, unlike many other Lloyd's investment companies which
have spread funds across a range of syndicates. Dealings are expected to
start on December 1.
The company has also made an offer to some Names to subscribe for up to 2m
ordinary shares at 100p each.
Plans for corporate investment in Lloyd's have been affected this year by
the lacklustre performance of existing corporate vehicles.
Mr Colin Murray, chairman of RJ Kiln, said he was 'delighted' with the

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Porton shareholders say yes to Pounds 65.5m
French bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Porton International's institutional shareholders yesterday backed a Pounds
65.5m recommended bid for the UK biotechnology company from Beaufour Ipsen,
the family-owned French pharmaceuticals group.
Shareholders controlling 88.9 per cent of Porton's shares, which are traded
under the Stock Exchange's Rule 4.2, agreed to accept the French bid worth
Pounds 13.40 in cash or notes by the 3pm deadline yesterday.
Under a separate deal Speywood, a company set up by Beaufour and Porton's
management to make the acquisition, has also agreed to acquire an additional
5.7 per cent stake in Porton.
These shares, together with the valid acceptances of the offer, lifted the
total number of Porton shares being acquired to 6.69m or 94.6 per cent of
the outstanding capital, comfortably above the 90 per cent target
. As a result, the offer has become unconditional and will remain open for
further acceptances.
The French group, advised by Lazard Brothers, held irrevocable undertakings
covering 66.2 per cent of the equity, including a 36.6 per cent stake held
by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, Porton's founder and ex-chairman ahead of the
deadline.
Victory had looked increasingly certain after institutional investors,
disappointed by Porton's financial performance, backed the bid which was
recommended by Kleinwort Benson, Porton's financial advisers.
Meanwhile, a potential rival offer for Porton from Scotgen Pharmaceuticals,
the Anglo-US drugs company, failed to materialise.
The acquisition has been structured as a leveraged buyout with Porton's
management taking an initial 22 per cent stake in Speywood on completion.
Subject to the company's performance, this management stake could could rise
as high as 35 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fenchurch advances to Pounds 7.79m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenchurch, the insurance broker which gained a stock market listing in
November last year, reported pre-tax up from Pounds 4.56m to Pounds 7.79m in
the year to September 30.
The result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 284,000 (Pounds
1.59m) and Pounds 58,000 profits (Pounds 875,000 losses) from discontinued
activities.
Pro forma pre-tax profits on continuing operations, assuming the flotation
took place at the beginning of the financial year, showed a 15 per cent
increase to Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 6.9m).
Earnings per share were 15p (10.6p) with the pro forma figure rising 16 per
cent to 14.1p (12.2p). The proposed final dividend of 5.4p makes 8p for the
full year.
Mr Roger Earl, chief executive, said: 'We want to continue this good and
consistent growth.' Market conditions were difficult, however, and would
continue to be tough during the next year.
Turnover rose to Pounds 32.3m (Pounds 31.2m) with Pounds 679,000 (Pounds
3.1m) from discontinued activities. UK retail turnover increased 5.5 per
cent to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.9m), including a 25 per cent increase from
the Protection House Insurance Services division, despite competition from
direct line insurers.
Since August Fenchurch has acquired a specialist insurer, a financial
consultancy and a minority stake in a provider of health risk management
services. The reinsurance business continued to grow, with turnover up from
Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 2m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 8.3% dividend increase from South West
Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South West Water yesterday announced a better-than-expected dividend
increase, despite reporting flat pre-tax profits for the first half.
The 8.3 per cent increase in the dividend from 8.4p to 9.1p compares with
expectations of about 6 per cent. This helped the shares resist the worst of
a 2 per cent decline in the sector, fuelled by fears of a general election.
South West fell by just over 1 per cent, from 486p to 481p. ed
South West announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.6m for the six months to
September 30, against Pounds 50.3m last time.
Sales were 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 143m, while earnings per share fell
by 0.5 per cent to 38.2p.
The pre-tax figure was depressed by a Pounds 3.5m rationalisation charge and
a Pounds 7.8m increase in interest payments to Pounds 12.6m.
The return was also hit by charges of Pounds 300,000 to cover the costs of
South West's appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the price
limits set by the industry regulator for the five years between 1995 and
2000.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, would not specify how much the appeal was
likely to cost South West, but said a further charge was expected in the
second half. A decision on the appeal is expected in March.
The regulated business returned pre-tax profits 4 per cent lower at Pounds
49m because of the rationalisation costs. About 140 jobs had been cut,
leaving 2,100 employees in the utility operation. Mr Hill said that,
excluding the additional treatment works, costs had been held at levels
similar to last year's.
South West's non-core division, which includes waste haulage, construction
and environmental businesses, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m,
against a loss of Pounds 700,000 last time.
COMMENT
South West has come out with the lowest dividend increase so far in the
sector's reporting season and, given the uncertainties it faces, this is no
great surprise. The MMC appeal is expected to cast a shadow over the shares
for another six months. The company also faces flat to minimal earnings
growth over the next few years. So, to provide meaningul dividend growth,
its cover will have to be eroded more quickly than that of its peers. This
would not be a problem, except that its peers will be increasing their
earnings while trimming dividend cover. Forecasts are for about Pounds 96m
this year. In the shorter term, the stock will be buoyed by its substantial
yield of more than 7 per cent. However, there may be others where yields are
almost as attractive but prospects for growth are better.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr rebels likely to claim first blood in
family feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rebel shareholders of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust were ready to claim
first blood today in the family feud over the future of the motor and
leisure group.
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, seemed likely to lose the vote on the board's
proposals to reform the two-tier share structure at its EGM in Leeds.
The company is understood to have received proxy votes representing more
than 50 per cent of ordinary voting shares from the rebels, led by Mr Barr's
nephews, Nicholas and Robert Barr.
They have pledged to vote down the board's plans to enfranchise the
non-voting A shares, owned almost entirely by institutional shareholders.
The Barr brothers have called on their uncle to step down as chairman, as
part of their strategy to run the group's two divisions as stand-alone
businesses.
They have also requisitioned their own EGM next week to unseat Mr Brian
Parker, the chief executive and Mr Brian Small, the finance director.
Negotiations between the warring parties failed to arrive at a compromise
yesterday, despite an earlier offer from Malcolm Barr to resign as chairman.
The brothers yesterday announced they had changed the trustees holding their
own shares, after discovering that their previous trustee also held shares
for Mr Parker and Mr Small.
Nicholas and Robert Barr, who are the sons of the late managing director
Stuart Barr, speak for almost 30 per cent of ordinary shares. Malcolm Barr,
who is also the outgoing chairman of Leeds Permanent Building Society, owns
16 per cent of the ordinary shares.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Quadramatic maintains its programme with
Kestrel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quadramatic, the coin-handling and optical group which came to market in
July 1993, has continued its promised programme of acquisitions with the
purchase of Kestrel Injection Moulders, a maker of precision plastic
injection mouldings, for up to Pounds 6.65m.
At the time of the flotation, Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, said he wanted to
build a specialist engineering group by acquisition.
The initial net cash consideration for Kestrel is Pounds 4.4m, after the
Pounds 1m sale and leaseback of a Kestrel freehold property to certain of
its vendors. An additional deferred amount of up to Pounds 2.25m, in cash or
shares, is profits-related.
Plymouth-based Kestrel made pre-tax profits of Pounds 855,000 on Pounds
4.19m turnover in the year ended May 31. In the six months to March,
Quadramatic made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.72m on turnover of Pounds
17.6m. Quadramatic's flotation was followed in November 1993 by the Pounds
11.25m acquisition of Quota, a private holding company for two high-tech
businesses.
Mr Glenn Powers, finance director, said originally the group wanted four
divisions - hence its name - but that now the building of an equally
weighted three was going well. Coin handling remained the biggest, followed
by instruments and then plastic moulding.
The group would think about a fourth when the market capitalisation
approached the Pounds 150m mark. The shares rose 3p yesterday to 168p for a
valuation of about Pounds 66.5m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Extra space boosts Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in selling space helped Storehouse, owner of the BHS and
Mothercare retail chains, to lift interim sales by 7 per cent and operating
profits from retailing by a third. The dividend is raised for the first time
in seven years.
Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said the group had added 80,000 sq ft to
its BHS sales space in the half, equivalent to adding three stores. The
group was aiming to add at least 20 new BHS stores to the present 125 in the
next three years, including nine this financial year.
While the spread is national, the group feels there is potential for at
least 200.
Sales for the 28 weeks to October 15 grew from Pounds 484.9m to Pounds
519.2m. Like-for-like sales were up 5 per cent.
At the pre-tax level, profits doubled to Pounds 24.2m, against Pounds 11.6m
struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.4m. Operating profits from
retailing rose from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 22.8m. Earnings per share
increased from 1.4p to 3.9p, and the interim dividend is 2.7p (2.5p).
The shares closed yesterday down 5p at 214p.
The group is cash positive, with Pounds 29.5m. Mr Dick Steele, who joined as
finance director from Lloyds Chemists early this year, said it was the first
time the group had not had net borrowings in the run up to Christmas.
Total costs rose by 5 per cent. 'We could have held the increase below 5 per
cent, but we are in an investing phase,' said Mr Steele.
The group has reduced the number of its suppliers from 1,000 in 1989 to 300.
At BHS, which has benefited from a TV advertising campaign, operating
profits rose from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 18.8m and sales from Pounds 337.2m
to Pounds 356.9m. BHS retail margins improved from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per
cent.
The Mothercare stores, which are rapidly being converted to a new format,
doubled operating profits from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4.2m on sales ahead
from Pounds 140.9m to Pounds 155m. Margins improved from 1.5 per cent to 2.7
per cent.
The loss at Blazer was halved from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 200,000 on the
back of a sales increase from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 22.8m.
COMMENT
The fall in the share price probably reflects disappointment that the
results were a little below the market's best hopes. Nevertheless, these are
encouraging figures, showing that the recent good housekeeping is starting
to pay off. Both BHS and Mothercare have a lot of catching up to do in the
retail sector, but the returns are improving and the balance sheet is good.
Better buying and better stock management are being coupled with rebuilding
the strong Mothercare brand and sorting out a firm identity for the BHS
brand as a value-driven family clothing chain. Pencilled in profits of
Pounds 105m for 1995-96 put the group on a prospective multiple of 12.5 -
not that demanding for a retailer with the rare combination of both growth
and recovery prospects.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin up 22% to Pounds 2.63m as
output rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher distillery output and bulk whisky sales helped Macdonald Martin
Distilleries achieve a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
2.16m to Pounds 2.63m in the six months to September 30.
Turnover was up 25 per cent at Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.1m).
Sales of Glenmorangie, the company's leading malt, rose 15 per cent in
volume terms and 19 per cent in value because of strong overseas demand,
particularly in the US and France. Shipments in the UK were flat, but retail
sales increased.
In blended whisky, sales were up 7 per cent in volume, but down 7 per cent
in value terms. Bulk sales of blended whisky increased, but bottled sales
were down 10 per cent overall.
The downturn was marked in the UK, where volume sales of bottled blends fell
by 25 per cent. The group lost a large own-label order from a supermarket
chain after it declined to lower its price.
Distillery production doubled in the first half, mainly to increase the
group's stocks. Mr James Fyfe, deputy managing director, estimated that
capacity utilisation would average 69 per cent this year, against 43 per
cent previously.
Sales of Crabbie's Green Ginger Wine, acquired a year ago, were in line with
forecasts and its market share had increased, but the profit contribution
'was modest.'
The exceptional item of Pounds 440,000 included just over Pounds 300,000 in
compensation to Mr Neil McKerrow who resigned as managing director in June.
The balance was start up costs of an Indian joint venture, which will begin
bottling Highland Queen next month.
The board declared a 10 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 2.5p
(2.266p) on the A shares and to 1.25p (1.133p) on the B shares. Earnings per
share were 12.73p (10.46p) and 6.36p (5.23p) on the respective classes.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: City of London PR rises 22% to Pounds
394,000 at interim stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City of London PR Group, the USM-traded specialist investor relations and
market research company, yesterday announced a 22 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits and said the second half should 'at least match' the Pounds
394,000 just announced.
On sales of Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 1.29m) in the six months to September 30,
operating profit was 39 per cent up at Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 124,000),
despite some softness in the market research business. Profit on disposal of
investments came to Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 23,000).
The interim is increased to 1.4p (1.27p) on earnings per share of 3.71p
(3.17p).

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Widows acts to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Widows, a life insurer which sells largely through independent
advisers, yesterday became the latest company in the sector to move to cut
costs, announcing the closure of 12 branch processing offices and the loss
of 143 jobs.
At the same time, it took a further step in changing its product range,
launching a new set of life insurance policies with a choice of how
commission is paid to the adviser. More changes to its pension plans are
expected early next month.
All life companies are facing increased pressure to reduce costs before next
year, when new regulations will force them to give customers more
information about charges and commission.
Widows' job losses mean that the clerical staff supporting its service to
independent advisers will be almost halved. It cannot rule out compulsory
redundancies, but hopes the target number can be met through voluntary
arrangements. The sales force will remain broadly the same size.
The company says that operating from six regional processing centres outside
Edinburgh will enable it to offer advisers a more efficient and reliable
service.

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Business Post rises sharply to Pounds 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Business Post, the express parcel delivery company, rose 15p to
154p yesterday, after it revealed that the recent expansion of its network
of hubs helped achieve 24 per cent sales growth and improved profit margins.
Pre-tax profits rose 74 per cent to Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 2.19m) in the six
months to September 30, well ahead of analysts' expectations, and the
company said the momentum was continuing. October sales rose 26 per cent.
The group sustained average price rises of 1.6 per cent in April, despite
what remains an extremely competitive market, given the existence of about
20 competitors with national networks.
In addition, it was now reaping the benefits of increased capacity and a
more efficient network, following investment in the expansion of several
regional 'hubs'.
Turnover rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 23.6m and operating profit margins
increased from 11.7 per cent to 15.6 per cent. This partly reflected the
high level of fixed costs within the business.
The trend should be more pronounced in the second half, as the business has
a seasonal bias because of the summer lull. Last year, 55 per cent of
Business Post's revenue came in the second half.
In addition, UK Mail, its door-to-door mail delivery service was suspended
in March, after contributing losses in the second half of 1993/1994.
Capital expenditure peaked in 1993, falling from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds
1.73m at the interim stage. It is likely to stay at about that level in the
second half.
It is increasing the dividend by 58 per cent to 1.9p (1.2p), roughly in line
with earnings per share, which rose 55 per cent to 5.1p (3.3p).

FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik faces delay at gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bakyrchik Gold, floated in London last year to invest in a mine in
Kazakhstan, yesterday reported a two-month delay in commissioning its stage
1 sulphide ore processing plant. This would hold back the forecast initial
annual rate of output - 30,000 troy ounces of gold - until January or
February next year, said Mr Kevin Foo, managing director.
In the meantime, however, following the recent placing and open offer which
raised Pounds 25.1m, operation of the Bakyrchik gold mine, on Kazakhstan's
north eastern steppes, was being transferred to the Bakyrchik joint venture
in which the London-quoted company has 40 per cent.
The delay in commissioning the process plant was caused by the failure of
the associate oxygen plant and an imposed closure by the Kazakh authorities,
who insisted on compliance with practices followed within the former Soviet
Union. The Redox sulphide plant itself operated effectively when it had been
run at design temperature and pressure. Recovery rates of 90 per cent of the
gold were achieved.
In line with expectations, Bakyrchik reported a pre-tax loss of Dollars
726,000 (Pounds 442,682) for the half-year to September 30, compared with a
Dollars 67,000 deficit previously.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Japanese banks fail to arrest slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The long earnings slump at Japanese banks showed no signs of abating
yesterday as the leading lenders reported sharply lower profits for the six
months to the end of September.
The gradual removal of the pile of bad loans accumulated in the collapse of
the Japanese property market in the past few years was reflected in bigger
write-offs of bad debts. The provisions for problem loans caused a further
slide in pre-tax profits, but they also began to make inroads into the
outstanding total of disclosed bad loans, which now appears to have passed
its peak.
But the asset quality problems were compounded by rising interest rates and
weak demand for lending which cut into banks' core business profits.
Aggregate operating profits at the 11 leading banks fell 6 per cent from a
year earlier to Y1,092bn (Pounds 7bn). Write-offs of bad loans cut pre-tax
profits 41 per cent to Y233bn.
Between them the 11 banks wrote off Y1,341bn in non-performing loans, up 60
per cent. The outstanding balance of non-performing loans fell by Y222bn to
Y8,726bn. But these figures include only loans to bankrupt borrowers and
loans on which no interest has been paid for at least six months. They do
not include restructured loans, where interest rates have been pared to keep
borrowers from going under. Real problem loan totals are thought to be up to
double the disclosed figures.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Direct Line soars amid price war fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears about the impact of an insurance premium price war hit Direct Line,
the UK's largest private motor insurer, yesterday in spite of a doubling in
its pre-tax profits.
Shares in the company's parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland, fell 17 1/2 p to
425p after Direct Line admitted fierce competition had led to a slight fall
in its operating efficiency.
Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive who founded Direct Line in 1985,
emphasised the company's progress in building on customer base by selling
personal loans and mortgages.
City analysts were disappointed at lower-than-expected growth in the number
of motor and household policies sold by Direct Line and suggested
competitive pressures affecting all insurance companies meant its profits
growth would slow.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 110.1m in the year to September - up from Pounds
50.2m last time.
The latest figure includes the Pounds 21.4m payment last January to Mr Wood
after he was bought out by the Royal Bank of Scotland and placed on a
salary.
Several leading City securities houses cut profit forecasts for next year to
about Pounds 130m-Pounds 140m. 'In a competitive, cyclical market, companies
like this must eventually have cyclical earnings,' said Mr Trevor May,
insurance analyst at BZW.
Direct Line said competitive pressures, marketing expenses and investment in
improving accidental damage management, had led to a 'marginal' increase in
its expenses-to-premiums ratio. Total premiums written rose to Pounds 608.2m
from Pounds 409.5m.
Direct Line also announced plans for its first expansion outside the UK  - a
joint venture with Bankinter, the Spanish bank. Mr Wood described Spain's
motor insurance sector as similar to the UK's a decade ago and he expected a
'substantial' market share within a few years. But he acknowledged Direct
Line's new venture would not make profits for some time. The company's
mortgage and personal loans operations were not included in this year's
results. Its life insurance operations start trading early next year.
Direct Line will begin pilot sales of a range of retail savings products
next February or March and plans a launch three months later. The Bank of
England plans to authorise it as a deposit-taker.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Taking a hard line on soft commission: The fund manager's
'free lunch' comes under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, RICHARD WATERS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soft commissions, often criticised as the proverbial free lunch for fund
managers, are under scrutiny by regulators around the world.
Last week Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management group,
disclosed that, from next January, it will no longer deal under soft
commissions agreements. These arrangements (known in the US as 'soft
dollars') involve a broker paying for goods and services for a fund manager,
in return for receiving a minimum amount of commissions from the manager.
MAM is 75 per cent owned by investment bank SG Warburg, which itself is an
active soft commission broker. The fund manager says its decision is largely
a reflection of the growing resistance among UK pension funds to soft
commissions.
Critics claim that soft commissions lead to a subtle form of bribery in
which fund managers, eager to obtain the free goods and services, 'churn'
client accounts to generate the requisite level of income. Moreover, there
is a fear that in order to meet the targets, fund managers direct business
through brokers who may not offer the best prices for securities.
'Softed' services typically include research provided by a third party, or
information services such as Reuters or Bloomberg screens - services which
fund managers would normally have to pay for themselves. 'If I didn't accept
soft commissions, I would have to either lower my profits or raise my fees,'
said one leading UK fund manager.
Fund managers say the softed services make them better at their jobs, and so
benefit clients. And soft commission brokers say there is nothing much
different between their activities and those of stockbrokers: in both cases,
fund managers are paying commissions to receive services (research material,
in the case of traditional brokers).
Many regulators are unconvinced. US Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman Mr Arthur Levitt said the practice 'doesn't feel right, smell right
or taste right'. This is despite the fact that, at around Dollars 750m in
1993, or 30 per cent of all commissions paid, the business is a large
practice in the US.
Regulators around the world are following a similar pattern in trying to
control the business: first they have sought to restrict the range of goods
or services available under 'softing' deals, and then they have pushed for
better disclosure.
In developed markets such as the US and UK, the first steps were taken in
the 1980s, and attention has now switched to disclosure. The SEC is expected
to publish proposals for greater disclosure of soft commission arrangements
in January. Mr Ken Berman, an SEC staff member working on the proposal, says
the result is likely to be a requirement for fund managers to produce 'some
kind of report to investors that deals only with soft dollars'. For the
first time, fund managers are expected to give details of the amount of soft
commissions they engage in, and the services they receive.
In many developing markets, - particularly in Asia, where soft commissions
have soared on a wave of equity investment from the US - regulation is still
at the first stage.
In Hong Kong, regulators have proposed restricting the practice of giving
fund managers cash rebates for minimum levels of business - a variation on
softing which is already banned in the US and UK. According to solicitors
Linklaters and Paines, softed goods and services in Hong Kong can include
tickets to sporting events, and it is difficult to see how these benefit the
end-client.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission is proposing to ban cash
rebates unless prior consent of the end-client has been obtained, and to ban
fund managers from accepting softed services that do not demonstrably
benefit clients. It also proposes that transactions with 'connected persons'
 -such as the stockbroking arm of a fund manager's parent company - must be
conducted at arm's length.
Meanwhile, regulators say that the increasingly international nature of
investment has made soft commissions more difficult to regulate. Indeed,
critics of Hong Kong's efforts to crack down on soft commission abuses point
out that local fund managers may be prompted to move their businesses to
rival centres such as Singapore or Tokyo. MAM says the one part of its
business which will still accept soft commissions is a small unit-trust
operation in Tokyo.
While soft commissions are just arriving in developing markets, the practice
is fast being overtaken in developed countries such as the US by an
alternative practice.
'Directed commissions' involve a fund manager's own client capturing the
benefit of commission payments, rather than the fund manager. Clients ask
their fund manager to arrange for part of their commissions to be directed
to a broker who will pay for services such as the client's own performance
measurement fees, or fees for investment consultancy.
According to Greenwich Associates, the US consulting firm, around a half of
all US pension funds engage in directed commissions. As the practice
spreads, it seems certain it will eat into fund managers' profits.
'The real question we are debating is 'Who does commission really belong
to?',' said one fund manager. 'Increasingly, the fund manager's client is
seeing commission as his asset, not the fund manager's'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Decision expected on foreign role in Telekom sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government will today end weeks of waiting by naming which US or
European bank will play the main foreign role in the DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn)
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
The announcement by the postal ministry at a press conference in Bonn
follows several days of uncertainty about when the names would be made
known. The decision was expected on Monday and then postponed. Because
Deutsche Telekom intends to list its shares in the US, the position is
almost certain to go to a New York-based bank.
Merrill Lynch of the US is regarded as one of the strongest candidates, with
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers also prominent among the
22 banks which made presentations in Bonn. Some bankers said the government
favours Merrill Lynch, while it is understood that Deutsche Telekom's choice
is for Goldman Sachs.
Among UK banks hoping for a parallel or subordinate foreign role are
Kleinwort Benson, SG Warburg and NM Rothschild. European banks have lobbied
strongly for one of them to play a prominent part in the issue, scheduled
for the first half of 1996, because of the experience of UK investment
houses in handling large privatisation deals. They have also argued their
case on political grounds.
Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank are expected to be appointed joint lead
managers of the issue, in which a quarter of Telekom's shares will be sold
in the first privatisation tranche; the second will take place in 1998.
Dresdner Bank is likely to oversee the domestic share side and Deutsche Bank
the international.
Like the recent privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, which
raised just over DM1bn, the Deutsche Telekom issue is expected to be
'ring-fenced' with banks restricted to consortiums covering geographical
areas.
The DM530m share offer by Hanover Re, the world's fifth-largest reinsurance
group, was subscribed twice over with foreign investors taking more of the
issue than expected, Commerzbank, the lead manager, said yesterday.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Mexican setback for Allied Domecq: Further progress expected
in second half from Spanish purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Domecq, the drinks and retailing group, reported a 16.5 per cent rise
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 310m despite a setback in the Mexican
spirits market.
With spirits, wine and retailing showing only marginal growth overall,
financial items accounted for almost all the rise in profits from Pounds
266m a year earlier. Finance charges fell by Pounds 20m to Pounds 80m while
disposals brought a Pounds 2m profit against a loss of Pounds 21m a year
ago.
Trading profits rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 388m on turnover up 5.5 per cent at
Pounds 2.87bn. Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the group would make
further progress in the second half thanks to underlying growth and a full
contribution from Domecq, the Spanish drinks group Allied acquired earlier
this year for Pounds 809m.
Domecq, which contributed two months' trading profits to the first half,
suffered a 5 per cent fall in sales volumes in Mexico because of political
and economic uncertainty. Allied said the local market should recover next
year. In contrast, Domecq's Spanish volumes rose 13 per cent. Integration of
Domecq into the group was going well, the company said.
Trading profits from Allied's existing spirits and wines businesses rose
Pounds 1m to Pounds 153m. In the UK, Teacher's whisky, Beefeater gin and
Harveys sherry increased market shares.
Retailing profits rose Pounds 5m to Pounds 118m with underlying profits up
5.4 per cent. Return from leased pubs were flat but managed pubs' profits
were up 6 per cent. Drink sales rose 5 per cent and food sales 20 per cent.
Profits at Victoria Wine, the off-licence chain, were up 35 per cent thanks
to the acquisition of Augustus Barnett but only 1 per cent without its
inclusion.
In the US, like-for-like sales at Dunkin' Donuts grew 4 per cent and at
Baskin-Robbins, the ice cream chain, by 1.5 per cent.
Profits at Carlsberg-Tetley, the group's UK brewing joint venture with
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, fell 9 per cent. Its beer volumes rose 1.5 per
cent while the UK market slipped 0.5 per cent. Margins were hurt by
discounting and growth of the lower margin take-home trade.
'We are looking for stability rather than profit growth' at the joint
venture, said Mr Hales.
The board declared an interim dividend of 7.75p a share, up 6.2 per cent.
Earnings per share were 18p against 14.8p including the exceptional items or
17.8p against 17.1p without. The group is changing its year-end to August
31, effective next year.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Government gives go-ahead for privatising Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least 51 per cent of Railtrack, owner of Britain's railway tracks,
signalling equipment and stations, will be sold in the life of the present
parliament, the government said yesterday. But it drew back from setting a
target date for the sell-off.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats condemned the plan as a 'hare-brained'
scheme likely to destroy the rail network.
The Freight Transport Association, whose members account for 90 per cent of
rail freight, warned that the rail industry must take more account of the
needs of its customers, particularly after the paralysing four-month strike
of signal workers in the summer.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, told parliament the timing of the
flotation depended on stock market conditions. But everyone would have the
opportunity to buy shares, he added.
A leaked government memo obtained this week by the Labour party mentioned a
target date of the first three months of 1996.
The sale of Railtrack is a key element of the government's
rail-privatisation programme alongside the franchising of passenger-train
operations and the auctioning of three newly created rolling stock leasing
companies.
Originally, ministers planned to sell Railtrack later in the privatisation
programme but franchising has taken longer than expected.
Railtrack assets have been notionally valued by the Treasury at Pounds
6.5bn, though City estimates are closer to Pounds 4bn. The company owns more
than 10,000 miles of track, 2,500 stations and employs about 12,000 people.
Mr Mawhinney said that the flotation would allow more use to be made of
private sector skills in managing the network and would encourage investment
by Railtrack and independent providers of private capital in upgrading
Britain's rail network.
The Railways Act of 1993 included powers to privatise the railway network
and no further parliamentary approval is needed.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow transport secretary, said the sale had nothing to
do with transport policy but was driven 'entirely by the desperate desire .
. . to make a quick financial killing to finance Tory tax cuts in time for
the next election.' Labour was committed to a publicly owned rail system and
would fight privatisation 'tooth and nail'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Tory MPs advise on trade with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, WILLIAM LEWIS and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Conservative MPs, including the parliamentary assistant to Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary, have been advising a commercial lobby group
which wants to increase trade between Iraq and the UK.
The two are Mr Henry Bellingham, parliamentary private secretary to Mr
Rifkind, and Mr Michael Colvin, chairman of the Conservative foreign affairs
committee.
They have been advising the Iraqi British Interests (IBI) Group - a lobby
association which in August organised one of the first British trade
delegations to Baghdad since the Gulf war. Sanctions were imposed on Iraq in
August 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait. 'They have advised us on who to
speak to in Whitehall if we want to seek advice on how to avoid breaking
United Nations sanctions, how would we do so,' said Mr Edmund Sykes,
secretary of the IBI. Mr Bellingham said: 'I have no regular contacts with
the IBI.' Mr Colvin was unavailable for comment.
Some 34 British and European companies will exhibit in Baghdad next week in
an attempt to win contracts from the Iraqi government. Companies from
Germany, France, Austria, Spain and Britain involved in the health and water
treatment sectors will exhibit at two trade fairs in Baghdad organised from
the UK by Orient Exhibitions, a Kent-based company.
Mr Andrew Maclean, one of Orient's directors, said communication licences,
issued by the Department of Trade and Industry, had been obtained by 17 UK
concerns, enabling them to talk directly to the Iraqis.
Mr Maclean said the companies attending the fair included Zeneca, the
pharmaceutical group; Weir Pumps, the Glasgow-based engineering group; and
Johnson &amp; Johnson, a leading supplier of medical products.
'Iraq has been a major market in the past and we are confident it will be in
the future. We want to be in position when sanctions are lifted,' said Sir
Ron Garrick, managing director and chief executive of the Weir Group.
Mr Stephen Crouch, the IBI's director-general, travelled to Jordan in
September, with Mr Bellingham, the MP for Norfolk North West. The MP had an
informal meeting with a senior official from the Iraqi foreign ministry on
September 3.
Mr Bellingham said the visit 'was a private visit paid for by myself as a
backbench MP'. He was not told that he would be meeting the Iraqi official
at a social engagement. He informed officials from the Foreign Office and
Ministry of Defence of the meeting. 'They were grateful that I'd informed
them,' he said.
In a letter obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Crouch states that with Mr
Bellingham he had meetings with a number of Jordanian government officials
and that 'we also met with a delegation from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in order to listen to their point of view'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Berlusconi seeks to avert strike: Embattled government edges
towards pensions compromise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italy's embattled government last night appeared to be moving closer to a
deal with trade unions to head off an eight-hour general strike on December
2.
Both sides appeared anxious to resolve the confrontation, over proposed cuts
in Italy's generous state pensions system, as the country's rightwing
coalition battled for political survival.
In the run-up to a meeting last night with union leaders, Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi had indicated his willingness to make concessions to avoid
the strike.
And speaking after the meeting, Mr Sergio D'Antoni, leader of the CISL
confederation, said: 'For the first time the government has said it is
prepared to study the separation of pension reform from the budget.' The
unions and the government will meet again on Wednesday morning to discuss
the issue.
Mr Berlusconi's new position is in sharp contrast to his tough stance before
and after the huge union-organised protest that brought almost 1.5m
demonstrators on to the streets of Rome on November 12. His political
position has been weakened in the wake of this week's warning by Milan
magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption.
As more details of the investigation leaked out, Milan magistrates were
reported to have discovered a bank account allegedly used for making
unregistered payments in Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest business group. Mr
Berlusconi has said he will not resign as a result of the investigation.
However, if the general strike goes ahead, it will add to the political
instability.
The populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi is in open disagreement
with its coalition partners, particularly on the pensions issue, where it is
ready to side with the unions. Mr Berlusconi is fighting a desperate battle
to survive and needs to get the 1995 budget through parliament.
Apart from being ready to give ground on pensions, he signalled on Wednesday
a renewed readiness to sell off the bulk of his stake in Fininvest -
although the opposition consider such a move unlikely.
Union leaders called the general strike to increase pressure on the
government to remove the sensitive and complex issue of pension reform from
the budget.
The government was last night seeking a formula that would not alter the
budget's overall aim of finding up to L50,000bn (Pounds 19.8bn) in new taxes
and spending cuts to hold the public sector deficit down to 8 per cent of
GDP.
The treasury has warned that the financial markets would react negatively to
any weakening of the budget's objectives.
Removing pension cuts from the budget would mean the government finding
L5,000bn from elsewhere.
Any agreement on pensions between the government and the unions will have to
be committed for consultation to Confindustria, the industrialists
confederation; and all sides may wish to reflect before a final decision.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Japanese alliance group's name is true to character
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is not always easy to pack a message into a name.
That is the moral of the national search for a new name, concluded after a
tortured debate last night, by Japan's alliance of nine political opposition
groups.
The alliance, due to transform itself into a mega-party at a mega-party on
December 10, settled briefly on an English version of its name only to
change its mind twice before announcing a final version, the New Frontier
party.
It is imbued with more meaning than its apparent blandness might suggest.
Party officials had asked the public to fax to Tokyo headquarters
suggestions for a title that would evoke 'the newness and freshness of our
group . . . and perhaps also imply such qualities as environmental awareness
and international responsibility.' The winning offering, chosen yesterday
from 100,000 suggestions, sent in by party friends and supporters, was
shin-shin-to, the literal translation of which is New-new party.
It won the most votes from a poll of the party's 213 upper and lower house
parliamentarians, advised by a panel of 15 academics, media folk and
artists, including Ms Fumio Hosokawa, a former pin-up girl.
It was, officials said, a demonstration of the open style of democracy with
which the new party hopes to challenge the backroom ways of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party's factional barons.
Critics that say New Frontier party sounds pretty similar to the four other
existing or recently deceased Japanese parties with 'new' in their names.
The party's name could have been worse. Runners-up included the Party of
Hope, the New Wind party, the Pure New party and the Human party.
Plain New-new party, while snappy, was thought an injustice to the subtlety
of the kanji characters of which it is composed, an example of how written
Japanese can be as impenetrable to native-speakers as it is to foreigners.
The second character of the name means something more than just new -
something like progress, or advance, said one of the NFP's political
advisers.
So it was that the title started yesterday evening as New Progressive party.
Officials thought, on reflection, that sounded 'odd' and changed it to New
Frontiers party, before Ms Hosokawa's panel finally lopped off the 's'.
Endearingly, one of the party's advisers confesses that the second,
forward-looking, 'shin' is not entirely appropriate because the NFP is
dominated by conservatives - former members of the ruling LDP.
Confused? That's Japanese politics.

FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Allied Domecq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no reason to doubt the strategic logic of Allied Domecq's purchase
of Pedro Domecq earlier this year. But it is disconcerting to see the
Mexican market - which accounts for half Domecq's profits - turning down so
sharply, so quickly. Why was Allied not able to see this coming?
Confidence in the group's deal-making prowess has taken a dent, especially
as it is now clear that due diligence ahead of the Domecq deal did not dig
so deep as to reveal in which part of the year the Spanish company earned
the bulk of its profits.
There is little consolation for shareholders in Allied's disingenuous
protestation that there would be no earnings dilution from the deal, but for
Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa's decision to exercise his 'put option'. The option,
obliging Allied to buy the outstanding shares in Domecq, is being exercised,
and the purchase will dilute in the current year as a result. It is not
surprising, under the circumstances, that Allied's share price dropped by
more than 3 per cent yesterday.
Across the group as a whole, operating performance was poor, with only
modest underlying growth in spirits and retailing. The 9 per cent drop in
Carlsberg-Tetley's operating profits provided more evidence of difficult
conditions in the UK beer industry. The shares will struggle to maintain a
market rating, given the pedestrian outlook for earnings growth in the next
few years.

FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Market-making
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg has caused another minor storm in the City. Last week,
the Office of Fair Trading's director-general published a report lambasting
underwriting commissions. Yesterday, it was the ability of market-makers to
keep large share trades secret for 90 minutes - and in some cases five days
 -that attracted his ire.
Such secrecy is typically justified by market-makers on the grounds that it
gives them time to off-load the risk of trading large blocks of shares:
requiring them to be open is rather like asking poker players to reveal
their hands.
But the OFT thinks market-makers who handle large trades gain valuable
information, from which secrecy gives them time to profit. Two alleged
anti-competitive consequences follow. First, big market-makers - which
handle most large trades - have an unfair advantage over smaller rivals.
Second, market-makers are so worried that they may be hit by a large trade
being unwound that they defensively widen the dealing spreads for
normal-sized trades. Investors suffer through not getting the best prices
for normal-sized deals.
The thesis is plausible enough but fuzzy. The OFT is vague on exactly what
information market-makers gain from handling large trades and how they
profit from it. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence that dealing
spreads for normal-sized trades are wider than they need be. If the OFT is
to press ahead with its attack on secrecy, it must be more convincing in
showing that there are victims.

FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Direct Line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The figures from Direct Line were splendid, a tribute to the company's
success in pioneering the telephone-based marketing which has revolutionised
the personal sector of the UK insurance industry. But for all management's
confidence in the future, one can sense future stagnation.
For one thing, Direct Line failed to meet its target of 2m motor customers.
Then there was a slight increase in the company's expense ratio,
disappointing in the light of the 48 per cent growth in premium income. All
this points to growing competition in the direct sector. This is especially
the case in motor insurance, where premiums are coming under increasing
pressure and claims levels are set to rise after an unusually favourable
patch. Direct Line remains well ahead of its competitors in terms of cost
management, but margins are set to fall.
These factors alone will not stop growth in pre-tax profits to Pounds
160-Pounds 170m next year and perhaps Pounds 200m in 1996. They point,
however, to growing pressures which limit the scope for expansion
thereafter. It is not yet clear that Direct Line's new ventures in financial
services and life insurance will be able to pick up the slack. Hence the
drop yesterday in the shares of Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line's
parent. The shares have performed better than those of any other bank in the
past two years, chiefly because of Direct Line. But as doubts about Direct
Line's future growth intensify, it is likely that RBS will lose some of its
premium rating.

FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Privatisation on track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Running railways, as the US railroad barons demonstrated in the late 19th
century, can prove hugely lucrative. Whether Railtrack, whose privatisation
was announced yesterday, can emulate them, or ends up a mere puffing billy,
remains unclear.
In theory, Railtrack should prove the former. On the cost side it can, like
the utilities, make substantial post-privatisation savings. Prospects are
also promising for revenues. Railtrack should significantly increase yields
on its Pounds 2bn property portfolio, currently at just 7 per cent. It may
also repeat BAA's trick of raising passenger spending at retail outlets at
its stations.
Admittedly, Railtrack's main income will initially come from fees paid by
train companies for using its network and their price will be set by a
regulator. But if privatisation is successful in generating greater usage of
the rail network, revenues from track fees could rise too. With petrol
prices due to increase in real terms over coming years, halting the
long-term decline in rail travel may not prove the tall order that some
think.
If the opportunities are considerable, so too are the risks. A brake van on
the company's progress will be politics. Labour, well ahead in the opinion
polls, remains implacably hostile to private ownership of the railways.
Though a Labour government would probably not renationalise Railtrack, it
might well interfere with its regulatory framework.
By contrast, while the Tories remain in power, there will be doubts about
their commitment to subsidise heavily loss-making routes in the long-term.
Such concerns may not derail privatisation, but they could reduce the amount
Railtrack fetches.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Price of compromise: Guy de Jonquieres on the concerns of US
trade partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's Washington compromise has relieved governments around the world,
which feared that failure by the Senate to ratify the Uruguay Round this
year would kill the global trade agreement stone-dead.
But now that much of this uncertainty has been removed, a new concern is
troubling US trade partners: could the price paid by President Bill Clinton
to secure congressional approval undermine the stronger multilateral trade
system the round is supposed to produce?
Concern focuses on the president's acceptance of Mr Robert Dole's demand for
a special commission of federal judges to review the operation of procedures
for settling trade disputes in the World Trade Organisation, so as to
safeguard US interests.
Effective disputes procedures are widely regarded as central to the WTO's
chances of gaining the international credibility needed to establish its
pre-eminence as policeman of international trade rules.
The Uruguay Round gives the WTO much stronger powers than those of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The biggest innovation is to require
that disputes panels' reports be adopted unless there is a consensus to
reject them - the reverse of Gatt practice. The mechanisms also cover new
areas, such as services, and provide for a standing appeals body to hear
challenges to panel findings.
The US has long advocated tougher Gatt disputes settlements procedures.
Indeed, it has repeatedly cited their shortcomings to justify its
controversial Section 301 trade legislation, which permits the US to
retaliate unilaterally against other countries in trade conflicts.
But now stronger multilateral mechanisms have been agreed, the Clinton
administration has been forced to appease anxieties in Congress that the new
WTO will trample on US sovereignty.
In one sense, the review commission will make little difference. If it
decided that WTO panels had ruled against the US unjustly in three disputes
in five years, that would trigger a congressional vote on whether to
withdraw from the organisation. However, Congress has always been free to
vote to pull out of Gatt. In either case, the president could veto such a
move.
More worrying is the risk that the commission could impair the disputes
panels' authority. Much will depend on the precise remit handed to the
judges, and how they exercise it.
If they were to pronounce on the substance of disputes cases, they could
simply become a pretext for the US to reject any finding with which it
disagreed. If, however, they focused strictly on whether panels have
followed procedures fairly and correctly, their role would be more limited.
Even then, they could find themselves at the centre of political
controversy. Expansion of WTO mechanisms to cover trade in services, and
other activities inside national borders, will require the panels to rule on
what Gatt members have hitherto considered the domain of domestic policy.
Some observers also expect a stream of early cases intended to test the
extent of the panels' jurisdiction and set precedents in areas where WTO
rules are sketchy. These cases could hand ammunition to isolationists in
Congress - and other national legislatures.
Precisely for these reasons, however, some WTO supporters take a more
positive view. They argue that US monitoring, if conducted objectively, will
give the disputes panels an extra incentive to meet the high standards of
jurisprudence needed to command respect.
Furthermore, they say, if the federal judges endorsed panel findings which
went against US interests, they could make them politically more acceptable
in Washington - and might even help improve the poor US record of
implementing adverse Gatt disputes rulings.
The federal judiciary's reputation for independence from other branches of
government also offers reassurance. However, such optimistic prognoses might
have to be revised if the US example were widely emulated - particularly by
countries less scrupulous about divisions between judicial and executive
power. That could only heighten the risk that the WTO would be torpedoed by
members intent on taking the law into their own hands.

under Whitehall used by Winston Churchill during the second world war have
for some while been advertising themselves in London tube stations with a
poster featuring Adolf Hitler and the slogan 'Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein

Europe would have happened a lot sooner.'

Given the streak of recklessness that seems to possess your average Belgian
when placed behind the wheel of a car, proposals by transport minister Elio
di Rupo to raise the speed limit by 10kph to 130kph - to bring things in
line with neighbouring France - might seem academic in the extreme.
Nonetheless, it is a notion upon which - surprise, surprise - the Flemings
and the Walloons cannot agree. Quite why those pro the increase should be
the Francophones, while the Dutch speakers all duly line up on the side of
the nays, is less than clear to a non-Belgian. But there are more motorway
accidents in Flanders. Which in turn is explained less by the fact that
Walloons make yet crazier drivers, than by the existence of a different
order of hazard - the regional police force. The latter installs nightly
check points - which seem to have the reverse of their intended effect of
cutting down the accident rate.

outfit, seems hell-bent on selling ever more complex products, such as life
insurance and mortgages. But despite yesterday's impressive increase in
profits, Direct Line's expansion plans have been met with scepticism.
Hence, it will be heartened by yesterday's press release from another firm
headed 'Customers say yes to phone-based mortgages'. Any concern that
complicated financial matters like mortgages can't be properly handled over
the phone has been dispelled by research, said the release.
And who has Direct Line to thank for this timely observation? The Household
Mortgage Corporation, the UK's largest centralised lender, which will be
Direct Line's number one competitor.

Warning - political gaffes can damage your career, unless you live in
Brazil. Rubens Ricupero, who quit in September after a row about Brazil's
inflation figures, is off to Rome as Brazil's next ambassador.
Ricupero, a lifetime diplomat and Brazil's fifth finance minister in two
years, is apparently looking forward to the less demanding lifestyle in the
foreign service.
His successor, Ciro Gomes, is also likely to be out of a job soon once the
new president, the very same Fernando Henrique Cardoso, takes over on
January 1. Given that Gomes has spent most of his period in office
bad-mouthing businessmen and making enemies in government, not even Brazil's
magnanimous diplomatic service is likely to find him a bolt hole.

Guess who's coming to Disney? That grand old trouper Sidney Poitier, who has
spent over 40 years in show business and starred in more than 40 films, has
popped up on the board of The Walt Disney Company.
Poitier's reputation has stood the test of time better than Disney's. The
first African American to make it big in Hollywood - he was knighted by the
Queen in 1968 - Poitier has gone from strength to strength in his later
years. Not so Walt Disney, which seems to have lost its stock market magic.
Euro Disney continues to turn in hefty losses, attendance is sagging at US
theme parks, and the death of Frank Wells and the noisy departure of Jeffrey
Katzenberg put a big question mark over the group's top management.
Not surprisingly, Disney is keeping us in suspense about Poitier's latest
role. The official release says that the academy-award winning entertainer
will fill the unexpired term of the late Frank Wells, Disney's president.
Does this mean that he is Wells's replacement?
And how old is Poitier? Disney says 67, the history books say closer to 71.
Disney chief executive Michael Eisner was enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday
yesterday, like the rest of the US, so no one was able to elaborate on his
odd comment that 'Sidney's talent is more than screen deep'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A sound message
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Europe's competitiveness problems could melt under sheer outpouring of
words, most of the continent's economic woes would by now have disappeared.
In contrast to many previous reports on the issue, including the European
Commission's own white paper 12 months ago, yesterday's document from the
European Round Table of Industrialists has the virtue of pithiness. By
underlining structural shortcomings compared with the US and Asia, and
concentrating on a few priority measures which even weak European
governments might be able to deliver, the industrialists have made a sound
contribution to the agenda for next month's European summit in Essen.
Their conclusions should help concentrate the minds of the new European
Commission. First, Europe must use faster than expected economic recovery to
correct imbalances in public sector finances that are weighing increasingly
on the private sector. Second, priority must be given to completing the
single market and ensuring that it works. Third, a tougher attack on state
aids, powerful deregulatory reform and sensible infrastructure investment
are needed to lower costs in energy, telecommunications and transport. Above
all, the Commission and Council of Ministers should test their actions
against the need to avoid unnecessary burdens on industry.
The business leaders wisely avoid lecturing trade unions about flexible
labour markets. Because recovery is generating so few extra jobs, employment
rigidities are softening even in Europe's most closely regulated economies,
while real take-home pay for most people in work is still falling. Few
bosses have had to face such sacrifices.
Along with a willingness to share burdens, Euro-industrialists need to show
more evidence of another virtue: humility. The Round Table's credibility
would be enhanced if it drew attention to industry's own part in Europe's
declining performance. Europe's poor record in innovation, for example,
cannot be blamed simply on failures in education. Along with undue
government regulation, lack of flexibility in the big businesses represented
on the Round Table is partly to blame for Europe's low employment growth. A
majority of 1,500 European business leaders in a survey last week termed as
inadequate their own investment in research and development and in training.
In areas like this, self-analysis would shed useful light on industry's own
ills.
The Round Table's underlying message, however, is clear. Failure to correct
the continent's structural faults will drive Europe's larger corporations to
shift a growing proportion of capital investment outside the EU during the
next decade. If this happens, Europe's companies might continue to prosper;
Europe would not. As they prepare for their trip to the Essen summit, that
is a sobering thought for the EU's leaders.

FT  25 NOV 94 / The sweetening of one man: Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne
analyse the political manoeuvres behind Clinton's deal to ratify the Uruguay
Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Strauss, the US trade representative in the late 1970s, once
described his approach to negotiating trade agreements and getting them
approved by Congress as 'half a teaspoon of sugar here, half a teaspoon
there and pretty soon they are sweet'.
The business has become more expensive - if not necessarily more subtle -
since his heyday. Last November's successful battle to ratify the North
American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Canada and Mexico saw pork
thrown around the congressional barrel as if all pigs were about to be
slaughtered. This month's - over Gatt - came down to the sweetening of one
man.
When Senator Robert Dole, the most powerful Republican in the US Senate,
pronounced himself satisfied with the deal he had struck over congressional
ratification of the Uruguay Round trade accords, more than President Bill
Clinton breathed a sigh of relief. The eyes of the trading world had been
focused on whether the US Congress would ratify the creation of a global
trading regime due to come into being next January under the auspices of the
new World Trade Organisation.
Waiting on the US, only about a quarter of the more than 120 members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have completed the approval process.
The endorsement of the European Union has also been delayed by a legal
wrangle, now resolved. International uncertainty has left even the choice of
a head of the WTO up in the air.
Now, even US opponents of the new order concede that Mr Dole's endorsement
has turned the tide. Next Thursday the outgoing Senate ought to put its seal
on the Uruguay Round. The House of Representatives should have done its bit
two days earlier since the bipartisan leadership - Congressmen Newt Gingrich
for the Republicans and Richard Gephardt for the Democrats - is committed to
approval. Political chickens are being counted with care but the assumption
is that the deal has been hatched.
Mr Dole is no mean dealmaker himself, fond of squeezing the pips until they
squeak. It must be assumed he knew exactly what he was doing in September
when he announced that he was far from sure that consideration of Gatt
should not be delayed until the new Congress convened in January. There
were, he said, serious budgetary issues and weighty questions of US
sovereignty.
This simple pronouncement made him the centre of the post-mid-term election
political universe, even temporarily eclipsing Mr Gingrich. Nafta, not a
perfect precedent but the best available, passed the Senate last year by 61
votes (including his) to 39. This is only one more than the 60 votes the
Uruguay Round needs to pass a critical procedural hurdle - the waiving of
budget rules - prior to a floor vote. While Mr Dole sat on the fence and
even with a number of Democratic converts from the anti-Nafta ranks, the
White House was conceding on Wednesday morning that it was a handful short
of the magic 60.
It was not merely the administration, directed by one of its own better
dealmakers, trade representative Mickey Kantor, that concentrated all its
energies on Mr Dole. The anti-Gatt forces based their campaign in his home
state headquarters in Wichita, Kansas, the 'ground zero' of their campaign.
Ross Perot, the 1992 presidential candidate, was in the city on Tuesday
night addressing a rally urging rejection. The Dole office was receiving
2,000 calls a day against ratification before the phones were taken off the
hook. Many of these were instigated by Mr Perot's organisation and by
rightwing radio commentators.
For public consumption, the lobbying of the senator from Kansas was always
more about pure politics than the merits of free trade, though all the usual
arguments were given full public airing. The administration naturally
claimed that Gatt amounted to 'the biggest tax cut in history', that free
trade created more high-paying American jobs, and that US leadership
overseas would be gravely damaged if the treaty went down the tubes.
The opposition, encompassing left and right and with the Nafta experience
fresh in the memory, warned that the Gatt-implementing legislation included
'give-aways' for special interests in the fine print of the revenue measures
of the enabling legislation. One of the better stunts was pulled by Mr Ralph
Nader, the consumer activist, who offered to give Dollars 10,000 to charity
if any member of Congress read the whole Uruguay Round agreement and then
answered 10 questions of his own design. Only Senator Hank Brown, the
Colorado Republican and a Gatt supporter, has taken him up - he sits the
test before next week's vote.
But the essence of the deal that was finally confected - some favours for
the agricultural interests so dear to any representative of the farm belt
but, most important, the creation of a five-judge panel to ascertain if the
WTO unfairly rules against US interests - was designed to give the senator
the sort of political protection he craved.
For there can be no doubt after the mid-term elections that the old
Republican support for free trade, so much a part of Mr Dole's own political
career, is weaker now than it has been since the 1920s. Suspicion is rampant
of any global body threatening US sovereignty, especially one with the
menacing title of World Trade Organisation.
It is generally recognised that Mr Dole has both a managerial and a
political problem with the resurgent right which, without this week's deal,
could have been exacerbated by the Gatt. Not only would he be vulnerable to
conservative charges of sacrificing US sovereignty to an unaccountable world
panel, he would also, in the legislative process, have found himself voting
for higher taxes. Under laws peculiar to the US, the loss of revenues from
the lower tariffs of the round must be offset by higher taxes and user fees.
Putting down his marker on the right, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a likely
rival of Mr Dole's for the party presidential nomination in 1996, came out
early and said he could not vote for the budget waiver and its higher taxes,
whatever he thought of the Gatt (after the Dole deal, he left the impression
he would back the treaty).
Mr Dole has more than Mr Gramm to worry about in looking ahead to 1996. It
is going to be hard enough simultaneously to run the Senate and a national
political campaign. Early finance and good organisation are imperative,
especially now that California and New York have moved their primaries up to
March, front-loading and shortening the effective voting season. And big
business - Mr Dole's potential underwriters - is pro-Gatt, while Mr Gramm,
for one, already has plenty of money and political chits in his campaign
bank.
Sometimes in the negotiations it seemed Mr Dole overreached himself. His
attempt to link the Gatt to cutting taxes on capital gains - long on the
Republican wish-list - got short shrift not only from the administration but
also from business interests. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, put it bluntly: 'The consequences of killing
the Gatt because of last-minute political manoeuvring over a capital gains
tax cut are too great.'
Even if the game is now over, the perception persists that the
administration should never have been forced into the corner of dealing with
Mr Dole. According to Julius Katz, a trade official under President George
Bush, the lessons of footdragging over Nafta should have been learnt. The
additional taxes needed to offset the lost tariff income should have been in
the budget for the 1995 fiscal year. It was known as soon as the Uruguay
Round was concluded last December that such provisions would have to be
made.
Then, in the search for extra revenues, the administration lighted upon
licence fees on the operators of the new broad spectrum radio wavebands.
This gave jurisdiction to the commerce committee chaired by Senator Ernest
Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat and protectionist. In October he
invoked congressional privileges forcing a 45-day delay in the Gatt vote.
Even assuming all goes to plan next week, the unintended consequences could
be many. Other countries may want their own watchdog panel of judges. The
entire dispute settlement process of the WTO, one of the main US objectives
in the launch of the Uruguay Round, could thus be put at risk. But to Bob
Dole, playing for high stakes today, that is tomorrow's problem.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Wrong track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be better not to have started from here. That is the sensible
response to the government's proposed technique for valuing Railtrack, which
owns British Rail's track, signalling and stations. In formally announcing
Railtrack's privatisation yesterday before there exists a sensible mechanism
for valuing it, ministers are putting their desire to raise funds above the
need to ensure efficiency in the railways.
Privatisation could bring significant benefits to passengers. This summer's
rail dispute might also have been concluded more quickly if Railtrack had
been free to negotiate without regard to the public sector pay freeze. Yet
it is doubtful whether the benefits will be as great as they should be. The
heart of the problem is that the government has based the charges which
train operators will pay Railtrack on an arbitrary valuation of Railtrack's
assets and on an equally arbitrary target rate of return for Railtrack to
earn.
The proposed asset value of Pounds 6.5bn is more than just debatable - a
case can be made for higher or lower figures. It is based on sunk (or
replacement) costs that are irrelevant to determination of the
infrastructure's current value. As Mr John Swift, the rail regulator has
noted, a more commercial approach to valuation is required. That value
should be determined by discounting the appropriate level of future revenues
at an appropriate rate of discount.
The government has approached the pricing question backwards. What needs to
be worked out is the revenue Railtrack would earn if it charged prices that
ensure efficient use of the railways. Those calculations should take account
of the demand for rail transport, the capacity available and the marginal
cost of increasing it. They should also allow for social and environmental
considerations, such as the desirable balance between use of roads and
railways. Given the uncertainties, it would be more sensible to value
Railtrack only after the new system of franchises is working.
The proposed rate of return of 5.6 per cent, rising to 8 per cent within
four years, is also unnecessarily steep for a utility. Partly because of
this, the odds are that track charges will end up too high. This would
hinder the emergence of competitive, entrepreneurial train operators and
ensure socially inefficient underutilisation of capacity.
In principle, any overvaluation could be offset by higher subsidies from the
Treasury. Yet the government would then find itself taking with one hand and
giving back with the other. In practice, however, subsidies on the required
scale would not be forthcoming. The government would then take its money,
perhaps to finance a tax-cutting bribe, but leave the railways
underutilised. Not for the first time, the promise of a privatisation would
be vitiated by foolish decisions taken during the act of privatisation
itself. The railways need to be put on a better track.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Question of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The small world of British politics has still not fully accustomed itself,
two and a half years after the general election, to the fact that the
government has an overall majority of less than 20. That makes parliamentary
life more interesting. It obliges the government to deal carefully with its
backbench supporters, and on occasion to take notice when even a tiny group
of them feels strongly enough to consider voting with the opposition on a
contentious issue, such as Post Office privatisation.
But it also obliges those backbenchers to weigh the consequences before
carrying their independence into the division lobby. If they cause the
government to be defeated more than once or twice, or on issues that are
central to its programme, they not only reduce its capacity to govern (as
Congress habitually does to US administrations) but also, since the UK is a
parliamentary democracy, undermine the very basis of its existence as a
government, which is the fact that it commands a majority in the House of
Commons. That is why the government not only can but must call for a vote of
confidence when it faces possible defeat on a substantial issue. It needs to
know whether it still has a parliamentary majority or not.
In the present case, the government is clearly right to treat the European
Communities (Finance) Bill as an issue of confidence. This bill is required
to give effect to an agreement Mr Major negotiated two years ago, at a
summit meeting held under his presidency. The agreement was regarded at the
time as a successful resolution of a difficult issue, and advantageous for
Britain in that it involved a smaller increase in EC resources (to which
Britain is a net contributor) than some other member states wanted. Some
Conservative backbenchers do not share that assessment, but they should
accept that negotiating such agreements is a quintessential government
responsibility. In such a negotiation, Britain expects its partners to
deliver what they agree to, and they have a right to expect the same. A
government that cannot rely on a parliamentary majority to implement such a
commitment is not an effective government, or even a legitimate one. The
issue is indeed one of confidence, and can only be treated as such.
If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, he has two options:
to resign, or to go to the Queen and seek a dissolution. In this case he has
clearly indicated his intention to do the latter, and on Tuesday night Mr
Kenneth Clarke revealed that the cabinet as a whole had agreed on this
course. In these circumstances, and so long after the last election, it is
most unlikely that the Queen would refuse to follow her prime minister's
advice. The electorate would thus be the final arbiter - an arbiter with
which, at the present moment, few Conservative MPs are eager for a premature
encounter. Mr Major can therefore await the vote of confidence with
confidence.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Aid in time: The donors' blueprint is failing in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warnings that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process could collapse any day
are forcing international donors to consider a radical overhaul of their aid
strategies. It is now widely acknowledged that the aid programme in the Gaza
Strip is failing.
As donors prepare to meet in Brussels next week, Mr Terje Larsen, the United
Nations under secretary-general for Palestinian territories, has warned that
time is running out for peace in Gaza, as living standards fall and violence
increases. 'We are at the very edge,' he said.
Disbursing aid by traditional means has proved almost impossible in Gaza,
with only Dollars 140m distributed of the Dollars 700m pledged for 1994 by
international donors such as the World Bank, the UN and the European Union.
One problem has been the difficulties donors have had dispersing money
through the embryonic Palestinian administration. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has been criticised for refusing
to delegate authority. He has even excluded officials of the Palestinian
implementing agency, PECDAR, from the delegation to the Brussels conference.
The Palestinian administration has also been slow to develop clear
procedures for distributing aid.
But according to Mr Samir Houleila, senior Palestinian aid official, 'donors
have been considering us as a classical case, expecting us to have built all
institutions and systems in six months . . . Without conceptual changes the
peace process is in jeopardy.'
In designing the aid programme, western donors assumed that the Palestinian
administration would be able to collect sufficient revenue to function, and
that long-term development projects, entailing pre-feasibility, feasibility
and design studies over 18-24 months, would deliver economic gains
sufficiently rapidly. Both these assumptions appear to have been flawed.
The peace process is no longer on track: the Israeli transfer of the West
Bank, with its greater revenue base, has been delayed. And Israel is
refusing to change the agreement signed with the PLO to hand over the
Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m a month it is collecting in customs duties in the
West Bank, until Palestinian elections.
The PLO claims that Israel has also paid only Shk20m of Shk180m in VAT
payments due to the Palestinian treasury, although Israel denies this.
Alone, Gaza-Jericho is not economically viable in terms of public finances,
say donors, and it is suffering a serious shortfall in revenue. Total
Palestinian revenue from taxes from October to the end of March is estimated
at Dollars 76.9m, compared with total expenditure of Dollars 234.5m. Only
Dollars 36.6m of financing is available to cover the shortfall of Dollars
124.9m.
This lack of funds is making it increasingly difficult for Gaza to pay its
police and civil servants, at a time when their morale and effectiveness is
vital. The recent revival in Islamic extremism has put Mr Arafat under even
greater pressure to contain violence, for which a properly paid police force
is essential. Expenditure for the police for the six months to March 1995 is
estimated at Dollars 42.9m.
But efforts to get aid to help pay the police have so far met with limited
success. Donors are traditionally reluctant to spend taxpayers' money
financing a police force or the salaries of a finance ministry. At a meeting
in Gaza on November 9, donors said they would pay salaries for no more than
the 9,000 policemen agreed between Israel and the PLO at the time of the
peace deal, although Gaza now has 10,800.
Gaza's economic position has also been made harder by the Israeli closures
of its borders, which have prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians
travelling to their jobs inside Israel. Mr Savir strongly defends Israel's
closure policy, despite the cost to the peace process, saying it has forced
Mr Arafat seriously to address Israel's security concerns.
But the closure has heightened the need for jobs to be created. In this
area, too, the aid programme's inflexibility has been much in evidence.
'The situation in Gaza is more dangerous today than before the peace
agreement was signed,' said Mr Larsen. 'The gap between expectations and
delivery is so large, so critical and unless donors get together to deliver,
the peace process will fail.'
And this is the message that is being conveyed to donors in Brussels. A
covering letter to the meeting signed by Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norwegian
foreign minister, in his capacity of chairman of the donors committee, says:
'Time is of the essence if we are to deal with the budgetary shortfall of
the Palestinian Authority so as to implement the process of long-term
economic development and political stability.'
Donors will be asked to make two strategic decisions. First to commit
themselves to providing Dollars 120m-Dollars 125m until March 31 1995 to pay
salaries and running costs for police and civil servants and to finance the
budget deficit of the Palestinian Authority.
Second, they are being asked to divert up to 20 per cent of the grants and
loans for long-term projects into short-term employment generation, mainly
small-scale public works. The World Bank and the UN are appealing for donors
to fund Dollars 100m worth of public works projects that will create
20,000-40,000 jobs within the next six months.
'What we are asking for from Israel and the donors is peanuts in global
terms,' said Mr Houleila, the senior Palestinian aid official. 'But without
the money and faster implementation, the impact on our side and on the
entire region will be massive. The tension is very high and the Palestinian
Authority desperately needs to build its credibility by making visible
economic changes.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confidence despite deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ABDUL KARIM AL-MUDARIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mark Nicholson has a journalist's right to report on Saudi Arabia
('Saudi budget may have to reflect some harsh realities', November 18) as he
saw it during his recent visit. However, allow me to express an additional
view as I and 51 British companies saw it during the British Aerospace/
Arab-British Chamber of Commerce joint venture mission which met 329 Saudi
companies in the kingdom earlier this month.
There was no denial in any quarter that there is a budget deficit. But there
is annoyance in private sector circles that this is being played up in the
west as if Saudi Arabia was unique in this respect - Germany, the UK and the
US are not exactly paragons of budgetary virtue. This is especially so in
the case of the US, which has been transformed from the world's largest
creditor to the largest debtor nation.
Despite current short-term problems our mission members, in serious business
discussions with Saudi counterparts, found large areas of the private sector
buoyant, liquid, and confident about the future. These were not naive people
we met, but hard-bitten, experienced Saudi businessmen investing in
technology and the expansion of their country's manufacturing sector.
The British companies were not fools either, and the fact that three of them
are at the stage of agreeing to joint ventures, 17 are now actively engaged
in further discussions with Saudi counterparts, and seven more expect to
achieve licence agreements - out of 51 on the mission - attests to the truth
of what I write.

FT  25 NOV 94 / A certain lack of drive: Ralph Atkins on the prospects of a
shakeout among direct-selling insurers in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are the UK's telephone-based motor insurance companies that sell policies
direct to customers running out of puff?
The pioneering Direct Line company, set up by Mr Peter Wood nine years ago
in conjunction with Royal Bank of Scotland, was doing all it could yesterday
to dismiss suggestions that the current motor premium price war would
jeopardise its future expansion.
Nevertheless, City forecasts for Direct Line's profits next year were cut
after the company admitted the price war was having an impact, albeit
'marginal', on its profitability.
Its admission was the latest sign that the UK direct private motor insurance
market - selling via the telephone, and cutting out brokers and their
commissions - is becoming increasingly crowded. With 15 direct sellers in
operation, competition is fierce; rumours of possible casualties in the next
few years are growing.
'There will be a shake-out among the 'directs'. The winners will be those
that have got the money to stick with it . . . Anyone who starts to write
(policies) now is not going to succeed unless they come up with a radically
different approach,' says Mr David Campbell, insurance industry specialist
at actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow figures suggest that, between 1990 and 1993, the private
motor insurance sector only broke even - in spite of large increases in
premium rates. 'The market as a whole doesn't make money. It is a question
of who makes money and who loses it,' says Mr Campbell.
Motor premium rates are falling steeply as new 'direct' companies cut prices
to grab market share. The most profitable will be those able to keep their
claims plus expenses lowest as a proportion of premiums (operating ratios).
Direct Line is well placed to ride out the current price war, with one of
the lowest operating ratios in the business. But Mr Wood acknowledges that
the doubling in Direct Line's pre-tax profits, to Pounds 110.1m in the year
to the end of September, is unlikely to be repeated.
Hence Direct Line was eager yesterday to outline its long-term plans for a
joint venture to sell motor insurance directly in Spain and to develop new
product areas - particularly mortgages, saving products and life insurance -
as well as expand its port-folio of household property policies.
Some other 'direct' companies are not faring so well, especially those new
in the market that face large start-up costs, including the heavy
advertising spending needed to build a customer base. Bacon &amp; Woodrow
calculates, for example, that last year the operating ratio of Churchill,
the direct selling company owned by Winterthur of Switzerland, was among the
highest in the sector, possibly because aggressive pricing had cut its
premium income.
Some established insurers that still rely on broker networks have also been
able to undercut the operating ratios of the 'directs' by using the same
computer technology to improve their risk assessment, thereby increasing
profitability.
According to Direct Line's Mr Wood, some of his rivals have achieved only a
lacklustre performance because of their failure to be sufficiently original
in following his lead. With motor insurance policies now sold by telephone
as if they were relatively simple commodities, the first into the market can
quickly build brand recognition and exploit economies of scale.
Some appear to agree with Mr Wood, and have tried to aim for a particular
target market. Admiral, the direct selling arm of Brockbank, one of the
largest agencies running insurance syndicates at the Lloyd's of London
market, has focused on higher-risk motorists paying more than Pounds 300 in
annual premiums. In a flattering endorsement of its strategy, Mr Wood has
followed Admiral by setting up a new company, Privilege Insurance, for the
non-standard motorist.
But others which have set up 'direct' operations in the private motor market
have taken a more defensive approach. Commercial Union and General Accident,
two of the UK's largest composite insurers, decided not to spend heavily on
promoting CU Direct and GA Direct, which remain among the smaller operators
in the private motor market.
At first sight, their stance appears to offer the worst of both worlds: the
expense of setting up a direct operation without the benefits that a
substantial presence can bring. But there is a logic to such a strategy:
given the ferocity of the competition in the private motor insurance market,
there is little point in investing heavily now. But it may prove important
in the long run to have built the expertise and capabilities needed to
exploit the technology of telephone selling.
'We don't believe it is opportune at this time to push it heavily. Next year
or after may be different,' says Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive
at General Accident.
The critical factors that will determine whether such caution is wise are
the speed and extent to which direct selling techniques spread to other
insurance products.
Already many direct selling insurers are expanding into household policies.
Direct Line underwrote 523,000 policies in the past year, and the company
believes there are substantial opportunities for selling other financial
products by telephone. 'People don't like driving down to the high street,
waiting in a queue, getting a form as long as War and Peace and having to
take a day off to fill it in,' says Mr Wood.
Several companies are even studying the feasibility of selling property and
motor insurance to companies without a broker network. Mr David Stevens,
marketing director at Admiral, says: 'Direct selling can work for any
insurance product which doesn't require a huge degree of perceived risk or a
huge perceived need for advice.'
Cutting out brokers allows companies not only to cut costs, but also to
break the 'winner's curse' - that is, the tendency for brokers, if
commissions are roughly equal, to sell insurance policies that have been
underpriced, rather than policies that actually make a profit for the
insurance company.
But others are more sceptical about the scope for expanding direct selling.
Many life insurance companies reckon UK regulatory requirements, designed to
ensure consumers are properly informed before buying products, mean
telephone interviews are suitable only for making an initial contact between
seller and buyer. Similarly, the complexity of mortgage products may make
them inappropriate for selling by telephone.
Moreover, Mr John Carter, Commercial Union's chief executive, argues it is
far from certain that direct sellers can make the same inroads into home and
contents insurance as they have in motor. Much of these markets is linked to
the mortgage-providing business, where the main operators have the financial
clout to defend market share in any price war.
'The opposition is not the high-street broker, it is the big banks, building
societies and lending institutions that can react to the pressure from the
'directs' and find ways of competing with it,' Mr Carter says.
Similarly, the profitable underwriting of small commercial policies requires
careful risk assessment based on local knowledge, he argues. In the US,
growth in direct sales of personal insurance products has slowed recently
(though in the US, 'directs' includes companies using tied sales agents as
well as those relying on telephone selling).
But CU, along with most European composite insurers, nevertheless sees
direct selling techniques becoming an increasingly important distribution
channel. Though hesitant about joining the price war in UK motor insurance,
CU is looking to build its share of the French private motor market via
Eurofil, its direct selling operation in that country.
Insurance companies such as these want to ensure that they avoid the worst
consequences of a shake-out in the direct UK private motor market  - but not
lose out to rivals as telephone selling spreads into new markets and
products. Telephone sales in the motor market may be becoming more
difficult, but the direct sellers are unlikely to pause for breath for long.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nutcrackers worth experiencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VICTOR HOCHHAUSER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Clement Crisp draws attention to two simultaneous productions of The
Nutcracker in London this Christmas season ('The FT Christmas show guide',
November 19). The necessity for this arises from the fact that both the
Birmingham Royal Ballet and the London Coliseum are only available during
this period. The alternative would be to deprive London audiences of
experiencing Peter Wright's glorious production.
Incidentally, Clement Crisp refers to New York City Ballet's Nutcracker and
omits to mention that the same ballet is being presented simultaneously in
New York by the American Ballet Theatre.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A proper pyramid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN SHUSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing with reference to the article, 'Blueprint for two kinds of
pyramid schemes' (November 19). The article clearly and concisely
highlighted the differences between legitimate direct selling or multi-level
marketing schemes and unethical pyramid selling schemes that are 'dressed up
to look like legitimate multi-level marketing plans or investment clubs'.
Since 1992, Amway has been running the Business Awareness Campaign which is
lobbying government to tighten the existing pyramid selling legislation so
it protects the consumer from these unethical schemes. The campaign also
aims to educate the public and opinion formers about the different types of
direct selling so that any dubious or fraudulent schemes can be clearly
identified and avoided. The campaign is fully supported by the Direct
Selling Association and the Department of Trade and Industry and by members
of Parliament from all parties.
The Direct Selling Association is currently drafting proposed legislative
amendments with the support of the DTI so it may not be too long before
these much-needed changes in the law are implemented.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU confused on TV ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LESLIE HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Brussels correspondent's reminder that the UK government still has
the power under clause 13 of the Industry Act to prevent foreign takeovers
of UK manufacturers underlines the inconsistency of policies which have a
European dimension ('Brussels tests Britain's power to block foreign
takeovers', November 18).
It is ironic that the European Commission should be concerned to remove what
it regards as an anomaly - which, so far as I know, has never been invoked -
while at the same time allowing an unbelievably confused pattern of media
ownership rules to apply throughout the European Union.
Manufacturing industry may be a theoretical no-go area for Britain's leading
EU partners, though BMW and others seem to have been unaware of this.
However, the broadcasting industry, one of Britain's growing international
businesses, stands wide open to foreign takeovers. The 1990 Broadcasting Act
permits 100 per cent ownership of an ITV company by any European
organisation. That makes the current UK commercial television ownership
rules unique in Europe. It is impossible for a British company to acquire
100 per cent of a television station in any other part of Europe.
National regulations vary, but the thrust of them, particularly in main
markets such as Germany, France and Italy, is to make it impossible for a UK
company to gain total control.
Media ownership rules should be consistent throughout the EU, and the
Commission should concentrate on this issue rather than concerning itself
with an unused clause of the Industry Act.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: British Gas bills policy a dangerous
precedent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH Z ORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The British Gas monopoly has set a dangerous precedent in establishing
a tiered price menu for its settlement charges on our gas supplies ('British
Gas sets prices to reward good payers', November 18).
By discriminating price levels it seeks to channel payments to the direct
debit system, through the high-street banks, to the detriment not only of
cheque payments made in good time but also to the detriment of straight cash
payments across their counters.
People paying bills by cash, immediately, are penalised by 5 per cent in
comparison with direct debit customers. What is now to stop British Gas
increasing this differential, by say, 10 per cent and forcing payments
through direct debit? Is it to be in its gift to control such matters? Will
others now think this is a very good wheeze? Has cash payment ever been so
forcibly denigrated?
The banks admit that a high proportion of their consumer complaints are
concerned with mistakes originating from direct debit arrangements, and of
course these problems will now increase.
Good customers of British Gas, that is the majority, who pay their bills at
the proper time either by cheque or cash and have done so for years, should
not be set upon by schemes such as this.
What can the consumer do about it? Surely the thinking consumer might decide
to change his policy too and, instead of paying his bills on time, delay
them, keep the money in his building society to the last legal moment and
use the interest so gained to claw back some of the 5 per cent penalty so
unfairly laid against him.
And so, by its dangerous unilateral precedent, British Gas converts veteran
blue-chip cash customers into payment laggards. The very thing it sought to
avoid]

FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: Nagasaki low on dramatic pressure - Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a humane message and an expertly professional score were enough to put
bums on seats, Out of the Blue might keep the Shaftesbury Theatre full for a
long time. I fear it is dead in the water.
This is a 'musical drama' (no jokes, no light relief) about Nagasaki - or
more precisely about five schematic characters, Japanese and American, who
were there. It is sung all through, looks good in extremely economical sets,
and takes just two hours; but it butters no parsnips.
The show was 'conceived' by Shun-ichi Tokura, a leading commercial composer,
and then 'developed' by its English director David Gilmore, with a libretto
by Paul Sand. The year 1945 is the time of most of the story, told in
flashbacks; the present day - 1970 - merely provides the occasion for
telling it, and for releasing old griefs. Somehow, in the course of the
conceiving, developing and writing, nobody noticed that in that form the
story is fatally low on dramatic pressure.
Back then, young Marshall was an American prisoner of war, roughed up by the
officer Hayashi (whose parents had died in the Tokyo bombings), but kindly
treated by Dr Akizuki and protected by Hayashi's sister Hideko. After the
Nagasaki horror and the Allied victory, he married Hideko; but soon
radiation sickness carried her off, and while he was visiting home a letter
from Hayashi told him (falsely) that their baby had succumbed to it too.
Now, he has taken Holy Orders in America and never returned. Dr Akizuki, on
a lecture tour for Peace, runs into Father Marshall and persuades him to
revisit.
Meanwhile the flashbacks keep filling us in on 1945. The only 'now' suspense
lies in how Marshall will face his long-lost daughter Hana, and the
revelation of Hayashi's lie soon smoothes that. By way of a late kick-start,
we get another revelation: Marshall served seven years in prison for a
certain mercy-killing (though the Church seems not to have minded). Ah so,
that was why Hayashi was so cross] - but the drama evaporates at once amid
general reconciliation.
Except for the deceased Hideko and the ageless Doctor, each character is
played by two actors, younger and older. The only Oriental in the cast is
baby Hana (non-singing), who grows up to be the coffee-coloured Paulette
Ivory (pleasantly poignant). The 'Japanese' men do, however, wear their hair
black and combed back. Like Michael McCarthy's Doctor, both the Marshalls
boast fine musical-comedy voices; if James Graeme offers little more than
stateliness-under-stress, Greg Ellis makes something strong and affecting of
his younger self. The Hayashis, David Burt and Simon Burke, fulminate
nicely, and Meredith Braun's Hideko warbles sweetly from her hospital bed.
The composer has assimilated the techniques of current American musicals
with quick intelligence. If the often Sondheim-ish score tends toward
blandness - too many of the songs are about vague, wistful feelings - it
does not lack variety; there is, however, more genuine Japanese music in The
Mikado. (Here Bernstein, Mussorgsky and even Faure peep through.) Paul
Sand's succinct lines rhyme and scan assiduously, and Tokura follows suit
exactly. In the programme-book there is a heartfelt plea for nuclear
disarmament from the Mayor of Nagasaki.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: A Song at Twilight - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We tend to think of Coward as a playwright of the 1920s, '30s and '40s.
Congratulations therefore to the Greenwich Theatre for reviving his 1966
play A Song at Twilight. As it begins, it reminds you of sundry other Coward
plays. But, as it develops, it also reveals a gift for suspense that Coward
had seldom employed. Then, seriously, it addresses a subject that had
underlain all Coward's earlier oeuvre but round which he had always,
childishly, skirted.
One of the several ways in which A Song takes your breath away is the
hostile light in which the male protagonist - Coward's own role - is viewed.
The role has wit and a certain urbane charm, on the surface; and no doubt
Coward himself made the most of those. But then the play peels that surface
away.
We see Sir Hugo Latymer, an eminent elderly writer living in Switzerland,
being beastly to his wife Hilde. She doubles as his secretary, and their
relationship is a development of that of Garry and Monica in Present
Laughter. We see him being charming to his young butler, Felix. But all
this, we sense, is preamble to the arrival of his old flame, Carlotta.
Carlotta turns out to be a well-preserved and much-married lady aged about
50; and the degree to which she skirmishes with Hugo and reminds him of the
past makes her a successor to Garry's wife Liz and the seductress Joanna,
both in Present Laughter. But all this is also preamble.
The most daring feature of Tom Smith's excellent Greenwich production is how
uncharming and unsympathetic it makes Sir Hugo from the first. John Quentin,
who plays the role, is testy, acid, defensive. His lack of charm makes him
an unnatural Cowardian, but has the advantage of ensuring that we face
head-on Hugo's unpleasant hypocrisies, cruelties, evasions. Gideon Davey,
the designer, has given Hugo's sitting-room a glacial air. Lois Baxter, as
the elegant Carlotta, has both the rapier conversational technique and the
womanly charm to point up all the more clearly what Hugo lacks.
Alison Skillbeck, as Hilde, neatly catches the dowdiness, forbearance, and
pragmatism that have been necessary to live with this man for 20 years.
If you want see this play, read no further; just go. For the best fun of A
Song is its suspense. The skeleton in Hugo's cupboard which Carlotta finally
addresses is his own homosexuality. We reach it, melodramatically, just
before the interval. But the beauty of the play is that Carlotta is not
blackmailing Hugo, though he presumes she is. She simply wants him to admit
not merely that he has a homosexual past, not merely that his thoughts have
been homosexual all his life, but most importantly his own capacity for
loving anyone.
It is this link between Hugo's sexual repression and his misanthropy that is
the play's most exciting feature. It illumines everything; the preamble, we
see, was not preamble at all. And the play's wordless conclusion - Hugo's
gasping reaction as he re-reads the letters he once wrote to the man who was
his one true love - suggests that his own ice is indeed about to crack. A
Song at Twilight is Coward's most adult play, and so this revival does him
honour.
At Greenwich Theatre, SE10.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: Ballets Jazz de Montreal - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It all depends on what you mean by 'ballet', and by 'jazz'. And, I must add,
on how tiresome you find the combination of these elements. Les Ballets Jazz
de Montreal are at Sadler's Wells this week on a return visit.
I saw the first of two programmes - or rather, as much of the first as I
could bear to watch on Tuesday. It was an evening more catatonic than jazzy,
and hardly balletic at all. Three pieces of choreography; 13 dancers; dull
design; a toothless feel to it all - no bite to step or score. And the bland
played on.
The best came first: James Kudelka's Ghosts, set to songs by the Beatles,
with an eccentric edge to the dance which matched what was audible of the
lyrics. A lot of brightness from the performers did not help, but Kudelka
has an ingenious way with their bodies. The succeeding Lovers, by Jennifer
Muller, claimed to be 'inspired by the paintings of Gustav Klimt'. This
statement needed to be amplified by the announcement that Miss Muller is the
rightful Grand Duchess Anastasia. We were treated to a tinkling piano score
by Keith Jarrett which proved as maundering and vexing as Miss Muller's four
duets, whose theme was He Needs Her And She Needs Him. The rest of the news
was that the dances and the dancers looked anxious but uninteresting, and
dragging Klimt's name into these goings-on was an insult to the fair name of
Viennese painting.
Mauricio Wainrot's Swing the Cat ended the evening. The title was promising
 -something like tossing the caber? - but the dance was not. A collection of
musical nullities from Simon Jeffe's Penguin Cafe Orchestra found an exact
counterpart in innocently awful little outings for a group of bathers. After
four numbers, with not even a kitten having been swung, I left - a
disappointed man.
At Sadler's Wells until
November 27.

The weekend starts here. Children in Need occupies BBC1 from after the nine
o'clock news until tomorrow morning, combining a good cause with
entertainment - well, Lulu, Gary Glitter and Lily Savage.
Or turn to that station one corner of which is forever America. Channel 4,
you remember, was founded as the egghead's station (and to prove it The Word
is back tonight, folks). Friday's ration of sitcom starts with Blossom (6pm)
and includes Ellen, Cheers and Roseanne (10pm). Roseanne is a cult figure
mainly, one suspects, because viewers can read anything they like into that
immobile face, monotone voice and inexpressive body.
The Trial, BBC 2's fly-on-the-courtroom-wall series (9pm) comes up with more
light entertainment, which sums up both the strengths and failings of the
idea. As an unsuccessful barrister, WS Gilbert was assaulted by an irate
client who hurled her wooden leg across the court at him. Nothing tonight
quite reaches that level, but it makes unexpectedly funny television.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: The British take the Met by storm - New York thrills
to Graham Vick's Shostakovich and Bryn Terfel's voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brits are the talk of the town. Not just on Broadway - where Andrew
Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard has opened to respectable reviews, mainly on
the strength of Glenn Close's performance as Norma Desmond. Not just in the
art world, which has been saluting two influential British potters, Lucie
Rie and Hans Coper, in their first major American show at the Metropolitan
Museum. Nor has the talk been confined to Manhattan's many musical
Anglophiles, who have been treated over the past two weeks to well-prepared
performances of Nicholas Maw's Odyssey and Rutland Boughton's The Immortal
Hour.
No, the real buzz has centred on the New York debuts of Bryn Terfel and
Graham Vick. Terfel, who sang in Le nozze di Figaro at the Metropolitan
Opera and gave a recital with James Levine, was an overnight sensation.
There have been chat-show appearances, a profile in Time magazine and a
spread in the New York Times, which crowned him 'the next Wotan'. The
bass-baritone from rural north Wales, still in his 20s, seemed unspoilt by
riches and stardom - which only added to the charm of a story tailor-made
for the American public.
Meanwhile, Vick's uproariously sophisticated staging of Shostakovich's Lady
Macbeth of Mtsensk turned the Met's image on its head: for once there was
real drama on stage and a sense of intellectual engagement among the
audience. Add Maria Ewing's kittenish Katerina and a hair-raising orchestral
performance under James Conlon - and you have a milestone in the work's
history.
This is the kind of 'modern' repertory one expects to be championed by New
York City Opera rather than the Met, where anything after Turandot is
anathema. In fact, a touring production of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk visited
the Met for a single performance in 1935 - a year after the St Petersburg
premiere - since when the opera might never have existed, judging by the
reaction of New York's audiences, musicians and critics.
So the new production has been blissfully cathartic, for the company as much
as its public: 20th century opera is OK after all, it can be interesting and
funny, it sells well, and why have we waited so long for this to happen?
Perhaps Levine and his board of directors can now be persuaded to take
glasnost an inch further, and open the Met's door to other artistic
luminaries of our fast-receding century.
Of course, it could all have gone disastrously wrong. Vick's decision to
modernise the setting, to choreograph the orchestral interludes and
punctuate the drama with Pop art and construction-site machinery, was a huge
risk. His courage was rewarded. The staging, a mixture of real and surreal,
of macabre farce and absurd fantasy, had the same perspicacious imagination
that characterises Shostakovich's music. Here was a tale of passion, greed
and brutality, mercilessly parodied.
Paul Brown's permanent set was a painted skyscape, slung diagonally across
the stage in the shape of a room. The refrigerator, television and saloon
car - not to mention the dated appeal of Katerina's rose-patterned dress -
could have been 1960s middle America, were it not for the icon on the wall,
the workers' red scarves, the socialist tower-blocks and neo-Stalinist riot
police. The beauty of it all was that the images were never specific. The
message was timeless, universal - and devastatingly true-to-life.
The wrestling and whipping, for example, were far more realistic than the
tame expressionism served up in most European stagings. And the equally
combative seduction scene had a frantic abandon reminiscent of The Postman
Always Rings Twice - except that a giant rose wafted up (love blossoming)
and the fridge door burst open at the climax, puncturing the tension with
laughter.
That was typical of the whole evening - and the Met audience did not need
Russian to get the jokes (there were no surtitles). Vick's sense of comic
timing was immaculate.
His sense of tragedy was not so keen. The last act was an anti-climax,
partly because the setting was a spotless contemporary gulag, partly because
the action was reduced to naked convention. Where the staging sagged,
Shostakovich's music came into its own. Conlon lent extra savagery to the
brass batteries by having the players line up in costume on a stage gallery.
The impact was chilling - even if the more private moments were underplayed.
That was entirely in keeping with a production which refused to caricature
the minor characters or beatify Katerina. Ewing bore the sultry, sexy,
self-conscious look of the girl who cannot help attracting male attention.
The voice is as problematic as ever - sometimes no more than a high-pitched
wail - but she was never less than audible, and her whole performance was
enthralling. Vladimir Galouzine, a name new to me, was the perfect Sergei:
macho and musical, with a rapier voice and the cheeky swagger that goes with
a lack of scruple. Mark Baker made an impressive Zinovy, looking more like a
workaholic provincial contractor than a wimpish husband. Sergei Koptchak was
the foul-mouthed Boris. The smaller parts were strongly cast.
The previous evening saw a revival of Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 production of
Don Giovanni, stiffly conducted by Leopold Hager. Here we returned to the
Met of international repute - museum opera in all its gormless, decorative
inertia. You could almost read the production-book as the singers took up
position for their arias. On one score alone, Zeffirelli deserves credit: he
never forgets the giocoso element. As in Lady Macbeth, the audience had no
need of surtitles to pick up the laughs.
But this was hardly the environment for deft ensemble or individual
imagination. The title role was sung by James Morris, one of the few
world-class Wagner singers who can sing Mozart with authority. He made a
tall, handsome, old-fashioned seducer. Sharon Sweet was the big, blowsy
Donna Anna, Carol Vaness a refined Donna Elvira, Stanford Olsen a
small-scale Don Ottavio. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo made a subdued local debut
as Masetto.
The main attraction of the revival was to have been Terfel's Leporello - but
he was forced to withdraw at the last moment because of back problems
(Herbert Perry substituted). According to Terfel's associates, he may have a
slipped disc and require an operation. Coming so soon after his Met debut
this is a cruel blow.
But it is surely no more than a temporary one, for his debut performances
have built a huge reserve of goodwill. Assessing his Figaro in glowing
terms, the New York Times said there was 'a bit of the rustic in Mr Terfel
which he uses with the savviness of an urbanite'. About his all-German
recital, the paper said he had 'a poet's affinity for words and their
underlying worlds of colour and emotion'. All America now wants to hear him
and there is talk of a Carnegie Hall recital.
It is now up to Terfel to decide how fast he wants his career to move. He
has the kind of once-in-a-generation talent which Columbia Artists
Management Inc, the American music industry mogul, would love to get its
hands on. If he is sensible, he will remain loyal to his Cardiff agent and
continue at his own steady pace. He has already agreed to sing Wozzeck for
Abbado and Stein at Salzburg in 1997, and he will record Wagner for Deutsche
Grammophon. But contrary to New York's expectations, let us hope he does not
become 'the next Wotan' - or the one after that.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology: Caught in the web - A new cyberspace
neighbourhood has joined the Internet and traffic is brisk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you thought the Internet was for 'techno-nerds', think again. Over the
past 18 months a vast new array of information resources has been added to
this global computer network that even a novice can navigate.
The World Wide Web (WWW) is the newest and fastest-growing neighbourhood in
cyberspace; a collection of about 10,000 'servers', or database computers,
up from about 3,000 in August with more being added everyday - containing
information on topics as diverse as fly fishing and home brewing to film
reviews and electronic newspapers.
The Web provides a set of standards, or formats, that enable users to access
information files on the Internet. What marks it out from earlier efforts is
its ability to allow users to move easily from relevant information in one
database to linked information in another one - which might be on the far
side of the world. The Internet itself is the network of computers that
exchanges information by using the same interconnection rules.
The Web has a flourishing 'commercial district' as hundreds of companies
begin to promote their wares over the Internet's global links. Most
important, it is the site of the first 'electronic commerce' on the
Internet, which is expected to explode over the next year.
The first filaments of the Web were spun in 1989 at Cern, the European
particle physics laboratory, in a project led by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer
scientist who is known as the 'father' of the WWW.
'The WWW was conceived as a seamless world in which all information, from
any source, can be accessed in a consistent and simple way . . . on any type
of computer, from any country, using one (standard) program,' says
Berners-Lee.
His vision has come close to reality over the past year, largely as a result
of the popularity of Mosaic, a software program that enables computer users
to 'browse' the databases and search swiftly through thousands of on-line
documents. It simplifies the task - a click of the mouse on a link-word in
one document automatically executes computer instructions to take the reader
to another related piece of information, be it text, graphics, sound or
video.
This is a huge improvement over the bewildering mass of different computer
protocols and languages that Internet users faced until recently. In effect,
Mosaic has become a tour guide to cyberspace - a guide that speaks all the
computer languages and knows the best sights.
Developed at the University of Illinois' National Centre for Supercomputing
Applications, Mosaic is available to individual users, via the Internet, at
no charge.
Since May, corporate computer users have purchased more than 10m copies of
an 'enhanced' version of Mosaic from Spyglass, a company set up to
commercialise the university's technology.
Traffic on the WWW is growing so fast that it is difficult to keep pace.
About 30m people are estimated to be using the Internet, with about 1m new
users logging on each month - many of them drawn by interest in the WWW.
Almost anybody can put up a 'home page' on the WWW. The McBryan family of
Boulder, Colorado, for example, claims to be the first home on the
information superhighway. Dad, Mum and the three kids are all wired up to
the Internet. 'What you will find here are prototypes of future infobahn
users,' they say, throwing in some family photos to illustrate their text.
Then there is Hillside Elementary School, in Minnesota, where Mrs Collins'
sixth-grade class project is to create a site on the WWW. Last year, the
third grade (ages 7-8) also participated.
An Intel engineer proudly shows off his contribution to the WWW - mock-up
photos designed to make him look like a felon being booked into jail and
some hyperlinks to discussions of British cars, his hobby.
The friendly feel of the WWW is also, however, making it the ideal locale
for businesses. You can find IBM, AT&amp;T, Ford, Mitsubishi and the Bank of
America on the Web, among many others. Search a bit further and you may find
menus of restaurants in Palo Alto, California, a wedding planning service
called 'Bridesmaid for Windows', a listing of homes for sale in San
Francisco and hundreds of other businesses.
Commercial 'domains', the Internet addresses for groups of users, have
multiplied from about 9,000 in 1991 to well over 20,000. Most are
experimenting on the Internet by posting public information and seeing how
much notice it gets.
A fledgling industry of consulting groups and service organisations is
growing up around the WWW, helping companies to create an on-line presence.
Business interest in the WWW is rapidly shifting, however, towards
electronic commerce. In Silicon Valley, for example, a group of electronics
manufacturers is building CommerceNet, an Internet marketplace for
electronics products.
Intel, one of the participants, predicts that eventually electronic commerce
will eliminate the 'middle men' or distributors that today play a critical
role in delivering all sorts of products to end-users.
The Web is also a new medium for publishing groups, with several newspapers
and magazines already on the Web. HotWired, an electronic version of the
trendy San Francisco high-tech magazine, is a big attraction on the WWW. The
San Jose Mercury News, a pioneer in electronic newspapers publishing with
its 'Mercury Center' on America Online, is also planning an Internet version
on the WWW.
As business interests multiply on the WWW, it is beginning to be seen as a
competitor to commercial on-line services such as Prodigy, Compuserve and
America Online for which users pay subscription plus fees according to how
much time they spend on line. The trend on the WWW, in contrast, is towards
free services supported by advertising revenues.
For the average user with a personal computer and a modem, access to the WWW
is slow. Yet as the availability of high-speed communications lines
increases, and prices decline, the WWW appears set to continue its
exponential growth and to create the much heralded 'information
superhighway' long before predictions of 'movies on demand' and 500 TV
channels come true.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology: Neural network fills gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week the government publishes a survey which was put together using one
of the biggest neural network systems - a computing technique loosely based
on the workings of the brain - yet developed.
The Department of Social Security has spent Pounds 400,000 on a neural
system to help prepare the DSS's Family Resources Survey, an exercise based
on interviews with 25,000 households which helps forecast and model benefit
expenditure. The system, which uses 1,500 individual neural networks, is the
largest in Europe, according to Recognition Systems, its Birmingham-based
developer.
The DSS statisticians turned to neural networks to fill in gaps in their
data, where interviewees had failed to answer particular questions. Filling
these gaps is important because bias would be introduced into the survey if
the questionnaires were left incomplete.
Although the adoption of neural networks in government surveys had few
precedents, their potential was obvious. Neural networks, which are trained
by example, can pick out patterns in large amounts of data.
The results of a pilot study were encouraging. It suggested that neural
computing technology was up to 40 per cent more accurate in estimating the
missing data items than classical statistical techniques such as regression
analysis.
The neural network proved capable of imputing results for 70 per cent of the
45,000 items that were missing from the survey's database, which totalled
10m items. There were insufficient examples of the other 30 per cent of
items, which involved unusual situations, for the neural network to handle.
The system has won the enthusiasm of Cheryl Morgan, the Family Resources
Survey's statistician. Not only does it produce more accurate results than
conventional techniques, but it costs less to run, she says.

The surge of interest in the Internet has prompted manufacturers to launch
equipment designed to give novices easier access.
Compaq, which believes it is the first large computer company to launch an
Internet-ready PC, will supply all its Presario computers with Easynet
software, which provides Internet access, from December 1. Prices range from
Pounds 1,399 to Pounds 1,799.
Carrera Technology, a UK company, has already launched a range of
Internet-ready PCs. A modem, Easynet software and a year's subscription to
the Internet adds an additional Pounds 349 to the cost of the computer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An enzyme-based drug detection system which can spot minute quantities of
heroin and morphine has been developed by the Institute of Biotechnology in
Cambridge.
The system uses an acetyl esterase enzyme extracted from a bacterium to
convert heroin to morphine, after which the morphine is oxidised using
morphine dehydrogenase, another enzyme. These reactions generate a product
that can be detected using an indicator.
The system is part of a hand-held, air-sampling monitor designed for
on-the-spot screening. The British Technology Group, which has filed patents
on the micro-organism and the enzymes, is seeking commercial partners.

Designing the acoustic systems for public buildings can be a hit-or-miss
affair, leading to inaudible announcements or the need for expensive
modifications.
Bose Corporation, an audio equipment manufacturer, has developed a computer
model which allows acoustic engineers to hear what public places will sound
like before constructions.
Its Auditioner system resulted from a nine-year research project which
focused on the acoustic modelling necessary to predict how sound travels and
the signal processing necessary to modify audio signals in the same way as
rooms do. It consists of a desktop computer workstation, an audio computer
fitted inside the workstation and audio playback apparatus for the listener.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping angina off the beat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potential advance in the understanding and treatment of artery narrowing
has been announced by researchers funded by the British Heart Foundation.
Angina, the chest pains caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the
heart, is usually successfully treated by angioplasty, a procedure which
widens narrowed arteries. But a third of patients suffer complications in
the form of renewed narrowing of the arteries or, more rarely, from the
formation of blood clots.
Research carried out by King's College School of Medicine in London, which
is due to be published in tomorrow's Lancet, found that a blood-clotting
mechanism is activated during angioplasty. Arterial narrowing appears to
stem from the excessive activity of growth factors contained in white blood
cells called platelets.
The researchers found that the platelet activity was inhibited in a small
group of patients who received an infusion of a nitrate medicine called
S-nitroso-glutathione GSNO before the angioplasty. It is thought to cause
nitric oxide to be released by the platelets, which acts as a brake on their
activity. Further work will now be undertaken.

Stuart Bridges, previously a director of Henderson Investment Management,
part of fund management group Henderson Administration, has been appointed
to the board of John I. Jacobs, the fledgling conglomerate.
For the past three years Bridges, 34, has been a fund manager at TR Property
Investment Trust. Now he joins Michael Kingshott, 47, who in May quit as
chief executive of Sally UK, the ferry operator that he founded, to become
managing director of John I. Jacobs.
According to Kingshott, he and Bridges 'have already worked closely together
on a number of transactions'. Bridges brings 'an expertise in corporate
finance and investment management to Jacobs, together with a detailed
knowledge of the property sector,' Kingshott says.
Jacobs still maintains an old-established firm of shipbrokers, but there are
plans to turn it into a what Kingshott calls a 'broadly-based shipping,
transport and property group'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Property: Rental values edge up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since December 1990, rental values for all properties
have shown a positive movement, achieving a growth of 0.1 per cent in
October, according to Investment Property Databank, a research group.
The improvement has been led by a rental growth of 0.2 per cent in the
retail sector. For the second consecutive month capital values have shown a
downward movement, by -0.2 per cent.
This capital-value decline has fed into the all-property total return which,
although still positive, continues to slow, recording 0.4 per cent for
October.
The all-property equivalent yield has stabilised at 8.1 per cent, although
the underlying yield shift continues to move outward, standing at 0.02 for
October.
The rates of both capital growth and total return have continued to slow.
Year-on-year total return has declined by 1.6 per-centage points, achieving
22.0 per cent for the year to October.
Capital growth has slowed across all sectors with an all-property capital
growth of 12.6 per cent for the year to October, compared with 13.9 per cent
for the 12 months to September.
Retail continues to be the best-performing sector with a return of 0.6 per
cent, while industrials and offices lag behind returning 0.4 per cent and
0.2 per cent respectively.

FT  25 NOV 94 / People: Tiphook finds a new finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook - soon to be renamed Central Transport Rental Group - yesterday
appointed Richard Raine as its new finance director - part of a spate of
senior management changes by newly-appointed chairman Ian Clubb.
In the past year, four of Tiphook's five executive directors have resigned,
leaving only founder and chief executive Robert Montague with any long-term
knowledge of its sharply diminished business. Indeed. Raine is replacing
Andrew Chandler, who lasted only one year.
He will be moving into a fairly hot seat. The company sold off its largest
operating business - container leasing - last March. It is facing a US Class
Action over bond issues in the US in 1992/1993; it remains saddled with
Pounds 512.5m of debt, and two operating businesses which both lost money
last year.
However, Raine is likely to get firm assistance from Clubb, the former
finance director of BOC, who has taken a hands-on approach to Tiphook that
belies his non-executive status.
Raine, a chartered accountant, was finance director of Bloomsbury Publishing
before its recent flotation, and has worked for a variety of other
companies, including building materials group Wickes.
He is also being joined by a new company secretary, Simon Enoch, who
previously worked at Kingfisher subsidiary B&amp;Q.
Further reshuffling among Tiphook's non-executive directors is expected to
follow, which could result in a complete turnround of the board (except for
Montague) within a 12-month period.
Kenneth Dick, the 81-year-old former Rothschild director, and Rupert Hambro,
the urbane merchant banker who took Tiphook's chairmanship for a brief but
turbulent period, are both expected to go.
The future of Montague himself has been in question, as he faced bankruptcy
charges, which, if successful, would disbar him from holding a directorship.
The hearing will be held in Oxford on December 22 but Montague is pushing
for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement. This would provide a structure for
partial repayment of creditors, while he retained his job.

FT  25 NOV 94 / People: Coleman: PW's World Leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So how does an unassuming accountant become a World Leader? In one easy
step, judging from 45-year-old Andrew Coleman, partner at Price Waterhouse
in charge of the European capital markets group, who has just been promoted
to the position of World Leader of a newly formed global capital markets and
treasury group.
The move comes in the context of the international accountancy firm's
rearrangement of its activities along industry rather than geographic lines.
'I guess the idea is to harness the power of individual batteries to get a
real charge,' says the new World Leader, 'rather than allowing (regional
centres) to do their own thing.'
The title itself, which he intimates is not of his own choosing, is designed
to distinguish between those running individual 'industry' divisions -
himself and others - and the chairman of the world financial services
practice, Thomas Macey.
The regrouping, which involves treasury being brought into the capital
markets fold, means that Coleman goes from managing a division of between
40-50 people to one encompassing between 400 and 500. His customers comprise
both the panoply of banks offering capital market and treasury services and
corporations, the would-be buyers of those services. The group will help the
banks originate and structure products and manage the risks on their books,
while advising companies on the likes of how to put risk management
frameworks in place.
A graduate of the London School of Economics, Coleman has been with PW his
entire working life, increasingly specialising on the capital markets side.
A partner for the past 12 years, he has become a well-known face in the
derivatives field, largely on account of his membership of the working group
which in 1993 produced the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Property: Quote, unquote - Are listed companies good value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From an international perspective, the structure of the UK property market
is unusual. The quoted property sector is valued at Pounds 13.5bn, with
assets of perhaps Pounds 16bn held in stock-exchange listed companies. No
other country has such a large number of quoted property companies.
But are investors right to support such a large quoted sector?
Between 1970 and the end of 1993, the Investment Property Databank index
showed an average annual total return of 12.4 per cent, excluding
development and trading activity. This is the return available to a passive
investor owning properties directly.
Over the same period, the quoted property sector also showed an average
total return of 12.4 per cent. In other words, property companies have - in
aggregate, over the long term - added nothing to the performance of their
underlying assets.
In theory, property companies should add value in two ways: through
management expertise and gearing. The performance of the shares suggests
these features are, at best, mixed blessings.
Management expertise costs money, which means that part of the investors'
income is eaten away by executive salaries and administrative costs.
According to an analysis by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, on
average 8 per cent of property companies' gross rental income is absorbed by
administration costs, over and above the cost of maintaining the buildings.
This average figure hides a wide variety of performance. The most costly
companies to run (usually developers) spend up to 20 per cent of gross rents
on administration.
'There are too many property companies and too few with the necessary skills
to outperform over the long run. There should be 40 larger property
companies rather than 120 smaller ones. The savings in terms of expenses
alone would enhance investment performance,' said Mr Marc Gilbard, analyst
at Goldman Sachs.
Gearing also cuts both ways. During the upturn shareholders see the value of
their company rise far faster than an ungeared investment. When property
values are falling, though, shareholders' funds can be rapidly eroded.
In an ideal world, property companies would borrow going into recovery and
repay debts as the market started to peak. Yet the sector has a nasty habit
of becoming over-geared at the wrong point in the cycle.
For example, average gearing across the sector is now about 60 per cent, low
by historic standards in spite of the early stage of recovery. Yet as the
market peaked in the late 1980s, average gearing rose to more than 100 per
cent.
In practice, gearing makes the performance of the shares more volatile than
the underlying property market.
This volatility is a disadvantage. Most institutional investors are
interested in the risk-adjusted return from their assets. Volatile assets
have to work harder to justify their place in the portfolio.
There are two main arguments in defence of property companies. First, just
because property companies in aggregate do not outperform their underlying
assets does not mean that individual companies cannot deliver spectacular
returns.
One of the best performing property companies over the past 20 years has
been Helical Bar, the developer run by Mr Michael Slade. The shares have
provided an annualised total return of 66 per cent over that period,
outperforming both the property market and the wider equity market by a
streak.
(Incidentally, the company also has one of the highest ratios of expenses to
rental income.)
Second, and more important, quoted property companies provide investors with
liquidity. This allows fund managers to increase and decrease their exposure
to the market at speed and low cost.
In contrast, buildings are an illiquid asset which are expensive to trade
and only available in large packages. Smaller investment institutions and
private investors, without the expertise to buy and manage a portfolio, rely
on property companies to do it for them.
If used effectively, the liquidity of property shares should help fund
managers achieve a better performance than from a passive portfolio of
properties. A fund which cleared out of the sector in 1989 and bought again
in 1992 will have seen impressive gains.
Yet fewer, bigger property companies would provide better liquidity at lower
administrative cost than the fragmented quoted sector now in evidence.
Against this background, it is surprising that so many property companies
have managed to flourish.
If the underlying property market is in for a dull period, as many
forecasters predict, companies which are low on management expertise and
high on expenses will struggle to justify their existence. Without a buoyant
property market to fall back on, the lacklustre performance of their shares
will be all the more obvious.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Management (Health Check): Pitfalls of indulgence - Carol
Cooper looks at how best to survive the Christmas festivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanks to classical experiments conducted by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick
II, it has been known since the 13th century that exercise inhibits
digestion.
Frederick made two slaves eat a big meal. Afterwards one rested while the
other was made to exercise vigorously. Both were then executed, which showed
that the one who had exercised still had a full stomach.
More research in this area seems unnecessary.
As the festive season approaches, more and more employees will get together
and indulge away from the office. One 'Christmas dinner' may be fun, but
there are often many such occasions every year.
Over-indulging in food has obvious consequences, and there can be more
immediate effects, especially if the food is different from one's usual
diet. Quantity matters, too. In company one tends to eat when not hungry,
and research confirms that the amount consumed increases with the number of
people at table.
In a business context this matters most at lunchtime. The early afternoon is
a soporific time of day anyway, and since the normal response to a heavy
meal is to sleep it off, a valiant struggle to get back to work may result
in little getting done.
A large lunch also potentiates the depressant effect of alcohol. After a
heavy meal, a short walk in the fresh air can help but, as Frederick's
experiments showed, brisk exercise, such as going to the gym or running to
catch a train, should be avoided.
Leaving aside its long-term risks, alcohol has well- documented effects on
attitudes, concentration, reaction times and co-ordination. The risk of road
traffic accidents is doubled by a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 80 mg
per millilitre and increases more or less exponentially at levels beyond
this. Those convicted of driving with a BAC of 200 mg per millilitre are
considered high-risk offenders.
One can often tell - if only with hindsight - how many drinks will loosen
inhibitions and result in saying or doing something regrettable. But it is
less easy to guess how much alcohol will raise BAC to a certain level. BAC
depends not only on the quantity imbibed but on personal characteristics
such as size, age, sex and the state of one's liver.
About 90 per cent of alcohol absorbed is metabolised by liver enzymes into
acetaldehyde, with the rest being excreted in breath, sweat and urine.
Acetaldehyde is then converted into carbon dioxide and water, and all one
can be reasonably sure about is that the normal adult takes about an hour to
eliminate each unit of alcohol (one unit corresponds roughly to one small
measure of spirits, one glass of wine, or half a pint of lager).
A BAC of 80 mg per cent is often known as the 'legal limit' because driving
with a level above this is a statutory offence. But a BAC as low as 30 mg
per millilitre can impair driving skills, and within the Road Traffic Act
there is a legal nicety worth knowing about. Section 4 warns that a person
who when driving or attempting to drive is unfit through drink or drugs, is
guilty of an offence.
With care, it is possible to enter into the spirit of the festivities
without adverse effects. Eating with drinks can help delay absorption of
alcohol. Diluting spirits (or even wine) and alternating alcohol drinks with
mineral water are other ways of reducing intake.
The usual pub measure is 1/6 gill in England and Wales, but drinks poured
outside pubs can be more generous. If, as in the case of punches, you are
unsure of how much or even what you're drinking, be cautious and stick to
something you know.
Extra-strength lager contains nearly three times as much alcohol as ordinary
lager, while low-alcohol drinks vary enormously. Some are almost
alcohol-free; others are up to half the strength of the average table wine.
If you're only thirsty, have soft drinks.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Management: How to bridge functional gaps - Electrolux is
integrating, with a difference, as it tries to become more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago this month a group of Scandinavian middle managers from
Electrolux, the Swedish household appliances multinational, spent several
days at a conference centre in Sigtuna, a town north of Stockholm.
Officially, their purpose was to learn new marketing skills.
But the debate kept turning to a much deeper problem: how to bridge the
'functional' barriers that still bedevil the company, separating its sales
and marketing organisation from its product development and factory units -
what Electrolux calls the 'industrial' side of the organisation.
This gulf has made the company slower, less innovative and less
cost-efficient than it should be, hampering its ability to beat arch-rivals
such as Germany's Bosch-Siemens and America's Whirlpool-Philips. It is still
suffering from this problem, in spite of the improved profits trend it
reported this month.
In one of the conference coffee breaks at Sigtuna, a couple of the managers
sketched a diagram on the whiteboard entitled 'how things should be done'.
In place of the company's current structure, they drew what they called an
'integrated' organisation, in which sales, marketing and 'industrial' were
all merged into a set of international product divisions, each with a full
range of functional responsibilities.
Electrolux's top management also feels keenly about the urgent need to
integrate the two sides of the organisation. 'It is an absolute necessity,'
says Leif Johansson, president of the group since 1991, when Anders Scharp
moved up to the chairmanship. 'It is the only way to achieve the necessary
competitive speed.'
But in recent months Johansson has made it clear that he considers a
structural merger impractical. Instead, he is trying to achieve the
integration by various other means, both 'hard' and 'soft'.
Electrolux has thereby declared itself a dissident from a powerful movement
that is emerging among multinational companies in industries as diverse as
engineering, information technology and chemicals. In a quest to increase
competitive speed, and cut complexity and costs, most companies are
streamlining their organisations by shifting the internal balance of
responsibility and power sharply towards their international product
divisions or 'lines of business'.
This is being done at the expense of the other dimensions of the complex
'matrix' organisations which these companies used to operate. The other two
dimensions were functional management, such as technology and production;
and geographic management (either national or regional), which in most
multinationals has been in charge of sales and marketing.
In IT, IBM has been moving steadily in this direction since Lou Gerstner
took over as chairman early last year. The American giant's latest step this
summer provoked the defection of the German head of IBM Europe, disgruntled
over the latest erosion of his own power, and that of his managers.
In chemicals, Ciba and ICI are just two of a cluster of groups which have
taken similar steps, again not without controversy.
Only a minority of companies in any industry is following the lead set by
ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant, in maintaining a matrix in which
the national subsidiaries retain considerable power over both sales and
marketing.
In moving so strongly to divisional structures, most other companies are
running a twofold risk of swinging the pendulum too far towards divisional
management: loss of touch with national market differences; and
demoralisation of the very managers on whom that responsiveness depends.
Electrolux is well aware of this risk. So, in the marketing and sales side
of its European organisation, it is retaining a strong element of national
management, in practice though not in name.
When it abolished its powerful country managers in Europe in late 1992, it
gave about half their responsibilities to three pan-European 'industrial'
divisions, which now control product development and manufacture. Two, for
'cold' and 'hot' products, are based in Stockholm. The 'wet' one, covering
washing machines and dishwashers, is  - appropriately - based near Venice.
But instead of transferring the country managers' power over national
marketing to the new divisions, these were given - as at Whirpool - to a
central marketing unit based in Italy. Much-expanded under a top manager
from Stockholm, Christer Forstrom, this unit now controls all European
marketing and sales through brand 'portfolio managers' in each country or
sub-region.
A number of Electrolux managers felt this should be only an interim step,
and that a full-blown merger of the marketing and industrial sides should
follow. Hence last year's backchat at Sigtuna.
At top management level, 'we talked a lot about merging the marketing and
industrial sides of the organisation, but decided not to because it would
actually cause much greater complications than what we have now - it would
recreate a very complex matrix', explains Aldo Burello, head of the 'wet'
products division.
The reason for this is that Electrolux runs four different brands in most
countries. It is enough of a challenge for the European marketing unit to
co-ordinate them, without adding all the difficulties that would arise if
each product division had to run four brands. 'It would mess up our account
management completely,' says Johansson.
Stressing the need for a unitary marketing organisation, Halvar Jonzon,
brand portfolio manager for Scandinavia, says 'trade customers expect you to
be able to handle the full range of products from all three divisions -
cold, hot and wet - not only by brand, but also by all brands'.
These barriers to further structural integration give an added urgency to
the wide range of other mechanisms which Johansson and his team have
unleashed over the past year. They deal partly with new processes,
procedures and systems, but also with factors such as people's sense of
sharing a common set of goals, and their willingness to co-operate with each
other regardless of their specialisms and formal reporting lines.
'Integration is very much a question of people's mindsets,' says Johansson.
The initiatives represent an even greater challenge for Electrolux than for
most companies.
This is because of the fact, now recognised throughout the company, that
Electrolux's long era of growth by acquisition is at an end after the
takeovers a decade ago of Zanussi in Italy and White (Frigidaire) in the US,
plus AEG's appliance arm this autumn. As a result, many of its past
management attitudes, skills and practices are in need of urgent change. 'In
organic growth, the core competencies you need are entirely different from
during restructuring,' says Forstrom.
Among the new processes, two are particularly ambitious. The first
constitutes classic 're-engineering': a comprehensive 'order-to-payment'
process which will span virtually the whole of sales, manufacturing,
logistics and payments operations across Europe.
Ulf Sodergren, who heads the new process, claims the first pilot projects
are cutting order-to-delivery times by up to 80 per cent, and halving stock
levels.
The second initiative is a mechanism which many re-engineering-minded
companies are signally failing to introduce: an integrated reporting system.
For the first time in Electrolux, this measures cross-border financial
performance by product division and brand. In process terms, 'we're starting
to measure end-to-end flows', says Johann Bygge, the group's controller.
Together with other new integrated information, measurement and reward
systems, this will do much more than just stop the traditional haggling over
internal transfer prices.
It will also end each manager's tendency to optimise his or her own unit's
performance to the detriment of the overall European division, brand or
process of which it forms part. 'But this is not happening overnight - it
needs a long education process,' says Bygge.
'Systems thinking' of this kind is hard to breed in any company. For one
with Electrolux's strong functional, national and decentralised traditions,
it will be extra tough.

A bill to authorise the building of the 67-mile, Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel
high-speed rail link was published yesterday. The bill may take up to two
years to complete its passage through parliament, and the project is
unlikely to be completed before 2002.
The bill also includes the widening of 11 miles of Kent's A2 trunk road at

FT  25 NOV 94 / United tourism plans for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The island of Ireland is to be promoted as a single tourist destination. The
initiative was unveiled yesterday by Baroness Denton, the Northern Ireland
economy minister, and Mr Charlie McCreevy, the Irish tourism minister, on
the back of the paramilitary ceasefire, John Murray Brown writes.
The joint initiative will target US and European markets in a Pounds 6.8m
marketing initiative which is expected to attract 92,000 extra visitors next
year.
Mr McCreevy was quick to stress that the project was being handled by the
tourism industry, not the respective governments. It will be funded by the
private sector, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Union.
Unionists in the north have in the past expressed opposition to any moves by
Dublin to exercise executive role in Ulster's affairs, even in
non-controversial areas.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Investors weigh network's returns: Charles Batchelor looks
at Railtrack's pros and cons for those tempted by the planned flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market flotation of Railtrack - the company running British Rail's
track, signalling and stations - represents for the government the logical
way of imposing financial discipline on the railway.
Railtrack will charge a commercial rate to the train operators who may thus
be persuaded to weigh carefully the costs of running marginal services.
The government's critics feel this has simply created a railway
infrastructure monopoly and means that train operators no longer have direct
control over their main costs.
But these broader arguments will only be of indirect relevance for the City.
Investors will be interested in whether Railtrack can manage effectively the
myriad of contracts it will sign with train operators, its suppliers and the
companies which will maintain the railway. They will be concerned that the
break-up of the railway does not impose excessive costs and a layer of
bureaucracy which renders the whole exercise uneconomic.
Investors will be asked to buy into a new company with just over 10,000
miles of route, 23,000 miles of track (because most routes have at least
dual tracks), nearly 2,500 stations and associated signalling systems.
The Treasury has put a value of Pounds 6.5bn on these assets using the
'modern equivalent asset value' method common in transport undertakings. The
real market value of Railtrack has been estimated at between Pounds 3.3bn
and Pounds 4.3bn by brokers Kleinwort Benson, but other observers think even
this is too high.
The Treasury has also set Railtrack a target for its return on assets of 5.1
per cent, rising in annual increments to 8 per cent in year four. Railtrack
will presumably attempt to beat these targets in the private sector - but it
will have to contend with the rail regulator, Mr John Swift, who is keen to
see it does not exploit its monopoly position.
Mr Swift is still reviewing the question of access charges to the track, but
he expects to announce his findings shortly, and in a second policy
statement due in April. Until December 1996 he is obliged to accept the
guidance of Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary - but Mr Swift has
already revealed a determination to curb Railtrack's monopoly powers.
The real significance of the physical assets is the cost to Railtrack of
maintaining them. In spite of the fact that its cupboard includes 90,000
bridges and several hundred listed buildings, relatively few will require
complete replacement within the framework of any business plan.
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, has said he plans to reduce his annual
maintenance bill of about Pounds 1.8bn. BR's maintenance and track renewal
companies are to be privatised and work will also be offered to other
outside contractors.
Railtrack is already accepting bids from maintenance companies in other
regions in preference to the 'local' company. Track maintenance costs could
be cut from Pounds 10,000 a mile to Pounds 7,000 a mile annually, according
to one independent estimate.
In addition to maintaining the existing railway, Mr Horton has committed
himself to spending Pounds 550m on new projects this year, rising to Pounds
750m in 1996-97. Apart from Railtrack's own budget, it plans to bring in
private-sector contributions to large projects such as the Pounds
500m-Pounds 600m upgrading of the main West Coast line. Projects such as
this are hugely expensive, but can generate significant cost savings, for
example by computerising signalling systems, and by attracting new customers
to fast, modern trains.
On the revenue side of the company's profit and loss account are the charges
the 25 train operating companies and freight groups will pay. Passenger
train access charges have been set at Pounds 2.2bn in year one with most of
this to be met by Treasury subsidy.
There will inevitably be pressure in future to reduce this sum although Mr
Roger Salmon, the director responsible for selling train operating
franchises, believes he has as firm a commitment as can be expected from the
Treasury to maintain subsidies. Nevertheless Railtrack and the train
operators will have to respond by improving efficiency, reducing costs and
attracting more passengers.
In addition to the access revenues, Railtrack will be attempting to increase
the Pounds 142m it earns in rent from its Pounds 2bn property portfolio.
Under BR management some of the larger modernised stations, such as London's
Liverpool Street and Victoria, have already become retail centres.
Rail enthusiasts may feel that activities such as this represent a
distraction from the the main business of running a railway. But investors
will see it as the exploitation of legitimate business opportunities which
they will expect Railtrack to expand.

FT  25 NOV 94 / CBI price survey adds to rate rise pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of manufacturers planning to increase prices rose again this
month, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry monthly
trends survey, renewing fears of inflationary pressures.
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, has in the past paid
particular attention to the CBI prices findings, and today's result will
fuel speculation that the governor will press for an early rise in base
rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on December 7.
However, the CBI survey did find that manufacturers are enjoying buoyant
export orders and increases in output.
The CBI also warned, in its latest economic forecast, that too aggressive
tax cuts before the next general election might, if combined with a fall in
sterling, threaten the government's inflation target.
The government's aim is to keep underlying inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) within the lower half of the 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target band.
However, the CBI's model says the target will be missed if Pounds 4bn of tax
cuts in 1996 is combined with a 5 per cent decline in sterling.
Without tax cuts, the CBI forecasts the target will be met, on the
assumption that base rates rise by 1 3/4 percentage points - to 7.5 per cent
 -by 1996. The first rise - of half a percentage point - is likely to occur
in the first quarter of next year.
Ms Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economist, said the organisation 'would
support interest rate rises of around this size', because it believed the
government should meet its inflation target.
The CBI forecasts that economic growth, which was likely to be around 3.9
per cent (allowing for the recently revised third-quarter data) this year,
would fall to 2.8 per cent next year and in 1996.
The recovery will be rebalanced away from consumption and towards exports
and investment.
Today's monthly survey found that 30 per cent of manufacturers planned to
increase prices over the next four months, while only 8 per cent planned to
reduce them.
This positive balance of 22 percentage points was up from 20 points in
October and 15 points in September, and was the highest figure since January
1991.
However, Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate economic director, said
that manufacturers had frequently not been able to raise prices in line with
expectations.
In addition, price expectations might be particularly high at the moment
because of the forthcoming January list increases.
The CBI survey also found that export orders were at the strongest level
since March 1988, and that total orders were at their highest since March
1989.
The balance of those reporting an increase in export orders was 10
percentage points, compared with a negative balance of 2 points in October.
The balance of those reporting higher output increased to 21 percentage
points in November, from 19 points, having fallen in each of the past two
months.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Opposition Budgets focus on job creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two main opposition parties yesterday unveiled alternative Budgets
focusing on tax reform, job creation and investment in industry and
education. Both shadow Budgets also called for the reversal of the
government's plans for a second increase in the level of value added tax on
domestic fuel, from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
However, the parties adopted starkly different approaches to taxation.
Labour gave no figures, in line with the party's policy of leaving detailed
decisions on tax rates and thresholds until close to the next general
election.
By contrast, the Liberal Democrats set out comprehensive tax proposals,
including an increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in marginal taxation
on incomes over Pounds 100,000.
Tentative plans for higher taxes on incomes over Pounds 40,000 have been
dropped for the time being, but Mr Malcolm Bruce, Treasury spokesman, said
that such increases had not been ruled out of the manifesto for the next
general election.
Labour's Budget submission focused on plans to offer employers a six-month
tax rebate of up to Pounds 75-a-week in return for hiring the long-term
unemployed.
The party said the rebate would cost up to Pounds 100m in the first year -
but would 'more than pay for itself' the year after because of savings from
benefits and lower unemployment.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, said the proposals would help 1m people
unemployed for more than one year and 300,000 of those out of work for more
than two years.
Labour also called for a review of corporate taxation, a Business
Development Bank to raise funding for small and medium-sized businesses and
a 'moratorium law' giving small companies in financial difficulty time to
avoid bankruptcy.
The party repeated earlier pledges to implement higher taxes on the profits
of privatised utilities, and a special windfall levy on the Pounds 3.5bn
profit that will accrue to the regional electricity companies when the
National Grid is sold or transferred later this year.
The Liberal Democrat Budget proposes a Pounds 1.8bn increase in education
investment, as part of a Pounds 4.72bn increase in public spending which
would also include a Pounds 900m back-to-work scheme and higher spending on
health and the police.
The party would also forego Pounds 950m of revenue by reducing National
Insurance contributions for the lower paid, increasing the total cost of
spending and tax reductions to Pounds 5.675bn.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Cost cuts 'may hit standards in the civil service'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday called for a code of conduct for public officials - and warned
that traditional civil service standards 'should not be relaxed in order to
secure economy and efficiency'.
The Treasury and civil service committee drew up its report amid fears that
recent reforms of Whitehall's operations have undermined integrity and
impartiality. The report says reforms have 'reinforced the need for greater
vigilance about standards throughout the civil service'.
At the heart of the committee's recommendations - agreed unanimously by the
committee - is a proposed civil service code, establishing basic rules of
behaviour for the nation's 500,000 public servants.
Following confusion over responsibilities of ministers and officials in the
arms-for-Iraq scandal, it recommends the creation of a Civil Service
Commission to hear complaints where a Whitehall official feels a breach of
procedures has taken place.
The report also lays down some principles of conduct for ministers.
The committee stresses the importance of the principle that any minister
found to have knowingly misled parliament must resign. 'The knowledge that
ministers and civil servants may evade questions and put the best gloss on
the facts but not lie or knowingly mislead the House is one of the most
powerful tools members (of parliament) have in holding the executive to
account,' the report says.
Reporting on the creation of Next Steps agencies - which carry out executive
functions on behalf of government departments - the committee warns that
standards will be threatened unless the government introduces legislation
setting out rules of conduct for ministers and officials.
The report says that if Next Steps status comes to be seen as 'a staging
post to the private sector' the value of executive agencies will be
considerably reduced.
The committee also has harsh words for the government's market-testing
initiative, saying it has 'not been conducted effectively by the government'
and has not won the broad support of civil servants.
The MPs express their astonishment at the small number of in-house bids
permitted under the government's competing for quality programme in 1992-93.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Clarke signals 'wise men' changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday reappointed the Treasury's
six-man panel of independent economic forecasters for one year while paving
the way for future changes.
The Treasury announced that two of the 'wise men' - Professor David Currie,
head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, and Prof Wynne
Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University - would serve
until the end of 1995.
The other four existing members were appointed until the end of 1996. These
are Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research; Prof Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street
Research; Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist for Goldman Sachs; and Prof
Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University.
In future the panel will produce two reports a year, compared with three
annually since it was set up in December 1992. This will bring it into line
with the Treasury, which by law has to produce two economic forecasts a
year.
The Treasury said the chancellor's goal was to change the membership of the
panel over time with appointments normally of three years. In practice a
third of the panel will change every year in future.
The names of the first two new members would be announced during 1995. The
two-year appointments announced yesterday would ensure some continuity until
the end of 1996, when there would be a further change of membership.
The panel was set up after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism to promote greater openness in economic policy making. Its members
were prone to squabble in the early days but, after initial hesitation, Mr
Clarke pronounced it useful.
However, the changed terms of reference and moves to turn over its
membership were seen in Whitehall last night as a sign that the forecasters
had earned only 'two cheers' from the chancellor.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Rail chairman with points to prove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even a company with as solid an asset portfolio as Railtrack will be judged
ultimately on the quality of its management rather than the elegance of its
Victorian stations or the robustness of its viaducts.
In Mr Robert Horton, its chairman, Railtrack has a leader with a
well-charted career history. He spent 35 years climbing to the top at
British Petroleum only to be ousted in 1992 when a tough cost-cutting
programme failed to reverse declining profits.
Barely installed at Railtrack, he was confronted with a signal workers'
strike and the first public test of his management skills. For someone long
used to operating in a highly regulated industry such as oil, Mr Horton's
performance before a Commons employment committee considering the dispute
was surprisingly uncertain.
His offer to donate to charity the difference between his Pounds 120,000
salary and the Pounds 46,000 earned by Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of
the RMT transport union, if it would resolve the dispute served only to
demonstrate a bizarre sense of the theatrical.
For all his long experience of big company management and his enthusiasm for
the railway, Mr Horton is a newcomer to the business. Industry expertise at
a senior level is provided by Mr John Edmonds, Railtrack chief executive and
a railway man for 34 years.
Under senior management comes a clutch of directorates for areas such as
civil engineering and procurement as well as 10 zonal or regional directors.
Railtrack's literature makes much of the zonal structure although some train
operators say important decisions are referred to head office. They also
accuse Railtrack of arrogance in its dealings with them.
It will clearly be difficult for such a large monopoly player in the new
railway industry to be loved by its smaller partners. Few doubt Mr Horton's
ability to run a tight ship - but management might give some priority to
polishing a somewhat tarnished image.

FT  25 NOV 94 / MP's bill to target proceeds of crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Hannam, Conservative MP for Exeter, is expected to introduce a bill
giving the courts powers to confiscate assets built up through criminal
activities - after coming third in the annual ballot for private members'
bills.
Speaking after the ballot yesterday, Sir John said he was 'minded' to adopt
what will be widely regarded as an off-the-peg bill provided by the Home
Office. If he goes ahead with the measure there is little doubt that it will
secure widespread support.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has already promised that his
department will provide 'every help' in drafting the measure.
The bill would ensure that when people have engaged in a series of crimes,
the courts will be able to assume that all the property that has passed
through the criminal's hands in the previous six years came from crime. They
will be empowered to confiscate its value.
The bill will also prevent the defendant from frustrating a confiscation
order by serving a term of imprisonment in default.
Mrs Diana Maddock, Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, who came first in
the ballot, may introduce an energy conservation bill targeted at domestic
premises.
Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Devonport, who came second, plans to
introduce a measure imposing more stringent safety standards on outdoor
adventure centres which provide canoeing and other sporting activities for
schools.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Scottish housing transfer attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons public accounts committee yesterday criticised Scottish Homes
for failing to secure the best price for more than 1,000 properties it sold
to a housing trust in the Borders region.
The cross-party committee of MPs attacked state-owned Scottish Homes for
accepting, in 1992, a Pounds 5.8m bid from Waverley Housing, an independent
trust, for the 1,191 houses, over a higher bid of Pounds 6.3m.
The MPs also criticised Scottish Homes for failing to ensure proper
competition in the sale and for awarding Waverley the contract to manage the
houses.
The management contract was awarded to Waverley, without competition, in
February 1989, even though the trust had only been established two months
earlier and an experienced housing association was also interested.
The MPs expressed concern that no records were kept of six meetings in 1987
and 1988 between Scottish Office officials and individuals who later
established Waverley, saying this was 'very unusual'.
Waverley's management costs were more than double previous bills.
Costs for managing 1,800 Borders houses had come to about Pounds 1.2m in
three years before the contract was awarded to Waverley.
But the bill then rose to Pounds 2.4m over three years for Waverley's
management of only 1,300 homes.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Fatal work accidents lowest ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fatal accidents at work are at a record low level, the Health and Safety
Commission (HSC) said yesterday.
Provisional figures in the HSC annual report for 1993-94 said that 379
people were killed at work during the year, compared with 452 in 1992-93.
Recorded injuries which caused three or more days' absence from work fell by
over 8,000 to 134,000 - but the real figure, including unreported accidents,
is believed to be three times greater, which Mr Frank Davies, HSC chairman,
said was 'disgracefully high'.
Mr Davies said the UK had been free of large injury accidents in recent
years though there had been a few 'near big ones', including a fire in
February at Associated Octel in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and an explosion
at Texaco's refinery in Milford Haven in July.
Welcoming the accident reductions, the Trades Union Congress calculated that
HSE measures could have saved the economy more than Pounds 200m last year,
including Pounds 70.5m in output because of a reduction in the number of
reportable injuries.
Mr John Rimington, director general of the HSE, highlighted
asbestosis-related diseases which, he said, were causing three times as many
deaths as workplace accidents every year.
He said: 'Demolition and construction workers are still exposed to this
fibre which is one of the biggest killers in society.'
The number of people claiming compensation for occupational asbestosis, he
said, had increased threefold since 1981 and would continue to rise.
He added: 'Thousands of tonnes of asbestos insulation and board remain in
buildings. It is not easily identified.' The HSE, he said, was planning an
asbestos awareness campaign within the construction industry in the New
Year.

FT  25 NOV 94 / SIB aids clients of Knight Williams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, has agreed to
become closely involved in monitoring complaints against Knight Williams,
one of the UK's largest independent financial advisers.
The new complaints procedure offers Knight Williams' clients an alternative
to the existing system. The firm has agreed to analyse each complaint
brought, including those already rejected or failed at arbitration.
Personal interviews between the complainant and a Knight Williams employee
will be recorded for SIB's benefit. If an investor does not want to talk to
the firm, SIB will pay for a third party - Ernst &amp; Young, chartered
accountants - to interview them instead.
SIB will inform Knight Williams of cases where it believes the firm's
handling of the complaint falls short of regulatory standards.
Complaints against an independent adviser are normally handled by the firm
involved and then by Fimbra, its self-regulatory body. SIB confirmed
yesterday that it was 'fairly unusual' for it to be involved so closely in
the complaints procedure of a member of another body, but said it was partly
as a result of Fimbra staffing shortages.
Fimbra closed for new business at the end of September in the wake of the
creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect
the private investor.
Mr Kenneth Jordan, chairman of the Knight Williams Investors Action Group,
said the new procedure indicated there were problems for small investors
wishing to complain against an independent adviser. 'However, now is the
opportunity for these problems to be resolved on the basis of reconciliation
and mutual trust,' he said.
Knight Williams attracted considerable publicity when MPs, including Sir
David Steel, former Liberal leader, tabled an early-day motion voicing
concern at the number of complaints against the firm. It was fined Pounds
50,000 by Fimbra in August for breaching 10 Fimbra rules, including issuing
misleading advertisements and failing to maintain proper client records.
Knight Williams said it welcomed the SIB move 'unreservedly'. Its
application to become a member of the PIA, lodged in April, has still not
been processed but it can continue to conduct business until the end of
September next year when SIB's recognition of Fimbra terminates.

FT  25 NOV 94 / BT called to talks over security breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Data Protection Registrar has called for talks with British
Telecommunications over a breach of security that has resulted in the leak
of some of the UK's most sensitive security telephone numbers.
BT began its own inquiry as doubts grew last night over the existence of a
hacker supposed to have penetrated the computers, removed sensitive
telephone numbers and addresses and transmitted them over the Internet, the
international computer network.
The Independent newspaper yesterday said the hacker had sent thousands of
confidential records including telephone numbers for MI5, MI6, Downing
Street and Buckingham Palace to Mr Stephen Fleming, described as a freelance
journalist.
The Independent said Mr Fleming had worked without pay for only three days
at BT, to check the veracity of the information he was receiving. The
information, it was said, was sent over the Internet from someone who
claimed to have penetrated BT security.
The telephone company said last night that Mr Fleming had been an employee
of the organisation for two months during the summer.
It accepted that there had been a genuine breach of security and that
sensitive numbers had been taken from the database but said there was no
evidence of hacking - jargon for defeating computer security devices. It
said last night that its Customer Service System was secure and
exceptionally robust. It added: 'Despite an extensive and on-going search,
BT has found no evidence that the confidential information has ever been
available on the Internet.'
Internet experts said last night the volume of traffic travelling across the
Internet was so great that it would be unlikely for anyone to have been able
to track the transmission.
Mr Fleming is a former pharmaceutical salesman who has recently worked for
United Artists cable networks in Edinburgh.
Mr Ian Hargreaves, Independent editor, said last night that the story had
been thoroughly researched over several weeks. Mr Fleming had not been paid
for his story.
The breach highlights a lack of awareness of computer security endemic
across British business. Professor Henry Becker of Zergo, a security
consultancy which works for public and private-sector organisations, said
computer security at BT was better than at most commercial companies.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Marketmakers urged to lift veil of secrecy: Norma Cohen on
the debate over rules which allow delays in publication of share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In financial markets, information is money. So it is not surprising that the
question of who has access to information and when has become the subject of
emotive debate in the City.
Yesterday the Office of Fair Trading released a study concluding that Stock
Exchange rules which allow marketmakers to delay publication of the prices
at which they bought or sold securities are inherently anti-competitive.
At the heart of the debate, regulators and City officials say, is the future
of the market-making system through which Pounds 564bn worth of shares
changed hands last year. Marketmakers are securities firms which, using
their own capital, agree to buy and sell large parcels of shares through all
market conditions.
They say their system, which provides liquidity for institutional investors,
cannot continue unless it is profitable. And if all business becomes public
as soon as it is transacted, it will not be profitable.
They argue that unless such large share trading remains partly opaque,
London will be forced to adopt the order-matching system in which bargains
between buyers and sellers are matched with each other in terms of quantity
and price - as is the case in most European markets. This, they argue, is a
bad deal for shareholders because it reduces liquidity, and London's
standing as an international financial centre will suffer.
Leading institutional investors, who rely on the system, have generally
supported the marketmakers. Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the investment
committee of the National Association of Pension Funds, the UK's largest
shareholder group, said: 'We value both liquidity and transparency but if we
had to value one over the other, we would prefer to maintain liquidity.'
He conceded that lack of transparency had some drawbacks. For one thing, it
has made it difficult to price accurately increasingly important equity
derivatives which depend on accurate information about share trading in cash
markets. Also, it is difficult to execute 'programme trades' for large
baskets of shares because doing so requires 'freezing' the price of each
stock at the same point in the day. 'You may be freezing the stock at the
wrong price,' he said.
All these concerns have weighed on the minds of regulators in considering
how to direct the debate about transparency in trading. While anxious not to
unravel the market-making system which has proved so successful in making
London the world's centre for international share trading, they are
concerned that changes in the way share trading is executed around the world
will force changes in London.
The exchange has largely taken the views of its big market-making members to
heart. To buttress its point, it has commissioned a study by consultants
Oliver Wyman - which it has not yet released - that concludes that
marketmakers already suffer big losses on their largest trades.
For trades which are 30 to 50 times normal market size - the average size of
deals in that share for the previous 12 months - marketmakers lose roughly
61 per cent of the capital they place at risk.
That is because marketmakers - or indeed investors - adjust the prices they
subsequently offer for the same security to reflect the most recent trade.
The actual price at which shares in a particular company last traded hands
has real monetary value.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive at Smith New Court, one of London's
biggest marketmakers, said recently: 'I believe we need marginally less
transparency, not more.'
The OFT has a different view. It has concluded that investors get a bad deal
because marketmakers offering to buy or sell their shares do so at a wider
'spread' between the buy and sell prices than they otherwise might. This
spread can represent profit to the marketmaker. Because they know they are
ignorant of their competitors' deals, marketmakers could be making wider
spreads than they would otherwise in order to account for the uncertainty.
'Public information is generally available in the market, while private
information is known to only one or more market participants,' the OFT
report noted. 'It is private information which allows particular traders to
gain at the expense of others.'
Marketmakers who agree to buy a large line of stock from an institutional
investor are likely to witness an immediate marking down of that share by
other market participants as soon as the sale becomes public knowledge.
It was this practice in the years after Big Bang in 1986, when all big
trades had to be reported immediately, that led to swingeing losses for
marketmakers.
In response, the exchange decided to allow members to delay trade
publication. Current rules allow publication of any transaction at least
three times the normal market size of any stock to be delayed for 90 minutes
while the marketmaker hedges his position against a sharp price reaction.
Moreover, any trade 75 times normal market size may be delayed for up to
five days or until the transaction is hedged.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Subsidy scheme to develop forest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to finance the development of the National Forest by
topping up the existing system of subsidies to landowners.
The National Forest is aimed at providing 200 sq miles of the Midlands with
wooded landscape, combining environmental change with economic regeneration.
The area's forestry cover would rise from 6 per cent to 30 per cent. It
would, said the National Forest strategy, published yesterday, be 'woven
into the physical and economic fabric of the area', which straddles
Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said in Burton-on-Trent yesterday
he had no idea what specific spending on the forest would be. But the
government would supplement the woodland grant scheme, the staple subsidy
for forestry initiatives, with incentives for the National Forest area at a
cost of Pounds 1m in the first year.
The woodland grant scheme, on which Pounds 15m will be spent in England
during this financial year, provides subsidies for the establishment and
management of plantations.
Under the new incentive system, landowners in the National Forest area can
tender for additional funds to pay for projects leading to the provision of
open space and other public benefits.
Development of the forest will be under the control of a new government
quango - whose first chairman will be Mr Rodney Swarbrick.
The quango will start operations in April. Separately, the Department of the
Environment said the Rural Development Commission would pay Pounds 1m over
three years to help reclamation of a former colliery at Moira, near Ashby de
la Zouch, Leicestershire, in the National Forest area.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Nadir 'strikes deal to regain seized hotels'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former chairman of Polly Peck International, was
yesterday reported to have struck a deal with the government of northern
Cyprus to regain control of two hotels seized this week.
However, administrators to PPI, which collapsed in 1990, said that the
government-appointed sequestrators were still in the hotels and that the
deal had divided the coalition government of Mr Hakki Atun, the prime
minister.
Sources in northern Cyprus indicated that the agreement had prompted one
government official to resign in protest and that the first instalment in an
agreed tax repayment scheme had been in the form of a post-dated cheque.
A finance ministry official in Nicosia said: 'Nadir made a first payment of
his tax arrears yesterday. The amount is not disclosed. The government has
agreed to a payment plan he proposed.'
The official added: 'The cabinet discussed the situation at a meeting on
Wednesday. Asil Nadir was later summoned by prime minister Hakki Atun.'
The prime minister was quoted by the Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK as
saying: 'We have been given assurances that remaining instalments will be
duly paid and we are happy to have solved this problem.'
Mr Chris Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator for
PPI, yesterday said: 'According to our information obtained this afternoon
the sequestrators are still in the hotels and we have heard that other
government ministers are not agreeing with this proposal.
'We are always keen to meet the government and we have made it clear that if
they assist us in getting possession of the hotels we will deal with the
issue of outstanding tax.'
Mr Nadir's UK lawyer Mr Peter Krivinskas said that his client had been two
months in arrears on a repayment scheme agreed last year. 'He is back in
control.' He added: 'I assume the payment was in cash. It could have been a
post-dated cheque.'
Since October 1990 the administrators have been denied access to Polly Peck
assets in north Cyprus because of a series of injunctions and court orders
obtained by Mr Nadir.
Government tax officers had seized the revenues of Mr Nadir's Jasmine Court
and Palm Beach hotels on Tuesday, to recover Dollars 1.5m in back taxes and
social security payments owed by a PPI subsidiary. Total tax debts for
companies under his control are thought to be in excess of Dollars 10m.
Mr Nadir fled from Britain to northern Cyprus in May last year while facing
charges of false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Industry welcomes contaminated land plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled proposals to deal with contaminated land
based on a suitable-use approach which has been broadly welcomed by
industry.
The approach requires remedial action only where the contamination poses a
risk to health or the environment and there are appropriate and
cost-effective methods of doing so. This will significantly reduce the cost
to industry of cleaning up sites and moves decisively away from the hardline
US policy of strict liability.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said in a written parliamentary
answer that the proposed Environment Agency should take over research work
and guidance on contaminated land now being carried out by the Department of
the Environment.
He added that legislative amendments to the provisions would be proposed to
enable regulators - the Environment Agency and local authories - to require
the prevention or abatement of contamination.
One move which was applauded by industry groups was the decision to repeal
section 143 of the Environment Protection Act 1990. This proposed that
district councils should maintain publicly available registers of all
contaminated sites.
Mr Gummer said that the regulatory authorities would have the task of
identifying problems caused by contamination. They would keep a register of
all significantly polluted sites in their area, recording actual rather than
suspected contamination.
He added that the government did not consider that a general register of
land subject to potentially contaminative uses was warranted.
The government will also propose legislative amendments to remove statutory
exemptions for abandoned mines where escaping water pollutes controlled
waters. Mine operators will have to give the agency six months notice of any
proposed abandonment.
During formal and informal talks held by the government, financial
institutions had expressed concerns that they might be held liable for
pollution caused by their clients, and Mr Gummer made the assurance that
they would not be subject to open-ended liabilities.
Mr Tim Sweeney, director-general of the British Bankers' Association,
welcomed government conclusions that the act of lending did not of itself
open the lender to liability.
The proposals were generally welcomed for ending the uncertainty that
business and the property industry had faced.
The Confederation of British Industry said it believed the framework would
help encourage investment in the development of contaminated land, bringing
more land back into use and reducing the pressure on green-field sites.
However, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that
clarification of a number of key elements would be crucial to the success of
the proposals. These included the degree of flexibility local authorities
would have in implementing their new duties and what standard of clean-up
would be required.

FT  25 NOV 94 / BBC confirms digital radio launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC confirmed yesterday that it will launch a digital audio broadcasting
service next September.
Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of Network Radio, said in London yesterday
that in addition to the existing five national BBC radio services there
would also be extended parliamentary and sports coverage.
The BBC says it is the first broadcaster in the world to make a firm
commitment to launching a DAB radio service.
The advantages of broadcasting a digital rather than the conventional signal
include good reception everywhere without moving aerials. Car radios would
be free of interference.
'The Proms will be crystal clear - even in a car,' Ms Forgan told a Voice of
the Listener and Viewer conference. 'You'll be able to carry Radio 4 drama
around the house without the signal breaking up or worrying about poking
your eye out with an aerial.'
The extra capacity provided by digital would mean access to parliament on an
unprecedented scale and much greater coverage of live sport.
The BBC executive yesterday urged manufacturers to get the special receivers
on sale at the earliest possible moment and 'at a price listeners will find
attractive'.
Carat, one of the largest media-buying companies, says that between the
third quarter of 1993 and the third quarter of 1994 Radio 1 lost 4.5m
listeners. According to a detailed analysis by Carat Research 1m of the lost
listeners were aged 15-24, even though Radio 1 has been trying to attract a
younger audience.

Profits of nearly Pounds 5m made by two directors of a privatised company
were yesterday condemned by the Labour party.
The directors of Clydeport, the Glasgow Docks Company, saw their Pounds
75,000 shareholdings soar when the firm applied on Wednesday for admission
to the Stock Exchange for flotation next month.
Clydeport, which operates the ports of Glasgow, Greenock and Ardrossan and
the Hunterston terminal on the Clyde, was privatised in 1992 in a Pounds 26m
staff buy-out. The flotation plan brought about 100 employees total profits
of Pounds 13m. Placing, Page 24

FT  25 NOV 94 / 'Where have you British been all these years . . .'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, WILLIAM LEWIS and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In August a group of British businessmen spent 14 uncomfortable hours
crossing the desert of Iraq's Al Nafar province from Jordan. Their
destination was Baghdad. Because of UN sanctions there are no direct flights
from Europe to the Iraqi capital but, against advice from the Foreign
Office, they were willing to brave dust, heat and possible kidnapping. The
prize was a chance to return to what, before the Gulf War, had been a
lucrative market of Pounds 800m a year
In spite of the government's public support for the continuation of
sanctions against Iraq some British companies are preparing to resume trade
with President Saddam Hussein's regime when they are lifted.
On Sunday, 17 British water treatment and engineering companies will begin
exhibiting at the Baghdad Trade Fair Centre.
The British organisers of the fair - billed as covering humanitarian aid -
say it has been cleared by the United Nations sanctions committee.
Communication licences have been obtained from the Department of Trade and
Industry, allowing participating companies to talk to the Iraqis about
medical and water treatment and sewage products.
The companies on the August trade trip had also been issued with
communication licences by the DTI. They talked to senior Iraqi ministers who
in turn arranged meetings with the heads of state-owned companies.
Among the businessmen who travelled across the desert was Mr Christopher
Doherty, managing director of United Projects, a trading company. Before the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, his company was exporting up to
Pounds 15m of goods a year to Iraq, including agricultural machinery and
pharmaceutical products.
Mr Doherty this week recalled: 'We went to reassure the Iraqis that we
wanted to re-establish business. When we got there the Iraqis asked us:
'Where have you British been all these years?''
Others in the delegation included representatives of Binnie &amp; Partners,
engineering consultants, and Thames Water. The two companies were exploring
the possibility of restarting an abandoned water treatment plant they helped
build.
Mr James Hetherington, a director of Binnie &amp; Partners, said he agreed to
join the delegation because it opened up the possibility of broadening
commercial contacts with the Iraqis. 'I told the Iraqis we would like to
repair the existing plant and in due course get more contracts.'
Mr Ewan Drummond, business director with Johnson &amp; Johnson, a supplier of
medical products which was involved in the August trip, said his company was
hoping to win Iraqi contracts after sanctions were lifted. 'It is quite
clear that the DTI was involved with the visit to Iraq,' he said. 'It was
not an officially sponsored trip, but nor did the DTI disapprove. We always
seek advice from the DTI to make sure that we comply with the sanctions
regime.'
Mr Ian Detheridge, financial director of Wright Rain, a water irrigation
company, said: 'We were interested originally because we were told
humanitarian aid was permissible and we wanted to sell the Iraqis irrigation
equipment . . . but when we got to Baghdad we realised that the Iraqis'
intention was to see the restoration of trade ties (with) the UK.'
The trade visit was organised by a commercial lobby group called the Iraqi
British Interest Group (IBI). It is also organising a trip in January for
the vehicle and construction trades. Member companies pay annual
subscriptions of between Pounds 250 and Pounds 500.
The IBI describes itself as a 'strategic association'. Its main organiser,
Mr Stephen Crouch, a business consultant, said its aim was 'to bring
together intelligence on the Iraqi market to see how we can move in when
conditions are better'. He added: 'Industry is very sensitive about being
seen to have contact with the Iraqi regime. However, companies obviously
want to maintain contact with the Iraqi state and to see what the country
requires.'
According to Mr Doherty, one of the group's strongest supporters is Mr Henry
Bellingham, a Conservative MP who is parliamentary private secretary to Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence minister. 'Mr Bellingham is fully supportive of
what we are doing,' he said.
Mr Doherty says Mr Bellingham was promoting British commercial links with
Iraq when he met Iraqi officials in Amman in early September.
When approached this week, Mr Bellingham said he had 'no regular contacts
with IBI', and added that his contacts with the Iraqis were informal.
Commercial support for the IBI has been growing. Some 100 companies from a
range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, financial services,
construction, and transport have expressed an interest in resuming ties with
Iraq.
One Whitehall official said Mr Crouch's objectives were 'a bit more loose
than Her Majesty's Government's'. Mr Crouch insists he has British interests
at the heart of his campaign.
Companies which have signalled their intention to go to Iraq in January
include Leyland Trucks, crane and construction equipment maker RB
International and fire engine maker Angus Fires.
Leyland said: 'When sanctions are lifted there is clearly going to be
opportunities for new business. Our feeling is that our competitors are
already preparing themselves.'
UK companies fear that European competitors have been moving faster than
they have. Trade delegations from France, Spain, Germany and Italy have
visited Baghdad during recent months.
Mr Andrew Brown, a senior manager with RB International, said last week:
'When sanctions are lifted, the whole place is going to come alive in trade
terms. We want to be there when that happens.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Investment guide for regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development projects which create jobs, promote inward investment and
strengthen local economies will be given priority treatment by English
Partnerships, the government agency, according to its investment guide
published today.
English Partnerships was created earlier this year to co-ordinate urban
regeneration policy and encourage development partnerships with the private,
public and voluntary sectors.
The investment guide says the agency will focus on physical regeneration
initiatives which show a significant return in terms of jobs created, inward
investment attracted and the provision of new housing and employment space.
The guide goes on: 'In considering environmental projects, we will
concentrate on those which are urgently required for health and safety
reasons and form part of a wider strategy of development and reclamation.'
While the agency was able to operate on vacant, derelict and contaminated
land throughout England it would concentrate on areas where mines have been
closed, City Challenge and other inner-city areas, and rural regions with
severe economic need.
Lord Walker, chairman of English Partnerships, said the agency was committed
to the creation of innovative development packages with a wide variety of
partners to bring benefits to local communities, existing industry and
inward investors.
He said: 'With the help of this comprehensive guide, our partners can help
make this objective a reality.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Women's pay in London up 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gross weekly earnings for female full-time employees in Greater London rose
3 per cent this year, while weekly pay for men in the region only rose by
1.3 per cent, says data from the fifth instalment of the New Earnings
Survey, published yesterday.
Both male and female full-time workers in Greater London command the highest
average gross weekly earnings in Britain, although women still earn 28 per
cent less than men.
The next highest earners, men in Berkshire and Surrey, received average pay
rises of 3.8 per cent in the same period, although the pay of women in
Surrey only rose by 1.9 per cent and that of women in Berkshire rose by 1.2
per cent.
In the counties where employees received the lowest weekly pre-tax earnings,
pay rose more than 4 per cent on average. For men, weekly pay in Cornwall
rose 4.1 per cent, while in the Isle of Wight it rose 4.6 per cent and in
Powys it rose 5.5 per cent.
The rankings for the lowest weekly earnings for women have changed. Last
year, Suffolk, Shropshire and Cornwall were at the bottom of the league for
received earnings while this year it was Shropshire, Cornwall and the
Highlands of Scotland.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Law to offer protection for disabled workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disabled people will be protected against discrimination at work under
long-awaited legislation, the government announced yesterday.
Mr William Hague, minister for the disabled, told the Commons it will be
unlawful for an employer to treat a disabled person less favourably than
others unless there are 'justifiable reasons'. He said the proposals
represented the greatest advance for disabled people in the history of the
country. But Labour said they did not go far enough.
Mr Hague refused to say how much the proposals would cost industry. He said
a full compliance-cost assessment will be produced alongside the bill when
it is published before the end of the year.
The Department of Social Security said the costs to business would be well
below the estimated Pounds 17bn cost of implementing the private member's
bill for the disabled proposed earlier this year by Mr Roger Berry, Labour
MP for Kingswood.
One official said the proposals could cost employers about Pounds 50m a year
for the next 15 years. Ministers are examining ways of ensuring that no
company will pay adjustment costs above a specified percentage of their
profits.
The Confederation of British Industry said it was important the measures
would not be 'unnecessarily costly to business'. The Institute of Directors
said the statement contained 'open-ended commitments which could prove very
costly'.
Mr Hague said employers will have to make 'a reasonable adjustment where
that would help overcome the practical effects of disability'. But he added
that regulations would 'ensure adjustments do not involve excessive costs'.
Employers with 20 or fewer workers will be exempt from the legislation.
The government also intends to abolish the quota scheme that requires
employers with 20 or more employees to employ at least 3 per cent of
registered disabled people. It believes the scheme is unworkable and fails
to meet the needs of the disabled.
A National Disability Council is to be created to advise the government. Mr
Hague said: 'This will be a new, powerful voice for disabled people in the
decision-making process.'
But the new body was criticised for not being strong enough.
Employers 'where practical' will have to remove physical and communication
barriers preventing access by the disabled to goods and services. But Mr
Hague said employers will have to make modifications 'only to the extent
they are readily achievable and subject to a financial limit'. Financial
services are to be included in the new statutory right of equal access.

FT  25 NOV 94 / MPs back 4.7% ministerial pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs last night voted by a large majority to give ministers a 4.7 per cent
pay increase next year, in spite of the opposition of the Labour leader and
prominent unionists.
Amid growing controversy about recent increases in the salaries of top
executives, MPs approved the government's recommended pay rise, which is
about 2.3 per cent above the level of inflation.
At the end of a debate forced by Labour MPs, the Commons voted by 179 to 13
in favour of the rise, a government majority of 166. Mr Tony Newton, the
leader of the Commons, defended the increase, saying it made up for earlier
freezes.
Opening a debate on the pay award, he said that MPs had lost about Pounds
2,000 each and ministers up to Pounds 4,000 each because of a salary freeze
over the last two years. 'That money has gone for good,' he insisted. 'It's
not something made up. It is a permanent loss.'
However, Labour MPs condemned the proposals, saying they were unacceptable
when public-sector workers were being asked to accept pay restraint.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, said the increase would 'stick in
the gullet' of the public.
Another Labour MP, Mr Jeff Rooker, claimed that it was 'demeaning' for the
Commons to debate such proposals.
Ministers were worth their pay in ultimate responsibility, but not in terms
of their productivity which had been 'absolutely pathetic', he added.
According to figures released by the government yesterday, the increase will
boost the prime minister's salary from Pounds 78,292 to Pounds 82,003 at the
start of next year. A cabinet minister's salary will rise to about Pounds
67,000, an increase of about Pounds 3,000.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, could claim a rise pushing his salary up
to Pounds 64,255. However, he has made clear that he will not accept the
rise 'when millions of others are having no increase at all'.
Mr Alan Duncan, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, branded Mr Blair's
decision not to take a rise as 'an opportunistic stunt'. He said the Labour
leader had one policy, 'and that policy is to feed discontent and then to
milk it for all it's worth'.
Mr Duncan added: 'He is choosing to seize on grievance and cash in on the
politics of what I call the lowest common denominator.'
Earlier this week, Mr John Major faced fierce questions about the 75 per
cent salary increase recently awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, the chief
executive of British Gas.
At the same time, senior unionists have attacked the increase. Mr John
Monks, the TUC general secretary, has said that the rise would make the
government's public-sector pay freeze 'even more unsustainable'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Nerves on edge for the battle of amendments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The corridors of the Commons were yesterday buzzing with speculation about
the outcome of Monday's vote on the European Union finance bill.
But as government whips anxiously counted and recounted their lists of loyal
backbenchers, it became clear that the government's future rests on the
willingness of Tory rebels to vote for a Labour amendment.
Mr Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic Tory backbencher, sought to set the
agenda early in the day by drafting an amendment giving the Commons public
accounts committee powers to block Britain's EU contributions.
The amendment reads: 'This house has confidence in Her Majesty's Government,
but declines to give a second reading to the bill unless HMG gives an
undertaking to the House of Commons that no money should be paid to the EC
in any year under the own resources decision . . . unless and until the PAC
of this House declares in that year that it is satisfied with the
effectiveness of the new procedures for detecting and dealing with fraud in
the EC.'
The Eurosceptics know that the amendment is unacceptable to the government
because it would set up a mechanism making it impossible for the government
to give the EU guarantees that payments would be made when they become due.
But under the arcane rules of the Commons, that did not matter to the
Eurosceptics, because they know that the amendment will never be selected
for debate by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker.
The intention was twofold: to make the Eurosceptic view crystal clear; and
to provide an opportunity for Labour to maximise the potential vote against
the government by adopting the rebels' tone and language.
In the event, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, tabled a toughly worded
motion deploring fraud and waste, but couched in terms that make it unlikely
that most of the rebels will dare to support it.
When MPs decide at about 10pm on Monday, Labour's amendment will be voted on
first. If it succeeds, it would delay implementation of the increased
contributions until 1996 because no bill can be tabled twice in one year.
That, however, would be academic because the success of the amendment would
be regarded as a government defeat on an issue of confidence, prompting an
immediate request by Mr John Major for a dissolution of parliament and a
general election.
It is more likely that the amendment will be defeated, and there would then
be a vote on the second reading of the bill - approving the principle of the
legislation. The division would be a sham because the failure of the
amendment would have shown that the rebels were not prepared to defeat the
government.
If that happens, Labour says it would abstain. Other parties might follow
suit, presenting the government with a resounding victory.

Scottish banks are to bring their bank holidays into line with those of
other UK banks from 1996. The move will end a discrepancy whereby on four
days of the year Scottish banks have different holidays to English banks and
to the rest of the Scottish financial community.
The change was agreed by the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks. Scottish
cities will still have public holidays on different days from each other
rather than on bank holidays.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Miras cut 'unlikely to hit home market'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any decision by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reduce mortgage income
tax relief would be unlikely to affect the housing market, Abbey National,
the home loans and banking group, said.
A survey for the group found that 87 per cent of people felt further changes
in the relief would not affect their decision to move.
Last year's Budgets included cuts in the rate of mortgage interest relief to
20 per cent from April this year, and to 15 per cent from April next year.
It is expected that it will continue to be phased out.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Lloyd's loss reviews 'should be halted'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's regulators should stop preparing loss review reports while legal
actions brought by Names are still in progress, the High Court heard
yesterday.
In a judicial review, managing agents of syndicates 80 and 843 asked for the
loss reviews to be halted because they were prejudicial to the court cases
in which Names are seeking damages for alleged negligence.
The agents claim the Names can obtain an unfair advantage because the
transcripts of interviews with regulators can be used as evidence in court.
The regulatory board of Lloyd's opposed the move, arguing that the loss
reviews were for the benefit of all Names, not just those in litigation.
Judgment is due today.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Lottery jackpot estimate raised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, the National Lottery operator, last night raised its forecast for
Saturday's jackpot to Pounds 5m, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Ticket sales for this week's draw now exceed Pounds 18m, compared with sales
of about Pounds 20m by Wednesday last week.
The Pounds 5m estimated jackpot is an increase of Pounds 1m on the figure
expected at the beginning of the week.
Mr David Rigg, Camelot communications director, said yesterday: 'Overall, we
are seeing sales continue at a very strong level. The final level of jackpot
will obviously depend on the sales between now and 7.30 on Saturday
evening.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Eurosceptic rebels peer over a cliff: Bill Cash and his
followers face an uphill struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old-timers will predominate if and when the names of the Tory MPs who have
signed a proposed Eurosceptic amendment to the bill increasing the UK's
contributions to the European Union are made public.
The 30 or so Tory Eurosceptics who voted against the government at crucial
junctures of the Maastricht bill's passage through parliament could
plausibly have been described as a blend of youth and experience.
But most of the young ones appear to have fallen into line with the
government. Along with a few more experienced hands, they reason either that
Eurosceptics should keep their powder dry until the 1996 European Union
inter-governmental conference or that the party needs to be seen to be
pulling together if it is to win the next general election, due by April
1997.
Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford who is the Eurosceptic ringleader, said
yesterday that the amendment he intends to table to the EU finance bill will
have the support of at least 15 MPs.
Mr Cash, 54, once described as the Tory party's 'white cliff of Dover', has
been a formidable adversary for the government throughout the European
clashes of the past two and a half years.
Since his amendment is unlikely to be voted on, its main effect may be to
identify those most determined to block the bill, which Mr John Major has
decided to make an issue of confidence.
Most Eurosceptics were yesterday tight-lipped. 'I'm shutting up like a
clam,' said one. Another confided: 'The more the whips are kept uncertain
the better.'
But those most likely to add their names to the Cash amendment were thought
to include the following: Sir Teddy Taylor, 57, the MP for Southend East, a
former Scottish Office minister and an engagingly articulate Thatcherite. He
has described the bill as 'a massive embarrassment to everyone' since it
will increase public expenditure at a time of huge pressure to cut spending.
Mr Tony Marlow, 54, (Northampton North), who astonished colleagues in March
by publicly demanding the prime minister's resignation. He is widely seen as
a parliamentary bruiser in the mould of Labour's Mr Dennis Skinner. He was
chairman of the Commons committee which decided in May that the Pounds 2bn
CrossRail project could not be justified.
Mr Christopher Gill, 58, (Ludlow), who yesterday told Mr Major he would
rather resign the party whip than vote for a bill with which dozens of Tory
MPs did not agree and for which there was no popular support. A key
organiser throughout the Eurosceptics' Maastricht campaign, he has the air
of an old-style English gentleman, but is sometimes known as 'the butcher of
Ludlow' in deference to his status as the man behind Gill's sausages.
Sir Richard Body, 67, (Holland with Boston), who is thought to have been one
of the backbench critics referred to as 'barmy' last year by Mr Major.
Shortly afterwards, he met his local party to discuss whether to leave
politics, but decided to stay on.
Mr Bill Walker, 65, (Tayside North), who has been an outspoken critic of the
government on issues other than Europe. Earlier this month he said the
situation facing the party after its climbdown on Post Office privatisation
was 'desperately serious'.
Mr John Wilkinson, 54, (Ruislip-Northwood),an Eton-educated former
ministerial aide. Yesterday he said he opposed 'the principle of the
legislation'. He added: 'I think it is wholly wrong for the government to
seek to commit this country and bind the next parliament to ever-increasing
expenditure on the EU.'
Other possible rebels are thought to include Mr John Carlisle, the MP for
Luton North, Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough
and Horncastle), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Sir Trevor Skeet
(Bedfordshire North), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton) and Mr Nicholas
Winterton (Macclesfield).
The Maastricht precedent suggests that few, if any, Eurosceptics are likely
to oppose the government on a vote of confidence: all fell into line when Mr
Major called such a vote after a defeat on the Maastricht bill last July.
But some MPs were yesterday insisting that Monday's vote would not fall into
that category.
Even so, with the government expected to have the support of the nine Ulster
Unionists and one Ulster Popular Unionist, a total of 18 Tories would need
to vote with the rest of the opposition parties - or 36 to abstain - for Mr
Major to be defeated. Last night, that was looking a tall order.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Rightwingers claim 1922 vote was rebuke to Major: Bonsor
fails to oust Fox from committee leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservative MPs said last night that a show of support for a
challenge to the chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers amounted to a coded rebuke to Mr John Major's leadership of the
party.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, failed to
unseat Sir Marcus Fox, leader of the committee for two years. In line with
normal practice, voting figures were kept secret.
But rightwing critics of the prime minister said Sir Nicholas had achieved a
'respectable' level of support, reflecting widespread concern about Sir
Marcus's unswerving public loyalty to Mr Major.
A senior rightwinger said: 'This can justifiably be seen as a slap in the
face for Major, because Marcus was seen as a close and uncritical
supporter.'
Sir Nicholas, a senior backbencher who is generally rightwing on economic
matters but allied with the centre of the party on social issues, refrained
from any criticism of the prime minister during the campaign.
But his decision to stand followed attempts by Sir Marcus to put public
pressure on backbenchers considering voting against the European Union
finance bill, which will have its second reading on Monday.
Many MPs were annoyed by Sir Marcus's forthright support for the bill, which
was interpreted by many as a reversal of the normal role of the 1922
chairman in keeping Downing Street informed of backbench opinion.
Sir Nicholas said there had been 'a lot' of support for his challenge, which
focused on a pledge to make the prime minister more aware of backbench
feelings, and to adopt a more private approach to liaison between MPs and
Downing Street.
'Irrespective of the result I hope it will encourage the forging of much
stronger private links between the backbenchers and the government,' he
said.
Sir Marcus described his victory as 'comfortable', but admitted that unease
over the strength of his loyalty to the prime minister had been a key factor
in the contest.
Sir Marcus went on: 'I fully understand that my style is perhaps not quite
the same as many of my predecessors. That is a style that I think has to
adapt to circumstances.
'I am not apologising, but I am saying that during the several days of the
campaign, a number of colleagues have expressed the view that I have been a
little bit too upfront,' he said.
The right wing of the party may have suffered a minor defeat after Mrs
Marion Roe, the rightwing MP for Broxbourne, did not gain re-election to the
executive of the 1922 committee.
Her place was taken by Sir Fergus Montgomery, the MP for Altrincham and
Sale, who has announced that he will retire from the Commons at the next
election.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Egypt forms gas-to-Israel group - Pipeline
across Sinai planned by venture with Amoco and ENI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO

<TEXT>
Egypt has taken the first steps towards the eventual export of gas to Israel
by forming a Dollars 150m joint venture company with two oil companies,
Amoco of the US and ENI of Italy. The venture plans to build a gas pipeline
from Port Said, at the entrance of the Suez Canal, to the Israeli border.
The state-owned Egypt Gas will own one third of the company, with Amoco and
ENI each holding a third. Company and Egyptian officials said the joint
venture would build a series of gas pipes in Egypt, with the export pipeline
to Israel a priority.
At the Israelis' request, Egyptian and Israeli officials held a series of
high-level talks about exporting Egyptian gas over the past year. Mr Hamdi
al-Banbi, Egypt's oil minister, then agreed in principle to the project, but
said exports would depend on a substantial rise in Egypt's provable
reserves.
The announcement of the joint venture company follows a recent series of gas
discoveries in the Nile Delta, the Mediterranean basin north of Sinai and
the Western Desert. These have lifted proven gas reserves to 21,000bn cubic
feet. Egyptian officials said they believed this would soon rise to 24,000bn
cu feet.
The leap in reserves, which stood at only 12,000bn cu feet a year ago, will
enable Egypt both to continue its long-standing programme to turn all the
country's electric stations over to gas power while also allowing exports,
officials said.
The new company, which must still win formal approval from the country's
General Investment Organisation, is expected to start work next year on the
proposed 250km pipeline to Israel at an expected eventual cost of Dollars
300m.
Egyptian officials said they did not yet know what volumes of gas might be
exported. However, Israeli needs have been estimated at 200m cu feet a day
in 1998 rising to an eventual 600m cu feet by 2000 - much of it for
industrial use.
However, Mr Wafik Meshref, a vice chairman of the state-owned Egyptian
General Petroleum Company, said the first pipeline would extend to 'Israel,
Palestine and even eventually Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey'. Mr al-Banbi is
understood to have told his Israeli counterpart in August that Egypt could
be ready to start exports by 1998.
Mr Meshref said the company was also expected to build a long-awaited
pipeline to link recent substantial finds in Egypt's Western Desert to the
eventual export pipeline. At first the export pipeline is expected to be fed
from the North Port Said concession, operated by the International Egyptian
Oil Company, an ENI/Agip subsidiary. The tract embraces a trio of gas fields
with proven reserves of more than 6,000bn cu feet.
He said the new company could begin building the pipeline next year with
completion expected within two years, by which time recent gas finds in the
Mediterranean should be coming on stream.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: EU plans trade zone with S Americans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union and Mercosur, the South American trade grouping of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, yesterday announced plans to
negotiate a free trade zone between them.
A proposal from the European Commission to begin negotiations will be
considered by EU foreign ministers next Monday. It is expected to be given
formal approval by the EU summit in Essen on December 9 and 10.
'The central idea is to work in a realistic and pragmatic way towards a
common free trade zone,' said Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, in
Brussels yesterday. He and his three South American counterparts met the
head of the commission, Mr Jacques Delors, and the commissioner in charge of
relations with Latin America, Mr Manuel Marin.
The EU has been the largest trading partner with the four countries since
1986. According to commission officials, the southern cone of South America
is by far the fastest growing market for European exports. In 1992, the EU
accounted for 27 per cent of Mercosur exports - against 21 per cent for
North America, 48 per cent of direct foreign investment and 42 per cent of
the group's foreign aid.
No formal timetable was given for a free trade accord with Mercosur.
Informally, officials have indicated a free trade zone could be in place by
the year 2001. Detailed negotiations are expected to begin next year over
trade liberalisation in the short-term, with the ultimate goal of a formal
free zone being cemented later. The EU wants to see a Mercosur customs union
in place, and a Mercosur institution established with which to negotiate.
A Mercosur customs union setting a common external tariff for 85 per cent of
goods will come into force on January 1, with the timetable for the most of
the rest already negotiated.
According to the Commission proposal going to ministers on Monday, the aim
is 'the gradual establishment of a free trade zone in industrial goods and
reciprocal and progressive liberalisation of farm trade (taking into account
the sensitivity of certain products)'.
'This is a bold strategy but we have to move quickly, even if the goal is
long term,' said one Commission official. The Commission calculates that
with free trade in prospect European exports could be expected to grow at
nearly double the rate of any other region.
The Mercosur move is one of a number of trade initiatives being directed at
areas outside Europe. It is also part of a larger package aimed at Latin
America - containing a variety of new and existing policies - expected
formally to be announced at the EU summit in Essen.
The timing of the announcement - ahead of the Summit of the Americas hosted
by President Bill Clinton in Miami which concludes on December 11 - is not
accidental, says Mr Wolf Grabendorff of the Institute for European-Latin
American Relations in Madrid.
He says the message is that Europe - having maintained strong economic
relations with South America during the debt-distressed decade of the 1980s
 -does not plan to abandon the region to the US now that it is enjoying some
economic success.
The package also includes plans to enhance economic relations with Mexico,
and to extend the generalised system of preferences arrangements with the
Andean countries and central America.
However, while the EU rhetoric speaks of free trade, the practical
difficulties for many South American exporters to Europe have increased over
the last five years.
In a speech this week to a conference in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian
ambassador to London, Mr Rubens Barbosa, said Brazilian exporters face
non-tariff barriers, anti-dumping procedures, restrictions arising out of
the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, and distortions caused by preferential
treatment of countries with privileged relations to the EU.

Turkey's TDI maritime agency has invited nine international companies to bid
for a radar and communications system to control shipping in the
Dardanelles, Sea of Marmara and Bosporus straits.
Bids are to be submitted in January 1995. The companies include Germany's
Deutsche Aerospace, Raytheon of the US, Mitsui from Japan and the UK's
Marconi. Suppliers must provide their own financing for the system, which is
expected to take three to four years to install at an estimated cost of
Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m.
The companies will also be asked to bid for a smaller initial phase of the
project, limited to the Bosporus alone. Traffic in the straits, linking the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea, has increased sharply since the collapse of
the Soviet Union as newly independent states in the region increase trade
with the rest of the world.

FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Shipowners see threat to US oil supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a US oil shortage this winter has increased in recent weeks
despite urgent efforts by shipowners and the insurance industry to find a
solution to tough new financial liability rules on tankers. With just over
one month before the December 28 deadline for tanker owners to prove that
they could meet the financial consequences of an oil spill, pressure is
increasing on both the shipping industry and the US administration.
The US Coastguard has approved the financial liability arrangements made by
the owners of nearly 300 tankers but this is only one third of the number
needed to maintain oil shipments to the US, shipowners said yesterday.
Intertanko, an organisation representing many of the world's independent
tanker owners, has written to Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation
secretary, calling for urgent action to prevent 'profound economic
disruption' to the international tanker community and the US economy.
Attempts to persuade the coastguard to delay implementation of the deadline
have been unsuccessful. Mr Miles Kulukundis, chairman of Intertanko, called
upon Mr Pena in a letter released yesterday to allow 'a reasonable
extension' to the deadline.
'The danger to the US is immediate,' Mr Kulukundis warned. 'The maritime
supply lines that provide the US with petroleum extend thousands of miles. .
. Voyage times run close to 40 days. The markets are already showing signs
of dislocation.'
Two insurance schemes to provide additional cover to oil tanker owners have
been accepted by the US authorities, but shipowners remain concerned that
these are insufficient to cover the costs which could arise from an oil
spill.
The problems arose following a tightening of rules governing financial
liability in the wake of the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster off Alaska in
1989. The US Coastguard has set higher limits on the 'certificates of
financial responsibility' for shipowners from December 28.
The limits have been increased to Dollars 1,500 per gross registered ton per
year, but if a court finds a shipowner or tanker captain has committed gross
negligence, the liability could be unlimited. Intertanko fears that a minor
act of negligence leading to an oil spill could be treated as 'gross
negligence' by the US courts.
The US Coastguard National Pollution Funds Centre said it had issued a
further 195 certificates of financial responsibility, bringing the total
available to tanker owners to 296. Companies which have now obtained
certificates include Shell International Shipping for 44 vessels, Bergesen
for 40 vessels and Union Carbide Corporation for one vessel. But Intertanko
calculates that the US needs about 1,000 tankers to meet its oil
requirements.
The insurance schemes which have obtained approval are First Line, arranged
by Stockton Reinsurance of Bermuda, which will provide cover of up to
Dollars 150m though a higher limit is being sought, and OPAClub, a mutual
liability arrangement created by brokers Willis Corroon and Sedgwick Marine,
which plans to provide cover to Dollars 250m.
A third arrangement, Shoreline Mutual Management, would provide Dollars 300m
of cover on top of the Dollars 700m available to shipowners through their
protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) club, the traditional method of obtaining
cover. But it has yet to win approval.
The problem with the insurance schemes which have been devised is that
shipowners fear a court might still be able to pin higher financial
liabilities on them or their P&amp;I Club, said Mr Chris Horrocks, secretary
general of the International Chamber of Shipping.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Defence spending split threatens Japan coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A split over defence spending has opened in Japan's three-party ruling
coalition of conservatives and socialists, threatening the government's
stability.
The dispute, over the rate of increase for next year's defence budget,
intensified yesterday when finance ministry officials announced they were
pushing for a lower rise next year than the 0.9 per cent set by the
coalition in August, a month after taking office.
This strengthens the hand of the pacifist Social Democratic party, the
second largest coalition partner, an unusual ally for the finance ministry.
The Socialists felt they were coerced into agreeing the 0.9 per cent rise by
the dominant coalition member, the conservative Liberal Democratic party.
'It is our duty to chart a clear course for disarmament,' said Mr Wataru
Kubo, the Socialists' deputy leader. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet
secretary, denied the government would reduce the figure.
Socialist politicians fear they have alienated traditional supporters over
the past few months by discarding most of their party's former policies,
such as opposition to the military's constitutional right to exist and
opposition to sales tax, in order to form a government with the LDP.
As a result, they are eager to demonstrate progress on pacifism, one of the
few policies the party still retains.
Failure to agree on the defence budget would increase pressure on a group of
dissidents, orchestrated by Mr Kubo, to form their own party. If the
Socialist party broke up, the government could be deprived of a majority.
The LDP's proposed rise, while the lowest for 33 years, would bring Japanese
defence spending to Y4,730bn (Pounds 30.3bn). It is the second largest
defence budget in the world, inflated by the yen's rise in value and huge
pension and social security payments.
On the outcome also hang the hopes of several foreign defence-equipment
suppliers, awaiting finance ministry clearance before their contracts can
proceed.

Two big aid agencies will today urge the European Union to release a

be met without the funds. The international medical agency Medicins Sans
Frontieres and the British charity Oxfam said their work in saving the lives
of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees was in vain unless Rwanda could
rebuild. 'While the new administration in Rwanda struggles to rebuild . .
without tables, chairs, pens and paper, EU development ministers sit on an
unspent Ecu 159m (Pounds 125m),' they said. They implored EU development
ministers meeting in Brussels today to unblock funds to enable Rwanda to
create conditions to foster justice, national reconciliation and basic
services. The new Rwandan government says it cannot properly foster national
reconciliation after the massacre of up to 1m people and three months of
civil war without international aid.

Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star television, the satellite network based in Hong

approved limited distribution of its movie channel in Beijing. Broadcast
authorities confirmed a Beijing Daily's report that new rules had been
issued allowing narrow segments of the population to apply for licences and
signal decoders needed to watch Star's satellite movie channel.
The rules mainly affect foreign tourists in hotels and foreigners and
overseas Chinese in special housing compounds, but include three-star hotels
patronised mainly by local Chinese. Star television is controlled by Mr
Murdoch's News Corporation. Using AsiaSat-1, its footprint covers north Asia
with four channels in English or Chinese and a movie channel, whose signal
is encrypted.

A Lebanese parliamentary committee said yesterday the French government was
responsible for Beirut's loss of millions of dollars in a 1983 helicopter
deal, and demanded Paris investigate the case. The committee investigating
the deal said it wanted Beirut 'officially to ask the French government,
which bears responsibility for breaching the contract, to uncover the
identity of French accomplices with Lebanese officials'. Under the agreement
Lebanon paid for six French Puma helicopters but received much cheaper
Romanian-assembled ones from Paris. The committee said it wanted the
Lebanese government to hold Paris responsible for the loss resulting from
the deal - put by one committee source at about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m). It
said it was holding General Ibrahim Tannous, former head of the Lebanese
army, 'responsible for negligence' resulting from the deal, known locally as
the Puma Scandal.

South Korea's gross national product growth rate slowed down in the third
quarter to 7.5 per cent because of a summer drought that affected
agriculture, the central bank said yesterday. Economic growth has gradually
declined from 8.9 per cent in the first quarter and 7.8 per cent in the
second. The economy has expanded by 8 per cent during the first nine months
of 1994. But the third quarter posted the biggest jump in industrial
investments, at 23.4 per cent, since the beginning of 1988. Companies are
expanding production facilities to meet an export boom caused by the weak
Korean currency. Private consumption rose by 7.6 per cent during the third
quarter, raising concerns of growing inflationary pressure. Inflation is now
hovering just below the government's target of 6 per cent for this year.

Further confrontation between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and
Islamic militants is expected today when the militants hold a big rally in
Gaza amid growing evidence that Palestinian police were largely to blame for
last Friday's killing of 12 people. The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement
has refused formally to sign an accord with the PLO to calm tension in the
Gaza Strip and ban weapons at public rallies until the PLO accepts
responsibility for last week's violence. But PLO efforts to blame the
incident on a conspiracy against the Palestinian self-rule authority are
being widely discredited and there is growing evidence to support the Hamas
version of events. The PLO accused the opposition of provoking violence by
firing on police and said evidence for the claim was supported by the fact
that among the dead were one policeman and eight activists of the Fatah
faction, the PLO's largest political group. Reuters news agency reported
yesterday that no policeman had been killed and only one of the dead was an
active Fatah supporter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko has dismissed the head of the Bank of
Zaire, ending a four-month battle of wills between the central bank governor
and Mr Kengo Wa Dondo, prime minister, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
Zairean state radio yesterday said that Mr Mobutu had signed a decree on
Tuesday dismissing Mr Ndiang Kaboul, his own appointee. Mr Ndiang has been
fighting to save his job since Mr Kengo's government suspended him in July,
accusing him of fuelling hyperinflation by flooding the market with millions
of new zaire notes.
A parliamentary committee earlier voted for Mr Ndiang's dismissal after an
audit found he had made huge unauthorised payments in defiance of a
government freeze on central bank transactions.
Economists regard establishing the autonomy of the Bank of Zaire, which in
the past has been tapped for funds by Mr Mobutu and his army generals
whenever they ran short of cash, as the key to rescuing Zaire's wrecked
economy.
The appointment of the centrist Mr Kengo in June broke a long political
stalemate between supporters and opponents of Mr Mobuto.
He quickly made the independence of the bank a central policy objective and,
during a tour of western capitals last month, he was repeatedly told that
investors would not put money into Zaire unless he could guarantee the
bank's independence.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Taiwan tycoon sets off court skirmish
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese tycoon suspected of illegal share dealings,
provoked a courtroom skirmish between his bodyguard and the bailiff when he
refused to pay TDollars 1m (Pounds 24,200) bail set by the Taipei district
court to which he was subpoenaed for questioning yesterday.
Friends of Mr Oung rallied to meet his bail as he resolutely denied that he
had played any role in the share speculation case which led to a chain of
share payment defaults and rattled the Taiwan stock market early last month.
As an elected member of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament, Mr Oung
may not be arrested or detained without the permission of the legislature
unless caught in the act of committing a crime, under the country's
constitution.
Mr Oung apparently sought to force the court into the position of having to
secure approval to arrest him.
During questioning, Mr Oung, effective chief of Hualon-Teijran Corp, a
listed textile concern, blamed the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the incident
that sparked a 14 per cent plunge in share prices in one week.
He said the exchange's failure to enforce a newly instituted
'self-protection clause' made financiers refuse to continue backing his
chief aide, Ms Li Hsiu-fen, thus precipitating the defaults crisis.
Earlier this year, Hualon-Teijran committed to invest Pounds 160m to build a
textile plant in Northern Ireland with Pounds 61m in subsidies from the UK
government.
The Taipei district attorney's office is believed to have documented
evidence of financial links among Mr Oung, Ms Li and other unnamed providers
of funds to speculation in shares of Imperial Hotel.
But Mr Oung denied such links, saying it was a mistake to take evidence of
financial flows as proof of his role in deals involving the share price. He
was simply helping his friends and employees, he said.
'For several years now I have entrusted all funds to Ms Li Hsiu-fen,
including even my cheque-book,' he told the Taipei district attorney,
asserting: 'I stopped paying attention to these matters long ago.'
Ms Li, also brought in for questioning yesterday, tearfully told prosecutors
that although she had traded heavily in Imperial Hotel shares, she did not
rig the share price.
Ms Li has been in detention since early October. No date was set for further
proceedings.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Zambia airline sell-off row may hit aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute between the Zambian government and international donors over
privatisation of the state-owned national airline could jeopardise external
support for the country's economic recovery programme.
The row stems from the government's decision to use a Dollars 30m (Pounds
19m) oil purchase facility, provided by a Kuwaiti bank, on behalf of the
heavily indebted Zambia Airways.
Donors, who have met government twice this week, say it contravenes an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund which includes a ceiling on
public sector borrowing, and fear that the government may be backtracking on
a commitment to privatise the airline.
Donors and government officials are due in Paris on December 5-6 for World
Bank chaired conference to review progress under the reform programme, and
discuss future funding.
Failure to resolve the dispute could result in donors withholding aid.
Zambian government officials have strongly defended the use of the oil
facility, arguing that it does not break the IMF deal, and insisting that
they intend to privatise the airline.
The facility was originally negotiated by the Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation (Zimco), the holding company of all Zambia's state-run
enterprises, and has been used to finance oil purchases by Zamoil, the
government fuel agency.
Zambian officials point out that the rolling loan is replenished through the
sale of the oil in Zambia, with the local currency proceeds being converted
to US dollars.
They argue that they are co-ordinating the needs of Zamoil with the short
term refinancing and restructuring of the airlines' debt, and have paid off
arrears which otherwise would have left some aircraft impounded.
This will also allow time to implement a radical cost cutting plan. It
includes reducing staff from 1,300 to 500, closing and selling all offices
outside southern Africa except London, and selling much of the airline's
property in Lusaka, including staff housing and a hotel.
Some leading donors express scepticism, however, and have interpreted the
government move as a last ditch attempt to avoid privatising the airline.
They fear it also may signal a weakening of commitment to privatisation of
the state-owned copper mines, which donors believe is essential to the
recovery plan undertaken by President Frederick Chiluba on taking office
three years ago.
The government faces elections next year, and privatising the airline, and
in particular the mines, faces considerable electoral opposition.
But any weakening of government resolve would reduce donor support of
Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m a year, say aid officials.
Earlier this year, the government had seemed prepared to let the airline go
to the wall. In a letter to Zimco, finance minister Ronald Penza wrote: 'The
government is left with no option but for the airline to go into voluntary
liquidation.'
A year ago the International Air Transport Association (Iata) suspended the
airline over arrears exceeding Dollars 5m. The airline's DC-10 was grounded
over other debts, and earlier this month a New York bank seized airline
assets when seeking payment of a Dollars 1m debt.
Zambia Airways has accumulated a loss of Dollars 37m over the past two
years. A further obligation stems from a 1990 order for a McDonnell-Douglas
aircraft due to be delivered in 1996.
If cancelled, it will cost Dollars 25m; if the order goes ahead, the
aircraft will cost Dollars 132m.

FT  25 NOV 94 / China talks moving too fast for some Taiwanese: Officials
worry that Taipei's economy will become captive to the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between China and Taiwan on improving working relations inched forward
this week in Nanjing, the Yangtze river town, but at the trading and
investment level the relationship continues to progress strongly, too
strongly for some Taiwanese officials.
Pledged Taiwanese investment in the mainland exceeds Dollars 20bn (Pounds
12.5bn), making it the second largest investor after Hong Kong. More
noteworthy perhaps is the rate of investment. While investors from Hong
Kong, Singapore, and Thailand have been active since the mid-1980s,
Taiwanese businessmen really got started in 1991, the year Taipei lifted its
formal ban on business links with the mainland.
According to the mainland-published China Economic News, Taiwanese
investment amounted to Dollars 3.4bn in 1991, Dollars 5.5bn in 1992 and
Dollars 10bn last year, a total of nearly Dollars 19bn by the end of 1993.
This estimate vastly exceeds official Taiwanese investment figures (Dollars
4bn at the end of June), the Investment Commission of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs says.
One explanation for this discrepancy is that many Taiwanese have chosen not
to report their activities. Some have channelled their investment through
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Taiwanese officials appear resigned to the fact that investment in the
mainland will continue to grow rapidly, but their attitudes sometimes show
two differing viewpoints. On one hand they can see real advantages in
Taiwanese business positioning itself in the world's largest market, on the
other they worry understandably about Taiwan's economy becoming captive to
China, and investment being drained away from Taiwan.
Mr Hansen Chien, spokesman for the ruling Kuomintang, reflecting gloomy
concerns of the Taiwanese establishment about becoming caught up in the
mainland's embrace, said: 'We are getting more worried about too much
investment in mainland China. We are becoming too dependent on the
mainland.'
At a political level, Mr Chien also gave voice to underlying Taiwanese
worries: 'Every time we talk with mainland China,' he said, 'it seems we are
losing more and more of our chips. We don't have too many chips to lose.
Every time we throw out a chip, we should get something back.'
Attempts by the authorities to mount what they describe as a 'go south'
policy to persuade investors to put their money in south-east Asian
economies is one among several responses aimed at tempering enthusiasm for
mainland investment.
'We are encouraging our people to go to south-east Asia, but not
discouraging them investing in the mainland, on condition we derive mutual
benefit,' says Mr Leo Tseng, deputy director-general of the Board of Foreign
Trade.
Taiwanese investment at the end of 1993 in Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines,
Indonesia and Vietnam, the main destinations for Taiwan's south-east Asian
investment, matched that of investment in the mainland; but again the
build-up of investment in China is proving much more rapid (see chart).
Typical of attitudes among larger investors to putting their money in the
mainland as opposed to south-east Asia is that expressed by representatives
of President Foods Group, the big Taiwanese food processor that has
ambitions of becoming the world's biggest food conglomerate.
The company has set up four factories in south-east Asia but targeted the
mainland because executives believe it provides better opportunities.
President Foods is establishing 12 companies involved in making a wide range
of products, including instant noodles, biscuits, animal feed and car
batteries. Since 1992, it has invested Dollars 100m, with plans to double
that figure.
But its representatives acknowledge that business in the mainland remains
extremely difficult: among problems is a lack of managerial talent and
difficulties in securing market share in a highly fragmented market where
local brand loyalties dominate. Transport bottlenecks militate against the
building of national brands.
Taiwanese officials point out that while thousands of Taiwanese businessmen
are continuing to rush to the mainland, the success rate is patchy, at best.
Mr Steven Wu, director of the Industrial Development and Investment Centre
of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, estimates that 30-50 per cent of
enterprises are making money.
'The rest have had a very sad experience,' he says. Problems encountered
include overmanning, bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties with local
partners. Mr Wu noted that the success rate of investments in south-east
Asia was higher.
But it seems that despite well publicised difficulties, Taiwanese investors
are determined to make their presence felt on the mainland, attracted as
they are by low labour costs, a huge market, and in some cases propelled by
a desire to escape from an increasingly active environmental lobby in
Taiwan.
Mr S Lee, vice-minister in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, responsible for
overseeing approvals for mainland investments, believes investment growth
will slow, but notes Taiwanese businessmen are beginning to make larger
commitments.
Mr Lee said that of the 'whole list' of 9,000 items covered by investment
guidelines, Taiwanese business was permitted to make about 4,588 on the
mainland, another 4,000 items were in a 'grey area', meaning approval would
be withheld for the time being, and about 1,000 'high-tech' items were
forbidden.
Industries in the 'grey area' include cement factories and petrochemical
plants involved in producing synthetic fibres, in which Taiwan leads the
world. The authorities are reluctant to allow competing industries to move
across the Taiwan Straits.
Mr Lee says: 'We are reviewing our policy (on investment approvals)
cautiously and progressively'. The problem for the Taiwanese authorities,
however, is that pressure from Taiwanese business is such that it is having
great difficulty holding the line.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Russia raises its Gulf profile: Conservative Arab states
have something to gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, returns to Moscow today having
lifted the Russian profile among the conservative Arab states of the Gulf.
Also, he may have achieved a diminution of the suspicion that Russia remains
inheritor not just to the property and treaties of the Soviet Union, but to
its alliances with the radical states of Syria, Libya and Iraq.
'Not so,' says Mr Valery Kuzmin, deputy head of the Russian Foreign
Ministry's Middle Eastern and North African department.
'The changes in the ideological position of the Soviet Union were coming
evident in the late 1980s; we officially ended the period of confrontation
in the Middle East in 1991; now we are partners in the peace process (in
Israel/Palestine) and our interests are to support the development of
economic ties.'
Kuwait was the most difficult stop on the trip. Still fearful of President
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the Kuwaiti leadership saw the visit to Baghdad by Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, as suspicious, even when he won
Baghdad's apparent recognition of Kuwait.
'We wanted to reassure Kuwait and the other states we did not have something
going on with Iraq behind their back. The visit was important in that
regard, a sign of the importance we attach to good relations with these
states after a time when it was said, wrongly, that we had lost interest in
them.'
Mr Chernomyrdin signed five fairly standard agreements on economic
co-operation, information exchange and investment protection. Mr Oleg
Davydov, Russian trade minister, noting Arab capital usually came into
Russia through western intermediaries, told his Kuwaiti hosts: 'It would be
more profitable if the money was invested directly.'
Mr Chernomyrdin got nowhere on the Russian debt to Kuwait of Dollars 1.1bn
(Pounds 687m), nor did he manage to unfreeze a credit promised in 1992.
The Kuwaitis were not interested in a plan to restructure the debt along
similar lines to that achieved in the Paris club of western creditors; the
form of words said only the two sides had reached 'a common understanding on
the issue of the possible reconstruction of the debt'. But contracts worth
Dollars 750m were signed to deliver to Kuwait Russian armoured personnel
carriers and other equipment, though it is not known what part, if any, of
that is to be written off against the debt.
The United Arab Emirates, closest to Russia of all the Gulf states, has
concluded military contracts Russian experts say are worth up to Dollars 3bn
and include joint production of a new SU-37 fighter (a version of the
SU-35).
The Russian debt to the UAE is Dollars 550m, with arrears on interest
payments of more than Dollars 60m, according to the Interfax news agency. No
decision on deferment, or of the use of the military shipments to pay off
the debt, has yet been announced.
Mr Chernomyrdin had most to gain from Saudi Arabia, but seems to have
achieved little but formal agreements. The Saudis opened an embassy in
Moscow only after the fall of the Soviet Union and remain distant. A claim
by Mr Davydov of an agreement to put off repayment of Dollars 250m owed by
Russia to a group of Saudi banks was flatly denied by Mr Mohammed Ali Aba
al-Khail, Saudi finance minister, who said the banks demanded full repayment
immediately.
For these wealthy states, Russia is of moderate interest. It is indigent,
and has better links with the radical states. But it offers a chance to
diversify arms purchases and put some pressure on the west; it is an active
partner in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process; its economy may be chaotic
but offers high quick returns in some spheres, and may become stable soon;
its diplomacy remains skilful and its memory long. Both sides had something
to gain.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Resignation triggers Mexico shockwaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and STEPHEN FIDLER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of Mexico's deputy attorney-general over claims that senior
ruling party officials have obstructed investigations into the assassination
of his brother has delivered another shock to the country's political
system.
Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu resigned as deputy attorney-general, member of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and lead investigator into
the killing of his brother, Francisco, which he claims was ordered by a
powerful group of PRI politicians. Francisco was, at the time of his death,
secretary-general of the PRI.
One week before Mr Ernesto Zedillo takes over the presidency, the
accusations have generated much noise, heat and smoke in the febrile
atmosphere of Mexico's political system. But it is not clear yet whether Mr
Ruiz has tossed a bomb or a firecracker at the ruling party.
The weeks before the six-yearly handover of power in Mexico are, in any
case, usually highly charged. In the relative political vacuum that exists
before power is handed over, stunning accusations are often levelled at
powerful figures, and the cracks quickly covered up once the new president
takes power.
That may be more difficult on this occasion, given the intensity of the
year's events. The September killing of Francisco came as the country's
political system was calming down following August's presidential election,
the April assassination of the PRI's original presidential candidate, Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, and the peasant uprising in the southern state of
Chiapas.
The greater freedom now enjoyed by parts of the Mexican media will also make
the political fallout harder to control. Mr Ruiz's accusations and
resignations were delivered on live television and witnessed by a packed
room of applauding family members, politicians and journalists.
Mr Ruiz is one of a handful of figures who have achieved celebrity status in
Mexico this year after delivering devastating critiques of the country's
tight-knit political system. The others include Mr Manuel Camacho, the
former mayor of Mexico City and Chiapas peace negotiator, and Mr Eduardo
Valle, a former special investigator in the attorney-general's office who
from self-exile in the US has alleged close links between senior Mexican
politicians and drug traffickers.
Political analysts say Mr Ruiz's moves make more likely a high-profile
political gesture from Mr Zedillo as soon as he takes office. This would be
reminiscent of President Carlos Salinas's decision to arrest the head of the
oil workers' union, Mr Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, when he took office, and
would stamp his authority on a feuding ruling party.
The moves also increase the pressure on the president-elect to pursue the
reform he has promised of the judiciary. Apart from tackling a corrupt and
unpopular institution, it would also head off minor scandals before they
became significant political incidents.
In Washington on Wednesday Mr Zedillo said he would give the assassination
investigation priority in his new administration and said he was anxious to
receive any and all information about the case from Mr Ruiz.
Mr Ruiz said he would hand his 'proof' that senior officials obstructed
justice - which has yet to be seen - over to a notary public, who would hold
it for Mr Zedillo.
Yesterday the attorney-general, Mr Humberto Benitez, and the president of
the PRI, Mr Ignacio Pichardo, renewed their demands that Mr Ruiz publicly
present proof that they conspired to obstruct the investigation of the
assassination.
Mr Ruiz said the alleged obstruction meant 'now is the time for political
decisions instead of police investigations'. He said that 'those who
obstructed the investigation will surely receive jobs in the next
administration' and that they 'were more powerful than the truth and justice
the president sought'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Menem begins long campaign for re-election: A split
opposition boosts his chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week is a long time in politics but, when it comes to Argentine election
campaigns, six months is not considered overlong. Nearly half a year before
next May's presidential elections, Mr Carlos Menem last weekend officially
launched his re-election bid at a huge rally of Peronist faithful on the
outskirts of Buenos Aires.
President Menem, having earlier this year engineered constitutional reforms
enabling him to seek a second term, has now begun the process of ensuring
four more years in office. To win outright he needs 45 per cent of the vote,
or more than 40 per cent provided he is 10 points clear of the next
candidate.
The president's aspirations, which had been dulled earlier in the year by
sagging popularity and the gathering strength of the opposition Frente
Grande coalition, received a shot in the arm last month when fellow Peronist
Governor Eduardo Duhalde scored an important victory in the province of
Buenos Aires. Mr Duhalde, mirroring Mr Menem's constitutional tinkering, won
61 per cent of electoral support in a plebiscite proposing that he be
allowed to stand again as governor.
Although Mr Duhalde's win may have owed as much to his personal style of
leadership as to general approval for the Peronist national agenda, Mr Menem
was quick to claim the victory as his own. 'This is a vote for my
government's model,' he said.
Mr Menem's claim was partially endorsed by a recent opinion poll suggesting
he would win the forthcoming election, without the need of a second-round
run-off, by polling nearly 44 per cent of the vote, against 20 per cent each
for the Frente Grande and Radicals.
Just as Mr Menem sought to take credit for the governor's victory, so too
has his party been keen to scotch rumours of a power struggle between the
president and Mr Duhalde, who has made no secret of his presidential
aspirations in 1999. Mr Duhalde is considered more of an old-fashioned
populist and is thought to dislike aspects of the government's economic
restructuring policies. He has made several calls for a return to 'the
politics of work', an implied criticism of unemployment, which now exceeds
10 per cent.
But any signs of discord within the governing party are outweighed by the
bitter infighting of the opposition, the two most important sectors of which
 -the Radicals and the Frente Grande - will nominate their presidential
candidates on Sunday.
The Radical party, the traditional counter to Peronism, has virtually split
into two wings, represented by presidential hopefuls Mr Federico Storani and
Mr Horacio Massaccesi. The two have fought a bruising pre-election campaign,
with Mr Storani accusing his opponent of ideological capitulation to the
governing Peronists. Mr Storani has hinted that, if nominated, he may be
willing to forge an electoral pact with the Frente Grande coalition in order
to mount a serious challenge to Mr Menem.
The Radical party has lost much credibility as an opposition force since its
leader, former President Raul Alfonsn, yielded to Mr Menem's wishes and
supported the constitutional changes that may well deliver the Peronists a
second presidential term. The Radicals are also remembered as the party
whose government led to a period of hyper-inflation; Mr Alfonsn admitted
recently that 'the economy exploded in our hands'.
The void left by the Radicals has in part been filled by the Frente Grande,
a centre-left coalition headed by Mr Carlos 'Chacho' Alvarez, a charismatic
Peronist dissident. The Frente, which shot to prominence in April's
constitutional assembly elections - when it defeated the Peronists in the
federal capital of Buenos Aires - is the great hope of those wishing to
unseat Mr Menem.
But the Frente has also been racked by unseemly internal squabbles and may
be losing ground. Mr Alvarez, partly in mind of the defeat in Brazil of Mr
Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, is seeking to reposition himself in the camp of
the moderate, electable, centre. But this stance has disenchanted the
coalition's more radical contingent, part of which has broken off into a
separate faction.
Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, says the Frente has much to do if it
is to persuade the electorate that it can risk a potentially destabilising
change of government. Mr Fraga also believes that, to have any chance of
success, the Frente will have to reach some sort of electoral alliance with
the Radicals.
For the moment the Peronists can afford to sit back in the hope that the
opposition will self-destruct. Mr Menem does not enjoy the levels of
popularity that he did a few years ago but, unless the opposition is able to
rally behind a single flag, this is unlikely to prevent the president riding
home to a second term.

FT  25 NOV 94 / White House to enter battle over education: State of
Missouri contests desegregation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is to intervene in a Supreme Court battle over
how much state governments can be held responsible for the wide disparities
in educational achievement between black and white and rich and poor.
Mr Drew Days, the solicitor-general, plans to file a brief on the side of
parents and the local school district of Kansas City, Missouri, against a
lawsuit brought by the state of Missouri seeking release from a costly
court-ordered plan to desegregate its schools which has required it to put
more money into schools in poor areas.
At the heart of the case is an argument over how much the state has to do to
prove it has reversed the effects of decades of racial segregation in
schools: is it enough to spend Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 828m) on specialised
'magnet' schools drawing pupils with particular abilities or interests from
outside their catchment areas and other educational facilities, complying
literally with the court's orders, or must it also bring the test scores of
black children in the district up to national levels to prove the success of
the desegregation plan?
The court decision is potentially far reaching, with more than 100 school
districts under similar court orders.
Mr Jeremiah Nixon, Missouri's attorney-general, is asking the Supreme Court
to reverse a federal appeals court ruling which he argues departs from
previous law by holding the state responsible for low student achievement
levels.
Justice department officials say the state must prove that it has done
everything it reasonably could to ensure the success of the desegregation
plan before it can be released from the court's supervision.
The case, which is to be argued before the Supreme Court in January, is
believed to be the first school desegregation case in which the Clinton
administration has taken sides. The administration of former President
George Bush generally sided with school boards seeking to be released from
court-supervised desegregation plans.
Responsibility for education in the US is delegated principally to the
states and to 15,000 local school districts, which are massively uneven in
funding and educational achievement. With no national curriculum or
examination, high school graduation standards vary widely.
A recent survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development criticised 'the extreme and unjustifiable disparity of service
quality between affluent and poorer communities'.
The Clinton administration is working with state governors to establish
national educational standards under the 'Goals 2000' legislation signed
earlier this year. But the federal government has little leverage to make
states bring their poorer districts up to these standards.
A 1973 Supreme Court decision that education was not a 'fundamental
interest' means that the unequal distribution of education funding cannot in
general be challenged under the US constitution, but racial equality laws do
provide the federal government with the means to hold state governments to
some standard.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Rate of French growth slower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's rate of growth slowed in the third quarter to 0.7 per cent, from
1.1 per cent in the second quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first three
months of this year, Insee, the official statistics agency, reported
yesterday. Insee also said consumer purchases of manufactured goods fell by
2.5 per cent in October after stagnation in September. But the agency saw
'no sign of a break in the recovery', which had been exceptionally strong in
the January-June period and was now continuing at a more normal pace. Even
if gross domestic product was flat in the fourth quarter, average growth
this year would be 2.3 per cent higher than 1993, Insee said.
In the third quarter growth was led by domestic demand, with household
consumption rising 0.9 per cent in July-September. This offset the one
negative factor - exports, which in volume terms increased only 0.1 per cent
in the third quarter after growing 2.7 per cent in April-June. By contrast,
import volumes rose by the same 1.6 per cent as in the second quarter.
Italian industrial producer prices rose 3.7 per cent in the year to
September compared with a 3.5 per cent rise in August, the National
Statistical Institute reported.
The fall in the west German inflation rate is gathering pace, according to
preliminary data from two key states, published yesterday. Consumer prices
in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, rose 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-November. The annual rate was 2.5 per cent, after 2.7 per cent
in October, and the lowest since March 1991, the regional statistics office
said.
A 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise in Baden-Wurttemberg brought the annual
rate there to 2.4 per cent after 2.6 per cent last month.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Allies fall out over protecting Bosnia safe areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, DAVID BUCHAN and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wide differences of emphasis between the outside powers involved in Bosnia
have resurfaced as they debate how to defuse the crisis in Bihac, a
stronghold of the Moslem-led government which has been surrounded by Serb
forces.
The US, strongly committed to the Bosnian government, has pressed for the
establishment around Bihac of as wide as possible an 'exclusion zone' in
which heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes.
This measure would be aimed at the Serbs, who enjoy overwhelming superiority
in heavy armour.
France has been no less strident than the US in saying that the town of
Bihac - a small and theoretically UN-protected area of the Bihac enclave -
must not be allowed to fall.
Paris was one of the first western capitals to moot the idea of extending
the protected area northwards from the town by up to four miles, less than
the US would like but still a breathing space.
At the same time, France and Britain - whose troops form the linchpin of the
UN ground force in Bosnia - have doubts about the feasibility of protecting
Bihac with air power alone.
London and Paris differ about what these doubts imply. British officials say
the fall of Bihac may in practice prove impossible to prevent, while the
French say the limits of air power reinforce the need to deploy more ground
troops.
This Anglo-French difference is more rhetorical than substantial. But not
for the first time, Paris is proving quicker than London to seize the moral
high ground in Bosnia.
The US put forward its ideas as part of a plan to 'demilitarise' Bihac - a
worthy-sounding objective whose precise meaning is bitterly disputed.
If it means a surrender of weapons by the government army, whose
battle-hardened Fifth Corps is based in Bihac and remains in business, then
it will be hailed by the Serbs and rejected by the Bosnian authorities. The
reverse may apply if the Fifth Corps is allowed to keep its weapons and use
them elsewhere.
This week's showdown around Bihac is the third crisis since the UN
designated six Bosnian towns as 'safe areas' in May 1993.
The international community failed to define their borders and sent a
handful of troops to guard them. Nor was their status as safe areas ever
respected by the warring parties. Serbs have blocked convoys to the
enclaves, while Moslems have used them as launching pads for assaults.
The 'safe area' concept was born out of fears of a bloodbath in April 1993,
when the defenders of Srebrenica, one of three Moslem enclaves in the east,
smuggled out a note, saying they could not hold out.
On condition that government forces disarmed immediately, Bosnian Serb
commander General Ratko Mladic agreed to halt the offensive. The UN never
called it a surrender, but it was a unilateral disarmament.
About 44,000 Moslems remain in Srebrenica, an unviable enclave at the far
end of a life support system.
In April, Moslem defenders tried to break out of Gorazde, about 45 miles
south-east of Sarajevo. Scoffing at Nato threats, Bosnian Serb forces closed
in on the town, which was crowded with 65,000 people, most of them refugees.
Nato reacted with a series of small air strikes. Gorazde, like Sarajevo, was
declared an 'exclusion zone' where heavy weapons could be subject to aerial
bombing, and a ceasefire was negotiated.
Eight months later, the enclave remains short of food, and conditions are
miserable, but the government army appears to have retained some fire-power
in the town - enough, in the UN's view, to stage occasional provocations.

Spanish joblessness edged down to 23.8 per cent of the work force at the end
of September from 24.2 per cent three months earlier, according to the
economy ministry's third-quarter employment survey.
The data confirmed projections there will be a net creation of jobs this
year on the back of an economic recovery that, under revised government
forecasts, will show a GDP growth of 2 per cent. The number of jobless,
according to the survey, dropped by 64,530 between July and September, the
biggest fall for the period in four years. Registered unemployment,
according to a separate set of figures issued by the labour ministry, stood
at 16.7 per cent of the work force at the end of last month after the lowest
jobless rise in October since 1989.

Western German companies are revising their production plans upwards for the
coming months because of the continuing strong recovery in the economy, Ifo,
the Munich-based Institute for Economic Research, concludes in its monthly
survey. However, the retail sector in both eastern and western Germany
remains one of the few which show little sign of growth, largely because
consumer spending is still sluggish. This is despite recent official
estimates showing that pan-German gross domestic product will grow 3 per
cent next year. The more optimistic response by companies coincides with a
record level of investment in eastern Germany for 1994. Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the economics minister, yesterday told the Bundestag, parliament's lower
house, that a record investment level of DM180bn (Pounds 73.4bn), higher per
capita than in western Germany, had poured into eastern Germany this year.

Norway's principal opponents of joining the European Union yesterday
re-affirmed their threat to block accession in parliament if the referendum
on Monday results in a narrow vote in favour of membership. With latest
opinion polls showing the Yes side narrowing the long-standing lead held by
the No campaign, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, strongly
attacked anti-EU parties for their refusal to be bound by the referendum
result, saying she would consider dissolving parliament if a Yes vote was
blocked.
Both the main parties opposed to membership, which together hold three more
seats than the number required for a blocking minority, yesterday said they
stood by their policy to reserve the right to vote against the referendum
result.
Yesterday, three opinion polls showed further gains for the Yes campaign,
but they continued to show a No lead ranging from a margin of 44-40 to
47-39. A fourth poll, which eliminated undecided voters, showed a No lead of
just 51-49.

Ireland's Labour party, the junior partner in the outgoing government,
yesterday held talks with both Fianna Fail, its former coalition partner,
and the conservative Fine Gael, the main opposition party, in the first
steps to break the deadlock over the search for a new government. Fine Gael
leader John Bruton described the talks as preliminary. A new Fianna
Fail-Labour coalition is still seen by most observers as the most likely
outcome. However, Labour's meeting with Fine Gael has raised the prospect
that the party may be prepared to accept the suggestion by Labour, the
smaller of the two, that Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, be appointed as
'rotating' prime minister in a rainbow coalition of several parties.
With the Dail, the Irish parliament, due to vote on the issue next
Wednesday, the politicians are under mounting pressure to agree terms for a
new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour
coalition last week and the resignation as prime minister of Mr Albert
Reynolds.
There was speculation last night that Mr Spring, who was foreign minister
under the old coalition, will demand a new carve up of ministerial
portfolios as his price for re-entering a coalition with Fianna Fail. Labour
is said to want finance, while Mr Spring may head a newly established
Northern Ireland ministry, as well as an 'open government' portfolio.

Turkey's parliament approved a framework privatisation law yesterday,
opening the way to sell off nearly all the country's loss-making state
companies. Approval of the law by 193 votes to 25 was a welcome political
victory for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, whose fractious coalition
government faced collapse in recent weeks. The law gives broad authority to
sell over 100 companies without obtaining prior parliamentary approval for
each sale. The Erdemir steel company and the Petrol Ofisi chain of petrol
stations and oil refineries are expected to be among the first companies to
be privatised. Officials expect to raise Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.4bn) from
privatisation next year.
This is the first structural reform measure parliament has approved since
Mrs Ciller in April adopted an emergency package of tax increases and
spending cuts after a balance of payments crisis. Last year, state companies
contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars
29.72bn.
However, Mrs Ciller now faces mounting opposition from trade unions. On
Wednesday, demonstrators paralysed the city of Zonguldak, home to the Demir
Celik steel company, to protest against privatisation, which is likely to
cost 80 per cent of the company's 8,700 jobs.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Call to postpone Russian elections

<TEXT>
A senior Russian presidential aide yesterday called for the postponement of
parliamentary and presidential elections because of the 'political apathy of
the majority'.
Mr Mark Urnov, newly appointed head of Mr Boris Yeltsin's analytical centre
 -the main presidential think-tank - also said that combining the elections
for parliament and the presidency could 'raise the level of political
activity of the population' and drive more people to the polls.
Another reason for postponement, he said, was that positive results from the
tough economic policy being proposed by the government would appear only
after the summer of 1996. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for the end
of next year, while presidential elections are due in spring of 1996.
Postponement of the elections has been a constant theme of presidential
aides in recent months - though they insist, as Mr Urnov repeated yesterday,
that Mr Yeltsin has not yet decided whether he will again be a candidate.
Mr Urnov said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the reformist Yabloko group
and a self-declared presidential candidate, had an 'extremely high' rating
as a potential presidential candidate, especially in industrial areas,
according to his polls.
But Mr Yavlinsky, with other reformist leaders such as Mr Yegor Gaidar,
leader of the Russia's Choice grouping, Mr Boris Fyodorov, leader of the
Liberal Democratic Union, and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, leader of the Party of
Unity and Accord, are considering uniting forces by presenting a joint
platform on parliamentary elections and one candidate for president.
The move comes in the face of increasing evidence that far-right and
far-left parties are better organised, more popular and ahead in local
elections.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warned yesterday of a danger of
fascism in Russia. 'There are concrete examples of people who express it,'
he said.
Meanwhile, one of the far-right leaders, Mr Alexander Sterligov, head of the
Russian National Assembly, forecast yesterday a period of 'national
liberation struggles' to stop the present leadership from turning the
country into a 'servile producer of raw materials for the west' and to
express the interests of the 84 per cent of the population who are ethnic
Russians.
He called for unity of patriotic forces at the next elections and emergence
of one presidential candidate supported by nationalist and communist groups.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Details of Berlusconi investigation leak out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Milan magistrates are reported to have discovered a bank account allegedly
used for making unregistered payments in the Fininvest business group of Mr
Silvio Berlusconi.
This discovery, according to the national news agency Ansa, lay behind the
magistrates' move on Tuesday telling Mr Berlusconi, the prime minister, he
was under investigation for alleged corruption. The report, quoting judicial
sources, appeared to be a well orchestrated leak from Milan magistrates in
advance of Mr Berlusconi's interrogation.
No date has been fixed, but the meeting with the magistrates, whom Mr
Berlusconi has accused of mounting a politically motivated campaign against
him, is expected very soon.
Throughout 2 1/2 years of anti-corruption investigations that have
undermined Italy's post-war political system, sensitive information has
consistently leaked from the offices of the Milan magistrates - including
this week's news of the plan to interrogate Mr Berlusconi.
The report of the bank account discovery followed publication in yesterday's
media of the four-page document explaining why the magistrates wish to
interrogate the premier about heading his Fininvest group, Italy's second
largest private business empire. The bank account allegedly served to make
off-balance sheet payments to members of the Berlusconi family and Fininvest
executives as well as to others including the Guardia di Finanza, the
financial police.
Mr Jas Gawronski, Mr Berlusconi's spokesman, ridiculed the report, saying:
'Mr Berlusconi has for many years been the first and second biggest taxpayer
in Italy. If he wished to give presents to his family and friends, he had no
need to resort to illicit funds let alone Swiss bank accounts.'
In July Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department,
admitted paying L330m (Pounds 130,500) between 1989 and 1992 to Guardia di
Finanza officials. This related to tax inspections of Videotime, a Fininvest
TV production company, Mediolanum, the group's life insurance company, and
the Mondadori publishing division. Mr Sciascia also received a special L500m
gratuity from Mr Silvio Berlusconi for his work at Fininvest. One of the
reasons cited by Milan magistrates for questioning Mr Berlusconi was his
responsibility as head of the group for such payments.
Mr Sciascia told magistrates the funds were given to him by Mr Paolo
Berlusconi, the prime minister's younger brother. Mr Paolo Berlusconi later
confirmed the payment and claimed Fininvest had been forced to make it. This
has been the standard defence of all businessmen accused in the
ever-widening enquiry into bribes paid to tax inspectors. Mr Silvio
Berlusconi used the same defence at a news conference in Naples on
Wednesday.
Milan magistrates are also investigating in a separate case alleged
undeclared transfer fees paid by Mr Berlusconi's football club, AC Milan,
for Gianluigi Lentini of Torino football club. Mr Mauro Borsano, the head of
Torino, told the magistrates L8bn was paid secretly via banks in
Liechtenstein and Lugano.
Different judicial authorities in Italy are believed to be investigating at
least seven separate cases within the Fininvest empire. Yesterday Rome
magistrates revealed that Mr Berlusconi was on the list of people under
investigation for abuse of office following complaints by a left-wing
politician and a consumers' association, for allegedly putting pressure on
the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, to do a deal with Fininvest's
TV channels on advertising rates.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Berlusconi's two children by his first
marriage - 28 year-old Marina and Piersilvio, aged 25 - who have board
positions in Fininvest, were under investigation for alleged false billing
in connection with Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wide-ranging proposals aimed at stemming corruption in French political life
were yesterday tabled by an all-party group of deputies in France's National
Assembly.
The proposals would reduce the share of corporate cash in political party
coffers, submit politicians to audits of their personal wealth and make it
harder for them to hold national and local posts simultaneously, and
increase transparency and controls on the awarding of public contracts.
It is unlikely all 18 legislative proposals in the group's 650-page report
would become law, even though representatives of almost all the assembly's
577 deputies sat in the group, chaired by Mr Philippe Seguin, assembly
president.
The reforms could be debated by the assembly in mid-December, he declared.
But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is reluctant to introduce new
legislation on corruption, arguing the current investigations of senior
politicians and company heads show existing anti-corruption laws are
working.
To avoid being accused in next spring's presidential election of being lax
on the issue, Mr Balladur is likely to react to reforms which Mr Seguin said
were aimed at 'helping dissolve suspicion of public officials and restoring
confidence in democracy'.

FT  25 NOV 94 / EU industry concerned at competition: Round Table seeks to
stop drain of jobs to US, Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's top industrialists yesterday called for a campaign to reduce public
spending, speed privatisation, and improve education and training, in order
to prevent the drain of jobs and wealth to the US and Asia.
In a hard-hitting report issued ahead of next month's European summit in
Essen, the European Round Table said it was an illusion to believe that
economic recovery signalled an end to Europe's competitiveness crisis.
'This is a dangerous conclusion. The need to improve long-term
competitiveness in order to generate job opportunities through sustained
growth remains as important as ever,' the report says.
The ERT groups 40 top industrialists from such companies as Bayer, BP, Fiat,
ICI, Philips, Siemens, and Unilever. Its seven-page report makes several
recommendations to force competitiveness to the top of the EU's political
agenda:
The creation of a Competitiveness Advisory Group. The forum would be drawn
from business and trade unions, and would offer an independent assessment of
industry's performance in global markets.
The appointment of a European commissioner for competitiveness charged with
filtering proposals for EU-wide legislation. The idea would be to halt
directives deemed to damage businesses' ability to compete internationally.
Investing - not consuming - the 'recovery dividend'. Public finances must be
put on a sound footing, the burden of the public sector must be lifted, and
the proposed CO energy tax scrapped, says the report.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, and Viscount Etienne Davignon,
chairman of the Societe Generale de Belgique, presented the ERT report to Mr
Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, yesterday. Mr
Delors was said to have given a favourable response.
Sir Denys said Europe could not afford to slacken efforts to bolster its
competitiveness, despite the economic recovery. 'We are, so to speak, at the
point of maximum danger, where people often let loose (on costs).'
Sir Denys warned that EU trade with the rest of the world had failed to keep
pace with intra-EU trade. Energy costs to European industry were at least 30
per cent higher than in the US; tax levels in Europe were 46 per cent of
GDP, as opposed to 31 per cent in the US and 34 per cent in Japan.
Despite a general wariness about state subsidies and public spending, the
ERT report gave a cautious welcome to the Trans-European networks, the
billion-dollar infrastructure projects expected to span Europe in the 21st
century.
Viscount Davignon urged Europe's leaders to examine the projects seriously
at the Essen summit on December 9 and 10. In response to sceptics in the
British and German governments worried about financing the projects, Mr
Davignon said: 'We should not make this a point of principle. We should have
a debate on a project - not on a concept.'

FT  25 NOV 94 / Iberia strike situation 'very grim': Things were starting to
look up for the airline's Hispanic strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A two-hour stoppage by ground crews has forced Iberia to cancel 20 per cent
of its 125 domestic flights today as management and unions remained in a
deadlock that could ground Spain's national carrier in the days ahead and,
in the medium term, reduce the company to a fraction of its present size.
The management said on Wednesday that unless unions accepted a viability
plan involving average pay cuts of 15 per cent for the airline's 25,000
employees, it would press ahead at the begining of next week with a decision
to axe 5,200 jobs and to sell off most of its business units.
Unions will stage the first of several planned demonstrations against the
threatened break-up of the company on Monday, with a march through central
Madrid. Mass meetings held at domestic airports heard calls to close down
air traffic in Spain, and there is growing concern that wildcat disruptive
action could follow if the airline's main unions lost control of the protest
to extremists.
'The situation is very grim indeed,' said a middle-management executive who
asked not to be named. 'The labour force is extremely angry and it is in no
mood to negotiate anything unless the top level of the company is sacked
first.'
As it lurches into the severest crisis in its 65 years, Iberia faces the
prospect of bankruptcy by next March unless it gains a Pta130bn (Pounds
635m) injection of capital. The funds can only be obtained through public
subsidies, which have to be authorised by the European Commission, or by
raising the necessary cash through disposals.
Part of Iberia's problem is its singular failure to increase its revenue.
The carrier says that although its unit costs are comparable to those of
Lufthansa, it raised its revenues between 1990 and 1993 by only 7.4 per cent
from Pta277bn to Pta299bn, compared with a 22.2 per cent increase by the
German carrier over the same period.
The lowered revenue, Iberia claims, is chiefly caused by the competition
that the company faces from charter carriers which account for 80 per cent
of air traffic to Spain. This competition from cut-rate operators places a
heavy cost-reducing onus on Iberia.
The company's costs, measured in available seat kilometres (ask), stand at
11.5 US cents - a middle-ranking level among the big European airlines,
where the best performer is British Airway's 8 US cents ask. Iberia needs to
curb its expenditure to BA's level if it is to take business from the
charter carriers.
The additional burdens of a fleet renewal programme, which Iberia is already
scaling down, and of a strong investment policy in Latin America have served
to increase the company's losses, estimated to total Pta44bn this year, up
on earlier estimates of Pta30bn.
Even if the pay cuts had been agreed with the union, Iberia would still have
encountered difficulties in gaining approval from Brussels for a government
recapitalisation. There is an open rift in the Commission over new
guidelines on state aid to troubled carriers and seven European airlines,
led by British Airways, are contesting the Commission's recent approval of a
state aid package worth Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.4bn) to Air France. Iberia's
accumulated losses by December will have in effect wiped out a Pta120bn
capital injection authorised by Brussels in 1992 on condition that no more
public money be made available to the airline until 1996.
Breaking up the airline would involve raising around Pta130bn by selling the
shareholdings built up in Latin American carriers since 1989 and hiving off
units such as handling and maintenance.
The proposed sale of Iberia's 85 per cent stake in Aerolineas Argentinas and
of its lesser shareholdings in Chile's Ladeco and in Venezuela's Viasa
signals the end of the airline's ambitions to link Europe and the southern
hemisphere. Iberia will clip its wings further with the planned disposal of
its domestic subsidiaries Aviaco, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterraneo.
It is ironic that Iberia should face the loss of its Hispanic empire just as
Aerolineas Argentinas, by far its biggest investment, should be starting to
post an operating profit. The Latin American strategy could turn out to be a
money spinner but the management's inability to control costs and its
industrial relations record may kill the potential golden goose just as it
starts to lay eggs.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Halifax and Leeds linked in talk of merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation was intensifying last night that talks are under way on a merger
between two of the UK's largest building societies.
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest with assets of more than Pounds
60bn, is reported to be in discussion with Leeds Permanent, the
fifth-largest society.
Any such merger would involve branch closures and job losses as there is
significant regional overlap between the two societies which are based in
Yorkshire.
Leeds has been rumoured as an intended partner because Mr Mike Blackburn,
Halifax chief executive, ran Leeds until the first half of last year. Leeds
has been without a chief executive since then.
A merger between the Halifax and the Leeds would create a society with
assets of Pounds 87.6bn and such a large slice of the mortgage lending
market that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission might become involved.
Halifax refused to comment on the reports last night. It has made no secret
of its desire to merge with a smaller society. However, there has always
been a question about the benefit of such a merger to the smaller partner
such as the Leeds.
The speculation comes at a time of increasing competition within the
personal financial services sector, leading to increased pressure for
consolidation.
Just over a year ago merger talks between Leeds and National &amp; Provincial
Building Society, the UK's eighth-largest, foundered on a difference of
management cultures.
In April this year Lloyds Bank launched a Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth-largest.
Halifax has made it clear it would like mutual bank status, and this is one
option under consideration in the current Treasury review of building
society powers. If Halifax were unable to achieve the freedom such an option
would offer it could well seek its members' approval to convert to a plc.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Rebels threaten to challenge Major over leadership:
Ministers confident of victory in Euro-vote despite backbench revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bitter confrontation between Mr John Major and the Tory party's
Eurosceptics escalated yesterday as leaders of the anti-Brussels rebellion
threatened to turn it into a direct challenge to the prime minister's
leadership.
The latest bout in the struggle over increased contributions to the European
Union followed formal cabinet endorsement of Mr Major's threat to seek a
general election if he is defeated in a parliamentary vote on Monday.
Despite the continuing defiance of a hard core of Tory Euro-sceptics and an
attempt by Labour and the Liberal Democrats to defeat the government, senior
ministers insisted last night they were assured of a comfortable victory.
On paper, the government's majority is only 14, but Mr Major also expects
the backing of 10 unionist MPs from Ulster. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour
leader, acknowledged publicly yesterday that a general election was
unlikely.
Amid signs of irritation among members of the cabinet over the prime
minister's handling of the issue, there was less confidence that the row had
not further damaged the prime minister's already battered authority. The
three leading Eurosceptics in the cabinet - Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter
Lilley, and Mr John Redwood - publicly supported the tough line over the
bill, which Downing Street insisted had been reaffirmed unanimously at
yesterday's meeting. But earlier at least one had voiced his misgivings to
journalists. Anger on the backbench Tory right prompted speculation that Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, might stand in a leadership contest.
Mr Lamont has not commented, but Mrs Edwina Currie, a supporter of the prime
minister, said she thought he might be planning a challenge.
Opponents of Mr Major are seeking the 34 nominations needed by next
Wednesday to trigger a leadership contest. They are still short of the
required number, but were claiming a groundswell of anger against Mr Major.
Advocates of a contest said potential rebels could choose to back the
government in the vote on the EU budget but then indicate they had lost
confidence in the prime minister by backing a challenge.
That brought acknowledgement from cabinet colleagues that a contest was
possible. But one senior minister insisted last night the latest storms had
strengthened Mr Major's determination to stay.
Mr Major drew comfort from the re-election to the chairmanship of the
backbench 1922 committee of Sir Marcus Fox.
He had been accused of not representing backbench MPs' views forcefully
enough to the prime minister. But he beat off a challenge from Eurosceptic
Sir Nicholas Bonsor.
The effort to turn the dispute into an attack on the prime minister came as
Labour and Liberal parties outlined their tactics for Monday's vote.
To win support from Tory sceptics, Labour published an amendment which would
delay implementation of the financing until the government had acted to
reduce fraud and spending on the Common Agricultural Policy. The Liberal
Democrats will vote against as the government had made it an issue of
confidence.
The cabinet's tough line did not prevent one Tory MP from issuing a public
Commons challenge. Mr Christopher Gill, a long-standing sceptic, told Mr
Major that he would prefer to resign from the parliamentary party than
support higher payments to Brussels.
Allies of the prime minister, however, admitted their main concern now was
heading off a leadership challenge.

FT  25 NOV 94 / Serbs press into Bihac as Nato squabbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb forces pressed their military offensive into the embattled town
of Bihac late yesterday as squabbling Nato countries tried to put together a
plan to save the battered enclave in north-west Bosnia.
The United Nations commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, accused
the Bosnian Serbs of 'flagrant and blatant' violation of the 'safe area'
designated by the UN at Bihac.
He said the Bosnian Serbs 'certainly have crossed the line beyond which the
safety of the population of Bihac is now threatened' and had refused a
ceasefire. 'This is a very grave development which we have to act upon,' he
said.
Gen Rose unsuccessfully negotiated with Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale, near
Sarajevo, while ambassadors from Nato's 16 member countries became bogged
down in unexpectedly tough talks in Brussels. The ambassadors failed to
agree on details of a blueprint to halt the Serb advance on Bihac, referring
the matter to the UN for assessment.
Mr Robert Hunter, US ambassador to Nato, said the allies were in broad
agreement over a proposal to set up a 'stabilisation zone' around Bihac, but
some details would have to be worked out by the UN.
The US expects the proposal to go to military specialists at the UN rather
than the Security Council. The specialists are expected to assess what
troops might be needed to make the proposal work.
The US initially urged its allies to create, around Bihac, as wide a zone as
possible where heavy weapons would be subject to air strikes. But European
members of Nato, led by France, suggested a more modest plan for a four-mile
extension of the existing 'safe area', within which the UN is committed to
protecting civilians and its own peacekeepers.
The French also insisted that more ground troops would be needed to
implement any ceasefire agreement. The French stance was aimed at driving
home to the US, which has declined to send ground troops to Bosnia, the
limits of a policy based purely on air power.
Gen Rose said that Bosnian Serbs late yesterday advanced from high ground to
the very outskirts of Bihac. He did not think the town could hold out
against any sustained attack.
An amateur radio operator reporting from Bihac said the Bosnian Serbs were
only one kilometre from the town centre.
In Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, sharply
criticised the Bosnian government, accusing it of provoking the fighting
around Bihac in the hope of prompting western intervention. There could be
no military solution to the Bosnian conflict and outside intervention could
result in a 'second Afghanistan or Vietnam'.
Mr Kozyrev said next week's meeting of the contact group - the US, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany - must send a 'clear signal that the world
community . . . favours a return to political methods' in Bosnia. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, last night warned that the UN might have to pull
out of Bosnia if there were a resumption of all-out war in the region. Mr
Major said there could be no prospect of imposing peace on Bosnia through
aerial bombardment.
He said that he had sent a letter to leaders of contact group countries
stressing 'the urgency of progress' at their next meeting.
The UN's contingent in Bihac is largely made up of 1,200 poorly armed
Bangladeshis, who were resupplied by a UN convoy yesterday under an
agreement with the Serbs.
The UN's vulnerability to any all-out confrontation with the Serbs was
driven home yesterday when over 250 peacekeepers from Canada, France, Russia
and Ukraine were detained in the Sarajevo area.

FT  25 NOV 94 / OFT says stock exchange price secrecy uncompetitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Stock Exchange rules which allow the prices of large blocks of shares
to be kept secret for up to five days are anti-competitive, the Office of
Fair Trading said yesterday.
The exchange declined to comment on the criticism, except to say it is
studying the OFT's report on competitiveness in share-dealing. However, it
is understood that the exchange will shortly approve changes to its rules.
These will limit the time during which trades can be kept hidden and force
immediate disclosure of some large trades which are now concealed.
Until now, the Stock Exchange and its large, market-making members, have
argued that publishing each large trade immediately means that competitors
can respond by instantly lowering the price they will offer for the same
shares. This practice, they say, led to swingeing losses for market makers
in the late 1980s when immediate post-trade transparency was required.
The OFT report comes as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog, is also asking whether current trading rules are fair to
investors. Regulators, including the Treasury, are concerned that London's
standing as a centre for international share trading could be damaged. The
SIB is expected to deliver its review early next year.
Submitting the report to the Treasury, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general
of the OFT, referred to the SIB review. He said he was bringing the OFT
report to public attention now 'in part in order to inform that process'.
'In deciding whether to direct the exchange to amend its rules, you may
therefore wish to consider the implications of my report for SIB's
continuing work,' Sir Bryan said.
The Stock Exchange's markets committee will meet today to consider the
report. The exchange is expected to alter the current rules to cut the time
some large trades are kept secret to 60 minutes from 90 minutes.
In addition, trades which may in future be hidden will have to be at least
five times Normal Market Size - the average size of each transaction in that
share for the previous 12 months. This is an increase from the current
threshold of three times NMS.
Rules on trade publication only apply to market makers - securities firms
which agree to buy and sell large blocks of shares through all market
conditions.
The OFT report maintained that allowing the trades to be hidden meant that
some market makers had an advantage over others.
As a result of the uncertainty, the 'spread' between the price they offer to
buy and sell the same shares is widened, thus potentially disadvantaging
investors.

Government forces defending the town of Bihac in north-west Bosnia said they
had lost strategic ground to the Serbs last night as squabbling Nato
countries put together a plan to stop the fighting in the embattled enclave.
After a day of unexpectedly tough bargaining in Brussels, ambassadors from
Nato's 16 members failed to agree on details of a blueprint to halt the Serb
advance but referred the plan to the United Nations.
Mr Robert Hunter, US ambassador to Nato, said the 16 allies were in broad
agreement over a proposal to set up a 'stabilisation zone' around the town
of Bihac, but details of the plan would have be worked out.
'We have asked the UN military authorities to tell us what the UN protection
force (in Bosnia) might need,' he said, adding that it should be possible to
protect the enclave under existing UN resolutions.
However, Russia and China, both members of the UN security council,
cautioned against western military intervention as Nato members haggled over
the details of their peace proposal.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, said the Serb attackers had
taken the strategic hill of Debeljaca overlooking Bihac in fighting which
intensified yesterday afternoon.
'They are attacking from all sides and the houses are burning,' said Mr
Silajdzic, alleging that the Serb infantry were backed by tanks and
artillery.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, sharply criticised the
Bosnian government.
'The Moslem side launched its latest offensive with the clear intention of
involving Nato and other third forces in fighting on its side,' he said in
Moscow.
Mr Kozyrev said there could be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict,
and outside intervention could result in a 'second Afghanistan or Vietnam'.
The minister said next week's meeting of the contact group - of the US,
Russia, Britain, France and Germany - must send a 'clear signal that the
world community . . . favours a return to political methods' in Bosnia.
China, whose approval will be necessary for any fresh UN resolutions on
Bosnia, voiced 'deep concern' over events in Bosnia and insisted that
western air power should be used to defend civilians or peacekeepers.
In emergency talks in in Brussels, the US initially urged its allies to
agree to create as wide as possible a zone round Bihac town where heavy
weapons would be subject to air strikes.
European members of Nato, led by France, suggested a more modest plan for a
four-mile extension of the existing 'safe area'.
The UN's contingent in the Bihac enclave is largely made up of 1,200 poorly
armed Bangladeshis, resupplied by a UN convoy yesterday under agreement with
the Serbs.
The UN's vulnerability to any all-out confrontation with the Serbs was
driven home yesterday when over 250 peacekeepers were detained in the
Sarajevo area.
The Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday blocked the peacekeepers at weapons
collections sites round the exclusion zone ringing the Bosnian capital.
It followed threats by Bosnian Serb leaders to wage an 'all-out war against
the UN' in retaliation for ordering Nato air strikes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, has denied it would only take a stake in French
computer group Groupe Bull if the French government made more concessions in
opening up its markets, Reuter reports from Paris.
'Those are separate issues,' AT&amp;T said yesterday. 'We are willing to take a
stake in Bull and we are whole-heartedly in favour of the opening up of
telecommunications markets in France and other countries where we cannot
operate.
'The European Union decided on Friday to end the telecoms monopolies by
1998, and that's fine with us. Of course, we would like to see it happen
earlier.'
However, AT&amp;T has indicated it would like to see France make concessions
before the US Federal Communications Commission approves a proposed link-up
between state-owned operators France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom and
Sprint, the US long-distance operator.
'We made a filing to the FCC on Friday saying we would welcome such a link
up - provided we were allowed to do similar business in France and Germany,'
AT&amp;T said.
France Telecom, a 17 per cent shareholder in Groupe Bull, said it would
inject FFr561m (Dollars 105.2m) into the computer maker before the end of
the year, ahead of its privatisation.

   DILI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia will prosecute 30 East Timorese for alleged involvement in riots
and pro-independence protests that swept the troubled territory last week,
it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dili.
President Suharto said all East Timorese were welcome to leave for the
territory's former colonial ruler Portugal, including 29 youths staging a
protest inside the US embassy compound in Jakarta.
The 29 East Timorese students who invaded the US embassy prepared to leave
for Portugal yesterday, saying they feared for their safety if they remained
in Indonesia.
Indonesia's hopes of presenting an open image during this month's meeting of
regional leaders in Jakarta were dashed by the US embassy sit-in and Dili
protests, captured on film by the world's media. 'We have arrested 30 men
and they will be brought to trial,' East Timor Police chief Colonel Andreas
Sugianto said.
The territory's outspoken Bishop Carlos Belo said police were terrifying
many East Timorese since last week's protests by conducting house-to-house
searches to find anyone suspected of involvement.
Col Sugianto said eight of the 30 men had been arrested in Bairo village.
Dili has been swept by riots in the past 10 days, some ignited by racial
tensions and some by political opposition to Indonesian rule in the
territory. Indonesia has accused foreign journalists of stoking the protests
and has asked at least four to leave for lacking 'proper accreditation'.
Bishop Belo attacked the government for its handling of the protests and
said Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, lacked a
commitment to bring peace to the troubled territory.
He deplored the protests which swept through Dili last week, but said the
most recent protest at his cathedral may have been instigated by the
authorities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia, short of the necessary manpower for its ambitious defence
programme, is considering the introduction of compulsory military service,
diplomats in the kingdom said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai.
They said the proposal has come in a draft of the country's new five-year
development plan due to come into effect in January and which has yet to be
approved by King Fahd.
Compulsory military service is among necessary conditions to 'develop Saudi
society, enhance the country's defence capabilities and deepen citizens'
loyalty and sense of belonging,' they quoted the draft as saying.
Saudi Arabia, with a population of 17m, of whom 4m are foreigners, has
embarked on a Dollars 10bn programme to beef up its defences by the end of
the century.
Deep doubts about Iraq's intentions despite its defeat after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait and suspicions of the radical Islamic rulers of non-Arab
Iran across the Gulf are among reasons given by diplomats for the Saudi arms
buildup.
But military experts have in the past wondered if the country had manpower
to handle the sophisticated arms it is importing.
The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies put Saudi
Arabia's active armed forces at 158,000 men, both in the regular army and
the royal-led National Guard.
A 1992 census put the number of Saudi males in the 13-17 age-group, likely
candidates for compulsory military service over the next five years, at
556,500.

<TEXT>
An amendment to French secrecy laws which would curb media coverage of
corruption investigations came under fire yesterday from French magistrates
and the press. The amendment, which was passed through the National Assembly
late on Tuesday night, proposed a ban on reporting investigations until a
suspect is brought to trial. It will become law if it is approved next month
by the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament. Drafted by Mr Alain
Marsaud, a Gaullist backbencher, the amendment prompted widespread
criticism. Le Monde described it as an attack on liberty and said it
violated freedom of speech. The newspaper questioned whether the party
funding and corruption scandals which have emerged over recent years would
have been brought to light if the media had not reported the findings of
dogged magistrates.
The USM magistrates' union said the amendment would stifle reporting of
corruption scandals and that it was a way of 'putting the lid' on affairs
which have shaken the French business and political establishment.
Mr Marsaud said his amendment was designed to protect the presumption of
innocence, which is 'daily flouted'.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Investors look for Russian climate change: Prospects for
cutting through the bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are easy enough to spot: hands thrust firmly into pockets, they pace
Moscow's hotel corridors muttering obscenities about the local population
and the need to return to 'civilisation'. The western businessmen, who have
wearied of trying to conclude deals in Russia, are still a common, if
unhappy, sight.
Quite apart from the unquantifiable political and economic risks, Russia has
retained its reputation as a byword for bureaucracy. The list of deterrents
to foreign investors is endless: companies are allowed only one hard
currency bank account; there are strict limitations on cash dealings; the
legislative climate can change overnight with little possibility of
international arbitration; taxes can be arbitrarily imposed and lifted;
there are conflicting priorities between federal and local government.
It is perhaps little wonder that an Ernst &amp; Young study of the investment
intentions of multinational companies found that only 6 per cent considered
the former Soviet Union a priority compared with 57 per cent for China.
But meetings held in Moscow this week between a group of western business
leaders and Russian ministers under the aegis of the Foreign Investment
Advisory Council, have provided fresh reason for hope. Russia's new
economics team, headed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, first deputy prime minister,
and Mr Yevgeny Yasin, economics minister, impressed many with its candour
and willingness to confront the main concerns.
Mr Chubais promised that a presidential decree would be issued 'within a few
days' halving the import duties on a range of goods for five years for those
companies which had a minimum 10 per cent stake in investment projects worth
more than Dollars 100m. He also vowed to change quickly the banking rules
preventing foreign companies opening more than one hard currency account and
to ease the limits on cash dealings.
Mr Yasin, meanwhile, said his ministry would assume chief responsibility for
responding to the concerns of foreign investors, with Mr Alexander
Gorokholinsky, deputy head of the foreign investment department, being named
as an 'ombudsman' to help sort out bureaucratic problems.
Although not hugely significant in isolation, these moves were interpreted
as a sign of intent. 'We thought here were a team of people who wanted to
find solutions and who wanted to encourage people to invest here,' said one
businessman.
Mr Michael Henning, chief executive of Ernst &amp; Young, said it was
'extraordinary' that such senior ministers were prepared to lock themselves
in a room for two days to discuss foreign investors' problems. Mr Neville
Isdell, senior vice-president of Coca-Cola, said he had never 'been to a
more productive meeting'.
A similar, if less overtly excitable, reaction also followed last week's
energy and law conference, jointly sponsored by the US and Russian energy
departments. Mr Yury Shafranik, Russia's energy minister, appeared to take
on board many of the concerns raised by western oil companies and accepted
the need to introduce 'strict rules of the game'. Legislation on tax
concessions and production-sharing agreements was promised as early as next
month.
But it is one thing to persuade senior ministers of the necessity for
change, quite another to create a stable legislative and fiscal environment,
which can inspire sufficient confidence for companies to invest substantial
long-term capital.
Russia's reformers have yet to fight many political battles both within the
government and with nationalists, who are mounting an increasingly vocal
campaign against 'selling out' to foreigners.
Mr Chubais, at least, appears firmly convinced of the need to mobilise both
domestic and foreign capital investment if the country is ever to stop using
the printing press as a means of financing industry. His primary goal of
achieving financial stability would be substantially eased if he could lift
the impediments to foreign investment and regulate the stock market to
attract productive long-term capital.
If successful, the prize for both Russian and foreign investors could be
enormous. Several western oil companies have completed in-depth feasibility
studies to develop new oilfields. Industry experts suggest some Dollars 60bn
of foreign capital could be forthcoming if Russia could establish a more
predictable and stable investment climate. That is about three times the
size of all foreign direct investment in China last year.
Western companies in other areas, such as heavy engineering and consumer
products, also sense big possibilities in Russia. Investment banks in Moscow
say there are many potential deals in the pipeline which could emerge in a
more favourable environment.
Mr Percy Barnevik, chairman of ABB, the Swedish-Swiss heavy engineering
company which has already set up 16 joint ventures in Russia, predicts the
country could attract up to 10 per cent of the world's foreign direct
investment within five years if it could successfully reduce its internal
barriers to trade and promote itself more effectively abroad. Russia
currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of all such investment.
Having just raised expectations among western business leaders to such a
pitch, Russia's government would cause grave disappointment if it now fails
to deliver. While in Moscow, the western executives stressed Russia risked
being sidelined in a competitive world for capital if did not do more to
attract investment. That would only make the government's future economic
battles that much harder.

FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard-hit chemicals group Courtaulds fell 15 to 425p as several analysts felt
the hoped-for turnaround had yet to arrive. Rising raw material costs
ensured that interim profits were down to Pounds 81m from Pounds 96m
previously.
UBS maintained its bearish view and bottom of the range full-year forecast
of Pounds 150m, while Kleinwort Benson reduced its estimate by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 155m, arguing that it was too soon to be an aggressive buyer.
More enthusiasm emanated from Hoare Govett, which responded to news that
Courtaulds is to raise its own prices from January and invest Pounds 90m in
a plant for Tencel, the company's new fibre. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare
confirmed his top of the range estimate of Pounds 170m, saying: 'The bull
points far outweigh the well worn negative issues.'
British Aerospace moved ahead against the market, although there was some
confusion caused by the adjustment for the group's two-part rights issue.
The shares closed at 434p, with the group collecting Pounds 178m for the
first tier of its planned rights issue and thus - as the market saw things -
ensuring that BAe can press ahead with rationalisation of its turbo-prop
business.
The second part of the cash call hinges on the group winning its Pounds 560m
bid battle with GEC for submarine maker VSEL. GEC dipped 6 to 275p.
Telecom shares were active, with BT, the most heavily traded Footsie stock,
turning over 14m shares and proving the star performer in the traded options
market. The stock ended 10 lower at 369p.
Cable and Wireless, also a heavily traded stock option, shed 15 to 370p in
7m turnover in spite of a buy recommendation for its HK Telecom subsidiary
from Salomon Brothers. Vodafone retreated 8 1/2 to 195 1/2 p as the market
took stock of the bad debt charges in Tuesday's results statement.
Having slipped to within a half-penny of its 182p flotation price, TeleWest
Communications ended all-square at 185 1/2 p, with the shares again heavily
traded between London and New York.
Investors said yes to TSB following encouraging reports on mortgage lending
margins from rival Abbey National on Tuesday. The shares stood out in the
Footsie with a rise of a half-penny to 219 1/2 p. High street bank Lloyds,
which will also be a leading player assuming that the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society deal goes through, eased 3 to 573p. Abbey
National slipped 9 to 403p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing a keen seller.
Paper group Bowater was one of the leading casualties in the market as it
transpired that the company's meeting with its broker was less positive than
previously thought. The shares fell 23 to 447p.
News that BTR's chief operating officer was stepping down (although staying
on the board) helped to depress sentiment at the diversified industrial
group. Mr Bob Faircloth is effectively number two to chief executive Mr Alan
Jackson. The shares retreated 12 to 284p in 12m turnover.
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield dropped 8 per cent on a gloomy statement about
disposal losses, the stock weakening 13 to 149p in very heavy trading volume
for H&amp;C of 12m shares.
Engineering shares with a heavy bias towards the US economy came in for
stern treatment, notably Siebe, which tumbled 16 to 554p, and TI Group, down
8 at 364p. Both companies get more than 40 per cent of turnover from North
America.
Food retailer Argyll Group was one of a handful of stocks that bucked the
poor market trend. The shares moved up 2 to 267p on an unconfirmed report
that BZW had advised investors to switch into the stock and out of J.
Sainsbury. Others simply attributed the rise to catching up after a period
of underperformance, ahead of next week's figures. Sainsbury shares
relinquished 5 at 406p.
Reports of a sell note on WH Smith left the shares 8 cheaper at 462p,
although Panmure Gordon was said to have advised investors to buy the stock
on weakness.
Shares in Granada Group resisted the market slide to close unchanged at 516p
after the group reported better than anticipated figures.
Full-year profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 265m and the dividend was
increased by 14 per cent. One analyst said: 'The profits are of course
wonderful but the cash generation policy is particularly impressive.' Many
brokers upgraded profit expectations.

FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline bounces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham recovered strongly as the company
announced a Pounds 920m (Dollars 1.45bn) disposal. The shares, down 12 at
one stage, ended a net 2 off at 421p, while the Units, which tend to reflect
US interest, finished marginally lower at 385p.
SmithKline is selling its global animal health business to Pfizer and,
although the move had been anticipated, it was only expected to realise one
to 1.5 times annual sales. In fact, it went for 2 1/2 times sales and is
expected to reduce the net debt to around Dollars 1.7bn.
Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs applauded the deal, saying: 'This clearly
demonstrates that management has kept to its promise to reduce debt through
disposals. In addition, the price looks very good.'

Dealers in Tate &amp; Lyle reported a badly handled selling order early in the
session which cast a shadow over the group's impressive full-year figures.
A block of around 600,000 shares was said to have done the damage, bringing
an early retreat in the stock. The shares closed 9 lower at 430p.
A further slide in the stock was prevented by euphoria at a 23 per cent
increase in full-year profits to Pounds 273.8m, which topped the most
optimistic forecasts and persuaded many analysts to upgrade profit
expectations.
Credit Lyonnais Laing increased its current year forecast by Pounds 25m to
Pounds 311m and the following year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 354m.
Reiterating their buy stance on the stock, analysts at the securities house
said: 'We believe the company will be able to report 10 per cent dividend
growth for the next three years while at the same time increasing dividend
cover.'
Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull raised his forecast by a more modest
Pounds 5m to Pounds 290m and advised investors to take profits as he expects
'slower earnings growth in the year to September 1995'.

FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hit by Wall Street's devastating overnight performance, stock index futures
had nowhere to hide and retreated rapidly from the outset in heavy two-way
trading, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the end of pit trading, the FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,025,
down 54 for a three-day drop of 115 points. It closed at a two-point
discount to the cash market and more than seven points below fair value.
For once the price action was fully reflected in levels of volume, with
contract numbers jumping to 19,932 - compared with 11,220 on Tuesday and
less than 7,000 on Monday - having been above 8,000 in the first two hours
of trading.
Activity was at times frantic, notably when the US market came in at 2.30pm
London time with further heavy losses. But traders said there was little
panic, citing the relatively unadventurous cash market discount which seldom
extended beyond two points throughout the session.
Wall Street continues to dictate immediate direction. If the December
contract falls through 3,000, the next support level is around 2,980. In
late screen-based trading it hit 3,015.
The volatility washed over into traded options, where volume powered ahead
to 80,982 lots, up from 35,852 on Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover
accounted for almost 50,000 contracts.

FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities stunned by latest Wall
Street sell-off - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market posted its fifth heaviest fall this year as the big
sell-off on Wall Street, which started on Monday, gathered pace, triggering
further sharp losses across world markets.
At the end of a trading session fraught with anxiety, the FT-SE 100 Index
closed a further 51.2 or 1.6 per cent lower at 3,027.5. Since the start of
the week the index has fallen 103.5 points or 3.3 per cent.
The weakness encompassed the second liners and smaller stocks, with the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index losing 56.5 or 1.6 per cent at 3,488.8. The market's
negative trend was reinforced by a massive derivatives operation - believed
to be the single largest in UK options - carried out by NatWest Securities.
The house bought more than 20,000 puts giving the right to sell the Footsie
at 2,800 in January.
Dealers commented that the trade probably did not represent the view that
the Footsie would fall to that level. It was seen as part of an arbitrage
possibly enabling the house to go short on the Footsie and buy into an
overseas market, possibly the Nikkei or the Dow. However, it still
represented a gloomy view of London's prospects.
The extent of Wall Street's weakness on Tuesday evening shocked analysts.
The 91-point drop in the Dow Average came in the wake of a 46-point slide on
Monday, leaving the Dow with a fall of above 3.6 per cent on the week to
date.
And there was more bad news for international markets, including London,
when the Dow slid more than 30 points shortly after the US market opened
yesterday.
Marketmakers in London were in no mood to absorb stock at the start of
trading, and dropped their opening prices to head off any large-scale
selling. The Footsie opened around 40 points lower and staged a brief rally
to the 3,042 mark. However, support quickly crumbled and the index was soon
back on the downward path as traders picked up the scent of another retreat
by Wall Street.
At its worst the FT-SE 100 was down 68.6, and the market was alive with wild
rumours that Wall Street was about to stage a fall of 1987 proportions. 'For
a while the market got very spooky indeed,' said a dealer.
Wall Street's opening, although weak, brought a measure of relief to the
market here, and shares stabilised and then edged up to close well above the
day's lows.
Trends in international bond markets gave a measure of support to equities.
US Treasury bonds responded to the success of the latest auction of
five-year bonds, German bunds rose sharply in the wake of better than
expected money supply news in Germany, and gilts made rapid progress.
Turnover reached 710.8m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 55
per cent of the total. Customer business was 'poor', with trading between
marketmakers, always anxious to avoid carrying large lines of stock on their
books in such volatile conditions, said to have been exceptionally heavy.
There was some comfort for the market with news that the strategy team at
UBS, one of the more bearish securities houses, has increased its mid-1995
FT-SE 100 target by 200 points to 3,200 and its end-1995 target by the same
amount to 3,400, after positive revisions to its UK economic forecasts.
UBS's Mr Bill Martin has raised his forecast of UK growth in GDP by 1/2
percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent, cut his inflation forecast by 1 1/4
percentage points to 3 1/2 per cent and, most importantly, cut his end-1995
forecast of UK base rates by 2 percentage points to 8 per cent.
Dealers are hoping for a period of calm in European markets, which they
expect to trade quietly during today's Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Wall
Street opens for a half day on Friday. 'We are not looking for many
fireworks until the Budget on Tuesday,' said one.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups early fall on
program buying
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices escaped the freefall some analysts had expected yesterday,
closing just slightly easier at the end of an extremely volatile day, writes
Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 3.36 off at 3,674.63. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.16 at 449.93, while the American SE composite
shed 3.74 to 432.40 and the Nasdaq composite was down 4.51 at 736.70. New
York SE volume was a very heavy 385m shares, in advance of today's
Thanksgiving holiday.
Program trading pushed stocks briefly into positive territory before they
retreated to end slightly down. Early in the afternoon, computer-driven
trades drove the Dow down nearly 40 points after a morning that saw the
index momentarily in positive territory at the opening bell.
The index was down for most of the morning, and even news that the Clinton
administration had won important support for the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade failed to boost shares. Senator Robert Dole, who had been
wavering in his support for the world trade package, which is viewed as
beneficial to businesses, said he would back the passage of the Gatt.
The bond market was a major beneficiary of the morning's drop in share
prices as the long bond yield fell below 8 per cent for the first time this
month and stayed there as bond trading closed for the day at 2pm before
today's holiday. It was one of the first times this year that stock and bond
markets had moved in opposite directions.
Some analysts believed that Tuesday's plunge in the Dow was simply the blue
chip index catching up with other indices that had fallen further.
Major cyclicals were mostly down. Aluminum Company of America lost Dollars 2
5/8 at Dollars 78, United Technologies Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 55 3/8 , Dow
Chemical Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 61 5/8 , Motorola Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars
55 3/4 and Hewlett Packard Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 95 5/8 .
Shares in interest rate-sensitive commercial banks posted increases:
Citicorp was up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 5/8 , NationsBank Dollars 1 7/8
at Dollars 45 5/8 , Chemical Banking Dollars 2 at Dollars 36 1/4 and Chase
Manhattan Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 3/8 . Major investment banks also gained:
JP Morgan rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 and Salomon Brothers Dollars
 7/8 to Dollars 37.
HJ Heinz fell initially after Nestle, the Swiss food group, announced that
it was not interested in purchasing the US food company, but by the close
Heinz was up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 1/2 .
Pfizer declined Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 1/2 after the pharmaceuticals
company announced that it would buy the animal health business of SmithKline
Beecham for Dollars 1.45bn in cash. SmithKline ADSs, traded on the NYSE,
dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 on the news.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo finished 2.3 per cent lower after light trade as
investors remained worried about the prospects for the banking sector.
Brokers said a sharp drop in the real against the US dollar had also made
the market nervous. The Bovespa index fell 1,018 to 43,930 in turnover of
RDollars 233.1m.
The central bank had liquidated four small financial institutions over the
previous 10 days, bringing the total to seven since the implement-ation of a
new currency on July 1.
Some small banks faced financial problems after recent central bank
measures, aimed at slowing consumption in Brazil, created a sharp liquidity
squeeze.
Analysts, however, said a measure taken by the central bank shortly after
the market closed aimed at helping small banks could provide underpinning at
the stock market opening today.
Smith Barney said yesterday that it had reduced its Latin American equity
portfolio weightings in Mexico and Argentina because both markets were
vulnerable to the rise in US interest rates.
The broker was raising its weighting in Brazil and Chile, since US interest
rate fluctuations had less influence over equity market movements in both
countries.
Canada
A late-session rally was seen in Toronto as it moved in unison with New
York, stock prices surging off lows for the day to end only slightly down in
moderate trading.
After days of losses, buyers rushed in late in the session to give support
to equity markets. Some analysts noted that a pre-US Thanksgiving rally is
not unusual as traders square away positions ahead of the US long weekend,
and strength in the US bond market helped.
The TSE 300 index, down 62 points at one stage, lost a net 9.55 points at
4,048.60 and declines led rises by 541 to 265 after volume of 60.6m shares.
The Canadian market got some support after the TSE 300 briefly breached the
4,000 barrier; Its 52-week low is 3,935.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by golds, conglomerates, metals
and oil stocks. Banking issues were firm, along with pipelines, industrial
products and utilities.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region tumbles in
response to US worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's overnight fall took a hefty toll of a region lacking the
influence of Tokyo, which was closed for the Japanese Thanksgiving holiday.
HONG KONG tumbled a further 4.2 per cent in reaction to US worries, the Hang
Seng index finishing 372.40 down at 8,576.03 after plunging to the day's low
of 8,379.88 in the opening minutes of trade.
Among the index heavyweights, HSBC fell HKDollars 2.75 or 3.1 per cent to
HKDollars 85.50 and Henderson Land shed HKDollars 2.30 or 5 per cent to
HKDollars 43.50.
Analysts noted that an auction of two plots of government land, which
produced results close to those predicted, failed to give the market
significant support.
Turnover amounted to a provisional HKDollars 5.9bn, compared with HKDollars
4.8bn on Tuesday.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell 19.48 or 1.6
per cent to 1,186.75.
SHANGHAI's B share index was down 4.3 per cent by the close, led by a
newcomer, Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development, and in line
with the sharp fall in Hong Kong. The index lost 3.04 at 67.63 in heavy
volume of 21.1m shares.
Shanghai Lujiazui, which made a strong debut on Tuesday, encountered heavy
overseas selling and weakened Dollars 0.072 or 8.8 per cent to Dollars 0.750
in volume of 17.3m shares.
BANGKOK's SET index hit a low of 1,303 before finishing 69.96 or 5 per cent
off at 1,332.85 in turnover of Bt13.7bn. The biggest falls were in banking,
down 5.5 per cent in Bt3.9bn of turnover, and finance, 6.8 per cent lower
with shares worth Bt2.7bn exchanged.
The mild recovery in the afternoon appeared to be encouraged by foreign
investors picking up cheap stocks in energy and petrochemicals, among other
sectors.
JAKARTA retreated 3.3 per cent as selective bargain hunting failed to halt a
broad sell-off, and the official index dropped 16.66 to 482.01.
Among the losers were Indosat and Gajah Tunggal, which fell almost 4 per
cent to Rp7,825 and 6 per cent to Rp3,100 respectively.
SINGAPORE picked up from its lows as some bargain hunting appeared among the
blue chips, but the Straits Times Industrial index still finished 52.24 or
2.3 per cent down at 2,217.81.
OCBC foreign dipped 90 cents to SDollars 14.60, Cycle and Carriage also 90
cents to SDollars 12.60 and Jurong Engineering SDollars 1.05 to SDollars
8.45.
KUALA LUMPUR followed a similar course, improving from early lows with the
emergence of bargain hunters. The composite index ended 24.38 off at
1,001.80 after a morning's low of 990.09. Volume increased to an estimated
170.9m shares from Tuesday's 105.4m.
SEOUL saw institutional selling of blue chips for the fifth straight day and
the composite index slipped 10.73 to 1,095.97. Brokers said tight liquidity
also hurt the market as banks were squeezed to meet their reserve
requirements from the central bank.
Samsung Electronics went limit down by Won3,000 to Won119,500, while Korea
Telecom lost Won12,000 to close limit down at Won559,000.
SYDNEY was well off its lows after bargain hunters gave shares a late lift.
The All Ordinaries index ended 20.6 or 1.1 per cent down at 1,857.1; but
this was 2.3 per cent better than its intraday low of 1,814.5 - the lowest
level for the All Ordinaries since July 28, 1993.
Dealers said the market was banking on a recovery on Wall Street. Banks were
the target of bargain hunters after ANZ reported a stronger than expected
final profit. ANZ gained a net 7 cents at ADollars 3.74 after an early fall
of 12 cents.
Base metal issues also made a spectacular recovery, with the diversified
mining groups CRA and Western Mining turning round early falls to close
modestly ahead. However, golds were the weakest stocks on the day in spite
of a higher gold price in New York.
TAIPEI combined textile industry fundamentals, the ruling party's 100th
anniversary today and speculation that the government might support equities
to achieve a good recovery. The weighted index, which hit a low of 6,241.66
at one stage, closed 26.21 up at 6,371.48. Turnover expanded from TDollars
30.89bn to TDollars 39.4bn.
The textiles sector index ended 3 per cent stronger on renewed expectations
of an industry recovery. Hualon, the most active stock in the sector, put on
TDollars 1.40 at TDollars 22.70, followed by Shinkong Synthetic Fibres,
which jumped by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 32.20, and Far
Eastern Textile, TDollars 1.70 ahead at TDollars 39.30.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Korea attracting attention from fund
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As one of the best performing Asian emerging markets so far this year, South
Korea has begun to attract attention from fund managers and strategists,
writes John Pitt.
Baring Securities suggests that the market is undervalued by almost any
standard. 'It trades at a 1994 price/cash flow multiple of 7.2 times,
compared with an average 14.4 times for the major Asian countries,' it says.
'Similarly, Korean shares are trading at a 1994 price/earnings multiple of
20.2 times, compared with an eight-year average of 25.4 times. By contrast,
the 1994 average price/earnings ratio for the major Asian countries is 27.2
times.'
What strategists find attractive about the country over the longer term is
the prospects for economic expansion when political reunification with North
Korea becomes a possibility. At present, trade with China is growing quickly
and, on the domestic agenda, rising industrial productivity, moderating wage
growth and diminishing labour disputes all point the way toward increasing
international competitiveness. Although the limit on the foreign ownership
of stocks is to be raised to 12 per cent from 10 per cent next month, and to
15 per cent during 1995, analysts expect the new limits to be reached
quickly.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses steady after painful
morning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses, trailing US equities, had a painful morning after Tuesday's Wall
Street plunge; but, in the afternoon, they seemed in no hurry to follow the
Dow's extended decline, writes Our Markets Staff.
Morgan Stanley's European strategist, Mr Richard Davidson, followed the lead
from his US colleagues and cut the weighting of equities in his European
mixed asset portfolio from 58 to 50 per cent. He moved the money into bonds,
reckoning that equities will underperform over the next two quarters; yet he
emphasised his house's longer term view that stock prices should outperform
over the course of the cycle.
FRANKFURT dropped 2 per cent on the session, the Dax index losing 41.46 at
2,033.31; however, it had recovered to 2,040.05 by the end of Ibis trading
for a 24-hour drop of 1.6 per cent.
Dealers said investors were seeking refuge in relatively high bond yields.
Turnover in German equities, reflecting the switch, moved up from DM5.5bn to
DM7.5bn.
Individual stocks still managed to respond to events. Deutsche Bank, a major
shareholder in, and creditor to Metallgesellschaft, dropped DM21.80 or
nearly 3 per cent to DM722.70 on the session after the troubled trader
unveiled capital reduction, and new share issue plans. Deutsche recovered to
DM727.50 after hours.
BASF and Bayer were relatively strong ahead of the chemicals results season,
down just DM1.20 to DM304 and DM1.10 to DM335.40 respectively. BMW led
carmakers down with a drop of DM26 to DM749 after a fall in October
registrations.
ZURICH was still preoccupied with developments at UBS, although the SMI
index fell 25.7 to 2,546.1, with the weakness of the dollar adding to its
more general concerns.
UBS bearers shed SFr34 or 2.9 per cent to SFr1,125 after a low of SFr1,115,
with the bank again said to be a large seller. The registered gave up SFr16
to SFr252, further reducing to 12.0 per cent their premium over the bearers.
The premium, which stood at 34.4 per cent when battle lines were drawn with
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision on September 29, had shrunk to 15.6 per cent by
Tuesday, when shareholders voted to support the board's proposal for a
single class of equity capital.
Nestle eased SFr9 to SFr1,196, its 10-month figures proving in line with
expectations, although forecasts for volume growth during 1995 helped the
shares up from a low of SFr1,181.
Holderbank gave up a further SFr15 to SFr1,015, still awaiting the outcome
of the European Commission's five-year investigation into alleged illegal
market-sharing agreements between some of Europe's biggest cement companies.
PARIS managed to recover some of its early losses, helped by some
institutional short-covering on the last day of the account. The CAC-40
index shed 18.32 or 1 per cent to 1,893.09, after a session's low of 1,872.
Turnover was FFr4bn.
Societe Generale went against the trend with a rise of FFr3 to FFr601.
However, it had its rating reduced yesterday by Merrill Lynch, which said
that the stock was now fully valued after a strong performance over the last
three months. According to Merrill, the stock had outperformed the market by
12 per cent in that period.
Alcatel Alsthom was another stock to rise, by FFr4.60 to FFr419.60, as some
bargain hunters emerged. The shares hit a year's low of FFr411 earlier in
the week as the head of a subsidiary was detained over allegations that
France Telecom had been overcharged for equipment supplied.
MILAN's Comit index fell 11.63 or 1.8 per cent to 623.64 as investors
worried that the anti-corruption magistrates' investigation of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, risked the parliamentary passage of the
budget, and threatened its deficit-cutting measures.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said, however, that political
developments were unlikely to halt the country's economic recovery. The
market was not yet cheap enough to be an irresistible buy, and the
likelihood of further political upsets meant it was likely to become cheaper
in the weeks ahead. Mr Cornish viewed further weakness as an opportunity for
selec-tive buying.
AMSTERDAM dragged itself back from an AEX index session low of 399.46,
closing 4.40 down at 402.00.
Akzo Nobel fell Fl 4.00 to Fl 193.50; it said it planned an investment of
SKr575m in two Swedish factories.
In the finance sector, ING slipped 40 cents to Fl 78.20. There were domestic
media reports that the group intended to shed approximately 1,500 employees,
which could result in savings of some Fl 735m. ING is expected to show an
improvement in its third-quarter earnings today.
Fokker announced job cuts of 160 at its special products division, due to
falling sales, and the shares dropped 2.7 per cent to Fl 14.50.
MADRID, once again, registered a lower than average decline, the general
index clawing back around half of its early loss to end 2.65 or 0.9 per cent
off at 299.72 in turnover of nearly Pta27bn.
Pryca climbed back from an early decline of nearly 4 per cent to finish
Pta55 or 2.5 per cent down at Pta2,130. Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel
said there had been stories in the Spanish press about limitation of opening
hours for supermarket groups.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar takes its lead from firmer US
treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday took its lead from the firmer US treasury market, to
finish higher on the day, writes Philip Gawith.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped below 8 per cent for the
first time in five weeks, and this set the tone for the dollar, rather than
the continued weakness in equity markets.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5537, from DM1.5536, and at Y98.335
from Y98.075. In New York it finished at DM1.5565 and Y98.455.
Short-term interest rate futures were also beneficiaries of the weaker
equity markets, investors assuming that this diminished the need for higher
interest rates. The March 1995 short sterling contract ended at 93.09, up
from 92.98.
The Italian lira stabilised following losses after it was announced that Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, would be investigated in connection
with corruption charges. The lira finished at L1,034 per D-Mark from L1,033.
Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index closing at 79.9 from
79.8.
Analysts have likened the behaviour of markets this week to the 1987 crash,
albeit on a smaller scale. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in
London, noted that in the two weeks after the 1987 crash, the bond market
rose by 10 points, while most G7 short-term rates were cut.
These moves were prompted by fears of systemic risk in the banking system,
and poss-ible damage to consumer con-fidence and corporate investment.
This time round, though, while the fall in equity markets did not compare
with 1987, 'the thought processes and price action have been similar', said
Mr Parsons. Referring to the firmer short sterling prices, he said markets
regarded falling equity prices as an effective monetary tightening, in the
same way that declining bond prices earlier in the year amounted to a
monetary tightening.
'The pace of rate rises is going to be nothing like the pace which the
market is currently discounting,' said Mr Parsons. He added that it made
little sense that the UK yield curve was steeper than the Italian yield
curve.
The spread between March and September 95 short sterling contracts was 105
basis points, compared to a 98 basis-point spread for the equivalent
Eurolira contracts.
Traders said that turnover in the dollar had been quite brisk, in spite of
markets winding down ahead of today's US Thanksgiving holiday.
Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank, said this time round the dollar was
benefiting from its link with the bond market. For much of the year,
weakness in the US bond market has been a factor in dragging the currency
down.
He said the fact that the dollar tracked bonds, rather than equities, was
probably a reflection of capital flows; foreign investors have larger
holdings of bonds than equities in the US.
Mr Burke added that the dollar appeared to be fairly well supported, given
the way it had reacted to what had been a potentially serious blow to
sentiment. He cited this as further evidence that the dollar was on a
recovery path.
Mr Michael Gallagher, director of IDEA in London, said nervous equity
markets were ambiguous for the dollar. On the one hand, foreign divestment
from US equities, and the feeling that the next tightening of Fed policy
would be delayed, were negative for the dollar.
On the other hand, tumbling world stock markets could prompt US mutual funds
to repatriate some of their offshore investments. This would help the
dollar.
Analysts said the stability in the lira probably reflected the fact that the
market is already pricing in a lot of bad news, including Mr Berlusconi's
possible resignation. Mr Gallagher said a survey of clients showed that most
felt the lira would not slip below L1,045-50 should he resign as prime
minister.
Elsewhere in Europe, the focus today shifts to the Bundesbank council
meeting. Mr Gallagher said a lower than expected October M3 money supply
figure had renewed speculation that the Bundesbank 'might give us an early
Christmas present (in the form of lower interest rates)'.
Overnight money traded between 2 per cent and 5 1/4 per cent as the Bank of
England cleared a Pounds 600m day's shortage in UK money markets.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian coal tender result
worrying for steel producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel producers have been given a sharp reminder of the state of the coking
coal market with the results of a tender by the Steel Authority of India.
Not only has it been undersubscribed - there simply is not enough coal
available - but prices are up to Dollars 10.50 higher than the current level
of the Japanese steel mills' contracts of Dollars 45.45 a tonne, free on
board Australia and Canada.
The tender result comes just as coking coal suppliers are gathering in Tokyo
at the start of negotiations of prices for deliveries in 1995-96. Although
the steel mills have offered roll-over prices, the debate will be over not
whether there will be a price rise but the extent of that rise.
The Indian tender saw just 1.5m tonnes offered against a request for 2m for
1995 supply. A further 450,000 tonnes was bid but breached the stringent
World Bank conditions for qualifying bidders. The result has put the mill in
an extreme quandary. Not only are the prices high - the lowest Australian
bid is Dollars 7.50 higher than the Japanese price - but the option to offer
more tonnage in exchange for coal producers being flexible on price levels
is not available this year: there simply is no coal available.
Steel producers in Asia and Europe are bracing themselves for higher price
levels - particularly in Europe where fob prices are between Dollars 2.50
(for Australian supplies) and Dollars 6 (for Canadian) lower than for
similar coals sold in Japan.
As the Indian tender demonstrates, the anxieties are not limited to prices;
supplies are extremely short. While this has caused great inconvenience in
1994, with steel production recovering from the slump of the previous two
years, in 1995, when even higher steel output is expected, the shortage
could become critical. Although some slight expansion of output is possible
in Queensland and Canada, it is thought that this will not compensate for
reductions in US availability.
If these were not problems enough, there has been a major derailment of a
coal train in Queensland, halting the flow of steam and coking coal to the
coal ports of Hay Point and Dairymple Bay.
Although the line is expected to be fully operational within a week, this
disruption will be felt immediately. Coming hard on the heels of two
derailments of the South Africa coal export line to Richards Bay and of
severe flooding of the pits in Colombia's Guajira region, the Queensland
mishap has reinforced the view that the 1994 coal market is jinxed.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices plunge on
Brazilian stocks surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices tumbled yesterday as hedge funds baled out of the market
leaving the January futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange
Dollars 265 a tonne lower at Dollars 2,870 a tonne.
The sharp fall in prices takes the market back to its level at the end of
June before the second Brazilian frost sent it over Dollars 3,000 a tonne.
Analysts interpreting technical signals from price charts said the market
could rapidly slip to Dollars 2,620 a tonne, the next support point, and
after that, to Dollars 2,480 a tonne. If prices break through these supports
they will return to levels in place before Brazil's first frost damaged
coffee trees leading to supply fears.
The downturn was sparked by the news that Brazilian coffee stocks were 15m
bags (60kg each), higher than traders expected. But the influential hedge
funds have taken a very negative view of the coffee market in recent weeks,
fuelling the price decline.
Roasting companies, which have seen purchases fall in the shops, have their
needs well covered and are not rushing to buy as the market drops.
'There is a significant battle between producers and consumers over which
way prices go,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers.
'The market is awash with coffee now, but it will be tight again next year.'
Prices on the London Metal Exchange finished lower but trading was not
particularly hectic, writes Kenneth Gooding. Traders said copper led the way
down and pulled other metals with it.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, said the metal
markets were overdue for a more substantial downward 'correction' but it was
too early to say whether the falls seen this week were the start of this
process. Prices could fall substantially before the year-end if the
investment funds decided to lock in their profits, he said.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP sweeteners proposed for
central Europeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday proposed short-term action to redress the
imbalance in agricultural trade between the European Union and the former
socialist countries of central and eastern Europe.
The proposals are intended as sweeteners to the central Europeans ahead of
the difficult debate on reform of the common agricultural policy. Without
further CAP reform, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the
front-runners, have little chance of realising their goal of EU membership
by the turn of the century.
The commission plans to adapt the EU association agreements with the central
Europeans to take account of the Gatt Uruguay Round, which will
substantially cut the volume of subsidised food exports.
The proposals - which must be approved by ministers from the member states -
include:
Reduction of all customs duties by 80 per cent where preferential access to
the EU market has been provided by tariff quotas.
Acceleration of concessions already granted in the association agreements,
so they can begin in July 1, 1995.
An increase in tariff quotas by 10 per cent per year for five years.
More flexibility for the central Europeans to take advantage of tariff
quotas. This would mean regrouping individual tariff quotas for a sector
into one global quota.
The commission is also promising to conclude agreements with the associated
EU members - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania - on sanitary and plant health matters. The aim is to prevent a
recurrence of the row over selective import controls on animal exports last
year.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia mobilises for fight
against deforestation - A look at initiatives aimed at saving the world's
second biggest forested area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, seemingly endless forests
cover the landscape, creating the impression of an infinite resource. It is
difficult to picture this vast, rugged, sparsely populated region stripped
of most of its trees.
Yet the World Bank warns that harvests from Indonesia's tropical forests,
the world's largest after Brazil's, are running about 50 per cent higher
than the estimated sustainable cut.
Indonesia's minister of forestry, Mr Djamaludin Suryohadikusomo, has set in
motion a plan to deal with the problems of deforestation, the first
Indonesian minister to take such action.
In September he introduced a restructuring of government regulations on
forestry management, promising to crack down on logging companies that fail
to manage their concessions responsibly. The regulations are aimed at
loggers who cut trees outside their concession areas, illegally convert
logged forest land to agriculture or fail to replant.
Mr Djamaludin admitted there were only 113m ha of natural forest cover left
in Indonesia, as opposed to earlier claims of 141m ha.
The minister announced that as the current 20-year logging concessions
expired, forest areas would be converted into a new type of management unit,
operating on a long-term basis and having an average size of 100,000 ha. 'If
someone is managing a forest area, as opposed to just having a licence to
sell the stock in a concession area, then there is a far greater incentive
to protect it,' commented a Jakarta-based forestry consultant.
The current duration of concessions does not encourage replanting of trees
that will take about 70 years to mature.
Supporters of the new system argue that it will encourage loggers to make
inventories of tree stocks, providing the data needed to maintain a constant
growing stock and facilitating sustainable development of the resource.
Not everyone is convinced, however. It could take 25 years to implement the
system and at current rates of deforestation, Indonesia's forests do not
have that much time left. It would be far more effective, argue some
consultants, to create an independent policing system to ensure government
regulations were observed.
The Institute of Eco-labelling, set up by Indonesia's former minister of
environment Mr Emil Salim, could take on this task. But progress has been
thwarted by arguments between pressure groups, consultants and officials,
who cannot agree on how the institute should be managed or what its purpose
should be.
The idea initially was to label forest products from a sustainable forest
resource as 'environmentally sound', with manufacturers subscribing to the
system voluntarily. The problem is that most Indonesian timber products are
exported to Taiwan, Japan and Korea, where environmental concerns have low
priority.
This has convinced some that eco-labelling needs to be compulsory. An
independent inspection team publishing its reports would ensure public
accountability and a degree of transparency in the forestry sector that has
not existed to date.
The punishment of offenders would be left to the Ministry of Forestry.
There is no doubt that Mr Djamaludin's team has powers to deal with
offending loggers. Recently, the ministry took over 49 per cent of the
shares in two concessions supplying timber giant PT Barito Pacific Timber,
as punishment for irresponsible forest management. It was an unprecedented
move that tackled one of the most powerful forces in the forestry sector and
was designed to send warning signals to other concession holders.
The question is whether Mr Djamaludin has the political clout to deal
effectively with illegal and irresponsible logging. Indonesia's forestry
sector is politically powerful and Mr Djamaludin's crackdown on offenders
has been irregular and arbitrary as a result.
The forest products sector is run almost single-handedly by timber merchant
Mr Bob Hasan, who is close to the presidential family. There are five
different forestry associations, all headed by Mr Hasan.
The most significant, Apkindo, the association of plywood producers, is
often regarded as a major culprit in accelerated deforestation. It operates
as a cartel, setting prices for plywood below international levels, ensuring
that Indonesian manufacturers keep the lion's share of the world market.
Indonesia earned Dollars 4.5bn from exports of forest-based products last
year, of which 75 per cent was from plywood.
The association decides who gets an export licence, where a manufacturer
will export to and at what price.
Apkindo's political clout has been sufficient to ensure that concessions to
manufacturers are cheap. Royalties on logs average about Dollars 22 a cubic
metre, compared with between Dollars 60 to Dollars 80 in other parts of the
world. 'This creates a cavalier attitude towards the resource,' said a
forestry consultant.
In an effort to slow down the rate of deforestation, Mr Djamaludin announced
that the total annual allowable cut would be lowered to 22m cu m from 33m.
It is a bold move, but does not address another cause of accelerated
deforestation in Indonesia - illegal logging.
Mr Indro Tjahjono, a co-ordinator at Skephi, an Indonesian pressure group
working for forest preservation, says 40 to 60 per cent of all logging is
illegal. Other estimates put the demand for illegal logs at around 60m cu m
a year.
The scale of illegal logging underlines the urgent need for effective
policing.
Ms Emmy Hafild, of the environmental pressure group Walhi, points out that
about half of the Ministry of Forestry's employees work in Jakarta. 'They're
in the wrong place,' she says. 'They should be out in the field guarding the
forest.'

Italian ballet students are being helped to aspire to the achievements of
compatriots Carla Fracci and Alessandra Ferri. Thanks to Turin's Fondazione
Sanpaolo, Milan's La Scala ballet school will be leaving its cramped and
inadequate facilities for new buildings at the end of next year. Work has
just started on a L5bn project in central Milan.
Assistance for La Scala's ballet school adds a new dimension to the
benefaction undertaken by the Fondazione Sanpaolo di Torino per la Cultura,
la Scienza e l'Arte. Since being established in 1985, it has financed the
L12bn restructuring of Turin's Egyptian Museum, and also the restoration of
the San Fruttuoso abbey, at Camogli near Genoa, and of the Superga basilica,
Juvarra's baroque masterpiece overlooking Turin.
Milan's Brera gallery, churches in Turin and Rome, and the Turin RAI
orchestra are also among the beneficiaries to which funds have been
channelled.
Gianni Zandano, Sanpaolo's chairman, explained: 'The Fondazione allows us to
operate on two fronts - first, the restoration and, in the best sense,
exploitation of our cultural heritage; and second, the promotion of
scientific research, paying particular attention to the environment. Both
areas of intervention directly concern the quality of life in society today.
. .
'The establishment of the Istituto San Paolo, in 1563, arose from
participation in the life and problems of society, the bank's predecessors
being a charitable body, the Compagnia per il Soccorso dei Poveri, and the
Monte di Pieta' whose aim was to combat usury,' Mr Zanadano said, adding
that the bank had never fallen short on social commitment.
The Fondazione is funded by Compagnia di San Paolo, which also funds the
charitable organisations Ufficio Pio and Educatorio Duchessa Isabella. In
1992 and 1993, they spent L17bn on welfare activities, essentially in
assisting people at society's margins. The poor, drug addicts, alcoholics
and the handicapped are among those benefiting.
Compagnia di San Paolo is the foundation established when the Istituto
Bancario San Paolo di Torino spun off its banking activities in 1991. It
owns the Sanpaolo Bank Holding, a joint stock corporation owning 76 per cent
of the San Paolo Bank that was floated in March 1992 and is listed in Milan,
Turin and London. The foundation obtains its income from dividends from its
shareholding in the bank.
San Paolo, Italy's biggest banking group, is not alone in having ties to a
cultural and charitable foundation. During the past three years, other
public sector banks, including Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia and the
savings banks (casse di risparmio), have settled on similar ownership
structures in which foundations have control. Indeed, Banco di Napoli led
the way, being the first to transform itself from a combined foundation and
bank into a foundation with a separate bank corporation.
In doing so, Banco di Napoli made use of the Amato Law, the starting point
for the shake-up that has been re-shaping the public-sector part of Italy's
banking system. Passed in July 1990, the law aimed to create the conditions
for rationalisation and concentration by offering fiscal incentives. It was
also an early, tentative step to encourage bank privatisations.
Formerly denominated as public law credit institutions, Turin's Sanpaolo and
Banco di Napoli both now enjoy stock market quotation. They are leading
examples of Amato Law transformations. Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie
Lombarde (the Milan savings bank Cariplo), which ranks fourth on assets and
leads in terms of Tier 1 capital, is another.
Cariplo was transformed in December 1991, the foundation spinning off its
banking operations into the Cariplo SpA joint stock corporation. Since then,
it has been engaged in a campaign of acquisitions of shareholdings in other
savings banks, either directly or indirectly through sub-holdings.
It has controlling interests in the savings banks of Puglia, Citta' di
Castello, Viterbo, and Calabria and Lucania. Significant minority
shareholdings give Cariplo a place in 11 other savings banks in central and
northern Italy.
While Cariplo has been casting its eyes over the savings banks and
exercising its financial muscle and skills of persuasion to draw some of the
many small and medium-sized casse into its orbit, Banca di Roma (controlled
by the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma) and the Turin's Banca CRT have been doing
the same.
There has been large scope for rationalisation in a category, nearly
80-strong, where most members operate on a provincial scale and where the
average network has less than 70 branches. Some have allied themselves in
holdings, a solution adopted by groups of savings banks in Emilia Romagna
and Tuscany. Projects for other alliances and for mergers will lead to
further concentration among savings banks, a category with nearly 30 per
cent of the banking system's deposits.
'The situation is fluid,' said Pier Giulio Cottini, general manager of ACRI,
the Italian savings banks' association. He noted that the use of holding
companies has the advantage of giving a voice to the small participating
banks. 'It provides a way of maintaining the savings banks' local ties,'
explained Mr Cottini.
Change and fluidity characterise the savings banks' banking operations.
Uncertainty is a feature of their controlling foundations. This was made
clear at the annual meeting of the Italian banking association ABI in June.
Treasury minister Lamberto Dini said that most foundations were pursuing
vague objectives, and had an unsatisfactory spread of unco-ordinated and
non-homogeneous interests.
Mr Dini, whose ministry oversees the foundations while the banking
activities are supervised by the Bank of Italy, reminded the foundations
that many need to revise their statutes. The law foresees that they should
undertake works of public utility in the areas of education, scientific
research, art and health. Mr Dini wants feasible, detailed programmes. The
treasury minister considers that the foundations should co-ordinate their
activities, and even merge.
He may appoint a commissioner if he considers that a foundation is not being
correctly administered. The treasury also has the powers to give general or
specific indications on how foundations should invest. Mr Dini said that
there must be diversification away from banks. A controlling public
shareholding is no longer a requirement. Moreover, foundations that sell
their bank shares will not incur capital gains tax.
Privatisation is not an issue. Indeed the real risk seems to be
nationalisation. The assets of the savings banks' foundations, which Mr
Cottini estimates at L30,000bn, make them an attractive target for
cash-strapped public bodies.
With this kind of money under management, even though annual dividend income
is probably a modest L300bn to L500bn, membership of the boards of the
savings banks' foundations' offers appetising opportunities for patronage.
At present, there is no statutory requirement for independent audit, nor for
the publication of annual accounts. Mr Dini could give a boost to
transparency, and put the boot into bad old practices, by opening up the
foundations to public scrutiny.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (8): Life offices hope
for new business from pensions - The insurers: casualties are possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news is proving to be good business for Italy's insurance sector, with
factors ranging the funding crisis of the country's state pensions system to
the war in Bosnia helping to raise profitability.
However, with European-wide liberalisation and the increasing incursion of
banks into the sector, competition is increasing sharply; and, despite the
upturn, the industry could see some casualties in the next few years.
Italy's life assurance chiefs hope that the state's difficulties in
continuing to fund pension provision will mean that more Italians will turn
to them for savings plans and pension policies. Already growth has been
rapid, increasing by between 10 and 15 per cent over the past five years,
following even quicker growth in the early 1980s.
Even though spending per head on premiums has doubled since 1988, the
industry remains underdeveloped by European standards. Per capita premiums
of only Dollars 161 in 1991, an amount equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP,
compared with 1.1 per cent for Spain and 7 per cent in the UK.
Recent growth has been underpinned by rapid expansion of the bancassurance
phenomenon, with most of the country's biggest companies forming links with
banks, and a number of banks themselves forming their own life assurance
subsidiaries. Banks now sell some 30 per cent of new life premiums, and are
expected to increase that share to 50 per cent by the end of the century.
In the non-life sector, the turmoil in the former Yugoslavia is one of
several reasons why claims costs are falling. Military action is acting as a
deterrent to car thieves who previously drove stolen Italian cars across
that territory to the east. The epidemic of car theft which hit Italian
insurers hard in the early 1990s has shifted to Germany and France as a
result of the war.
'The war in Yugoslavia has closed the main door for car theft,' says Mr Pier
Giorgio Bedogni, a senior executive with SAI, the country's fourth largest
company and a leader in the motor business. The improvement also reflects a
general economic slowdown, which has led drivers to make fewer journeys, and
a decline in the number of motorists driving leased cars.
Mr Bedogni says that the war campaign against Mafia-inspired violence has
helped to reduce crime, especially in some southern cities where there is a
military presence on the streets. The fall in claims costs is contributing
to a steady improvement in non-life market underwriting results after a
period of poor performance across the market at the end of the 1980s.
In addition, although Italian companies have only recently been completely
freed from government restrictions, premium rates have risen over the past
two years. Mr Bedogni says that, following rises in the non-compulsory
classes, which cover damage to the car itself, Italian motor premiums are
now among the most expensive in Europe. Further improvement seems likely.
Rate increases averaging 10 per cent have been introduced across the motor
market this summer, following the approval of the European Union's third
non-life directive. Hitherto, rates in the compulsory third-party motor
liability market - which generates an estimated 45 per cent of non-life
premiums - had been subject to government control.
Although this should all be good news for the industry as a whole, there is
general agreement that competition is intensifying and that many smaller
companies, among the 300 or so which populate the market, may be unable to
retain their independence.
In the life sector, in particular, traditionally high margins - up to three
times those achieved by more efficient French and British companies - are
under severe pressure. Typically, Italian life insurers have distributed
only 70 to 80 per cent of life fund investment returns to policyholders,
retaining up to 30 per cent as profits.
Life insurers elsewhere in Europe typically retain only 10 per cent.
Companies dependent on agents or financial advisers for their sales could
come under especially severe pressure, since banks are able to sell policies
with significantly lower overheads.
The privatisation of the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (INA), the
former government-owned company which was partially privatised this year,
should be completely in private hands by the spring of next year - a sale
which will, at least indirectly, spur competition.
In the past, existing Italian companies have been obliged to cede 10 per
cent of premiums - and new entrants 30 per cent of premiums - to INA.
In the non-life market, there are signs that Italian insurers are beginning
to make more use of technology in the way they assess risks, a development
which should favour those companies big enough to make the necessary capital
investment. For example, although differences in rates have traditionally
depended on the power of the car and where it is based, some companies are
now taking into account the risk factors associated with the driver, varying
charges according to age, sex and occupation.
Significantly, Generali, the country's largest company, has launched a pilot
direct-writing operation, selling motor insurance directly to the public by
telephone along lines pioneered by companies such as Direct Line in the UK.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (7): Deutsche Bank
builds on purchase of BAI - Foreign banks: a look at the contrasting
fortunes of retail and commercial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There could hardly be a greater contrast between the activities of foreign
investment banks and foreign retail and commercial banks on the Italian
market.
While investment banks and securities firms are building up their Italian
activities or turning what was a mere foothold on the peninsula into a base
camp for further expansion, their commercial counterparts have mostly
retreated, badly bruised.
Lloyds, of the UK, and First Chicago and Wells Fargo, of the US, have all
been and gone from the Italian commercial banking sector. Citibank sold its
Naples-based chain of banks to Banco Ambrosiano Veneto. Credit Lyonnais is
said to be seeking a buyer for its investment in Credito Bergamasco in
northern Italy, while others - Credit Agricole and Banque Nationale de
Paris, National Westminster of the UK, and Creditanstalt of Austria, for
example - maintain only minority stakes in Italian partners.
Only Deutsche Bank has made an out-and-out operational success of an Italian
commercial banking investment. It has built on its purchase of Banca
d'America e d'Italia (BAI) from Bank of America in 1986. A year ago, it
bought Banca Popolare di Lecco, a regional bank based near Lake Como, and
now has some 300 branches in Italy and 4,200 employees. Underlining its
success, the bank has just changed the name of the old BAI network to
Deutsche Bank, a brave move in a country which, 50 years on, is still
sensitive to anything that implies German occupation.
Mr Gianni Testoni, Deutsche Bank's chief executive in Italy, puts the
success down to the German parent's capacity to 'think globally, and act
locally' and work 'prudently, gradually and continuously' - but he still
admits that the bank is the exception that proves the rule.
For foreign investment banks and securities houses, the market is a little
more crowded, and is likely to become even more so. For example, Finanziaria
Indosuez, part of Banque Indosuez of France, is beefing up its Italian
securities trading and research operation; while Salomon Brothers' New York
headquarters took a decision in June to expand its presence from a tiny
representative office to a full bond-dealing operation with a staff of nine
or 10.
This is comparatively small beer, compared with the activities of some of
the longer-established operators. JP Morgan, which has been in Italy for
some 25 years, has more than 300 employees in the country, while Morgan
Stanley has registered itself as an Italian bank in its push to win even
more Italian business.
The main reason why foreign securities houses have increased their profile
in Italy in the past four years is the internationalisation of the Italian
government bond market, the largest in the world after the US and Japan.
This year the Italian government has introduced a new category of bond
dealer - the 'superprimary' dealer - to encourage the screen-based second
market in government securities. Such dealers are entitled to greater
privileges on the market (for example, a right to participate in
supplementary bond issues) than ordinary dealers or primary dealers, but
have to take up a greater proportion of issues and trading volume over the
year. The title may also appeal to the vanity of anglo-saxon firms, three of
which - JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America - are among the 12
authorised superprimary dealers, while others are believed to be considering
an application.
For these banks, the Italian market has enough potential to justify a little
local bureaucratic inconvenience, one of the elements which has hampered the
growth of foreign companies in the commercial and retail banking sector.
For example, UK merchant banks attacked the Italian law which restricts
direct access to the market to locally registered securities houses, called
Sims, claiming it was against EU rules. But most have still opted to
establish a Sim, or buy into an existing firm, rather than wait for the
European Commission or Court of Justice to rule on the case. Schroders, for
example, is poised to receive a Sim licence, and by the end of the year
should have 15 corporate finance professionals and 25 securities traders
working mainly out of its Milan office.
'At the end of the day, it's probably going to take you almost as long and
cost you more to fight the Sims law,' admits one foreign banker.
However, many UK and US firms still maintain important operations, including
equity-research and corporate-finance activities, in London, sending
professionals over to Italy when necessary. Goldman Sachs, for example, has
a comparatively small office in Milan, and Mr Claudio Costamagna, who heads
the Italian investment banking operation, says the fragmentation of the
market makes it almost as easy to work out of London as out of Milan, when
it comes to visiting clients. He adds: 'By being in London, being exposed to
the rest of the international business community you can bring something to
the client that you wouldn't otherwise bring.'
Whether based in Italy or overseas, most foreign firms are after a share of
corporate finance business in Italy. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank,
has a firm hold over corporate finance for the largest Italian companies,
but the foreigners believe they can capture a share of international M&amp;A
business, and carve a niche in advice for medium-sized local companies
looking to expand, float on the stock market, or take over competitors.
They are also front-runners in the competition to advise on Italy's large
privatisation programme, which was launched two years ago.
This has led to much hand-wringing in the Italian press about the dearth of
Italian investment banks. Over the summer, there were even veiled threats
from some more extreme members of the new right-wing Italian government that
respected firms like Morgan Stanley might be cut out of government business
if they continued to put their names to unfavourable research about the
Italian economy. Happily for foreign firms, these appear to be isolated
incidents - indeed, Morgan Stanley has just won the mandate to advise the
government on next year's sale of shares in Stet, the telecoms holding
company. However, there is certainly increased political pressure to nurture
small Italian investment banks, which suggests that domestic competition
could hot up over the next few years. That is a trend generally welcomed by
foreign bankers.
'The culture of the domestic participants in the market has become much more
international,' says Mr Hendrik van Riel, managing director of JP Morgan in
Milan. 'Anybody can have a view about whether that could have happened
faster, but it certainly has, and it's never slowed down. I'm convinced it
will continue.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (9): Carrot-and-stick
from the state - Managed funds: small investors are becoming more interested
in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy may be the land of the small company, but it is not yet the land of
the small shareholder.
Although household savings amounted to nearly 19 per cent of disposal income
in Italy last year - a higher proportion than in the US, Japan, Germany,
France and the UK - less than 4 per cent of those household financial assets
are invested directly in equities. Moreover, only 9.7 per cent of the
average household's financial assets are entrusted to institutional
investors, such as fund managers.
According to the stock exchange authorities, however, the situation is
changing, and ordinary investors are beginning to increase their direct or
indirect holdings in equities.
There are two important reasons for this metamorphosis. One is
privatisation, and the other is the growth of managed investment funds and
pension funds.
The initial sales in the government's privatisation programme were made
directly to private companies; but at the end of last year, the decision was
taken to begin a series of public offers of shares in Italy's three
state-controlled banks, Credito Italiano (Credit), Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI), and IMI, which were already quoted on the stock market, and
the insurer Ina, 100 per cent owned by the treasury. The declared intention
was to stimulate the stock market, and, as in the UK and other European
countries, encourage wider share ownership.
All the offers so far have been oversubscribed, but although that meant the
privatisations were a success from the Italian government's point of view,
certain more ambitious advocates of shareholder democracy have been
disappointed by the outcome. In particular, they argue that, in spite of
restrictions on share ownership, the two big retail banks - Credit and BCI -
are now 'controlled' by big corporate allies of Mediobanca, the Milan
merchant bank which has for five decades represented Italy's biggest
corporate and financial interests.
To counter such accusations, the government has introduced new rules, used
for the first time in the privatisation of Ina in June, which allow for a
list-voting mechanism at shareholder assemblies. In the case of Ina, that
meant three of the 13 seats on the board were reserved for nominees of
minority shareholders.
In practice, this has failed to satisfy some of the smallest shareholders,
who found it difficult to reach the threshold for nominating a list of
directors, and claimed that there had been little attempt by the company,
the treasury and their advisers to implement the principles of shareholder
democracy. 'We wanted to underline the importance of this particular
assembly in the context of Italian privatisation, which has been a corporate
governance nightmare until now,' said Mr Paul Dionne, of Milan-based PVD
Advisories, one of the only corporate governance specialists in Italy.
Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, outgoing chairman of Ina, was particularly critical of
the way in which small shareholders had been treated. 'I'm sorry that the
majority, though very active in supporting its own initiatives, hasn't given
space to representatives of small shareholders: we'll obviously need time if
Ina is to live up to the pluralism of the new company statutes,' he said, at
the Ina shareholder meeting earlier this month. In the event, the three
minority nominees were elected from the list proposed by Imigest, the fund
management arm of IMI, indicating another path towards shareholder
democracy: the growth of investment and pension funds.
This process is likely to stimulated by the carrot-and-stick approach of the
Italian government. It is cutting back on state pension benefits to avoid
the collapse of the state system, thus forcing ordinary Italians to consider
more innovative methods of retirement provision. On the other hand, it is
contemplating the introduction of incentives for the establishment of
pension funds.
All participants in the sector are preparing for the growth of this area.
For example, IMI, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, and the INPS state pension
institute, are collaborating to offer advice on setting up and managing
funds, while insurance companies are also readying themselves to offer more
life insurance products.
Whether this will prompt a revolution in the management of quoted Italian
companies depends on the freedom given to fund management groups, many of
which are directly owned by the same big quoted groups, which might resent
any attempt to rock the boat.
That said, there is already some evidence that fund managers are changing
from a passive to an active role in Italian corporate life. Earlier this
year, for example, a group of funds warned Sheraton, the US hotels
subsidiary of ITT, that they would be particularly vigilant about how the US
company exercised its control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group in
which the funds have a minority stake.
However, as Mr Pallesi's comments indicate, creeping change of this sort may
not be quick enough for the impatient pioneers of Italian shareholder
democracy.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (5): More sell-offs
expected next year - The stock exchange: on-screen trading has proved
broadly reliable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems to have been a good year for the Italian stock exchange, if not for
the Italian stock market.
The Comit index of leading Italian stocks stands at roughly the same level
as at the beginning of the year. Equities began a tiring climb up to new
highs in March, fuelled by optimism about the new government, only to come
tumbling down during the summer and autumn because of uncertainty about the
cohesion and resolve of the same administration.
Mr Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Milan-based Italian stock exchange
council, is philosophical about the fluctuation of the market: 'In the first
six months of the year, the Italian market was the star of Europe  - it rose
to unthinkable levels, due mainly to the activity of foreign operators. In
the second half, they realised good gains and are waiting to come back when
the conditions are right.'
Mr Ventura's principal concern is to ensure that when that moment arrives,
foreign and Italian investors are not deterred from trading on the Italian
equity market because of technical or bureaucratic deficiencies, illiquidity
or a lack of suitable products. In that respect, he is convinced that Milan
has made progress this year.
Milan moved to full on-screen trading in April, adding to its computerised
system the few stocks still traded on the floor of the exchange by open
outcry. The borsa was unlucky in that the switch coincided with one of the
busiest periods in the exchange's history - at the height of optimism about
the new government's prospects - and the 'little bang' was postponed for 24
hours as special measures were put in place to relieve pressure on the
system.
Since then, the system has proved broadly reliable, although there was a
hiccup early last month when a technical hitch blacked out computer trading
just after the country's justice minister had announced his resignation,
interrupting a sharp fall in the value of equities. After an investigation,
the exchange authorities declared themselves broadly satisfied that the
cause was a technical fault and not sabotage, but small investors have
called for a judicial inquiry.
A five-day rolling settlement system, to replace the monthly account trading
system, is also being phased in, but Mr Ventura says it could be 'a few
months' yet before full cash settlement is introduced for all stocks.
As far as liquidity is concerned, market operators and stock exchange
authorities alike are optimistic about the impact which trading in new
equity derivatives should have on the underlying equity market. The first
futures contract on the revamped MIB 30 index of heavily traded stocks
should begin trading next week and once the market is under way, the
exchange is expecting to add an option on the index and, in the first half
of next year, options on single shares.
Liquidity has also improved as a result of the privatisation programme
launched in 1992. In the past 12 months, the government has turned from
private sales to public offers, injecting more shares into the market in the
case of the banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano and IMI,
which were already quoted, and listing shares in Ina, the insurer, for the
first time.
Under the new government, partly because of inexperience, the privatisation
programme has slowed, and concern has been expressed about the appetite of
the Italian public for further large sell-offs. Nevertheless, within the
next 12 months, the state should sell more of its shares in Stet, the
telecoms holding company which is one of Italy's biggest companies by market
capitalisation, and bring to market Enel, the electricity company, and all
or part of Eni, the chemicals and energy conglomerate.
At the same time, the government has introduced new rules to protect
minority shareholders and bring taxation on share investment into line with
other forms of investment, such as bonds, which have traditionally occupied
more space in the ordinary household savings portfolio. The stock exchange
itself has responded to small investors' demands by introducing a regulated
system for the trading of small quantities of shares, which fall below the
threshold for on-screen trading.
Privatisation has not been the only stimulus for the market. The overall
amount of new capital raised during 1994 had already reached nearly
L11,500bn in mid-September, much of that from opportunistic rights issues
during the first half of the year. That compares with L16,192bn for the
whole of 1993 and only L3,027bn and L4,854bn in 1992 and 1991 respectively.
The difficulty for the Italian authorities is persuading some of Italy's
small and medium-sized companies, the real motor of the Italian economy, to
finance future growth with equity issues, rather than with bank debt.
Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of Akros Finanziaria, an expanding
Italian financial-services company, says many family-owned companies are
reluctant to seek a listing on the stock exchange. 'The advantage of being
quoted isn't absolutely evident for those companies which generate enough
cash-flow to develop the business adequately,' he points out.
As director of a company involved in the development of investment and
pension funds, Mr Roveraro believes more entrepreneurs might be persuaded to
take part in the market if the number of such funds increased, and it became
obvious that there was an appetite for new equity. To help this process, the
Berlusconi government is already preparing regulatory changes to encourage
the launching of private pension funds.
At the same time, the stock exchange, securities houses, banks,
industrialists and chambers of commerce are making plans for the
establishment of a second market, for small and medium-sized companies.
Sceptics are worried that such a market would experience the same
difficulties as equivalents in France and the UK, but advocates point to the
success of Nasdaq in the US as a reason for pushing ahead with the plan.
However, even the backers of the Italian second market agree that this will
be a difficult task, requiring the co-ordination of investors,
intermediaries, regulators and the companies themselves. 'The potential is
there, but it could still be a very difficult market,' admits Mr Ventura.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (6): Anxiety over
fiscal deficit - Bonds' difficult year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Italy's government bonds markets have experienced a rough ride
this year, with a combination of international economic trends and local
political uncertainty hitting prices.
As one of Europe's 'high yielders', Italian government bonds were hard hit
by the general retreat of international investors from bond markets in
general and high-yield markets in particular, in the wake of the increase in
short term US interest rates in February.
In addition doubts have grown about the ability of the government of Mr
Silvio Berlusconi to tackle Italy's high fiscal deficit and its heavy debt
burden. The delay in the publication of the government's financial programme
in July contributed to initial scepticism.
The increase in short-term interest rates from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent in
August followed pressure on bonds and on the lira. Investors have
subsequently become concerned that the proposals to reduce the fiscal
deficit contained in the 1995 budget, currently before parliament, are
insufficiently radical and that political tensions may interfere with budget
discussions.
'The budget relies excessively on one-off measures, thereby postponing more
significant action for subsequent years,' says Mr Jose Alzola, analyst with
Salomon Brothers.
Bond yields have risen steadily, both in absolute terms and relative to
paper issued by Germany. The yield spread of the Italian 10-year bond - the
BTP - over the 10 year Bund fell gradually through 1993 and early 1994,
dropping from a high of 671 basis points in April last year to 255 basis
points in May this year. Since then, however, spreads have widened, with the
spread in the 425 to 475 basis points range during October and November.
There are some grounds to suggest these fears are overdone. Reductions in
inflation has at least partially reflected the success of measures to
introduce flexibility to the labour market. especially he abolition of the
scala mobile wage indexation mechanism in 1993.
The economy is growing: GDP is forecast to increase by 3 per cent in 1995,
following an expected 2.2 per cent rise in 1994.
Italy has made good progress over the past four years in improving the
efficiency and professionalism of its debt markets, and - not withstanding
this year's setbacks - it has made some progress both in making its markets
more attractive to foreign investors and in increasing the maturities of its
public debt, thereby reducing its vulnerability to shifts in market
sentiment and changes in short term interest rates.
Traditionally, the bulk of Italy's debt has been short term, and much of it
has been in the hands of Italian families. Since most of these bought their
bonds directly, rather than through intermediaries, and tend to hold them
until maturity, the debt is also relatively illiquid.
During 1992 and 1993, Italy began to extend the maturity of its debt,
shifting funding away from short-term bills towards fixed-rate medium and
long-term debt. The average maturity of the debt has increased from two
years and 11 months at the end of 1992, to three years and two months at the
end of 1993, up to three years and five months in February this year;
although, since then, maturities have shortened.
Stamp duty on bonds was abolished early in 1994, and the system whereby
withholding tax was reimbursed to foreign investors improved. Auctions for
medium and long term bonds have been streamlined and the time taken to
settle trades has been reduced. In addition, a new two-tier system of market
making has been established, with a number of investment banks asked to play
a more active role in the debt market by becoming super primary dealers.
Super primary dealers - so far there are three, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America - must trade in at least 3 per cent of new issues and
secondary market in all classes of debt paper, and account for at least 1
per cent of trades in each separate class of paper. In addition, they must
meet higher minimum capital requirements.
Foreign investors bought heavily during 1992 and 1993, increasing their
holdings of lira-denominated from 4 per cent of overall debt in 1990 to
nearly 15 per cent in 1993, although that figure has since fallen back to
well below 10 per cent of the total.
The ratio between debt and GDP, which is expected to reach 128.5 per cent in
1995, is high and remains a source of concern for the markets, which fear it
will increase government pressure on a limited pool of savings and force up
interest rates.
However, Italy's ability to tap the international capital markets could
reduce possible upward pressure on interest rates.
Mr Vittorio Grilli, head of the treasury's debt management and privatisation
department, says that the aim of the government's eurobond programme is
modest. It 'is a window on the world . . . designed to help increase the
foreign component of domestic debt.'
Italy completed a Dollars 11.6bn euromarket borrowing programme for 1994 in
mid-November, when it finalised a Y450bn euroyen issue.
However, the fact remains that the government still has room for manoeuvre.
Even after the recent issue foreign currency debt is still estimated by
analysts at well under 8 per cent of the total debt.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (3): Rolo fights to
keep its roots - Profile of Credito Romagnolo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional bank with powerful roots in the local community has persisted
in Italy long after it has waned or disappeared elsewhere in Europe.
But this phenomenon could well be about to change as the banking system
begins to concentrate. In this process of concentration all eyes are on the
fate of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the highly profitable Bologna-based bank
which is rooted in the rich Emilia Romagna region of north-central Italy.
The bank dates back to 1896 when it was founded as Piccolo Credito
Romagnolo. Over the course of nearly a century, it has become a local
institution, symbolising the region's tradition of hard work and thrift.
These deep roots are also reflected in the 28,842 small shareholders who
possess 22 per cent of the stock.
'Our shares are passed down from generation to generation,' says Mr Emilio
Ottlenghi, the chairman. 'Sometimes they are sold at marriage to buy a
house; but then they are bought back with subsequent earnings.'
But as Mr Ottolenghi talks, in the bank's magnificent board room decorated
with frescoes by the three Caracci brothers - the great 16th century Bologna
artists - there is a sense of apprehension. Such solid traditions are at
risk.
At the end of October, Rolo became the object of a hostile bid by the
recently privatised Credito Italiano, offering L2,010bn for 48.2 per cent of
the shares. In response, Rolo revived and enlarged plans to merge with its
long-standing local rival - Caer, the holding for the Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna (Carisbo).
If Credito's bid is successful, this would create Italy's largest private
banking empire. Alternatively if it fails and the Rolo-Caer merger
succeeds,perhaps with the help of a big white knight,it would create the
10th largest banking group.
The battle is going to be hard-fought, and one suspects it will be full of
surprises given the untried and often ambiguous nature of Italy's 1992
take-over laws. Rolo's main arguments against being absorbed by Credito are
quite simple. The bank recognises the Credito deal may benefit a few
individual shareholders, but it will be detrimental to the bank's operating
efficiency, eliminate its local identity and prevent Rolo's own healthy
'organic' expansion.
The bank argues that its profit base would become obscured and would be used
to bolster a large, flabby organisation. The bank also claims that the
absorption by Credito would lead to the loss of of over 1,000 jobs among the
6,200 Rolo employees. The question of Emilia Romagna losing its 'local' bank
to Milan, combined with the question of potential job losses, are clearly
the most political aspects of the bid.
Rolo, with total assets of L31,154bn, is currently controlled by a core of
shareholders put together since 1988 by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti
chairman, in the wake of a tough four-year struggle against a rival group
led by Fiat and the Agnelli family. Mr De Benedetti controls just under 5
per cent, while the biggest single shareholder is France's BNP with 6.3 per
cent.
In the month-long run-up to the bid launched on October 26, Rolo shares
moved from just below L11,500 a share to over L13,700, in part reflecting
Credito's accumulation of a 2 per cent stake. Bourse gossip had it that
Credito was talking to at least one large Rolo shareholder, offering up to
L18,000 a share prior to the announcement of the take-over.
The bank's statutes impose a 10 per cent ceiling on individual shareholdings
 -precisely in order to preserve the diffused nature of share ownership.
Persuading Rolo shareholders to change this norm represents a big hurdle. It
will need to be overcome this statutory block in the case of the merger as
well. The merger is on the basis of 1.31 nominal L1,000 Rolo shares for one
nominal L10,000 share of Caer. Caer, controlled by a foundation with 93 per
cent of the capital, would then possess 30 per cent of the new entity's
stock.
The two local banks will also have to explain more clearly why they should
have revived so hurriedly a merger project which had been dropped only a
month previously after more than a year of discussions, and which had the
blessing of the Bank of Italy. Rolo executives insist the merger had merely
been shelved - not dropped - since the structure of the deal was
unsatisfactory. Only a limited range of services was included in the
original merger, and the subsidiaries of both institutions were excluded.
Now, the new merger plan is comprehensive and covers every aspect of both
groups. Rolo counters Credito's claim that the merged bank offers limited
growth prospects operating in a saturated area. Executives say the
activities of Rolo and Carisbo, the main savings bank arm of Caer, are
remarkably complementary. Rolo is involved in retail banking and has a
fast-growing client portfolio management business: Carisbo, on the other
hand, has a strong presence among local authorities and does more term
lending.
Ironically, it was the failure of the original Rolo-Carisbo marriage that
suddenly made Rolo an attractive take-over target. Until that time it looked
as though the merger would be an effective barrier against raiders, allowing
the two to consolidate in Emilia Romagna and fan out from there, building on
Rolo's successful four year-old venture into the economically vibrant
Friuli-Veneto region through Banco di Friuli.
In the battle ahead, both Credito and Rolo face many unseen obstacles. Not
least of these is the legal position of the takeover in relation to the
Rolo-Caer merger. Which of the two options for instance takes precedence?
Should the takeover be allowed first to run its course? The takeover was
announced first, but it was not formally initiated until after the merger
was agreed.
