FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (2): Analysts stress
the ratios that matter - Andrew Hill examines the banks' efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian banks are usually ranked according to their total assets or equity,
a list in which the laurels are always taken by the biggest credit
institutions.
These are the so-called banks of national interest, like Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Credito Italiano; the six former 'public law credit
institutions', like Istituto San Paolo di Torino and Monte dei Paschi di
Siena; and the largest savings banks (casse di risparmio), such as Cariplo
and the Banca di Roma grouping.
The spate of recent merger and takeover proposals has, however, reminded
Italy that, wherever its banks stand in the national ranking and whatever
the outcome of the current bid battles, its credit institutions still have a
comparatively lowly place in world rankings. The question is whether this
lack of bulk matters, and whether a rush to consolidate might distract banks
from the more important aim of improving internal efficiency.
Many bankers and banking analysts are now looking at other criteria to judge
Italy's biggest financial houses. They suggest the banking sector should be
paying more attention to its efficiency ratios - the relationship between
profit and assets, for example, or, quite simply, the net profit figure.
Attempts to assess the relative efficiency of Italian banks in this way
produce a quite different ranking. For example, Credito Romagnolo (Rolo),
preparing to fight off a bid from Credito Italiano (Credit), has made great
play of a list of Italy's top 20 banks, which sets 1993 gross operating
profit against assets, and ranks Rolo as the fifth most profitable bank, and
Credit only 13th.
Similarly, Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, which seems to have successfully blocked
attempts at a takeover, ranks seventh, while its erstwhile suitor, Banca
Commerciale Italiana (BCI), comes in 11th. All such rankings can be
misleading if one-off elements are not taken into account, of course. If one
compares gross profit, for example, the level of provisions - an important
element in judging banks' accounts - is not included. But if, for example,
only net profit is judged, then the distorting effect of tax charges can
blur the ranking.
In any case, both BCI and Credit have fought back against the implication
that they may be less efficient or profitable than Rolo and Ambroveneto.
They point out that all four banks are efficient institutions relative to
the sector overall, and that during the recession both Rolo and Ambroveneto
have been working in slightly easier markets (respectively, the prosperous
areas of Emilia Romagna and the Veneto) than their suitors. Credit's
supporters argue, moreover, that Rolo lacks the international presence of
the larger bank, which would ease the way for Emilia Romagna's many
exporters.
Looking at the whole European banking sector, Mr William Vincent, European
banking analyst with Schroder Securities, says that the banks which stand
the best chance of succeeding are not necessarily the biggest, but those
with a definite niche in the market.
That sounds positive for Italy's myriad smaller banks, particularly as they
have the closest links to the small and medium-sized companies which are the
backbone of the Italian economy. On the other hand, as Mr Vincent himself
points out, it is the same small companies which have suffered most in the
recession, and as a result many of Italy's smaller banks have been hit by
heavy provisions against bad loans.
Mr Luigi Coccioli, deputy chairman of the Italian banking association (ABI),
sees both sides of the problem. He is also chairman of Banco di Napoli, one
of Italy's biggest and oldest banks. But Banconapoli's customers also
include a large proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises, based in
the south of Italy, which has been particularly hard-hit by recession. The
bank had to announce a heavy first-half loss this year, and suffered the
indignity of having its credit rating downgraded by Moody's because of
'deteriorating asset quality'.
Mr Coccioli still defends the ability of a larger bank to provide a better
service than its smaller competitors, however - especially for expanding
companies: 'The local cassa di risparmio can certainly take care of a small
textile company in its home town, but if that company wants to export its
products to Guatemala or Kuala Lumpur, the small cassa is unable to
guarantee all the paraphernalia of bills of lading, export credits and so
on.' He is adamant, however, that enthusiasm for expansion must be matched
by a desire to confront the difficult challenges of rationalisation and
improving efficiency.
In this, Italy's biggest banking groups need to learn from their past
mistakes. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, for example, erred when it indulged in
what one observer close to the bank describes as an 'imperial' phase during
the 1980s. New subsidiaries were started up, the Rome head office expanded,
and international branches were added without paying enough attention to the
quality of staff recruited overseas. The phase culminated in the
embarrassing scandal of unauthorised loans to Iraq made by the group's
Atlanta branch. Now, under new management, BNL is amalgamating its
subsidiaries into the group structure, and will concentrate on efficiency
improvements to consolidate its position as the third or fourth largest
Italian institution.
In the same way, IMI, the diversified financial services group which until
the recent reforms was one of Italy's few medium-term lending institutions,
tried to expand internationally in the 1980s, but had to rein in its
ambitions when it realised that to achieve its aim of becoming a global
operator at that time would have been, in the words of one banker, 'very
expensive and very risky'.
The risks of domestic expansion are less obvious, and all bankers talk of
the need to reduce the number of banks in Italy from over 1,000 to nearer
the 200 or so which analysts believe the market can support.
But, as Mr Coccioli of ABI points out, there is still a heavy cost to
rationalisation. To realise efficiencies, management must take on powerful
banking unions, backed by rigid labour agreements; local politicians, who
identify the regional bank with the future prosperity and identity of their
constituency; and the technological challenge of linking up different
computer systems.
As one analyst puts it: 'You can see the advantages for Italy and Italians
of consolidation - a greater range of financial products, and so on - but
it's far harder for the banks themselves to see the benefits.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (4): Scars that will
not heal easily - A look at the rift between the government and the central
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always on the cards that the Bank of Italy would enjoy an uneasy
relationship with the inexperienced right-wing coalition headed by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi.
Yet no one foresaw the degree to which the central bank and the government
have fallen out. On occasions, the two have scarcely been on speaking terms
as the bank has fought a rearguard action to protect its autonomy - an
almost unprecedented situation in a G-7 country. Even if now both sides are
making a determined effort to establish a proper working relationship, the
scars left by these scraps will not heal easily.
The bank will also continue to find itself in a difficult position regarding
monetary policy and interest rates, where it risks being on the opposite
side of the fence. The government wants interest rates to go down to lower
the cost of servicing Italy's huge debt stock and so keep the 1995 budget
deficit projections on course. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister,
believes once the 1995 budget is approved by parliament, then interest rates
should go down. The bank, on the other hand, is far more cautious.
On the other hand, Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, has repeatedly said his
priority is to protect the currency and ensure that inflation does not
return as the domestic recovery strengthens. This led him to raise the
discount rate in mid-August by half a percentage point to 7.5 percent, and
he has warned that he will not hesitate to do so again if the circumstances
require.
Indeed, in the bank's latest quarterly bulletin, it politely told the
government that the 1995 budget projections for the cost of debt service
were too low and the deficit consequently greater. The bulletin also doubted
the feasibility of achieving a 2.5 per cent annualised inflation target next
year.
The problematic relationship began from the very start of the new
administration in May, when Mr Dini was recruited to the treasury from being
the bank's director-general - the number-two job in the bank's four-man
executive directorate. As treasury minister, he immediately became the
single most important government figure determining economic and financial
policy.
The Bank of Italy has always enjoyed a good and close relationship with the
treasury, with the central bank often supplying the latter's best
technicians. However, in this case matters were clouded by personal
sentiment. By seniority, Mr Dini had been the natural candidate to become
governor when, the previous year, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was called from
near retirement to become prime minister. However, on that occasion Mr Dini
was passed over in favour of Mr Fazio, then the number three in rank in the
directorate.
The friction resulting from this promotion complicated the choice of a
successor to Mr Dini. The members of the four-man directorate at the bank
are chosen by the institution's governing council (composed of the chairman
of the Bank of Italy's regional offices), and the appointment is then
approved by the cabinet and the head of state.
Traditionally this has been a consensual process between the various actors.
But the Berlusconi government was heavy-handed in trying to influence the
choice of candidates - imposing a veto on Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the
senior of the two deputy directors, because he was considered too close to
Mr Ciampi. Instead the right-wing coalition insisted on an outsider, which
the bank resisted.
As a result, the stand-off lasted from June until mid-October when the bank
named Mr Vincenzo Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors, as a
compromise candidate. Even then the government demurred in accepting the
outcome, and delayed approval for almost three weeks to make its displeasure
plain.
No one has emerged unscathed from this affair. By waiting so long to name a
Dini successor, the bank appeared undecided and therefore subject to
political pressure. The bank's governing council also found itself in the
embarrassing position of choosing Mr Desario, whose career in the bank has
been essentially confined to supervision of the banking system, over a more
experienced and internationally recognised central banker, Mr Padoa
Schioppa.
As further evidence of sensitivities, the bank decided not to name a
successor to Mr Desario in the directorate until the latter's appointment
had been digested. The government still wants a say in who takes his job,
and thus it may not go to the next in line within the bank.
The coalition's desire to interfere in the activities of the central bank
has dragged the institution into the political arena in a way not seen 1979
over the affairs of Banco Ambrosiano and the late banker Roberto Calvi.
Members of the coalition have gratuitously attacked Mr Ciampi for his role
as honorary governor, arguing that it is unacceptable that, having been
prime minister, he should be allowed to retain this position with an office
available at the bank. It is is nevertheless bank tradition that former
governors have this honorary role.
The bank has also been criticised for the way it continues to exclude
politicians from the invitation to attend the governor's annual message on
the economy on the occasion of the annual meeting at the end of May.
Coalition members argue the governor's message is often 'political' and that
therefore it is undiplomatic to exclude the politicians.
What is more important, members of the coalition have been muttering darkly
of the need to re-examine the central bank's statutes. The aim of this would
be to regulate the governor's currently unlimited tenure to a fixed term.
Another suggestion, vigorously rejected by the bank, is that its supervision
functions be hived off.
With the banking system now undergoing radical transformation in the wake of
privatisation, the supervision side of the bank acquires heightened
significance. For instance, the bank now finds itself in a highly visible
role as arbiter of the merits of a hostile take-over by Credito Italiano of
Credito Romagnolo. With many competing banking - plus political and
socio-economic - considerations at stake, the last thing the bank needs in
these circumstances is a tense relationship with the government.
Perhaps the final casualty of the row over Mr Dini's replacement has been
rational discussion of the future role of the bank, 100 years old last year.
It is the one Italian institution to have preserved its dignity and respect
during the past two years of tumultuous political change. Nevertheless, as
the banking system is privatised and the state retreats from its dominant
role in the economy, it is an opportune moment to reassess the size and
precise function of the central bank. Unfortunately, tempers are too heated
and the bank has been placed too much on the defensive for a proper
discussion.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (1): Waiting for a
puff of white smoke - The authorities prefer that evolution of the sector be
left to the market, but many bankers would welcome a philosophical vision of
the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago, shortly after being named a cardinal, the archbishop of
Ravenna chose to comment on the strictly secular topic of takeovers in the
Italian banking sector.
Italian newspapers reported that Cardinal Ersilio Tonini and his counterpart
in nearby Bologna had come out in support of the local bank, Credito
Romagnolo, which was preparing to fight off a hostile bid from Milan-based
Credito Italiano.
The archiepiscopal intervention prompted some indignant muttering on the
part of Credito Italiano's advisers, but it should have surprised nobody.
Indeed, it probably helps explain why it has so far taken more than mere
legislative reform to restructure the country's overcrowded banking sector.
For one thing, the event illustrated how deep the regional roots of some of
Italy's 1,037 credit institutions go, and how difficult it could be to
untangle them. For another, it drew attention to the atmosphere of papal
intrigue in which the Italian banking shake-up is being carried out.
Technically, the Bank of Italy - responsible for banking supervision - has
limited legal power to impede bids and mergers in the banking sector, except
in certain circumstances, such as failure to observe competition rules, or
an increased risk of insolvency. Indeed, as Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the
central bank's deputy director-general, told a conference last week: 'It is
not up to the supervisory authority to choose the best operation, nor to
carry out a particular plan or direct the outcome on the market.'
Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's treasury minister and former director-general at
the central bank, has also publicly stated that the treasury will leave the
outcome of the banking shake-up to the market.
But many senior Italian bankers believe that the central bank must have a
philosophy and a vision of the future of the Italian banking sector, and
should be exercising 'moral suasion' - or, as one banker puts it, 'nods and
winks, like the Bank of England' - to ensure that the myriad institutions
under its control move towards that vision.
Meanwhile, within the private sector, Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank
which has built a network of unparalleled influence over Italy's largest
financial and industrial companies, is said to be pulling strings to realise
its own vision of Italian banking. Most outside observers believe that both
the Credito Italiano approach to Credito Romagnolo, and the almost
simultaneous move on Banco Ambrosiano Veneto by Banca Commerciale Italiana,
were inspired by Mediobanca. The bank itself, as always, has not commented.
The idea that anyone should covertly tamper with the free market is anathema
to many in the new generation of Italian investment bankers, weaned on
Anglo-Saxon attitudes to banking and market supervision. But the evolution
of the Italian financial sector has produced a unique creature, which may
require special treatment.
The list of more than 1,000 Italian banks is the heritage of decades of
restrictive rules, which protected financial institutions from competition
by banks from outside their designated territory or sector of activity. With
the 1990 Amato Law - named after the Socialist treasury minister, Mr
Giuliano Amato, later prime minister - the Italian government put the final
element of banking reform in place, giving public banks the chance to change
their identity from foundations, trusts and associations into joint stock
corporations, and float off part of their banking operations.
Reform was also supposed to set off a spate of mergers and takeovers in the
sector. Italy's second biggest savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio di Roma,
quickly bought 65 per cent of Banco di Roma, in October 1990, to form Banca
di Roma. Other casse di risparmio allied with Cariplo, the Milan-based bank
which claims to be the world's largest savings bank. But compared with
expectations at the time, there have been few attempts to consolidate, and
even the largest Italian banks remain small by US, Japanese or British
standards.
However, within the past 12 months, the sale by IRI, the state holding
company, of the rest of its shares in Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale
Italiana has triggered off what could be a second wave of bids and mergers.
Italian banks are comparatively well-capitalised. But this only adds to the
concern that fear of being overtaken in the national league of big banks
will fuel indiscriminate bingeing by nervous financial institutions. The
result would be to exchange a range of medium-sized, comparatively lean
banks for an uninspiring collection of flabby giants.
'I don't believe the Italian banking system can afford to concentrate just
on size,' says Professor Mario Sarcinelli, chairman of Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, 54 per cent of which is still owned by the treasury. 'The problem of
the Italian banking system is profitability and efficiency, it's not size,
or just size.'
The past two years have exposed this weakness. In 1993, for example, banks'
net profits were hit by heavy provisions and tax charges, in spite of an
overall 28 per cent increase in operating profit at the largest Italian
banks which account for most of Italian banking turnover. Half-year results
for this year suggest that the situation will be worse in 1994. Banks' loan
portfolios are still in the shadow of recession, even as industrial
companies emerge into a more prosperous period; and the increase in interest
rates has hit revenue from securities trading, which was particularly strong
in 1993.
Productivity is improving, according to the Italian banking association
(ABI), and staff numbers are dropping, but there is still a long way to go,
and the banks are hampered by rigid labour rules, fiercely defended by trade
unions, which have staged a series of one-day strikes. Negotiations between
management and unions were completed earlier this month, with workers
offering some concessions on longer opening hours, and there are indications
that a jobs-for-life mentality is beginning to disappear. But, as one senior
Italian bank executive points out: 'The average employee takes it for
granted that we have a situation in which there can be no firing or
labour-shedding in the Italian banking system. This is clearly wrong.'
The reform of the system has helped Italy to increase the number of branches
across the country from only 6,000 in 1990 to 22,100, leading to concerns
that the network may now be saturated. Now the problem, according to ABI, is
that, whereas there is a surplus of branches in some areas (for example,
Tuscany, dominated by the ancient Siena-based bank, Monte dei Paschi), in
other areas, particularly the poorer south of the country, there is a lack.
'The main towns are certainly overbranched,' warns Mr Luigi Coccioli, ABI
deputy chairman and chairman of Banco di Napoli, one of the south's biggest
banks.
In that respect, the consolidation of northern banks is a worrying
development, because it could deprive southern customers of the efficient,
stable and customer-friendly banking system which should emerge in the more
competitive north, increasing the attraction of usury - which is still
widespread in Italy - and other dubious financial services.
Hence the attempts of the Bank of Italy and treasury to encourage further
modernisation of the system, and, in particular, the increased
'privatisation' of the banking branches controlled by the many charitable
foundations across Italy.
'The high proportion of banking activity which, from an ownership point of
view, is still in public-sector hands shows that the likely route to
privatisation for the banks is still long, and the foundations will be the
ones to complete it,' Mr Padoa Schioppa said last week.
Clearly, observers will have to wait a while before a puff of white smoke
from the Bank of Italy indicates that the new Italian banking sector has
been fully installed.

<TEXT>
The stock market slide on Wall Street on Tuesday prompted money managers to
shift assets into higher-yielding securities, a shift reflected in rising
volume in the interest rate pits of Chicago's futures exchanges.
Globex, the after-hours computer trading system owned by Reuters and
operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Paris's Matif, logged record
business starting at 2.30pm local time on Tuesday, shortly after the CME's
eurodollar futures pit closed.
By the time the electronic trading session ended early on Wednesday morning,
turnover had hit 24,365 contracts, by far Globex's best night.
'People moved in to buy eurodollars as the stock market fell,' said the CME.
Of Globex's total turnover overnight, 20,681 contracts were eurodollar
futures. The Chicago Board of Trade's electronic after-market trading
system, Project A, logged a record 11,000 contracts, mostly 30-year US
Treasury bond futures, during the two hours it was open on Tuesday.
Tuesday night's volume surge also boosted the daytime volumes in Chicago
futures trading. Trading that day pushed the CBoT's cumulative volume for
the year above 200.6m contracts, a record for any exchange.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Issuers choose defensive instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Issuers on the eurobond market turned yesterday to defensive instruments in
the face of volatility in government bond markets.
Issuance was mainly in dollars and investors showed demand for floating-rate
notes and short-dated paper.
'The rally in US Treasury prices is likely to bring sellers to the market
and put upward pressure on secondary market spreads,' said one trader.
Another dealer said: 'Spreads on lower-quality debt have already begun to
widen and this could have a knock-on effect with investors switching out of
eurobonds and into Treasuries in a flight to quality.'
Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy's fifth-largest bank, launched a Dollars
200m offering of five-year floating-rate notes with a coupon of 18.75 basis
points over three-month Libor.
Demand for the notes came from investors in Hong Kong and France, and from
Japanese investment funds in London and Asia.
Citicorp launched a DM250m issue of five-year FRNs offering a coupon of 25
basis points over three-month Libor.
At the short end of the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation
launched a Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield six basis
points over US government bonds and offering a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the deal was targeted mainly at retail
investors and that most of the bonds were sold across Europe but with
limited interest from domestic German investors.
In another deal targeted at retail investors, ABB International Finance
launched a Dollars 200m offering of bonds due January 1997, priced to yield
20 basis points over US government bonds and offering a coupon of 7.5 per
cent. 'The two-year area of the dollar sector is where European investors
want to be,' said one trader.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Competition steps up in loans
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frogmore Estates, the UK property company, yesterday announced the
successful syndication of a Pounds 150m loan arranged by Barclays.
As with another deal signed this week - a DM65m medium term loan facility
for Pohjolan Voima (PVO), the Finnish power company - the terms provide
further evidence of increasing competition in the loans market, where
margins have fallen sharply during the past 12 months.
The Frogmore loan was priced at 60 basis points over the London Interbank
Offered Rate (Libor), for the unsecured revolving credit facility, compared
with about 100 basis points when the company last came to market in June
1982.
The money will be used to refinance an Pounds 80m revolving credit facility
maturing in June 1996 and for general corporate purposes. Originally
launched at Pounds 120m to relationship banks and a small group of
international lenders, the loan was increased to Pounds 150m.
Mr Gavin Rody, of Barclays, said it had been easier to win support for the
deal in the market than in 1992. 'Two years ago the market was tough. This
time it has been more comfortable,' he explained.
Chemical Bank arranged the four-year loan facility for PVO, designed to
refinance a DM65m facility signed in August 1993.
PVO will pay 35 basis points over Libor, compared with 95 basis points for
the earlier deal, which was also arranged by Chemical Bank.
Banks participating in the PVO deal alongside Chemical, are all Japanese.
They are Fuji Bank, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking Corporation, and Yamaichi Bank (UK).
PVO was assigned a AA rating by the Japanese Credit Rating Agency in
October.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: S G Warburg senior debt is
rated A2 by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service said it had assigned a rating of A2 to the
long-term senior debt guaranteed by investment bank SG Warburg Group, the
first debt rating it has given for the group.
According to Moody's, the rating reflects the group's leading franchises in
the UK and international equities markets, as well as its conservative
financial structure.
However, the rating also reflects expectations that Warburg's competitive
position will be increasingly challenged by other, much larger investment
banks, especially in its overseas markets.
Moody's said that it expected competition for business to be particularly
intense in developing markets, and the size of Warburg's much larger US
competitors would give them powerful advantages.
According to Moody's, 'a second challenge is for Warburg to decide on the
appropriate volume and risk limits of its securities trading'. The agency
noted the volatility which trading on its own capital base has introduced
into earnings.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post strong gains as sentiment
swings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US Treasury prices posted impressive gains on the heels of a weakening
equities market as investors switched from stocks to bonds in search of
higher yields.
At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 94
29/32 , yielding 7.942 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 27/32 , yielding 7.165 per cent. The
market closed at 2pm local time for the Thanksgiving holiday and will remain
closed all day today.
After another sharp fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday and
losses in European and Asian equity markets, the long-bond yield fell below
8 per cent for the first time this month.
Mr Joseph Liro, chief economist at SG Warburg, warned, however, that there
is no guarantee yields will remain this low.
'If the equity market stabilises in the next week, bond yields will go right
back through 8 per cent like a hot knife through butter,' he said. For the
moment, he added, bond market investors have both eyes on the equities
market. For nearly all of this year the stock market has taken its lead from
the bond market.
Late Monday afternoon, as share prices tumbled, however, the two markets
moved apart as bonds benefited from the same fears of rising interest rates
that hit equities.
Mr Liro attributed most bond market gains to speculation rather than the
much-talked-about asset reallocation, because most of the buying seemed to
be in long bonds, which are normally not havens for investors worried about
rising short-term interest rates. Some traders, though, reported signs of
buying in the 10-year sector of the market.
Markets hardly took notice of new economic data. The Commerce Department
reported that durable goods orders declined 1.5 per cent in October from
September. Analysts had expected an increase of about 0.1 per cent. Much of
the decline, however, came from a drop in car and aircraft orders. Excluding
transport, orders increased 1.1 per cent.
A drop in aircraft and car and truck orders caused transportation equipment
orders to decline 9.4 per cent.
European government bond markets took their tone from the US yesterday, with
stronger sentiment leading to rises in both German and UK government bonds.
One analyst said: 'Inflation seems to be under control by the Fed and the
risk premium is reducing in bond markets.'
German government bonds followed the US rise and the December bund futures
contract ended at 91.07, up 0.62 on the day.
Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody said bunds had been supported by US
Treasuries rather than the October M3 money supply figures, which showed an
annualised rise from the fourth quarter of last year of 6.9 per cent, rather
than the 7.3 per cent which some had expected.
UK government bond markets showed some strength and the December long gilt
future had moved up  27/32 of a point to trade around 103 13/32 by late in
the day.
Three tap issues of gilts worth a total Pounds 550m were exhausted
yesterday. They were: Pounds 200m of 9 per cent due 2008 at a price of
104.18; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent due 2012 at 105.08; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2
per cent index-linked due 2003 at 162.22.
Mr Kevin Adams at BZW said: 'People may be feeling that bonds are back in
fashion.' He said investors had shrugged off hints of political uncertainty
stemming from disagreements in the governing Conservative party over the UK
contributions to the European Union budget.
He said: 'Investors cannot believe any Tory MP will risk going to the
country when they will so obviously get completely pasted.'
The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose 3 basis points to 12.14
per cent.
Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the fall in price was due to further political
uncertainty.

Indian Shaving Products, a joint venture between Gillette of the US and the
Calcutta-based Poddar group, yesterday announced a 150 per cent rise in net
profit for the half-year to September 1994 on the back of a 20 per cent
increase in sales.
The company said net sales for the first half of the financial year rose to
Rs341.4m (Dollars 10.9m) from Rs285.5m a year ago, with strength in both the
domestic and export markets.
While domestic sales grew 18 per cent to Rs301.2m, export sales were up 35
per cent to Rs40.2m.
Gross profits increased to Rs54.8m from Rs43.3m, a rise of 27 per cent.
This was achieved after investing Rs42.1m in advertising and other marketing
activities. Net profits increased 150 per cent to Rs28.5m, after providing
for a depreciation of Rs14.8m and interest of Rs11.5m.
In 1993-94, the company wrote off the difference in exchange on a long-term
advance received from Gillette, resulting in a loss of Rs17.6m, and
therefore there was no exchange loss in this period. This contributed to
sharply higher net profits this year.

<TEXT>
Banca Antoniana, a Padua-based bank, is negotiating with Monte dei Paschi di
Siena, Italy's oldest bank, to buy an 81 per cent stake in Credito Lombardo,
Monte dei Paschi's quoted subsidiary, for about L240bn (Dollars 149m).
Credito Lombardo, based in Milan, has only 13 branches, but the acquisition
would fit into Antoniana's strategy of extending and strengthening its
network of 127 branches across north and north-east Italy.
The operation is part of the continuing shake-up in Italian banking, in
which Antoniana has played a small role. The Padua bank is one of four small
banks from the Veneto region which decided this month to sell their joint
13.52 per cent stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto to other shareholders, in
effect blocking a bid for control by Banca Commerciale Italiana.
Monte dei Paschi said on Tuesday that the sale of its Credito Lombardo
holding should be completed by the end of the year.
Antoniana will have to launch a full bid for the outstanding shares on the
Italian market at the same price of about L4,400 a share. Trading in Credito
Lombardo's shares was suspended on Tuesday morning, having risen 5 per cent
on Monday to L3,588. They remained under suspension yesterday.

<TEXT>
Astra International, one of the largest business groups in Indonesia,
surprised the market with an 84 per cent rise in net profits for the first
nine months of the year, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The company reported net profits of Rp186bn (Dollars 88m) against Rp101.93bn
a year ago, on sales of Rp6,282.32bn, against Rp4,110.47bn.
'The impressive result was due mainly to higher automotive sales, which
accounted for about 75 per cent of total sales,' Mr Jos Parengkuan, an
analyst with Lippo Securities said.
'But gross profit rose only 41 per cent due to a lower gross margin, which
resulted from the strong Japanese yen.'
He said average gross margins edged up to 18 per cent in the third quarter
from 17.4 per cent in the first half.
Meanwhile, the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday that Astra
would secure a Dollars 200m loan from a syndicate of several Singapore-based
Japanese banks.
It said the loans would be used to finance Astra's expansion programme in
agriculture and financial services.
Mr Rini S. Soewandi, the company's finance director, was quoted as saying
that agriculture currently contributes about 4 per cent of the company's
total revenue.
Mr Rini said that Astra had planned to raise Dollars 200m through bonds to
be issued in the US with interest rates of between 9.5 per cent and 10 per
cent. That plan was postponed as several Indonesian companies were reported
to have issued Yankee bonds with higher interest rates.
According to the company, the syndicated loan agreement is expected to be
signed in Singapore on December 16.
Semen Gresik, Indonesia's state-owned cement company, is to acquire Semen
Padang and Semen Tonasa, the other two state-owned cement companies, early
next year prior to listing its shares offshore, Antara, the official news
agency, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Jakarta.
No details were revealed.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: NSK in joint venture with US
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSK, the Japanese motor components and bearings group, is forming a joint
venture with Ingersoll-Rand, the US multinational, to launch a broader
attack on Europe's 15m-plus units a year market for vehicle steering
columns.
The equally-owned venture, Nastech Europe, initially will pool the resources
of Torrington, Ingersoll-Rand's automotive subsidiary, and NSK's steering
column manufacturing facilities in the UK.
Later they will consider adding capacity in continental Europe. Torrington
employs 400 people at Coventry and NSK employs 160 people at Peterlee in
north-east England.
The two plants have a combined turnover of Pounds 35m to Pounds 40m (Dollars
22.3m-Dollars 25.5m) a year.
Torrington supplies traditional European customers such as Ford and Rover.
The Peterlee facility supplies mainly Japanese transplant operations,
notably Nissan at Sunderland, Toyota in Derbyshire and a Suzuki venture in
Hungary.
Together they account for about 15 per cent of Europe's steering column
market, according to Mr Chris Thomas, the new company's managing director.
Large independent rivals include ZF of Germany. But about 50 per cent of
demand is currently met by vehicle makers' in-house production.
However, executives of Nastech Europe, which will start operations early
next year, say they believe that the trend of vehicle manufacturers
increasingly to out-source components should provide good growth
opportunities in the sector.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI India, a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, yesterday
announced a 77 per cent increase in gross profits for the first six months
to September and a 15 per cent advance in turnover for the period.
The company's profit before tax increased to Rs254.3m (Dollars 8.1m) from
Rs47.4m last year. Net sales increased to Rs2.82bn from Rs2.36bn reflecting
improved trading conditions and the intrinsic strengths of the diversified
product portfolio of the company.
Gross profit after the deduction of interest but before depreciation and
taxation increased to Rs341.6m from Rs192.5m last year.
The company said the explosives business continued to suffer from low prices
in an oversupplied market. With this exception, the company's other
businesses contributed to the large upturn. The restructuring of the
company's portfolio resulted in a steep reduction in interest costs and the
effective elimination of debt.
ICI India said it had restructured the seeds business during the half-year,
resulting in a profit of Rs13.2m. Profit after tax rose 59 per cent to
Rs150.5m, in spite of the fact that the previous period included a large
gain from the disposal of the company's fibres business.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, the last of the big
Australian banks to report earnings for the year to end-September, yesterday
surprised the market with an ADollars 803.2m (USDollars 613.1m) profit after
tax but before abnormals.
The figure compared with ADollars 459.7m in the previous year. Including
abnormals, the profit was ADollars 821.9m, up from ADollars 246.5m. Earnings
per share rose sharply - from 30.8 cents to 54.5 cents, on a pre-abnormals
basis.
The final dividend is 14 cents (unfranked), compared with 10 cents a year
ago, making a total for the year of 25 cents, up from 20 cents.
The result was ahead of analysts' expectations, which had been pitched
slightly below ADollars 700m. The shares jumped 8 cents to ADollars 3.75,
helping to rally both the banking sector and the Australian stock market
which had been rocked by Wall Street's overnight plunge.
ANZ said the result came on the back of strong income growth and a sharp
fall in the charge for doubtful debts. It noted a particularly strong
recovery in the profits from its core Australian operations, which
contributed ADollars 456.8m to the group's total, compared with ADollars
199.9m previously.
International operations contributed ADollars 250.7m, against ADollars
163.9m, while the New Zealand business remained stable, with ADollars 95.7m.
ANZ said the charge for bad and doubtful debts fell to ADollars 381.4m, from
ADollars 633.7m a year ago, with Mr John Gough, chairman, describing the
asset quality issue as 'well under control'. Net impaired assets at
end-September were ADollars 1.93bn, down from ADollars 2.7bn in 1993.
Operating expenses increased by ADollars 89.9m, with a reduction in premises
and computer costs being offset by higher personnel and other costs.
This meant the ratio of operating expenses for net operating income stood at
66 per cent, down from 69.2 per cent in the previous 12 months.
ANZ McCaughan, the group's stockbroking arm, made ADollars 14.4m, up from
ADollars 5.3m in 1992-93.
In Melbourne, Mr Don Mercer, managing director, said ANZ hoped to overtake
National Australia Bank - the strongest of the large Australian banks - in
terms of returns on shareholders' equity.
'I fancy our chances of passing our major competitors on return on
shareholders' equity,' he commented, although ANZ achieved only 15.2 per
cent last year, compared with NAB's 17.5 per cent.
He added that ANZ had no large acquisition plans, nor was it looking to
divest any significant elements of its business.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: ACT clears a path through
risk-management minefield - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publication of the Association of Corporate Treasurers' guidelines on risk
management and control of derivatives could hardly have been better timed. A
succession of losses through the use of these complicated financial
instruments has nurtured an impression that companies cannot handle them.
The ACT believes that the problems lie not so much in the complexity of the
products as in a failure of control at a very basic level. The organisation,
which groups corporate treasurers from the UK's largest companies, elevates
one simple recommendation above all: 'Strategies, policies and procedures
for the use or trading of derivatives must be clearly agreed by senior
management and at least endorsed by the board of directors.'
Most non-financial corporations say they only use derivatives to hedge, or
lay off their risk. But Mr Derek Ross, author of the paper and ACT chairman,
argues that hedging is an ambiguous concept which needs to be pinned down. A
dealer takes a view of the market when deciding when and for how long to
hedge.
The ACT policy document holds that management must not only agree a clear
policy but 'monitor and report all derivative activities, positions and
exposures'. That reads like a rather trite sentiment, but a basic failure of
supervision lies behind many of the recent corporate losses.
Another important point is the need to provide for an internal check on
treasury and dealers. This separate risk management function should ensure
compliance with limits to exposure and independent reporting to management.
Some treasurers maintain that the ACT's recommendations are over the top and
the public hysteria is overheated. The sanguine view is that derivatives,
complex and misunderstood as they are, get more than their fair share of
blame for losses. For every loser there is a winner, analysts stress, but
the winners stay silent.
Companies have proved perfectly capable of losing large sums of money, not
on exotic derivatives, but simply because of movements on underlying
markets. Rolls-Royce, Laker and Lyons lead the list of examples. Only rarely
is it mentioned that a company should have used derivatives to hedge its
exposure.
There may be no boardroom panic about derivatives but there is concern. For
a start, about one-tenth of UK treasury departments still trade for profit,
according to surveys of corporate treasurers, and that can also expose them
more to losses. Speculating treasurers can always do damage but highly
leveraged derivatives can allow them to wreak particular havoc.
It is also possible to lose money on a standard but misunderstood hedge. A
company can misjudge its underlying exposure. It could, for example,
over-estimate its sensitivity to interest-rate movements and
over-compensate.
And some treasurers still experiment with complicated instruments which are
beyond them. 'There is very good and strong sales pressure,' says Mr Les
Halpin, of Record Treasury Management, the risk management research company.
'And it is natural human nature: a treasurer wants to try things out.'
The roll-call of corporate losses on derivatives is nevertheless having a
salutary effect on practices. 'It will make people that much more cautious,
that much more diligent,' says Mr Paul Reyniers of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.
Ahead of the ACT guidelines a trend towards more robust and explicit
controls is already in evidence. Some companies have, for example,
restricted the use of certain instruments such as the short option.
Corporate treasurers are evaluating their positions more frequently. This
practice of 'marking to market' can be misleading, some companies claim, and
some of the more complicated instruments are hard to value. The Record
survey showed only 28 per cent of surveyed corporate treasurers marked to
market every day or week. Marking to market is nevertheless becoming more
common as a guide.
Management can rein in their central treasury units but many of the most
crippling derivatives losses have been inflicted by rogue subsidiaries.
'There are people in subsidiaries that can sell the company,' says Mr
Reyniers. Companies are therefore tending to insist that units, as well as
filing the usual monthly balance sheet, also state their off-balance sheet
positions.
Corporate treasurers and board members are also taking to heart the message
that they should not be using derivatives if they do not understand them.
'If you don't know what you are doing you are dead,' says Mr Richard
Desmond, corporate treasurer of BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial
services group.
Some clients have blamed their misapprehension on investment banks for
giving bad advice. Fewer than half of the corporate treasurers interviewed
by Record said sellers of derivatives explained their products adequately.
In the US both Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibsons Greetings have sued Bankers
Trust, a leading derivatives dealer.
However, companies' dominant reaction has been to put their own house in
order. While there has been no obvious fall-off in overall use of
derivatives, a gentle shift has taken place: from the captions and swaptions
that bewilder the uninitiated towards simple, 'plain vanilla' products that
can be easily explained to superiors.
Explanation is easier if executives have solid basic knowledge. Workshops,
seminars and conferences on derivatives for corporate treasurers have
proliferated. A finance director attending one accountancy firm's course
said: 'My treasurer wants to use more derivatives. I just don't feel
comfortable. She could be doing something crazy and I would never know.'
Of course a board may endorse a risky move in the derivatives market. In
that case there are no guarantees. The most Mr Ross can do is to argue: 'If
a company wishes to adopt such a hazardous policy it should at least be
disclosed to shareholders.'

McLeod Russell, part of the Khaitan group tea plantation group, yesterday
completed its purchase of a controlling interest of Union Carbide India
(UCI) when it paid Rs2.9bn (Dollars 92.45m) for the 50.9 per cent holding
held by Union Carbide Corporation of the US, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
The payment was received by Sir Ian Percival, trustee of the Bhopal Hospital
Trust to which Union Carbide had entrusted the controlling block of UCI. Sir
Ian said: 'The Trust will now get down to building a Rs1.2bn hospital for
the victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.'
McLeod Russell will now be making an offer to buy the shares of UCI from the
minority shareholders at Rs175 a share, the price it paid for the Union
Carbide holding.

The ministry on Wednesday also granted licenses to 11 limited financial
groups; five leasing companies, five factoring companies and a foreign
exchange house.
Those receiving approval include GE Capital, Caterpillar, Chrysler Credit,
and Ford Credit. The latter three are expected to do business in tractor and
automobile and lending and leasing. Deutsche Bank received a license to
operate a foreign exchange house.

Hong Kong has chosen the trading and clearing system of the German futures
and options market, Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), for its planned traded
options market, the DTB said, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
Mr Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Hong Kong exchange, said DTB's system had
been selected as the most suitable for the Hong Kong market after it had
also looked into many other systems. 'The stock exchange will now be able to
move ahead towards the introduction of our traded options market in the
third quarter of next year,' Mr Cheng said.
Mr Jorg Franke, DTB general manager, who signed the contract with Mr Cheng
yesterday, said this was the first step in a long-term relationship between
the two exchanges. He said the system developed by DTB, the world's largest
fully computerised options and futures exchange, had handled more than
600,000 contracts a day at peak times.

<TEXT>
Karstadt, Germany's biggest retail group, yesterday warned there would be a
'marked fall' in profits for the year because of stagnant consumer demand,
writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn.
The group said turnover had risen 30.8 per cent to DM19.4bn (Dollars
12.48bn) in the first nine months of the year following the takeover of
Hertie, the country's third-biggest retailer. Sales at Karstadt itself fell
5.8 per cent to DM8.45bn, while Hertie's turnover dropped 2.8 per cent to
DM3.27.
Karstadt's travel services were virtually the only sectors able to report
sales increases.
While most of the German economy is pulling out of its worst post-war
recession, retailers have yet to benefit. Next year is not expected to
improve because of new taxes and a national pay round which is not seen as
likely to boost wages significantly.

<TEXT>
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish pulp and paper group, plans to invest FM2bn
(Dollars 421m) in a new paper machine at its Kirkniemi plant in Finland,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The machine, due to begin
operations in late 1996, will be able to produce 300,000 tonnes a year of
double-coated fine paper.
This will raise the company's total annual capacity for graphic printing
papers to 1m tonnes.
Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive, said the investment was based on rising
demand for coated offset printing papers, where growth of more than 5 per
cent a year was expected between 1994 and 1998. He stressed the group
intended to maintain a strong balance sheet.
This is one of the biggest single capacity additions to be announced by a
Finnish forestry group in the past three years.
However, it may increase fears that the industry is heading for a new
investments boom now that it is back in profit and prices are rising
strongly.
The downturn in the pulp and paper cycle between 1991 and 1993 was mainly
caused by over-capacity.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: US cable-TV group in Dollars
1.4bn buy - Deal lifts Continental Cablevision's network to 4m subscribers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Cablevision, the third largest US cable-TV company, is to buy
the cable operations of Providence Journal in a deal valued at Dollars
1.4bn.
Continental, which is privately owned, will take on Dollars 755m of debt and
issue stock to Providence valued at about Dollars 645m. It is believed this
will give Providence 18 per cent of Continental's equity. Continental also
plans to go public when the deal is closed next year.
The deal implicitly values the whole of Continental at Dollars 3.6bn.
The cable properties of Providence Journal, a diversified communications
company which is also privately owned, are in seven states across the USA.
Five of them are close to Continental's cable operations, the companies
said.
The purchase will add 750,000 subscribers to Continental's network, giving
it a total of about 4m. This still leaves it in third place after
Tele-Communications Inc and Time Warner.
Some 55 per cent of Continental will then be owned by the company's founder,
Mr Amos Hostetter, and by fellow executives, with the balance held by
institutions.
The subsequent flotation is planned for the middle of next year.
Continental refused to comment yesterday on reports that it had considered
and then dropped a separate plan to give a substantial share of its equity
to US West, the regional telephone operator.
Continental has so far avoided the general move by the big cable companies
into the US telephone market.
Last month TCI joined forces with Comcast and Cox - the fourth and sixth
biggest cable operators - and Sprint, the long-distance telephone company,
to bid for mobile communications licences.
Time Warner is entering the telephone market independently, and also has an
alliance with US West.
The latest deal illustrates the trend in the cable industry towards
consolidation. This results from competitive pressures between cable and
telephone operators and from recent government-imposed cuts in prices
charged to cable subscribers.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: US bank settles derivatives
lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust reached agreement yesterday to settle the smaller of two
lawsuits brought against it by corporate customers over derivatives losses.
Under the out-of-court settlement, the bank in effect released Gibson
Greetings, a Cincinnati-based greetings card company, from Dollars 14m it
owed under two swap agreements.
However, the company will pay Bankers Trust Dollars 6.2m, the balance of the
losses it faced on the two contracts.
The Gibson case is believed to have been the first brought against a bank by
a corporate customer over a complex derivative transaction.
It was seen by derivatives professionals as a test of whether corporate
treasurers could be held wholly responsible for financial instruments they
buy, or whether they could lay some of the blame on the banks they bought
them from.
Gibson had sued the New York-based bank in September, seeking to recover
what at the time were paper losses of Dollars 23m, along with punitive
damages of Dollars 50m. It claimed that Bankers Trust misinformed it about
the true risks of the derivatives it bought. The instruments turned bad
after February this year, when US interest rates started to rise.
Bankers Trust refused to discuss its reasons for settling the suit, saying
only that it was 'in the interest of both parties based on the unique facts
of this case'. It is thought, however, that the bank believed Gibson, as a
small company, stood a good chance of depicting itself in court as an
innocent victim.
Bankers Trust, meanwhile, said that it still intended to defend itself
vigorously against the second lawsuit, under which Procter &amp; Gamble is
seeking Dollars 130m and unspecified punitive damages over a single interest
rate swap that went bad after US rates rose.

<TEXT>
Creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the failed Canadian property developer, have
found an outside investor to inject badly-needed capital into Gulf Canada
Resources, the oil and gas producer formerly controlled by O&amp;Y.
Torch Energy Advisors, a Houston-based investment management group, will pay
CDollars 300m (USDollars 214m) for 55m newly-issued units, each comprising
one Gulf common share and a one-quarter warrant to buy one share at CDollars
6.25 over the next two years. The warrants, if exercised, would raise
another CDollars 86m.
The deal will allow the international lender group, led by Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, Credit Lyonnais, Royal Bank of Canada and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, to cut its stake in Gulf Canada to 52 per cent from 70 per
cent. Torch will have a 25 per cent interest.
Torch also has an option until December 9 to make an offer for Gulf shares
held by the banks and other shareholders for CDollars 5.38 each. This is
significantly higher than the CDollars 4.50 at which Gulf shares were
trading on the Toronto stock exchange immediately prior to the announcement.
O&amp;Y pledged its Gulf shares to the banks as partial collateral for a
USDollars 2.5bn syndicated loan. The banks seized the shares when O&amp;Y
collapsed in 1992.
Mr Ken Croft, analyst at Levesque Securities in Calgary, said the banks have
faced a dilemma: 'They believe there's more value in the company than the
current share price suggests. But to realise that gain would require someone
to put in extra money.'
Gulf has extensive operations in western Canada, northern Russia and
Indonesia.
It produced an average of 93,500 barrels a day of liquids and 296m cubic
feet of natural gas in 1993. But the company has lost more than CDollars
400m since 1990, and has CDollars 1.7bn of debt. It has disposed of several
businesses in the past two years in an effort to alleviate its financial
position.
Mr Chuck Shultz, Gulf chief executive, said Torch's purchase would provide
capital to develop its remaining assets. Gulf also indicated that a sturdier
capital base may allow it to resume dividend payments on its preferred
shares.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study highlights differences in
French and UK acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French companies are more strategic in their acquisition of businesses while
their UK rivals are more obsessed with detailed numbers, according to a
survey published yesterday by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK accountancy firm.
More than half of the French companies surveyed considered consolidating
their core business as the principal reason for buying others - at the
expense of carrying out much financial analysis, the survey showed.
Acquirers tend to be haphazard in the way they buy other companies, with
time frames and deadlines often imposed by the target business. In one-third
of cases, there was no due diligence to assess the companies, and one-third
had no direct contact with the target before making an offer.
Mr Alec D'Janoeff, chairman of Coopers' French market sector group, said:
'British acquisitions are all very calculated while the French make their
decisions on strategic grounds. I believe it reflects a different
intellectual approach to doing business. Both have their advantages.'
The findings were based on interviews with a representative sample of
executives in French and UK companies. These showed that 70 per cent of
French companies did not develop a plan to cope with integration until after
an acquisition had taken place.
In three-quarters of the cases studied, the mergers and acquisitions had
been supported by the target's board of directors and was not in any way
hostile.
Mr D'Janoeff said one of the implications of the study was that UK-based
multinationals should be prepared to pay a premium when acquiring French
businesses if they wanted to be able to compete against French rivals
interested in a target primarily for strategic reasons.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: CSA adopts a new flight plan -
The Czech airline is seeking a domestic partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Czechoslovak Airlines, the Czech Republic's loss-making national airline, is
hoping an injection of government money and a new approach to future
partnerships will help it ride out the most turbulent period in its 71-year
history.
CSA, majority-owned by Czech state institutions, has been tackling two
problems - the search for new partner following the split with Air France,
and the struggle to meet finance requirements on its Airbus leases.
CSA split up with Air France, its strategic partner, in March, after the
government paid Dollars 27m to buy out the French airline's stake. It has
tried to forge another alliance with an airline, but without success.
It has now adopted a new approach: the search is on for a Czech investor,
such as a financial institution, willing to pump money into the airline.
The Airbus leases that are at the core of CSA's problems were signed early
in 1989 at the peak of the aircraft leasing boom and before the democratic
revolution in the former Czechoslovakia.
'It has been clear for some time that CSA is not able to carry the cost of
these leases,' says Mr Frantisek Slaby, the airline's executive
vice-president for finance and planning.
The Airbus lease represents about 10 per cent of CSA's total cost base, he
adds.
The carrier, however, is to receive an interest-free loan of Kcs586m
(Dollars 21.3m) from the government to help it discharge immediate leasing
payments on two Airbus A310-300s.
In addition to the loan, the airline has managed to renegotiate the leases
so that its annual repayments will be cut to Kcs600m a year from now until
they expire in 2001. This will save it Kcs200m annually.
The airline also leases five Boeing 737-500s and four ATR 72-200s, which it
acquired in 1992 and which cost Kcs700m annually.
CSA hopes the new lease arrangements will convince a local investor to come
on board.
It has held talks with several North American and east Asian airlines, but
its financial woes and a lingering bitterness over Air France's withdrawal
have forced it to abandon that route.
Instead, Mr Slaby says, CSA is talking to Czech investors, one of which is
likely to acquire some or all of the 48.99 per cent stake in the airline
held by the National Property Fund, the Czech government body that owns
companies being privatised.
Mr Slaby says this investor would most likely be a Czech financial
institution, and that a deal could be finalised next year.
'There are (Czech) institutions able and willing to be financial partners
with CSA,' he says.
A possible partner is Ceska Pojist'ovna, the partly privatised Czech
insurance company that owns 4.5 per cent of CSA.
CSA will, however, continue talks with other airlines on route-sharing,
passenger incentives and catering services. Delta Airlines of the US has
been touted as a likely partner in this area. However, Mr Slaby says his
airline is talking to four or five parties.
A third likely alliance would involve a technology and know-how agreement
with another airline or service company. The final say on these developments
rests with the government, whose anger at the Air France pull-out has been
partly assuaged by CSA's improving financial performance.
The company has reduced losses in the first nine months to Kcs215.2m,
compared with a loss of Kcs738.3m in the same period last year. In fiscal
1993 CSA lost Kcs1.5bn after tax.
Passenger numbers have been rising since March, ironically coinciding with
the Air France pull-out, while capacity utilisation is also up on last year,
peaking at nearly 75 per cent in August.
By the end of the year CSA will have 20 aircraft. Six Russian Ilyushin Il
62Ms were withdrawn from service at the end of October, but in addition to
the western-built aircraft it also has four Tupolev Tu 154Ms and three Tu
134As.
It has recently taken delivery of two ATR 42s on operating leases for
service on short-haul routes.
In spite of lower losses, the leasing commitments make the need for CSA to
find a new backer urgent. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which was Air France's partner in the high-profile Dollars 60m
investment in March 1992, says it will soldier on as a long-term investor,
despite losing its board representation.
The EBRD too must be hoping CSA's new plans will provide an early solution
to the airline's problems.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Capital increase for Von Roll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Von Roll, the troubled Swiss steel and engineering group, said it would
slash its SFr184m (Dollars 140m) equity capital by 90 per cent and then
increase it to SFr190.9m through a rights issue to shareholders and
bondholders.
This is the second significant restructuring programme in less than a year
for the group, in which Proventus, the Swedish industrial investment group,
has a 28.1 per cent stake.
Von Roll said in a statement that this latest capital injection was made
necessary only by continuing troubles at its toxic waste disposal plant in
the US. Other operations were recovering as planned.
The waste plant's start-up last year came two years late because of blocking
manoeuvres by environmentalists, and some of its sensitive equipment froze
during a cold snap last winter.
Recently, it has suffered from a slump in the market, and Von Roll said
yesterday that it would continue for some time to incur losses.
The registered shares and participation certificates would be abolished,
creating a single class of SFr10 bearer shares.
Shareholders would be given a subscription right to the upcoming capital
rise at the rate of 11 new shares at SFr25 for each SFr100 nominal of
existing capital. The board would be reduced to five from the current nine
members.
Von Roll said it would suffer a loss this year, its fourth in succession,
but expected to report a modest group net profit in 1995 and a satisfactory
profit in 1996.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Videotron falls despite 10%
sales increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Expanding cable-TV operations in Canada and the UK enabled Videotron to
report a 10 per cent rise in revenues for the year ended August 31, but
higher depreciation and continuing problems in domestic broadcasting
depressed profits overall.
Net profit was CDollars 20.5m (USDollars 14.6m), or 11 cents a share, down
from CDollars 25.1m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 641m against CDollars 584m.
Videotron has been investing heavily in its cable and telecommunications
franchise areas in southern England, leading to higher depreciation and
amortisation.
However, Videotron said the UK unit would contribute more in 1995 and
eventually be a significant source of income and cash flow.
Videotron will also start up a trial commercial cable/multi-media system in
Quebec this autumn and is expanding rapidly in the US. Newbridge Networks, a
specialised telecommunication equipment maker, posted a second-quarter
profit of CDollars 45.3m, or 56 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 191m, up
almost 50 per cent. First-half profit was CDollars 87.2m, or CDollars 1.08 a
share, up from CDollars 69.1m, or 87 cents, on sales of CDollars 363m
against CDollars 243m.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thyssen returns to black but
omits dividend again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thyssen, the steel-based conglomerate, said yesterday it was back in profit
after the worst results in its 103-year history. However, it will not be
paying a dividend for 1993-94.
The group reported a DM90m (Dollars 57.9m) net profit for the year ended
September 30, compared with net losses of DM994m the year before. Thyssen
said a 'satisfactory' dividend would be paid at the end of the present
financial year.
The group last paid a dividend, of DM10, in 1992.
Its recovery was driven mainly by a turnround in the European car industry
and the growing demand for investment goods as Germany emerges from its
worst post-war recession. Restructuring over the past two years, especially
in the steel division, helped lift productivity.
Turnover for the year rose 4 per cent to DM34.9, up from DM33.5m, while
orders increased 8 per cent.
Budd, the US subsidiary, saw turnover rise 17 per cent during the review
period, helped especially by strong sales of pick-up trucks and minivans,
which are the group's speciality.
More jobs are expected to be shed in the coming year, mainly in the steel
division, which represents about 30 per cent of group turnover and was the
main cause of the recent losses.
Steel sales rose 3 per cent to DM11bn during the period. Although the steel
division has been reporting monthly profits since April, it will report a
loss for the year as a whole, even though plants are working flat out and
cannot meet the unexpectedly strong demand for some products.
Thyssen employed 129,389 people at the end of the period, about 5 per cent
less than a year earlier.
The group expects to shed another 4,000 steelworkers by the end of 1995,
bringing the steel division's workforce to about 22,000, down from 30,858 in
September 1993.
The Steel Federation said new orders at German steelmakers in the third
quarter rose 16.4 per cent, to 9.5m tonnes, over the same period a year ago.
However, the figures represent a drop of 0.8 per cent against the second
quarter, mainly because of lower orders from China.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sales at Nestle hit by strong
Swiss franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VEVEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said sales in the first nine months
were down 1.5 per cent to SFr45.9bn (Dollars 35bn), mainly because of the
strength of the Swiss franc.
However, Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, forecast an increase in net income for
the full year, partly attributable to extraordinary gains, and further
increases in sales and profit in 1995.
Nestle's sales volume rose 2.8 per cent in the first 10 months, well below
its 4 per cent target.
Mr Maucher said the recession in Europe had affected important markets such
as France, Spain and Germany.
Acquisitions added 2.1 per cent to the value of sales and price increases a
further 1.7 per cent. However, the effects of the exchange rate knocked off
6.9 per cent, and a change in accounting for sales in inflation-hit Brazil
shaved off a further 1.2 per cent.
The group will record a SFr620m after-tax profit this year on the sales of
its interests in distributors of the French cosmetics group L'Oreal. Mr Reto
Domeniconi, finance director, said SFr320m would appear as an extraordinary
gain and the remainder would be transferred directly to the balance sheet.
Mr Maucher said two-thirds of sales growth in the past decade had come from
acquisitions, but he foresaw a reversal of the pattern as sales from
subsidiaries in developing countries expanded.
Capital spending was likely to be flat this year at SFr3.1bn.
The group recently announced some 2,000 redundancies at three sites in the
UK. Mr Ramon Masip, chief operating officer, said the cuts were 'all that
are foreseen in this country for the next few years'.
Mr Maucher said yesterday Nestle was interested in buying the European
petfood activities of US breakfast cereal manufacturer Quaker Oats.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans call
for further DM600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A capital restructuring package, including a call on shareholders for a
further DM600m (Dollars 387m) and a two-to-one capital reduction, is being
prepared for presentation at Metallgesellschaft's annual meeting next March.
Describing the scheme as 'only a concept', Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman of
the battered German metals and engineering group, said yesterday the aim
would be to offer shares in the capital increase at a substantial discount
to the market rate.
Shares in this year's DM1.4bn rights issue, part of a DM3.4bn rescue
arranged by bank shareholders, were priced well above the market at DM250.
The stock was suspended yesterday pending the announcement, after closing at
DM143 on Tuesday.
Despite the lack of detail, the fact that plans for a capital write-down
have been announced suggests German creditor banks, which tightly control
the company, have already agreed in principle.
A restructuring of the group's capital base has long been expected. It is
viewed as the logical consequence of the operational shake-out which has led
to the sale and closure of many subsidiaries.
The assets sale instituted last December has generated more than DM4bn, and
90 subsidiaries have been disposed of or deconsolidated.
Mr Neukirchen said yesterday the sell-off was virtually complete, apart from
the planned disposal of the Lentjes plant and pipeline activities.
He repeated earlier forecasts of operating earnings exceeding DM100m in the
year to the end of September 1995.
Mr Neukirchen also expanded on 1993-94 figures published last week which
showed a net loss of DM2.7bn on sales of DM20bn, compared with a with a
deficit of DM1.97bn on DM26bn turnover.
Trading and services divisions earned DM38m pre-tax on sales up DM1bn at
DM8.7bn, after losing DM33m last time. Plant construction under the Lurgi
group fell into a loss of DM35m, but only after setting aside DM110m for
redundancies and early retirements.
Dynamit Nobel has bought two more chemical concerns from its parent company
Metallgesellschaft, concentrating all of the latter's chemicals activities
under one roof, Reuter adds.
The two subsidiaries Dynamit Nobel purchased are Sachtleben Chemie of
Duisburg-Homberg, and the Chemson Group, with factories in Austria and the
UK.

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stora surges as demand rises

<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a
SKr2.04bn (Dollars 277m) pre-tax profit for the first nine months, a
seven-fold increase on last year's SKr294m.
Higher volumes, lower financial costs, the weak krona and capital gains all
contributed to the surge. Mr Lars Ake Helgesson, chief executive, said the
group had benefited from higher prices during the third quarter.
Average prices were up 1 per cent, with higher pulp, fine paper, newsprint
and packaging paper prices offset by lower board, magazine paper and
light-weight coated paper prices.
Mr Helgesson said the impact of higher prices would be greater in future,
since prices for half the group's production volume were yet to improve.
Prices for newsprint and uncoated magazine paper were due to rise by as much
as 25 per cent from January, he said.
The upturn in pulp and paper demand means Stora is operating virtually flat
out, with capacity use rising to 93 per cent from 89 per cent and deliveries
climbing 6 per cent to 5.11m tonnes. The increase in European demand for the
group's products ranges from 5 per cent for newsprint to 18 per cent for
coated fine papers. The trend has helped to push up underlying sales by 11
per cent to SKr35.3bn.
Operating income of SKr2.94bn included one-off gains of SKr590m, arising
mainly from the sale of the Tarkett floor material unit. The comparable 1993
figure was SKr1.55bn, when there were one-off gains of SKr188m.
The group's financial costs fell to SKr905m from SKr1.26bn due to lower
interest rates and a reduced debt burden.
All of the group's divisions improved their performance, except for Stora
Financial Services, where operating income dropped to SKr249m from last
year's unusually strong SKr702m. Stora Feldmuhle lifted profits to SKr641m
from SKr90m, while Stora Papyrus saw profits jump to SKr509m from SKr158m.
Stora Power and Stora Building Products were the only divisions to remain in
the red.
Analysts are predicting a full-year profit of more than SKr3bn after last
year's SKr530m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old investment banker, was yesterday named
number two at Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, in
the expectation that he will take over at the FFr147bn-a-year (Dollars
27.6bn) business from Mr Guy Dejouany, CGE's veteran chairman and chief
executive, in 18 months.
CGE said that the decision to co-opt Mr Messier to the board as a
director-general was taken unanimously, therefore with the apparent approval
of Mr Jacques Calvet. Mr Calvet, the head of Peugeot, the carmaker, had
earlier threatened to resign from the CGE board if so young a man with
little experience of the group's business were 'parachuted' into so high a
position.
Mr Calvet left Paris on a business trip immediately after the CGE board
meeting.
A CGE statement made clear Mr Messier was being groomed to succeed Mr
Dejouany, who has run CGE for the past 18 years and who is due to retire in
1996.
It said Mr Messier 'will have very broad delegated powers, under the control
of' Mr Dejouany. He will head a new internal executive committee to prepare
important decisions and a new subcommittee of the board dealing with
corporate strategy and development.
This puts him above Mr Paul-Louis Girardot, the only other CGE
director-general to be a board member.
Mr Girardot was known to be unhappy with Mr Dejouany's decision to pass him
over by choosing someone much younger from outside the group.

Commerzbank, the German bank, has suffered a 27 per cent drop in group
operating profits, to DM660m (Dollars 425m), for the first 10 months of this
year. It blamed weakness in world bond markets.
However, it ended up with a higher pre-tax figure after including proceeds
from sales of shareholdings.
The bank also said it was buying 51 per cent of Hypothekenbank in Essen,
which specialises in municipal and mortgage loans. The bank has total assets
of DM22bn - which will bring the Commerzbank total up to more than DM310bn -
and made net profits of DM34m last year. It gave no price.
The fall in Commerzbank's operating profits mainly reflects the decline in
bond and securities markets, with earnings on financial dealings on its own
account falling 88 per cent to DM56m from DM475m. Losses and write-offs on
securities trading were partly offset by profits on foreign exchange and
derivatives transactions.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, said the bank still kept a critical eye on
domestic loan risks. However, it was able to reduce loan-loss provisions by
3 per cent to DM1.3bn. In spite of the economic recovery, many companies
still found business conditions difficult.
Commerzbank, the first of Germany's big commercial banks to issue 10-month
figures, said its pre-tax profit was 43 per cent higher at DM1.5bn. Profits
on the sale of its 15 per cent stake in Karstadt, the department store
group, and of shares in the DBV insurance group were mainly responsible for
the increase.
Mr Kohlhaussen hinted that shareholders would receive a higher pay-out to
mark next year's 125th anniversary. He said the DM12 dividend would be 'at
least' maintained, with an anniversary bonus to be considered after the
year-end.
Partial operating profits, which exclude own-account trading, rose by 14 per
cent. Contributing strongly was a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to
DM4.3bn. Increased lending competition pushed the average interest margin
down to 1.79 per cent from 1.85 per cent, but this has improved since
mid-year.
The bank said it was opening a direct banking subsidiary, ComDirect Bank,
next year. It will offer standard securities, deposit and loan products by
telephone, fax or mail.

BK Vision, the investment fund that is the largest shareholder in Union Bank
of Switzerland, is determined to go ahead with a legal challenge to the UBS
shareholders' vote in favour of converting registered shares into bearer
shares.
UBS yesterday appealed to dissident shareholders not to block the
introduction of the new share structure. It pointed out that a clear
majority - 57.8 per cent of the registered shares voted at an extraordinary
meeting on Tuesday - endorsed the change.
Under the new structure, the voting strength of the registered shares, now
five times that of bearer shares, would be slashed to equal bearers.
UBS said the majority support from registered shareholders was a strong
argument against the granting of an injunction to BK Vision to block the
implementation of the conversion.
BK Vision, controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has argued that
registered shareholders should have been allowed to vote separately on the
issue.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a director of BK Vision, maintained there were several
other grounds for contesting Tuesday's vote.
Investors seem to believe BK Vision will win the injunction next week.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pre-Budget moves to b&amp;b - A practice which
appears to have gained in popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market may be wallowing like a rudderless ship, but down in
the engine room investors are quietly shifting funds in case a well loved
loophole is plugged in next week's budget.
Dealers who closely follow the patterns of share trading have noted that the
number of 'bed and breakfast' deals has risen dramatically over the past few
weeks.
These trades generally involve placing stock shortly before the close of the
session and buying it back the next morning to establish a tax loss - hence
its potential interest to the Chancellor.
On one day last week, daily volume was boosted by 60m shares, about a tenth
of the turnover, after large blocks of FT-SE 100 stocks appeared on the Seaq
automated quotation system first thing in the morning. And on Tuesday some
13m shares in second line stocks went through the dealing screens.
Both were believed to represent one half of this evocative but obscure
practice.
Opinion is divided, however, on the reasons for the increase. And
establishing motivation is made more difficult by the shadowy legal nature
of the practice.
In the words of the Stock Exchange: 'The question is not so much whether it
is illegal but whether it is allowable under tax regulations.'
The pointer to a bed and breakfast deal is often a large block of shares
recorded just before the close of dealing at below the market price and
known in the trade as 'a 1629'. The following morning a similar block of
shares with matching price and size will show up.
These trades are made to mitigate the effects of capital gains tax. If there
is no link between the sale and the repurchase they are perfectly legal.
Mr Paul Franklin, of the Inland Revenue, said: 'We have no objection to a
general disposal followed by an acquisition as long as they reflect the
market value. If they don't, an inspector will look at them.'
The Stock Exchange concurs. 'As far as we are concerned we don't know if the
bargain is bought back the next day. The rules are that they have to be
booked near the market price.' In other words, if the transaction
constituted price manipulation it would be breaking the rules.
Marketmakers say the fact that deals are often slightly below the market
price can be explained by the size of the trade compared with the normal
market size and the general liquidity of the stock.
Because of the sensitive nature of bed and breakfasts, securities houses
will not comment officially on their involvement. And none will admit to
agreeing both sides of the deal, that would constitute a 'scheme'.
One senior dealer said: 'Legally they don't exist but technically they do
happen. The whole subject is such a hot potato we would rather remain in the
background.'
One insider at UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, said business had
grown because a number of institutional clients were concerned that the
Chancellor would stop the practice.
'The rumour often rears its head around Budget time. It may not be founded
on anything but there has been more worry around this year.' He added: 'I am
not really sure how the Chancellor can stop people buying or selling shares
and establishing a tax loss.'
It is also possible that much of the business might merely reflect prudent
cash management. The stock market has fallen by about 9 per cent since its
highs at the start of the year. If Mr Clarke is going to bare his teeth,
investors might feel that now is as good a time as any to make the best
possible use of capital gains tax allowances.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wagon rises to Pounds 9.6m as markets
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wagon Industrial resumed profits growth, as the effect of internal changes
to raise productivity coincided with an improvement in market conditions,
especially in the UK.
Pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30 at the group, whose
interests embrace storage and retail equipment, engineering and automotive
products, rose to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 5.06m).
This lifted earnings per share to 12.63p (4.52p) and allowed a 5 per cent
increase in the interim dividend to 6.65p (6.325p).
Stripping out exceptional costs for restructuring and writing off goodwill
associated with disposals, Wagon said that its underlying pre-tax profits
rose in the first half by 28 per cent to Pounds 10.4m.
It said it was optimistic about its prospects and anticipated 'a continuing
improvement in profits for the year as a whole'.
Like other engineering companies, Wagon is experiencing continued pressure
on its margins. Its profits growth has been underpinned by productivity
improvements. 'Underlying profits have moved ahead in the UK, but in Europe,
profits were more or less flat,' said Mr John Hudson, the chief executive.
The group has made a string of small acquisitions to bolster its varied
market positions and this was reflected in its turnover. Acquisitions
contributed Pounds 6.49m out of a first half total of Pounds 163.85m,
compared with Pounds 132.23m.
Operating profits moved ahead to Pounds 11.15m, against Pounds 4.42m when
the figure was depressed by restructuring charges at Forkhardt, the German
specialist chuck maker.
The contributions of both the storage and retail and the automotive products
divisions rose, but there remained a loss from engineering, largely because
of a downturn in the market for Wefco, which makes storage tanks and
pressure vessels, but is now closing two of its four factories.
COMMENT
Wagon has delivered what it said it would deliver. Its profits are moving
firmly upwards: the UK market is under its belt and European recovery is yet
to come. Problems at Wefco and at Link Plastics, another trouble spot, will
be sorted out in the current half. The group is riding the cycle. Full year
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 25m, to give earnings per share of 37.4p,
would not be fanciful. That presages a 5 per cent increase in the final
dividend, given group policy of working towards cover of two times. Such a
forecast puts the shares, after yesterday's slip in the market, when they
lost 4p to 459p, on a prospective multiple of 12.3, cheap for the sector.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sharelink Pounds 468,000 in the red and
trading 'very poor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharelink Investment Services, the Birmingham-based share dealing company,
continues to lose money on its current trading.
For the half year to September 30, it announced yesterday a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 468,000, compared with profits of Pounds 3.68m - this result was
foreshadowed in the warning of late September. The shares shed 7p to close
at 176p.
But Sharelink also announced that it 'was trading below break even in
October,' and Mr David Jones, the chief executive and biggest single
shareholder, said present trading is 'very poor.' This, he added, made him
'cautious about the year end result.'
First half turnover was down to Pounds 7.28m, against Pounds 11.25m last
time when business was boosted by BT privatisation.
Loss per share was 1.79p, against earnings of 16.07p, but Sharelink is
maintaining its interim dividend at 3p.
Sharelink's basic problem is the low level of dealing volume on the UK stock
market. But its financial results have also been affected by investment of
Pounds 700,000, during the first half, on the development of more efficient
operating systems and the introduction of new financial management products.
Investment spending in the second half will be Pounds 600,000. Sharelink
hopes to protect itself against market fluctuations by reducing costs and
bringing in a stream of fixed revenue from new products.

Continuing progress in the reshaping and restructuring of its business
helped John Foster &amp; Son, the mohair topmaking, worsted and spinning
concern, cut losses from Pounds 921,000 to Pounds 605,000 for the half year
to August 31.
The company said the result was in line with expectations. The second half
was likely to be similar to the first and an overall loss was expected for
the year.
Although the wool textile industry was generally more buoyant and the
forward order book stronger than for some time, margins remained under
considerable pressure due to the recent sharp rise in wool prices.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 6.2m.
Losses per share were 5.4p (8.4p).

McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, yesterday started to
make good its promise of more acquisitions, with the ADollars 15.4m (Pounds
7.48m) purchase of the packaged products division of Hunter Douglas, the
Australian group.
The division distributes drapery hardware like blinds and curtain rails,
thus fitting in with Phipps International, an earlier Australian
acquisition. The two companies should be able to feed business back to
McKechnie's aluminium extrusion operations.
This latest purchase brings to Pounds 51m the commitments McKechnie has made
on takeovers since August last year. Its spending has been partially offset
by Pounds 21.7m from disposals.
Last month McKechnie said it would buy companies in Europe, North America
and the Pacific area.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Birkby to float vehicle hire side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birkby, the business property managers and hire purchase group, yesterday
announced the flotation of its vehicle hire division to fund further
expansion.
The company, which established a national profile in March with the Pounds
58.7m purchase of In Shops, plans to extend its chain of business units
across the UK.
The group's gearing reached 77 per cent by September 30, up from 41 per cent
on March 31. It expects to be ungeared after the Hill Hire flotation.
The shares closed down 5p at 233p yesterday.
Birkby intends to float Hill Hire, its commercial vehicle hire company, by a
placing with institutional investors, which is expected to value the company
at more than Pounds 26m.
Mr Bill Cran, chief executive, said Birkby would retain a 40 per cent stake.
'We are beginning to restrict the growth of Hill Hire, simply because we are
not a truck rental operation and that is not a core activity,' he said.
'We want to put our resources into space management.' Hill Hire carries a
heavy debt burden, as is typical in vehicle hire.
Birkby acquired Hill Hire in July 1993 to add heavy commercial vehicles to
its existing light vehicles hire business. The division reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.76m on sales of Pounds 10.5m in the year to March 31.
Average utilisation rates stand at 72 per cent on light vehicles and 84 per
cent on heavy vehicles.
For the six months to September 30, Birkby reported a seven-fold rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 581,000).
Turnover expanded from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 32.2m, including a full
contribution from In Shops and its discount retailer Job Lot. The figures
were also lifted by a contribution from I-MEX, the manager of commercial and
light industrial units, which was acquired in August.
Occupancy rates in the group's 38 workspace centres range from 94 per cent
at the Birkby sites to 65 per cent at the I-MEX sites. Retail occupancy
stands at 82 per cent in the group's 65 centres.
Earnings were 8.2p (6.6p). The interim dividend goes up to 2p (1.2p).

FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: DCC shows 24% growth to IPounds
8.8m

DCC, the Dublin-based diversified holding company which came to the market
in May, reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds
7.11m to IPounds 8.82m (Pounds 8.7m) for the half year to September,
reflecting improved economic conditions in Ireland and the UK.
The group has interests in 20 companies in the foods, energy, healthcare and
computer services sectors, including snack food manufacturing, waste oil
recycling and natural gas distribution in the UK, and health care services
in the US.
Turnover, after deducting the share of associated companies, rose 26 per
cent to IPounds 119m (IPounds 94.7m).
Operating profits were up 35 per cent to IPounds 10m (IPounds 7.42m).
Mr Jim Flavin, DCC's founder and chief executive, said the performance was
'driven by organic growth and not merely the result of acquisitions'.
The foods sector is the largest contributor, with operating profits 44 per
cent up at IPounds 3m (IPounds 2.1m). The result includes contributions from
its associates, among them Fyffes, the fruit trader, and Allied Foods.
Earnings per share amounted to 7.9p (6.86p) and an interim dividend of 2.4p
is being paid.
A good outcome was expected for the year as seasonal factors, particularly
in the energy sector, weighted profits towards the second half, Mr Flavin
said.
DCC spent IPounds 5.1m on acquisitions in the period, including a
controlling interest in Virtus, a healthcare products maker.
DCC has been trading at below its issue price for much of the period since
going public.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming makes 6.3% midway advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Fleming Holdings, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday reported a
6.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30,
thus defying an industry trend which has seen earnings hit hard by turbulent
stock and bond markets, writes Norma Cohen.
Jardine Fleming, the group's 50 per cent owned Hong Kong-based investment
banking subsidiary, contributed roughly 40 per cent of total profits, up
from about a third in the same period last year, according to Mr John
Manser, group chief executive.
Pre-tax profits for the privately owned investment banking group rose to
Pounds 97.4m (Pounds 91.6m) with the investment banking sector contributing
a marginally lower Pounds 48.8m (Pounds 49.7m).
However, Mr Manser warned that the group was unlikely to match the Pounds
71.8m earned in its investment banking division in the second half of last
year, so that annual profits would be lower overall. 'I'd like to think we
could, but in all honesty, it is not likely.'
In its investment management business, the group earned pre-tax profits of
Pounds 48.6m, up 16 per cent from Pounds 41.9m. Assets under management
increased from Pounds 49.5bn to Pounds 50.2bn. This represents a net cash
inflow of about Pounds 2bn, mostly from retail accounts in the UK, US and
Europe, which was offset by a 3 per cent drop in the value of the investment
portfolio.
Mr Manser said that in Fleming Investment Management's core UK business 'we
have staunched the flow' of pension clients who had been leaving the firm
due to lacklustre investment performance, although it would be some time
before significant new business was attracted.
Fleming recently recruited a new chief executive to its asset management
division, Mr Ken Inglis, who has made several internal changes.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Far East strength pays off - How Fleming is
bucking the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turbulent world markets have been unkind to the investment banking industry
this year, although Robert Fleming Holdings appears to be bucking the trend.
Yesterday Fleming said its pre-tax profits rose by 6.3 per cent to Pounds
97.4m and that, moreover, its investment banking division's profits were off
only slightly from last year's level. Investment management, which includes
a US-based joint venture with mutual fund company T Rowe Price, contributed
to the group's earnings stability with a 16 per cent profits rise.
Significantly, much of the asset growth came from retail products,
especially in the US, where investors are increasingly keen to buy
non-domestic investment funds.
Mr John Manser, group chief executive, attributes the group's ability to
withstand the current tough markets to two key factors. 'Our businesses are
very well spread. We are in both retail and wholesale markets and we have a
good geographical spread. We operate in 32 markets and not all of those do
the same thing at the same time.'
And, perhaps most critically, Mr Manser says: 'We have strength in the Far
East through Jardine Fleming.'
Jardine Fleming, the investment bank owned jointly with Jardine Matheson,
had post-tax profits of Dollars 111m (Pounds 67.6m) for the six months to
June 30, a 44 per cent increase on last time.
Mr Manser says the firm's strategy, unlike that of some of its competitors,
is to grow globally through joint ventures, such as that with Jardine
Fleming, rather than to try to set up new operations with a high cost base.
'We would rather have a smaller part of a bigger whole than a larger part of
a smaller whole.'
He said the group's resilience partly reflected its success in integrating
the business generated from London into its joint ventures around the world.
These also include a 50 per cent stake in leading Australian stockbroker
Orde Minett and a South African joint venture with Martin and Co.
The structure allows decision-making to take place at the local level, where
management is likely to be better informed about conditions. 'It relieves
the strain on management,' he says. 'Running a global business from a single
spot will eventually overwhelm the management.' There are only two key
decision-making committees within Fleming; a seven-member body at the Group
headquarters in London and a similar-sized group at Jardine Fleming.
'There is a strategic issue here,' says a securities analyst with a rival
investment banking firm. 'The strategy of being in a niche business and
being risk averse is likely to be more successful long-term than the
integrated houses, who are taking a risk-based approach.'
And, perhaps most significantly for the current round of earnings, Fleming
has no market making capacity in UK equities and little of it within Europe.
Instead, it has concentrated on its role as an agency broker, although it is
building selected distribution and research capacity for European shares.
However, Fleming is not entirely risk averse, according to its competitors.
It has been strikingly aggressive about bidding for capital markets
business, particularly in the privatisation field. According to Euromoney
Bondware, an industry database, Fleming and its Jardine Fleming venture were
the leading bookrunner for Asian equity and equity-linked deals in 1993 and
1994; and according to Acquisitions Monthly, it ranks third in advisory
business for UK public takeovers so far this year.
Earlier this autumn, Fleming drew gasps from some of its competitors for
agreeing to act as global coordinator for a Dollars 900m international
distribution of warrants for newly privatised Pakistan Telecom. Pakistan
asked a group of banks to bid for the business - whose most recent accounts
were two years old - without a due diligence review.
'Of course we had some reservations about that fact but from our analysis,
in relation to other Asian telecom companies, we felt it was good value,' a
Fleming official explained.
While many competitors backed out, Fleming took the business on, although
shortly after it had distributed the warrants the price fell sharply. This
reflected a correction of information which had appeared in the domestic
prospectus which had been misinterpreted by foreign investors.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire cuts 600 more jobs - Water
utility to lose a quarter of its workforce as profits fall 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water yesterday announced plans to cut another 600 jobs. The
latest cuts are in addition to the 400 redundancies announced four months
ago, before the July price review.
The news came as Yorkshire Water reported a 10 per cent decline in interim
pre-tax profits and the season's lowest percentage dividend rise so far for
the sector.
Mr Malcolm Batty, finance director, said he expected further job losses in
future but could not yet quantify their scale or timing.
Yorkshire, which in June announced 400 job losses for 1994, has decided to
cut 100 more this year and another 500 over the next two years, accounting
for about 25 per cent of the regulated utility workforce.
Yorkshire's profits were depressed by the Pounds 25m charge to pay for the
rationalisation. This is in addition to the Pounds 10m provision last year.
It said it expected a two-year payback on the Pounds 35m provisions.
Pre-tax profits for the half-year to September 30 fell from Pounds 74.8m to
Pounds 67.2m. Sales were 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 275.4m (Pounds 259.4m).
Profits were helped by a higher than expected reduction in the pipe
maintenance charge from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 23.4m. Cashflow was also
enhanced by a substantial reduction in utility investment from Pounds 112m
to Pounds 72m.
Yorkshire, along with other water companies which have reported so far this
season, also announced plans to devote extra funds to issues such as foul
flooding and discoloured water, which were not allowed for in the price
review. The company said it would devote Pounds 316m this year to such
discretionary spending.
The core utility business reported an 11 per cent decline in operating
profits, after exceptionals, to Pounds 72.2m on sales 4 per cent ahead at
Pounds 249.1m.
The non-regulated activities contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m
against Pounds 900,000 last time.
Yorkshire increased its interim payout by 9.2 per cent to 8.3p and said it
intended to maintain dividend growth of at least 5 per cent above inflation
for the next five years. This would be achieved without substantially
eroding its dividend cover of about three times, the group said. Earnings
fell as a result of the exceptionals from 36.1p to 31.9p.
COMMENT
The market's reaction to a better than expected payout and the promise of at
least 5 per cent real dividend growth to 2000 might be seen as rather
ungrateful. However, there is a perception that Yorkshire has been held back
by fears that higher dividend growth would rekindle local controversy and
further damage its battered public image. Financially, Yorkshire is one of
the strongest water and sewerage companies and it could afford to increase
the payout by substantially more. There is also the argument that dividend
cover should be lower than the 3.4 times projected by analysts for the year
2000. Forecasts are for about Pounds 157m this year after exceptionals. The
group's non-core success and strong financials make Yorkshire a solid hold,
in spite of a yield just below the sector average.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RJB has 'overestimated demand for coal by
20%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company bidding to take over the English mining assets
of British Coal, has overestimated by 20 per cent the demand for coal by
English power generators in the late 1990s, according to an analysis
published today.
Coal UK, the Financial Times newsletter, says the company has also made too
little allowance in its calculation for the role of private coal producers
which will be its competitors.
Coal UK estimates the generators will buy 23.9m tonnes of coal from English
coal suppliers in 1998-99, whereas RJB says a conservative projection should
be about 28.9m tonnes.
'While the RJB case is its pessimistic view, our forecast is our most likely
scenario,' says Coal UK. 'Beyond 2000 difficulties will increase with the
prospect of tighter sulphur limits.'
The newsletter's analysis comes as RJB prepares to publish within the next
few weeks its pathfinder prospectus for a flotation aimed at raising up to
Pounds 425m. The company has offered Pounds 914m for the three regions for
which it is preferred bidder, although this figure is likely to decline in
final negotiations.
In the newsletter, Coal UK says RJB fails to take account in its market
projections of 3.6m tonnes of coal equivalent a year of heavy fuel oil burn
and appears to ignore supplies from other English mines. It also says RJB
under-estimates the amount of electricity that can be imported.
RJB's prediction of an industrial market of 6.4m tonnes in the late 1990s is
described as 'unaccountable'. Its ambitions to take 2m tonnes of the
domestic market assumes RJB will capture all the Scottish and Welsh
customers as well as the English.
Coal UK also criticises RJB for its high valuation of stocked coal. RJB
estimates total stocks (including non-coal) at Pounds 314m with Pounds 250m
of that for 9m tonnes of coal. This suggests Pounds 27.28 a tonne, says Coal
Investments.
Recent prices obtained by British Coal suggest that Pounds 14.40 to Pounds
24 would be more appropriate, says the newsletter.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chloride makes Pounds 14m security buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chloride Group's transformation from a batteries business into an
electronics group was reinforced yesterday by the acquisition of ADE Group,
an electronic security business, for up to Pounds 14m.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, Chloride chief executive, said that the acquisition
would enhance earnings per share and generate cash.
Chloride also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04m for the six months to
September 30 and a return to the dividend list with an interim payment of
0.1p, the first since the 1989-90 interim.
The profit compared with Pounds 1.32m, which included operating profits of
Pounds 1.1m from the seven battery businesses in central Africa which were
sold in the second half of 1993.
ADE manufactures control panels for alarms and distributes electronic
security alarm products. In the year to April 30 it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.54m) on sales of Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.1m).
The vendors, principally Mr James Chadwick, chief executive, and Mr Graham
Whitehead, deputy chief executive, will receive a Pounds 1.5m distribution
from ADE and an initial payment of Pounds 5m, satisfied by Pounds 4m cash
and 4m shares.
There is a further deferred profit-related Pounds 7.52m, satisfied by loan
notes.
Turnover was Pounds 50.6m with Pounds 2.47m from acquisitions, against
Pounds 51.8m, which included Pounds 9.07m from discontinued activities. As a
result of the divestments, tax fell to Pounds 415,000 (Pounds 987,000) and
minority interests to Pounds 13,000 (Pounds 210,000) giving attributable
profits of Pounds 608,000 (Pounds 124,000) and earnings per share of 0.3p
(0.1p).
Mr Hodgkinson said: 'We are now in a position where we feel confident about
returning to the dividend list.'
In the core electronics business operating profits, excluding Ondyne, the
power supply business it bought in April, rose to Pounds 1m (Pounds 508,000)
on sales up 14 per cent to Pounds 43.5m.
Margins and sales in the uninterruptible power supplies business increased
and the emergency lighting sector returned to profit for the first time in
four years. The power conversion business continued to make losses.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher chief could get Pounds 0.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Walls, the chairman of Albert Fisher, the food processing and
distribution group, will be paid a minimum of Pounds 464,000 this year and
could earn up to Pounds 618,000.
One of the main components is a lump sum pension payment which will total
Pounds 155,000 this year. Under Mr Walls' two-year rolling contract the
company must each year pay the equivalent of half his basic salary into his
company pension scheme.
On September 1 Mr Walls' basic salary was increased from Pounds 300,000 to
Pounds 309,000. On top of this he is also eligible for an annual bonus which
could be as much as half his basic salary.
Payment of the bonus is dependent on group performance and on Mr Walls
meeting 11 personal objectives during this year. They include:
'Ensure that by the end of the year the group has no operations losing money
(unless new start-ups specifically approved by the board)'.
'Continue to raise the general morale and motivation of personnel at all
levels'.
'Putting in place planned major head office cost reductions in line with
plan'.
The details are in documents available for inspection by shareholders ahead
of the AGM on December 14.
Mr Walls' total pay last year rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 514,000. The
annual report for the year to August, published yesterday, said this
included a Pounds 150,000 pension payment, without revealing that he has a
contractual entitlement to a similar sum each year. It also disclosed that
he received a Pounds 48,000 bonus last year 'based on the achievement of
stated personal objectives'.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Morland advances to Pounds 9.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued success of Old Speckled Hen helped Morland, the Thames
Valley-based brewer, to boost pre-tax profits by 9 per cent from Pounds
8.87m to Pounds 9.67m for the year to the end of September.
Production of Old Speckled Hen ale has reached 40,000 barrels, up from 5,000
barrels in 1992, when Greene King made a bid for Morland.
If the bid had succeeded, Greene King would have closed the Abingdon
brewery. But demand for its beer has prompted Morland to invest Pounds 5m in
its brewery over three years, culminating in a new brewing stream by Easter
1996.
Mr Michael Watts, managing director, said yesterday that the brewery had
raised its ale production by 21 per cent in a market generally seen as being
in decline. Old Speckled Hen accounted for Pounds 6m of the total turnover
of Pounds 57.1m, 12 per cent ahead of a previous Pounds 50.9m.
The group plans to take the ale from a national brand to international
recognition. Mr Watts said that by the end of the year, the company expected
to have established an export business, with the US and Italy as prime
targets.
Like-for-like profits on its tenanted estate were down by less than 2 per
cent. Mr Watts said the business was under attack on three fronts -
take-home sales, consumer imports of beer from France and the continuing
effects of the recession.
Earnings were 32p (29.1p). A final dividend of 7.65p (6.96p) makes 10.71p
(9.74p) for the year.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland chairman and chief executive, is
relinquishing the role of chief executive in February, when he will be 60.
Mr Watts will become chief executive, while Mr Clutterbuck will remain
chairman.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Research Machines to join market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research Machines, a supplier of computers and computer software to schools
and colleges, is coming to the market through a placing likely to value the
company at about Pounds 30m.
The company is expected to publish its pathfinder document later today.
The flotation is not intended to raise new money for the company, which has
about Pounds 6.5m in the bank, but to raise the profile and enhance the
reputation of a 21-year-old company which is still relatively unknown
outside the UK education market. It is anxious to increase its presence
overseas where a listing would give it greater credibility.
The flotation will also provide liquidity for existing shareholders
including Citicorp, 3i, Kleinwort Benson and Rothschild.
Last year it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.52m on turnover of Pounds
66.2m.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Higher raw material costs limit
Waddington's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, yesterday warned
that raw material price increases were putting margins in its packaging
businesses under pressure.
Mr Geoff Gibson, finance director, said prices for some plastic polymers had
risen by up to 70 per cent, with four increases in the US since April.
Operating profits for the six months to October 1 in the packaging division,
which accounts for two thirds of group turnover, fell from Pounds 6.82m to
Pounds 6.68m, in spite of an increase in sales from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds
82.2m. The latest figures include contributions of Pounds 433,000 to profits
and Pounds 3.16m to sales for one month from Imca Beheer, the Dutch cartons
business acquired in July.
The US food services business lifted operating profits from Pounds 2.7m to
Pounds 3.4m, while the pharmaceuticals packaging business improved from
Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.1m. These gains were offset by the food and
drinks packaging sector, which fell Pounds 300,000 into the red (Pounds 1.4m
profit).
Total pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 9.01m to Pounds 9.88m on the back
of a rise in turnover from Pounds 118.2m to Pounds 122.8m.
The specialist printing division lifted operating profits from Pounds 1.46m
to Pounds 2.17m on sales up from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 27.2m.
Profits from games eased to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.2m), held back by supply
shortages in the new ranges of radio controlled toys and pre-school toys.
Sales improved to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.9m).
Earnings per share were static at 7.88p, after restating the previous
earnings following the Pounds 42m rights issue for buying Imca. The interim
dividend is 3.8p (3.68p).
COMMENT
Raw material price rises for plastics, paper and board are unavoidable, and
will soak up a lot of management time as very few of the group's contracts
include automatic price increases. But they are not the sole reason that the
City is cutting its forecasts for this year - the attempt to diversify away
from margarine containers has not gone well. The cost of cutting capacity to
meet demand will further damage profitability. Forecasts for the year have
been reduced from as much as Pounds 25m to as low as Pounds 20m, giving a
prospective multiple of 16, which looks about right, bearing in mind the
disappointments and uncertainties.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Division makes Pounds 9.6m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Division, the Bristol-based virtual reality computer technology company, is
raising Pounds 9.6m through a 3-for-10 rights issue of up to 10.1m shares at
100p each.
The shares closed 13p up at 133p yesterday.
At the same time, Division, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in May
last year at 40p a share, estimated that it would carry a pre-tax loss of
not more than Pounds 1.44m in the year to October 31, against a Pounds
503,000 deficit last time.
The full-year loss, which reflects heavy investment in product development
and marketing, was foreshadowed at the interim stage.
The company said yesterday that sales for the second half of the year, 'have
followed the trend of earlier years with strong underlying growth
continuing.'
Turnover for the year is expected to have more than doubled to Pounds 5.27m
(Pounds 2.08m), boosted by strong growth in the group's blue-chip customer
base.
Mr Charles Grimsdale, managing director, said the new funds would be used
'to provide additional working capital and support the company's anticipated
growth, including future products.'
Since the flotation last year, which raised about Pounds 5m, Division has
made considerable progress in the development of new virtual reality
products and in particular, specialised 3-D graphics technology.
Last December it launched a new high-power graphics accelerator, based on
technology licensed from the University of North Carolina.
The VPX accelerator uses thousands of tiny micro-processors working in
parallel to compute images on a screen and has been sold mainly for
engineering, training and scientific applications.
The issue has been underwritten by Albert E Sharp.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Shares slip just 3p as Asprey falls to
Pounds 3.01m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Asprey slipped a mere 3p to 141p yesterday - their smallest fall
for some time in response to company announcements, press reports or market
rumours.
This time the Queen's jeweller was revealing a sharp pre-tax profits tumble
from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 3.01m in the six months to September 30. Group
turnover declined to Pounds 82m (Pounds 87.4m).
The downturn was foreshadowed in September when the company said the absence
of a few high-spending customers would depress profits. That day shares fell
110p to 200p.
However, Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said that although the six
months had been disappointing, with a lack of big-ticket sales in New York,
Switzerland and Paris, the weeks since the warning had shown a small
improvement.
Mr Arnaud Bumberger, managing director of Cartier in the UK, part of the
Vendome luxury products group, agreed that customers for the most expensive
products were a 'very small and confidential world' and, as such, volatile.
However, he stressed that his company was not suffering similar problems to
Asprey, 'though nobody knows what will happen next year'. Vendome's interims
are due out on December 2.
Asprey's share price has declined further since September, as the group has
been buffeted by City rumours, which it has been swift to deny, and a leaked
and altered memorandum from its bankers, the Bank of Scotland, about its
financial position.
Mr Attallah said yesterday that he wanted to have a 'good relationship with
the City', but that if the shares continued to decline, 'we will buy the
shares back'. The Asprey family speaks for some 52 per cent of the stock,
lifted yesterday by 170,000 shares bought by Mr John Asprey, chairman, at
143p.
The expansion downmarket of the customer base was now over, Mr Attallah
added.
Stock rose from an 'ideal' Pounds 135m at the year-end to Pounds 147m
(Pounds 127m), but should decline if recent trading improvements continue.
Its most expensive item, a Burma ruby and diamond suite of jewellery,
retails at more than Pounds 4m. Debt at September 30 was Pounds 35.6m,
giving gearing up from 14.5 to 22.6 per cent. Mr Attallah said he was
'happy' with that but would not want to see it rise further.
Interest payable was flat at Pounds 1.07m. Interest receivable and rents
dropped to Pounds 392,000 (Pounds 1.08m). Earnings fell to 0.14p (8.04p) per
share with the interim dividend held at 1.25p.

<TEXT>
A growing number of permanent jobs in the south of England contributed to a
fourfold increase in pre-tax profits at Reed Executive, the UK's largest
employment agency.
The company yesterday announced profits of Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 457,000) on
turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 23.2m) in the third quarter.
Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said: 'Employers are worried about retaining staff
and are valuing certain temporary staff more. This helps our margins because
people are not so interested in negotiating fees.'
Earnings per share rose to 2.7p (0.4p) in the quarter.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Harrisons seeks to rein in expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield shares dropped 8 per cent yesterday as the chemicals,
commodities and building supplies company sought to rein in profit
expectations for the second consecutive year.
Mr Martin Anderson, finance director, said the expected recovery in pig
prices had not materialised in the second half, and malt margins remained
depressed. In addition, profits would be hit by a Pounds 10m rationalisation
charge. As a result, he said, analysts' profit expectations might have been
too high.
Harrisons had also sought to clear up confusion about the impact of
disposals completed this year, which have netted the company about Pounds
134m.
Analysts cut profit forecasts from about Pounds 115m to less than Pounds
90m, excluding the disposal proceeds.
The share price dropped 13p to 149p, a far sharper fall than the 2 per cent
decline in the overall market.
'It is a litany of mini-disasters,' said one analyst. 'The management is
definitely on trial now.' Last year forecasts were pulled back by about
Pounds 5m after a similar trading statement.
The analyst speculated that further disappointment from Harrisons could
leave it open to a possible takeover bid. It is known that at least one
large company has examined the possibility of a break-up bid in the last 18
months.
Mr Anderson said Harrisons expected to incur losses of about Pounds 3.5m in
the pigs business this year, similar to last time.
The chemicals division was having a mixed year, with pressure on margins
from higher raw material costs in some sectors and solid advances in others.
Mr Anderson said that the UK building supplies business had experienced
strong first-half growth. The US building supplies business was ahead of
last year.
Profits from the Papua New Guinea plantation would be lower in the second
half.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: SmithKline to merge international divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham is to merge its three international divisions into one
called SB Healthcare International.
The reorganisation covers all operations outside Europe and north America
with total sales of about Pounds 1.3bn, 20 per cent of the whole business.
It combines the resources of SmithKline's consumer healthcare and
pharmaceuticals divisions with the Sterling Health over-the-counter
medicines unit acquired in August.
SmithKline will cut duplication of resources, especially in Asia and Latin
America, but no figures were available yesterday.
The company used external consultants to evaluate which parts of each
division would survive.
Mr Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, said that this was to ensure
fairness. 'We treated all three divisions equally. Sterling was not a second
class citizen.'
He acknowledged that this was 'a surprise' for some people.
The reorganisation comes as the company completes a Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds
4.7bn) series of acquisitions and disposals culminating yesterday in the
Dollars 1.45bn sale of its animal health business to Pfizer of the US.
Mr Leschly said that the reorganisation was a signal that the main
management effort would now be on extracting the most from Sterling Health
and Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US drug distributor, which have
been acquired over the past six months.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Margins slip at Courtaulds - Grimsby chosen
ahead of Munich for Pounds 90m Tencel production plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds has chosen Grimsby, Humberside, as the site for its European
production plant for Tencel, its new man-made fibre. The plant, which will
initially create 120 jobs, will cost Pounds 90m, of which Pounds 10m has
been provided as a grant by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said it was 'a very close run thing'
between Grimsby and a site near Munich, where greater financial assistance
was offered.
The decision was announced as Courtaulds reported a fall in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 80.7m (Pounds 96.1m) for the half year to September 30. The result
last time, however, was boosted by profits of Pounds 24.4m from the sale or
closure of discontinued operations, partly offset by Pounds 4.1m
restructuring charges.
Operating profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 86.4m reflecting Courtaulds'
inability to pass on sharp increases in raw materials costs, particularly
for viscose and acrylic fibres. Mr Huismans warned that the effects would be
more marked in the second half although it planned to increase its fibre
prices by between 5 and 15 per cent from January 1.
'I am very confident that all will be recovered. Nothing goes up as rapidly
as this without a rapid reversal.'
Although demand was generally firm, operating margins in all three division
slipped. But excluding the new European fibres joint venture with Hoechst
the group figure was steady at 8.9 per cent. Turnover was flat at Pounds
1.03bn.
Earnings per share were 15p (14.8p) excluding exceptionals and the dividend
is 4.15p (4p).
Profits from fibres and chemicals were little changed at Pounds 42m (Pounds
41m) held back by stiff competition, particularly in the US, and increased
marketing and development costs on Tencel. As expected, these outweighed
Tencel's trading profits but it is now making a positive contribution.
Courtaulds announced a joint venture with Akzo Nobel to develop a filament
yarn version of Tencel.
Polymer products profits dropped to Pounds 14m (Pounds 18m), reflecting the
end of the light armoured vehicle contract, but coatings and sealants were
unchanged at Pounds 36m.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 15m to Pounds 8m, thanks partly to the
elimination of unwanted swaps. Capital expenditure rose to Pounds 69m
(Pounds 55m).
COMMENT
Courtaulds' shares have had a bad run over the last few months as the City
has watched its raw materials costs soar. So the solid figures provided some
reassurance. Although the impact will be greater in the second half, costs
appear to have peaked and the other main fibre producers seem determined to
push up prices. Courtaulds tends to outperform late in the cycle and as
investors tire of the early risers its shares should make up lost ground. On
a multiple of about 14.5, assuming full-year profits of Pounds 170m, they
take little account of Tencel's potential.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northern banks to offer own financial
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three UK banking subsidiaries of National Australia Bank - Yorkshire
Bank, Clydesdale Bank and Northern Bank - are to become 'bancassurers',
selling their own financial services policies through their branch networks
from late next year.
Their move marks a further sharpening of competition among high street
financial institutions to sell life insurance and investment products to
their retail banking customers.
The UK's two largest building societies - Halifax and Nationwide - are
scheduled to launch wholly-owned life subsidiaries next year.
The products offered by the three banks will all be designed, processed and
underwritten within National Australia Life, part of the parent
organisation. But they will almost certainly be branded and marketed as
products provided by each bank to its own customers.
Final approval for the project was given recently and the group has begun
recruiting for its customer service centre in Glasgow.
At present, the three banks offer independent financial advice for life and
investment products, but this is a small-scale and specialised service,
involving only about 100 staff.
The intention is to meet the financial needs of most of the banks' 3.5m
customers with a relatively simple range of products. Independent advice
will still be offered as a separate, niche service for those whose
circumstances are more complex.
Mr Ross Pinney, chief executive of National Australia Life, said he expected
the banks to be able to meet the financial needs of a much higher proportion
of their customers than at present.
'Many of our customers are not coming to us for financial advice, because
they are not even aware that we offer life insurance products,' he said.
The group should benefit not just via an extra stream of income coming
through the branch networks, but also through keeping all the profit from
manufacturing the policies as well as distributing them.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Porton poised for takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beaufour Ipsen, the family-owned French pharmaceuticals company, should find
out today whether its Pounds 65.5m recommended takeover bid for Porton
International, one of the UK's first biotechnology companies, has been
successful.
Shareholders holding 60.2 per cent of Porton's shares, which are traded
under the Stock Exchanges's Rule 4.2, have already given irrevocable
undertakings to accept the French bid, worth Pounds 13.40 in cash or notes.
Of those investors, the largest stake is held by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie,
Porton's founder and ex-chairman, who stands to receive about Pounds 24m for
his 36.6 per cent stake in the private company.
Under a separate deal Beaufour will pick up an additional 6 per cent stake
in Porton, lifting the total tranche covered by irrevocable undertakings to
66.2 per cent. Many of Porton's institutional investors, which sank Pounds
76m into the group during the 1980s but have been disappointed by its
financial performance, are understood to be keen to sell their holdings.
Porton's management is expected to take an initial 22 per cent stake in
Speywood Holdings, a company set up by Beaufour to make the acquisition. The
French group has set a 3pm deadline today to receive more than 90 per cent
acceptances for its offer, which has been recommended by Kleinwort Benson,
Porton's financial advisers.
A potential rival offer for Porton from Scotgen Pharmaceuticals, the
Anglo-US drugs company, has failed to materialise.

FT  24 NOV 94 / SmithKline makes Dollars 1.45bn sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the UK drugs company, yesterday agreed to sell its
animal health business to US rival Pfizer and called a halt to the Dollars
7.7bn of corporate transactions it began last May.
The Dollars 1.45bn (Pounds 920m) deal is the biggest acquisition ever made
by Pfizer, the fourth biggest US drugs company, and signals its intention to
grow through takeovers.
'We have several core health businesses, and we're looking for acquisitions
in all of them,' said Mr William Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief
executive officer.
Mr Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, said the disposal was probably
the last corporate deal for the moment.
Since Mr Leschly was appointed in April, SmithKline has spent Dollars 5.2bn
on buying Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, a US drugs distributor, and
Sterling Health. It later sold the north American operations of Sterling to
Bayer, the German chemicals company.
'I can't rule out further acquisitions, but what's next is to make sure that
we make the most of our investments through synergy and restructuring,' said
Mr Leschly.
That restructuring has already started, with the merging of all businesses
outside Europe and north America into a single division called SB Healthcare
International, he said.
With the purchase, Pfizer will control the world's biggest animal healthcare
business, ahead of Rhone-Merieux of France, according to Mr Matthew
Phillips, animal health sector analyst with London stockbroker Wood
Mackenzie.
SmithKline's animal health business had sales in 1993 of Dollars 614m and
operating profits of Dollars 104m. Pfizer's division had Dollars 578m in
sales, Dollars 37.5m in operating profits and is growing more slowly than
SmithKline's.
With this deal, Pfizer is buying an entry into European and Australian
markets to complement its strengths in the US and Japan. It will also add
animal vaccines and pet medicines to its product portfolio.
The companies said the transaction would not dilute earnings.
The sale should more than halve SmithKline's gearing. Last September, the
company expected year-end gearing to be 250 to 300 per cent. However, after
this sale it should fall to about 120 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Wall Street fall-out gives little cause for thanks: The
falling dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment Cassandras have been proclaiming that the US stock market has
been overvalued for two years or more, but Wall Street has stubbornly
refused to pay attention.
This week may have seen the turning point. On Tuesday the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged more than 90 points, its biggest fall since the
Federal Reserve first raised interest rates and sparked a stock market
decline in early February.
The frenzied selling in Tuesday's final hour of trading, coming after a
similar sharp decline late on Monday, indicated that something was seriously
wrong with the US market. Just how wrong remains to be seen, but Wall
Sreet's hopes for a traditional December rally in share prices are fading.
European and Asian equity markets have been almost powerless to resist in
the face of the US declines. In some cases, such as Hong Kong, there is a
direct interest rate and currency link with the US, which often turns the
local stock market into a more volatile version of Wall Street.
In Europe, the health of the US economy has a direct impact on corporate
profits. If the Fed's increases in interest rates do slow the US economy,
'the result will be a net negative for the rest of the world both in terms
of lost exports to the US and lower corporate profits earned by US
subsidiaries', said Mr Peter Lyon, chief strategist at securities house
Smith New Court.
With US investors also playing an important part in world capital flows, it
is hard to see how European and Asian markets can escape from Wall Street's
influence. So the immediate prospects for world markets depend on events in
the US.
This week's losses, while well short of Crash proportions, have left
traders, investors and analysts rattled. The Dow lost 3.6 per cent of its
value on Monday and Tuesday, the largest two-day decline since March.
The selling was so intense that the New York Stock Exchange's 'circuit
breakers', which limit computerised program trading during volatile markets,
proved totally ineffective. Yesterday, the market's mood remained grim, and
analysts were speculating whether the Dow would soon test its year low of
just above 3,600.
Until this week, the Dow had outperformed the rest of the market by some
margin. At the start of the week, it was up 1.6 per cent on the year, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 - a much broader measure of the market - was down
1 per cent. The main indices of financial, transportation, and utilities
stocks were down 10 per cent, 17 per cent, and 24 per cent respectively.
The Dow held up so well this year because investors had been buying cyclical
stocks - which make up a large part of the Dow average - in the hope of
riding the coat-tails of strong economic recovery.
However, late on Monday, investors - their confidence in the economic
outlook undermined by last week's interest rate rise - began to sell
cyclicals. The Fed's move on November 15 was the sixth (and possibly not the
last) tightening of monetary policy in 1994, and the largest rate increase
in more than a decade.
This, says Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus fund group in New
York, scared investors. 'The Dow has a lot of cyclical stocks in it, and the
cyclicals were outperforming on the basis of a strong economic recovery. But
then the Fed tightened aggressively, to the point where the fear of weaker
earnings and recession in 1995 spread.'
On top of the concern about further rate increases and a weakening in
economic and earnings growth, there was a growing realisation on Wall Street
that investors may be ready to switch their money out of shares and into
bonds because of the more attractive yields available on the latter.
As one fund manager said on Tuesday: 'People are finally understanding that
it's better to get 7.5 per cent guaranteed by the government than a 3 per
cent dividend from a stock.' US dividend yields are still low in historical
terms, and indeed are little better than those prevailing at the time of the
1987 crash.
This week Morgan Stanley cut its recommended allocation of stocks in its
model portfolio from 97 per cent to 85 per cent, and Dean Witter Reynolds
raised the bond portion of its model from 35 per cent to 50 per cent.
By yesterday, it was clear the bond market was already benefiting from the
switch out of stocks. For the second consecutive day, bond prices rose as
share prices dropped. After one of its worst declines ever, the bond market
now appears poised to capitalise on the stock market's woes.
The US stock market has also been unsettled by the uncertain political
situation in Washington, where the Republicans who recently took control of
Congress are talking of cutting taxes and increasing defence spending. To
investors, this sounds like a recipe for higher budget deficits and initial
Republican threats to delay a vote on the Gatt trade agreement also upset
the market.
Today's Thanksgiving holiday may be a welcome break for investors and
traders on both sides of the Atlantic. But those bulls who were counting on
a Dow rally through 4,000 by Christmas may feel queasy as they tuck into
their turkey.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Granada focuses on expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Granada group is considering expansion in continental Europe through
acquisitions in catering and services.
The new focus was revealed yesterday as the television, leisure and services
group announced a record pre-tax profit of Pounds 265m for the 52 weeks to
October 1 - a rise of 51 per cent.
Granada, following the failure of its attempts to acquire Gardner Merchant,
the catering group, is faced with the prospect of increasing profits and a
debt-free business within three years if it makes no new significant
acquisitions.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We might look at European
motorways, European catering businesses and public catering.'
The group, one of the largest ITV companies owning Granada Television and
London Weekend Television, can add little to its UK television interests
without a change in regulations.
Mr Robinson said: 'The most likely outcome is that we don't have
acquisitions over the next 18 months. I would like that not to be true but
it will only not be true if we find the right thing.' He conceded the
company might have to return more money to shareholders if the right deals
do not come along.
Yesterday Granada reported strong growth both in its existing businesses and
in the year's two most recent large acquisitions - Sutcliffe Catering and
LWT.
Mr Robinson was bullish about the future. He said the company looked forward
to 1995 with confidence 'in our ability to improve margins and with
expectation that our own capacity to generate organic growth from our
principal businesses will be enhanced by an improving economy'.
Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.09bn and operating profit grew by 46
per cent to Pounds 299m. Fully diluted earnings per share rose29 per cent to
32p. The dividend was lifted 14 per cent to 10p.
If the British Sky Broadcasting flotation goes ahead at the mid-price
Granada will get rid of around Pounds 120m in contingency liabilities plus a
total of around Pounds 40m in cash.
Some analysts are now looking for around Pounds 317m in profit in the
current financial year.
Yesterday Granada shares closed unchanged at 516p, after touching a high of
524p earlier in the day.

FT  24 NOV 94 / National Grid raises payout to recs 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Grid, the England and Wales power transmission company, is to
increase its interim dividend to the regional electricity companies (recs)
which own it by 17 per cent to Pounds 54m.
The Grid is expected to be floated on the stock exchange next summer.
The rise is in spite of a 6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
285.3m to Pounds 267.1m. The profits fall was partly the result of a Pounds
33.3m premium paid on the early redemption of Pounds 300m of government
debt.
Analysts warned against drawing strong conclusions about the full-year
dividend. However most said the results were in line, or slightly above
expectations, after taking one-off factors into account. Most analysts were
impressed by a 10 per cent cut in controllable costs at the core business.
The flotation price of the company will depend on how much debt the recs put
into the National Grid but one analyst said Pounds 4.2bn seemed the base
figure with the likelihood that it could be as high as Pounds 5bn.
The recs are discussing flotation plans with the government, which holds a
golden share in the National Grid, and are likely to announce details of a
flotation within the next few months.
The flotation is likely to take the form of a demerger whereby shareholders
in the recs would be given new shares in the Grid. The recs are expected to
load the company with debt of about Pounds 750m to help pay a Pounds 1bn tax
bill and consumer rebates of more than Pounds 200m.
Mr David Jefferies, Grid chairman, refused to comment on the flotation,
saying no decisions had been made.
In the six months to September 30, operating profits rose from Pounds 310.1m
to Pounds 322m on turnover of Pounds 674.9m (Pounds 686.9m).
The company said that if the debt redemption premium and its effects were
excluded from the results, the underlying increase in pre-tax profits was
4.1 per cent.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 186.9m, up Pounds 13m on last year, and of
this Pounds 89m related to Energis, the telecommunications company being
built by the Grid. The comparable spending on Energis last year was Pounds
30m. Energis made a loss during the period of Pounds 19.2m, against a loss
of Pounds 4.8m.
Staff numbers, excluding Energis fell 8.8 per cent to 4,612. Mr Jefferies
said about 4,300 was likely by the year-end.
Net debt was Pounds 135.4m at September 30.

FT  24 NOV 94 / US unit lifts Tate &amp; Lyle to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from US cereal sweeteners and starches helped Tate &amp;
Lyle overcome weaker US sugar markets and modest growth in Europe to report
a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to a record Pounds 273.8m for the year
ended September.
The main factor behind the rise was the turnround at Staley, the US
subsidiary it acquired in 1988 for Dollars 1.2bn. It reported a record
profit thanks to higher volumes, strong demand particularly from the soft
drink makers, new uses for starch and lower costs. The upturn came after
several years of labour disputes over working practices at its Decatur,
Illinois plant.
Staley's profits, however, masked a downturn in the group's sugar profits in
the US where margins were eroded by record beet supplies.
Tate &amp; Lyle declined to give specific figures in line with a decision to
reduce the data it publishes. 'We believe it's detrimental to the business'
to give more information than do competitors, many of which are private
companies, Sir Neil Shaw, chairman, said. Several analysts said they found
it difficult to split out the figures to assess fully the results.
Operating profits from North American sweeteners and starches rose 31 per
cent to Pounds 147.6m on sales ahead 13 per cent at Pounds 1.64bn. In the
past the group gave separate figures for cereal sweeteners and starches, US
sugar and Canadian sugar.
European profits from sweeteners and starches rose 5 per cent to Pounds
136.5m on a similar rise in sales to Pounds 1.3bn. In the UK profits 'held
up well' with sales to industrial customers rising but exports falling.
Amylum, its European cereals subsidiary, enjoyed strong sweetener profits
but weaker starch profits.
Profits from sweeteners and starches in the rest of the world rose 32 per
cent to Pounds 20.8m on a 54 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 513.2m.
Bundaberg, the Australian sugar miller acquired in 1991, performed strongly.
The board recommended a final dividend of 9.8p making 14.4p for the year, up
11 per cent. Earnings per share were up 13 per cent at 37.1p fully diluted
against 32.7p a year earlier, reflecting higher minorities and a tax charge
of 27 per cent against 25 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UN warns of human catastrophe as Serb forces battle into
Bihac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations warned last night of a potential humanitarian catastrophe
as Serb forces, defying a fresh wave of air strikes by Nato, fought their
way into the north Bosnian town of Bihac, a UN-protected area.
Nato bombers struck Serb anti-aircraft batteries in three places yesterday,
implementing tough new rules of engagement that were secretly agreed with
the UN on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the senior UN official in former Yugoslavia,
said he had worked out a peace plan for Bihac with Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic which he would put to all the warring parties. He also
said he had secured agreement for a convoy to supply the 1,000 Bangladeshi
UN peace-keepers trapped in the enclave.
However, it was unclear whether any plan put together in Belgrade would halt
the fighting on the ground. Mr Akashi also apparently failed to get
permission for passage of emergency food supplies to 180,000 Moslems trapped
in Bihac.
Earlier, Nato ambassadors, under pressure from France and the US, had held
emergency talks in Brussels on how they could stop Bihac falling. They also
considered a plan to implement a total UN withdrawal from Bosnia, which has
been prepared over several months.
The prospect of a 'nightmare scenario' was raised by the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees as thousands poured into Bihac town from outlying
villages which have fallen to the Serbs.
Mr Kris Janowski, a UNHCR spokesman, said food and water could run out if
the town, virtually cut off from emergency provisions for several months,
became overcrowded.
Russia, breaking ranks with the US and western Europe, cautioned against
'excessive use of force' by Nato and announced a diplomatic initiative on
Bosnia by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister.
Itar-Tass news agency said Mr Kozyrev would go to Belgrade and parts of
former Yugoslavia after talks with the German government in Bonn tomorrow.
Nato bombers struck Serb anti-aircraft positions near the towns of Otoka and
Bosanska Krupa in Bosnia and at Dvor in Croatia, in two separate missions.
They initially intended to aim only at Otoka - in retaliation for an attack
on UK fighters on Tuesday - but broadened their aim after Serb radar locked
on to Nato reconnaissance aircraft.
Bosnian government radio described the situation in Bihac as 'real hell',
saying that 'the Serbs are shelling the town itself, and refugees are
pouring into the very centre of Bihac'.
UN officials - who in the past have accused the Bosnian government of
exaggerating the extent of Serb assaults - confirmed that fighting had
spread to the town. Mr Alexander Ivanko, a UN spokesman, said the Serbs were
backing up their infantry with artillery fire from Mount Grabez, a strategic
position outside the town.

FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle is difficult enough to understand at the best of times;
yesterday's decision to present less detailed segmental information is a
retrograde step. The move may be justified commercially, but it will hardly
help Tate dispel investors' doubts about the quality of its earnings. These
have long been viewed as vulnerable to swings in the commodity-like markets
in which Tate operates.
That said, the swings in the last financial year worked decidedly in
shareholders' favour. Pre-tax profits were at the top end of analysts'
expectations and the dividend was up by a generous 10.8 per cent. But with
the shares up 18 per cent against the market this year, and a 20 per cent
yield premium to the market converted to a small discount, this kind of
earnings performance has already been anticipated. The question now is the
extent to which the profits momentum can be maintained in the current year.
The pointers are good. The favourable supply/demand equilibrium in north
American and European starch and sweetener markets seems set to continue.
There is likely to be a modest recovery in the US sugar market. Elsewhere in
the group there is ample scope for loss elimination - for example, at
recently acquired Orsan - and for cost-cutting. Healthy cash-flow will
enable Tate to pursue further acquisition opportunities and pay a
substantially higher dividend. Tate will remain a core holding,
notwithstanding the greater obscurity of its accounting.

FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada has become the latest British group to toy with the idea of buying
back its shares or paying special dividends. Doing so is clearly not its
priority. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, would much prefer to find more
acquisitions into which to pour his energies. Indeed, the evidence to date
on the LWT and Sutcliffe purchases seems to show that Granada is adept at
adding value through acquisition. The snag is that suitable avenues for
expansion are hard to find. During the summer, caterer Gardner Merchant
spurned Granada's advances; moreover, the government is unlikely soon to
change rules preventing the group buying another ITV company. As a result,
Granada is having to scout around for catering acquisitions on the continent
 -so far with no luck.
Meanwhile, the company generates cash at a prodigious rate. If no further
acquisitions are made, Granada will be debt-free in three years and still
hold a Pounds 400m investment in BSkyB. Under such a scenario, share
buy-backs would clearly be sensible. Investors should also be reassured by
the implication that the management is not so desperate for deals that it
will overpay. Yesterday's preliminary results show how tightly the business
is being managed. The improvement in margins was particularly gratifying.
But it is hard to argue that Granada is undervalued. The predictability of
its rental and catering arms may compensate for their dullness. But a
prospective price/earnings premium to the market of around 10 per cent looks
large enough.

FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Pfizer/SB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham may justify the disposal of its animal health business by
insisting it wants to concentrate on human health. But yesterday's sale to
Pfizer was motivated more by financial needs than industrial strategy.
Although the deal may prove marginally dilutive, that will be more than
offset by the balance sheet impact of Pounds 700m in net cash. By year-end,
gearing should have fallen from a peak of nearly 350 per cent to just 120
per cent.
Pfizer's desire to leap from number six to the top spot in animal health
appears initially puzzling. After all, the sector's low margins and
relatively slow growth mean it has always been a poor cousin to human
health. However annual growth of the US pharmaceuticals market has
decelerated to just 5 per cent, little more than animal health's 3 per cent.
Moreover, the mix of SB's business means that during the last three years
its division has enjoyed average growth of 10 per cent and margins of 17 per
cent. That will give Pfizer's operations, whose margins fell from 18.6 per
cent in 1990 to just 6.4 per cent last year, a substantial shot in the arm.
Whether Pfizer has overpaid is unclear: the acquisition is unprecedented in
the animal health industry. The multiple of 22 times historic earnings is
probably justified by the business fit. There is little product overlap and
fine geographical synergy given SB's strength in Europe and Australasia and
Pfizer's in South America and Japan. Given the fragmented state of the
animal health industry and the continuing turmoil in the drugs industry as a
whole, this is unlikely to be the sector's last deal.

FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Dow but not out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street has defied gravity all year. Though world bond markets and most
other equity markets have tumbled, the Dow had stayed remarkably steady. One
could view this week's slide as Wall Street catching up. Compared with bond
yields of 8 per cent, the 3 per cent pay-out on shares was looking a bit
mean. It also seems reasonable to shade down estimates of corporate earnings
growth to take account of the latest rise in short-term interest rates. The
growing feeling that a Republican Congress was more of a menace than a boon
to industry hardly helped.
The knock-on effect on British and other European equities seems less to do
with fundamentals than sentiment. True, any slowdown in the US will harm
exports and reduce the earnings multinationals receive from their American
subsidiaries. But UK equities have already fallen this year. Moreover, the
spread between gilts and Treasury bonds has narrowed in recent months. So
the ratio between bond and equity yields in Britain is not as stretched as
in the US. The same is true in much of the rest of Europe. Perhaps one
should not even be too worried about Wall Street. Two promising features
this week have been the rally in US bond markets and the firmness of the
dollar. If they continue, funds which have been flowing out of US markets
all year may start returning. Japanese investors, in particular, may be
tempted back into dollar assets. It will not take a very large bond rally
for Wall Street to look reasonably priced.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Government to set standards for cleaning contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is set to announce proposals for dealing with contaminated
land that are expected to cut the cost to industry of cleaning up polluted
sites.
Under the plans, to be announced soon, polluted sites will only need to be
cleaned to a standard suitable for their intended use and not restored to
their original, unspoilt state.
For example, land intended for use as a car park would not need to be
cleaned to the same standard as a site on which a school is to be built. By
setting such a standard, government hopes business will avoid the huge
clean-up costs encountered in countries, such as the US, which have taken a
tougher stance on industrial pollution.
Legislation is expected to follow principles laid down in a consultation
paper issued in March. It drew fierce criticism from environmental groups
but a cautious welcome from business.
Local authorities will be instructed to keep a record of all significantly
polluted sites in their area. But registration will be based on actual
rather than potential contamination.
Last year the government dropped controversial plans for public registers of
potentially contaminated sites, based on the past uses of the land.
Landowners and property developers argued such registers would have blighted
formerly industrialised regions and pushed development on to green field
sites.
In March, the government said that in some circumstances banks should be
liable for pollution caused by companies to which they made loans.
However, it is thought to have softened its line after banks argued that
lender liability could discourage investment in industry. Legislation on
contaminated land will be included in the environment and countryside bill.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Maxwell lawyers say media made fair trial impossible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence lawyers are seeking to have the Maxwell brothers' trial on fraud and
other charges called off on the grounds that publicity over the Maxwell
affair has made a fair trial impossible.
The attempt to halt the criminal proceedings against Kevin and Ian Maxwell
was disclosed in court for the first time yesterday when the Serious Fraud
Office applied for a reporting ban on a current High Court case concerning
Maxwell pension fund assets used to raise a Pounds 50m loan.
A successful SFO application would rule out any reporting of the attempt by
UK pensioners to recover Pounds 60m from Credit Suisse bank, which accepted
the assets as collateral for the loan. The SFO said the ban was necessary to
avoid prejudicing the trials, to start after Easter next year.
The Credit Suisse case is expected to end next summer, but if the SFO
succeeds, pensioners could be left in ignorance of the result for a further
two years, their lawyers argued.
Mr Justice Lindsay, the Credit Suisse case judge, rejected an SFO request
for reporting restrictions on yesterday's hearing.
Arguments over calling off the criminal proceedings against all defendants
in the Maxwell fraud trial will be heard in January.
First in line for trial will be four of the six facing various fraud charges
 -Kevin and Ian Maxwell, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, former adviser to Mr Robert
Maxwell, and Mr Robert Bunn, former finance director of Maxwell
Communication Corporation.
In the first trial, Kevin Maxwell will face two charges of a total nine
alleging conspiracy to defraud over pension fund assets. Ian Maxwell, Mr
Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn will face one charge of conspiracy to defraud.
Further proceedings against the four and two former Robert Maxwell
employees, Mr Michael Stoney, a former Mirror Group Newspapers finance
director, and Mr Albert Fuller, a former MGN treasurer, are set to follow.
Mr Michael Crystal QC, for the Mirror Group Pension Fund Trustees, argued
against a blanket reporting ban on the Credit Suisse proceedings. He said
the proceedings might last until 1997 and the order could prevent pensioners
being informed of the result of their action, he said.
The trustees and the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the
main Maxwell pension management company, are suing Credit Suisse.
Ten national newspapers are opposing the SFO application. The hearing was
adjourned until December 5.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Ripple effect of Tokyo's Big Bang: Gerard Baker examines the
implications of allowing Japan's leading banks to open securities companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This morning, Japan's stockbrokers will be bracing themselves. As they wait
to see how the plunging Tokyo market reacts to the latest collapses in world
stock markets, a serious threat to the brokers' viability is being launched.
Japan's leading banks are to open the doors of their own securities
companies for the first time, ushering in the most radical upheaval yet in
the country's financial system.
While banks such as Sumitomo and Mitsubishi have been running securities
operations in foreign markets for years, they have been forbidden to sell
stocks or bonds in Japan. But today subsidiaries of the six big retail banks
will join those of a few smaller banks which were admitted to the securities
market last year.
This big step towards universal banking was made possible by changes last
year to Article 65 of the Securities Exchange Law, Japan's equivalent of the
US Glass-Steagall act, which prevented banks from undertaking brokerage
activity.
The catalyst for the change was the move by companies towards issuing bonds,
rather than borrowing from banks, as a way of raising finance. As a result,
banks began pushing the Ministry of Finance to allow them a slice of the
bond-issuance business.
Aware of the damage that this would cause to existing brokers, the ministry
decided to limit the banks' subsidiaries, initially, to bond underwriting
and sales.
Though the banks are not yet permitted to compete with the brokers in their
core business of equity trading, the competition for bond business will hurt
their rivals. So far this year, the subsidiaries of the smaller long-term
credit banks have taken nearly 10 per cent of the bond issuance market, and
the larger banks are certain to grab a much larger share.
For a while, the finance ministry placated the brokers by arguing that the
relaxation would result in a larger market for everyone. The banks, too,
maintained the fiction, saying they posed no threat to their new rivals. But
in the last few weeks, the pretence has been dropped.
'This is going to be very competitive. Brokers are very concerned about what
will happen to their business as the banks enter the market,' said Mr Kaname
Seki, managing director of the Japan Securities Dealers Association.
A slump in Tokyo's securities business has already devastated stockbrokers.
Securities companies went from a combined pre-tax profit of Y2,200bn in 1989
to a loss of Y470bn in 1992. A slight recovery last year looks likely to be
wiped out in 1994.
At first sight, Japan's four broking behemoths, Nomura, Nikko, Yamaichi and
Daiwa, look like the biggest losers: 15 per cent of their earnings came from
underwriting commissions last year, compared with an average of 6 per cent
for smaller and medium-sized brokers. But they are large enough to withstand
even a sizeable loss of business. And, as a result of a piece of reciprocal
deregulation, they have established trust banking subsidiaries which are
expected to provide significant compensation.
The real threat is to the smaller stockbrokers. Bonds represent a smaller
proportion of their business, but the arrival of the banks comes just as
their core equities business is hitting new lows.
The finance ministry has reduced new equity issues to a trickle in the past
two years, to avoid flooding the market. Worse still, in recent months
trading levels have fallen sharply. Trading volumes on the stock market have
declined from a peak of more than 1bn shares a day in 1988, to a recent low
of an average 300m a day for this year.
The collapse of trading has put brokers' margins under severe pressure. For
an average broker to make a profit, total trading needs to be in excess of
400m shares a day. Despite radical cost-cutting measures, including staff
reductions of nearly 30,000, or 20 per cent, in three years, brokers are
still losing money. In the past six months only 29 securities companies out
of 215 made a profit.
Losing out to the banks in bond issuance will turn these difficulties into a
crisis. One senior executive at a medium-sized broker said: 'We are now in a
race for customers, and I cannot see any other outcome than one in which the
banks win the race easily. Because our profits are so weak, banks can always
beat us on price, despite their size and higher costs.'
What most upsets brokers is what they see as the unfair advantages enjoyed
by the banks' subsidiaries. As well as having the world's largest financial
institutions backing them, they will have access to an enviable client base,
in that the banks' clients are expected to transfer their broking business
to the banks' subsidiaries.
The new companies are supposed to be divided from their parents by 'fire
walls', preventing the transfer of information from bank to broker. They
will not be allowed to tout for customers together, for example. But the
aggrieved brokers feel that most of the divisions are cosmetic - with one
rule preventing the subsidiaries' staff from wearing the same coloured
uniforms as those of the banks - and will not prevent subsidiaries from
exploiting their links with their parent banks.
'Though we are not allowed to exchange information, I should point out that,
of the 126 employees of DKB Securities, 124 came from DKB the bank,' said Mr
Yasuo Noda, president of DKB Securities, with a wry smile.
In two years the authorities are committed to reviewing the new framework,
but few in the industry think the outcome will be anything other than a
further extension of the banks' role. That leads most analysts to conclude
that the industry is in for a significant shakeout.
One medium-sized stockbroker, Cosmo, has already had to be rescued by a
bank. More are likely to follow. Even the banks seem prepared for it. Many
of the smaller companies are partly owned by banks and larger companies, and
many analysts expect these stakes to be expanded.
'Since the current difficulties for the smaller brokers are certain to get
worse,' said Mr Noda, 'further mergers and consolidation are bound to
happen.'
One opportunity for brokers could lie in the further deregulation of the
securities market, which might expand the volume of business by enough to
save most of them. They have been reluctant to press for wider deregulation
until now, since it would be likely to lead to a cut in the fixed
commissions they charge. But they may have little choice now.
A wide range of securities business is currently denied to the broking
sector. With deregulation, there are some relatively new markets that
brokers could tap, such as asset-backed securities and derivatives, both of
which are heavily restricted in Japan.
There would also be opportunities in a domestic secondary bond market,
almost non-existent at present due to the rules governing the registration
of bonds, which make it almost impossible to sell a bond once it has been
bought.
'If the arrival of the banks is accompanied by a genuine opening of the
whole securities market, then we have nothing to fear, and the real winner
will be the corporate customer,' said Mr Akira Ogino, a managing director of
Nomura Securities.
This suggests the intriguing possibility that financial deregulation, up to
now carefully controlled by the Ministry of Finance, might be developing a
momentum of its own. Tokyo's markets are still hidebound by restrictions
that deter domestic and foreign investors and limit the scope for raising
capital. 'The right thing to do now,' says Mr Seki, 'would be to press ahead
with wider deregulation quickly to enlarge the market and create genuinely
open competition.'
It is a happy coincidence of interest that the action that will probably be
necessary to save the skins of the country's brokers will be the same as
that needed to develop a capital market commensurate with the needs of the
world's second largest economy. The Ministry of Finance may find that it has
at last created a self-propelling liberalising machine.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Allies of circumstance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's air raids on Serb positions in Bosnia and Croatia, involving
dozens of aircraft from at least four nations, have at least in technical
terms been a spectacular demonstration of Nato's ability to marshal and
co-ordinate the use of force. It has taken 45 years, billions of dollars,
and great firmness of will to refine the procedures by which, for example,
US command systems can guide the activities of UK aircraft carriers or Dutch
bombers based in Italy.
Yet Nato is getting its first chance to show off these hard-won skills at
the very moment when the transatlantic solidarity on which it is based is
being questioned on both sides of the ocean. Precisely because Nato
succeeded so well in the purpose for which it was formed - facing down the
Soviet bloc - it is going through a profound existential crisis, of which
the latest arguments over Bosnia are only a symptom.
The role of aerial policeman in Bosnia is one that fell into Nato's lap and
does not suit the alliance particularly well. It leaves unresolved the
longer-term question of what, if anything, the alliance is for.
In the five years since the Berlin Wall came down, most debate about Nato's
future has been couched in euphemistic terms which underestimate the
seriousness of the problem. Commentators speak of new models for
'burden-sharing', and of Europe 'taking more responsibility for its own
defence' - as if the general nature of these burdens and responsibilities
was perfectly clear, and the only outstanding question was how precisely to
allocate them.
Regional challenges
Such clarity of purpose did broadly exist during the cold war, when the
Soviet threat was manifested on so many fronts that the common interest in
confronting it scarcely needed to be discussed. Today, however, there is no
overriding challenge which simultaneously, and in roughly equal measure,
threatens North America, western Europe and Turkey; instead there is a host
of regional challenges which affect different countries to a widely
differing extent.
For obvious reasons, the possibility of an extremist regime in North Africa
acquiring ballistic missiles is something that haunts Spain and Italy far
more vividly than it troubles Norway or Canada. Non-communist Russia remains
an uncomfortable neighbour for Norway, and a tough regional rival for
Turkey; but in the absence of any global east-west confrontation, both Oslo
and Ankara are finding it much harder than before to win understanding of
these concerns from their Nato partners. And on the issue of whether Nato
should expand eastwards - at the risk of upsetting Moscow - there is no
clear agreement within any of the leading western capitals, let alone among
the alliance as a whole.
Western unity
On the face of things, the Serbs of Croatia have done the western security
system a back-handed favour by mounting a series of air attacks which so
flagrantly violated UN resolutions that the international community had
little choice but to take action. At least for a moment, the Serbs goaded
the western allies into rediscovering the unity which they formerly
displayed in the face of the Soviet threat, and which had been conspicuously
lacking in the previous two weeks of ill-tempered sparring over the arms
embargo.
The US, its European allies and even - at least initially - Russia were able
to agree on the need to stop future air attacks on the Bosnian enclave of
Bihac. But there is no guarantee that this display of unity will be
maintained if Serb commanders decide to keep on testing it. Indeed, they may
well calculate that sooner or later the strains within the contact group
will resurface, and work to their advantage. The very survival of the
western security institutions may depend on making sure such calculations
are ill-founded.
In any case, the 16 members of Nato should not leave it to the Serbs of
Bosnia or Croatia, or any other provocateurs, to provide them with a sense
of purpose. To retain credibility, they need to take the initiative in
defining more clearly those areas where they still do perceive a common aim,
and those where they feel they can afford to differ.

Pfizer, the US drugs company, has just paid Dollars 1.45bn for SmithKline
Beecham's animal health business which includes a thriving sideline in

Come, come, Pfizer. If you are going to call a pet a 'companion animal',
surely a swine should be an ungulate omnivorous mammal. Even swine have

Pity the Earl of Longford, the veteran Labour peer and former cabinet
minister who has been championing the cause of penal reform for 50 years. He
despairs of securing any improvement while Michael Howard remains home
secretary.
Indeed, the normally restrained peer has dubbed Howard 'the prince of
darkness'. He is pinning his hopes on Home Office minister Baroness Blatch,
who helped remedy some of John Patten's mistakes when he was education
secretary. Longford calls her his 'angel of light'.

Someone in the Tory hierarchy has found an ingenious way of silencing the
Young Conservatives, the spotty rightwing ideologues who make Lady Thatcher
appear somewhat to the left of Tony Benn.
The dwindling band of teenage militants, long a thorn in the side of the
party leadership, have been told by Conservative Central Office that it will
no longer organise their annual conference. They can make their own
arrangements for next February's Southport jamboree.
To raise the necessary cash, the YCs - as they call themselves - have come
up with the clever wheeze of charging journalists Pounds 50 for the
privilege of covering the event. The only snag is that the main news
organisations are refusing to pay up and threatening instead to ignore the
youthful shenanigans.
Who says Central Office doesn't have bright ideas?

If November is going to be the warmest on record in Britain, what next?
Unfortunately, Bill Foggitt, the Thirsk weather sage, has been basking in
hospital during Britain's unseasonally warm autumn weather, so he has not
been able to sniff the air as much as he would wish.
Now recuperating at home, he reports that the recent mild autumn spell,
similar to those of 1944 and 1947, is not going to last. While the wet
October and November of this year were similar to those of last year, that
is where the similarity ends. Though last year's wet autumn was followed by
a white Christmas and an extremely cold February, Foggitt is not predicting
a white Christmas this year. It has happened in successive winters only once
this century, he says: in 1963 and 1964.

Whatever happened to Sir Peter Holmes? He has gone to ground since he
stepped down as chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell nearly 18 months ago.
Unlike his predecessors, such as Sir Peter Baxendell, who went on to chair
Hawker Siddeley, and 'Fearless Frank' McFadzean, who went on to head British
Airways and Rolls-Royce, Sir Peter has kept his head down.
At 62, he is still young enough to take his pick of chairmanships in the
public or private sector. But he seems to prefer spending his time trekking
in remote areas rather than networking in the City. It seems to run in the
family. His daughter, Martha Holmes, has just picked up an International
Emmy award for her documentary Life in the Freezer - the product of two
years spent in the Antarctic.

Indonesia's President Suharto is getting a reputation as a man who can get
things done.
Having made sure that the leaders at last week's Apec summit did not get
drenched - he laid on a pawang hujan (rain man) to pray for dry weather - he
seems to have been responsible for banging heads together at this week's
Opec conference.
Opec has been looking for a new secretary general since June and it seemed
as if the latest Opec meeting would pass without a decision; both Iran and
Venezuela wanted their man to get the job. However, Suharto broke the
deadlock with a phone call to Iran's President Rafsanjani urging him to
accept Nigeria's Rilwanu Lukman as Opec's next chief.
A slightly surprising choice - given Nigeria's reputation as Opec's bad boy
for consistently flouting production ceilings. Even so, the fact that Opec
can agree on something is bound to send the right sort of signal to the
world's oil markets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Silvio Berlusconi, currently the only leader of a G7 country waiting to be
grilled by anti-corruption magistrates, could learn a lesson or two from
Italy's Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca, the powerful Milan
merchant bank.
Cuccia, who celebrates his 87th birthday today, received a warning from
Ravenna magistrates in May that he and three other Mediobanca executives
were under investigation for alleged involvement in false corporate
reporting by Ferruzzi-Montedison, the troubled industrial group for which
the bank masterminded a rescue plan exactly a year ago.
Immediately, a terse press release (Mediobanca's first ever) was issued
denying the charges, and then there was complete silence.
In contrast, Berlusconi's reaction to the magistrates' warning was to record
an angry seven-minute speech, railing at almost everybody, and send it to
all Italy's television channels.
Result: Berlusconi loses credibility; Cuccia guards his.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The markets out of sorts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's giddy slide on Wall Street, which has precipitated sharp falls
in stock markets around the world, was surprising chiefly for its late
arrival. US equities have long looked fully valued and their resistance to
the pull of rising bond yields over the past 12 months had all the
appearance of financial levitation. That impression was reinforced by equity
investors' insouciant response to the tightening of US monetary policy since
February. Whatever happens in the short run, it is hard to believe that
stock prices can return to peak levels in a hurry. The more pressing
question is whether the slide will accelerate.
The starting point for any assessment must be the peculiarity of an economic
cycle in which securities markets have been heavily distorted by the efforts
of the US Federal Reserve to prevent a debt crisis turning into a credit
crunch. The means employed by the Fed to achieve this end was to maintain a
steep yield curve: short-term interest rates were kept low for an abnormally
long period relative to bond rates. Banks were thereby encouraged to borrow
cheaply to invest in higher yielding government IOUs. The resulting profits
helped restore their capital base, permitting them to finance the economic
recovery.
Mutual funds
The strength of the recovery is a measure of the success of the Fed's
earlier policy. Yet one important consequence of that policy was that savers
removed money from low-yielding bank deposit accounts and certificates of
deposits, and put them into bond and equity mutual funds, which offered
either a higher income or the prospect of capital growth. By last year the
mutual fund industry had acquired Dollars 670bn of equities and Dollars
760bn of bonds, in addition to its money market fund holdings of Dollars
580bn. Together these funds of nearly Dollars 2,000bn were equivalent to
about 85 per cent of all US bank deposits, against only 10 per cent in the
early 1980s.
The bond market collapse which followed the Fed's decision to start
tightening policy in February has already caused the flow of money into bond
mutual funds to dry up. The flow into equities has so far merely slowed
down. Yet the recent successive rises in US short-term rates point towards
lower equity valuations and a shift of mutual fund equity money back into
bonds and deposits.
Both in the US and across the world, economic recovery has proved far
stronger this year than most forecasters expected. That is one reason why
bond markets have worried about resurgent inflation and a rising cost of
capital, and why the Fed has been forced to take remedial action. The price
to be paid for pre-empting a further outbreak of inflation is a more
pedestrian growth rate next year. Corporate profits will inevitably take a
knock.
Gloomy story
The best reason for thinking that the present correction is not the end of
the gloomy story is the current pattern of returns in the financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been yielding less than 3 per cent
while two-year government paper offers well over 7 per cent, and 10-year
bonds offer nearly 8 per cent. The inflation-adjusted real rate of interest
is exceptionally high by historic standards. Its attractions for investors
are bolstered by Fed policy, which the futures markets expect to become
tougher still. Meantime money is flowing back into bank deposits. The
distortions wrought by the excessive accumulation of debt in the 1980s are
beginning to unwind.
The process nonetheless has a long way to go. For the rest of the world's
markets, that points to an unstable climate for equities, since they cannot
escape some backwash from Wall Street, even if their domestic economies are
at an earlier stage in the recovery cycle. Yet the fall in prices could
still prove beneficial if it helps free a flow of international capital that
has been disrupted by the weakness of the dollar.
Having lost billions on dollar bond holdings since the mid-1980s, Japanese
investors have been dollar shy. Their absence from US Treasury bonds has
contributed to higher real long-term interest rates. The fall in bond and
equity prices on Wall Street does at least help restore the competitiveness
of US assets by making them look cheaper to international investors, paving
the way for the much needed stabilisation of the dollar.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Personal View: There's no time like European time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boosting a country's prosperity is rather like keeping a company moving
forward. You must strive to increase revenues, to cut costs and to make
yourself more competitive. Do this and in financial terms you will live to
do more for your shareholders.
If into the bargain you can improve the quality of life of those you are
responsible for, you may even be liked as well - though that is asking a
lot] Which has led me to wonder if it would not be remiss of the government
to pass up an opportunity to bring in an extra Pounds 1bn a year for the
UK's tourism and leisure industries, boost business and employment
prospects, and consolidate the positions of London and Edinburgh as Europe's
pre-eminent financial centres, all without costing us a penny.
For that very opportunity is before us now.
It goes by various names and has appeared in different guises over the years
without ever quite making it on to the statute books. It is the remarkably
simple idea of putting our clocks forward by one hour throughout the year on
to what Eurotunnel is at present forced to call 'concession time'. This is
what we operate from Folkestone, and what the Home Office has laboriously
christened 'single/double summertime'.
A campaign to achieve this objective - unifying the UK with European Time -
was launched recently, with the aim of bringing forward a private member's
bill on the subject in the annual ballot that allows a backbench member of
Parliament to introduce a bill to the House of Commons.
The campaign, Daylight Extra . . . Now, is rightly pointing out the
advantages of an extra hour's daylight at the end of the day, when most of
us would notice the difference. Most notable is the reduction in road
accidents, evidence for which is provided by the Transport Research
Laboratory and endorsed by the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Accidents. There are also the greater opportunities for sport and leisure,
but from my commercial perspective there are other benefits too.
For a start, the change to synchronise UK time with that in continental
Europe would spell an end to the current absurdity whereby we enjoy a mere
four hours of overlap in working time with the continent of which we are
part and to which about three-fifths of our exports now go. Never do the 22
miles separating us seem so long as when you try to call a colleague in
Paris around 'lunchtime'.
But there is far more at stake than mere convenience. Putting the clocks
forward will synchronise Britain's financial markets with those of
continental Europe, it will confirm English as the main language of European
business and it will open up a precious 60 minutes of overlap in working
time with the tiger economies of the Far East.
British executives will also experience the novelty of attending normal
meetings in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva and Frankfurt without the
expensive and time-consuming process of flying over the night before to stay
in anonymous hotels.
The tourist industry, which is heavily dependent on daylight hours already,
would have its season extended - thereby encouraging the rapidly expanding
domestic market in off-peak and short-break holidays.
Small wonder then that the campaign has the backing of, among 130 others,
the Confederation of British Industry, British Tourist Authority and the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce.
It is time to break inertia's grip on our parliamentary decision makers, and
there is evidence to suggest that the grip is now slackening among MPs. Like
all matters that affect the way we live our lives - be it the compulsory
wearing of seat belts or imposing a smoking ban on public transport - there
is an inbuilt reluctance to shift from the status quo.
Ultimately, however, passive opposition in those examples was overcome and I
am confident it can be in this one.
As there was reluctance in Downing Street to include this measure in the
Queen's Speech, then let there be support for a private member's bill which
is included in today's ballot. Government by lottery it may be, but this is
one issue whose number must surely now be called.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Bright outlook for the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, seems to have been born under a lucky
star. For it is difficult to remember when the economic and budgetary
outlook seemed better or when mainstream economists have looked more
uncomfortable. The real hero of the hour is, however, our old friend
'self-correcting economic forces'.
The new National Institute Economic Review is disarmingly frank about how
conventional expectations have been confounded:
The rate of increase of wages and prices has remained low despite the 1992
post-ERM devaluation. The current balance of payments has improved despite a
recovery in domestic demand faster in the UK than in its main trading
partners. Indeed, as cautious an economist as Andrew Sentance asks in the
rival London Business Economic Outlook: 'Is the UK current account moving
into surplus?' It probably is in surplus already if overseas assets are
valued properly.
Consumer spending continues to rise despite the tax increases announced in
two 1993 Budgets, some of which have still to come into effect.
Unemployment continues to fall despite the earlier conventional view that
'even' resumed economic growth would not make a dent in it.
The NIESR cautions us against assuming another economic miracle, but does so
for interesting reasons. It suggests that the pressure of demand in both
goods and labour markets 'may have a more marked effect on wage and price
setting than we had realised'. You can say that again. The improvement in
trade performance is rightly said to date back to the 1980s. But the recent
narrowing of the trade gap has taken place despite favourable movements in
the terms of trade - the opposite of what is supposed to happen after
devaluation.
Cynical readers should note that it is not the tradition of political
economy from Adam Smith onwards that has been discomforted; nor has the
subsequent analysis of the main causes of both market and government
failure. The discomfort has been felt at two extremes - the mainstream
short-term economic modellers and those who believe financial markets are
always right.
If the economic prospect is good, the budgetary outlook is 'brill'
(upper-class female shorthand for brilliant). It is only a year and a half
ago that the Pounds 50bn UK public sector borrowing requirement, originally
estimated for 1993-94, was the one economic number everybody knew. Indeed,
it was thrown at one by the most surprising people and quite often soon
followed by demands that more should be done to stimulate the economy.
The Pounds 50bn figure always seemed an exaggeration, and has now been
revised down to Pounds 46bn. The Treasury projection of a contracting
deficit all but disappearing near the end of the decade was almost
universally derided. Yet the latest projections show the deficit has been
contracting ahead of schedule. Borrowing in 1994-95 is turning out at little
more than Pounds 30bn, and at Pounds 20bn in 1995-96, according to updated
Green Budget projections.
Goldman Sachs, which originally made the projections for the Green Budget in
October, has since revised downwards by Pounds 8bn its projection of next
year's public sector spending. For it now believes that the chancellor will
try to get the full benefits of lower-than-expected inflation in a cut of
Pounds 6bn in the public spending control total and that there will be
further savings in cyclical social security spending and in debt interest.
We can then expect a learned and inconclusive debate about whether the
chancellor has tightened fiscal policy and can thus afford to pause before
raising interest rates again, or whether the Exchequer finances are simply
benefiting from the economic upturn. Hoare Govett has made an illuminating
analysis of the improvements in the fiscal outlook over the three years
between 1993 and 1996, estimated at 4 1/2 percentage points of gross
domestic product. Business cycle factors are said to account for 2 1/2
percentage points, pre-announced tax increases for 2 1/4 points and tighter
spending control for a further 1 1/4 points. Falling asset sales are an
influence in the opposite direction. The point, however, is that tighter
fiscal policies are already in place. The chancellor will mainly allow
events to take their course and introduce a so-called neutral Budget.
Much past experience, from President Lyndon Johnson's 1960s tax increase to
pay for the Vietnam war onwards, has suggested that fiscal tightening -
whatever its other virtues - does little on its own to slow down a rapidly
expanding economy. The NIESR estimate of an increase in non-oil GDP of 3 per
cent in 1994 may not have adequately taken into account the very recent
upward revision in the national income estimates. Some 3 1/2 per cent is a
more likely guess - well above the most optimistic estimates of the trend
growth of output. Now that the capacity gap looks near to closing, a
slowdown will be necessary.
The argument from growth and capacity estimates is clinched by the signs
that business is looking for an opportunity to pass on in higher prices the
increase in costs in components and materials already in the pipeline. The
rapid and unforeseen revival of nearly all other economies, including the
continental European ones, will add to demand pressures in the UK, as will
the rise in investment taking place despite the third-quarter blip.
The interrelated problems which non-inflationary growth on its own will not
solve are structural unemployment and widening pay differentials. The most
important aspect of the Budget - one which financiers are bad at judging -
is what Clarke does to improve work incentives. Improvements have to be made
both in the incentives for workers to move off the dole and for employers to
offer jobs to less skilled workers. These problems were analysed by
Stephanie Flanders in yesterday's FT. The distinctions that need to be made
are between kick-start changes, such as relieving newly employed workers
from National Insurance and/or income tax for a limited period and more
permanent top-up payments which continue as long as needed.
Meanwhile the puzzle remains why the economic upturn still leaves so much of
the electorate in such a sour mood. A brave attempt at an answer has been
made by Peter Spencer and John Curtice in a Kleinwort Benson paper. They
themselves identify the missing ingredients as the absence of increases in
working hours normally experienced at this stage of recovery, saying that
higher demand has been met from productivity instead. They believe this
absence makes workers insecure about their jobs.
It is a brave try, but unconvincing and old-fashioned. Paid overtime is
largely a blue collar phenomenon. Fears over job security are felt much more
widely among white collar and professional workers. There is, however, a
traditional type of economic explanation to hand. This is that real
disposable income has been under pressure for several years. It stagnated
during the recession and has now fallen again, against a long-term upward
trend of 2.7 per cent per annum.
The fall in real disposable income is partly the mirror image of the shift
of resources into exports and investment for which economists have been
crying out for decades. But it is also a mirror image of the increase in the
tax burden imposed to improve government finances. Consumer spending is
still doing pretty well, but at the expense of a steeply falling savings
ratio, which averaged 12 1/2 per cent in 1992-93 and is expected by the
NIESR to fall to 8 1/2 per cent next year.
Increased spending financed from reduced saving no doubt does not feel as
good as increased spending financed by higher real post-tax incomes. But
there are clearly more deep-seated factors, such as the trend away from
'jobs for life' which is being experienced in all countries. Solutions will
not be found in traditional party political 10-point programmes which imply
that all change must come from government.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Plan offers no renaissance for
Florence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From EVA BUIATTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We read your article, 'David and the car Goliath' (October 31) on the
new urban plan for Florence, with great interest. However, we take a
different view on a number of points.
First, the Franchini-Vittorini urban plan is not based on 'mixed
development' principles. For instance, the 1.86m sq m Fondiaria area - very
large by our standards and currently empty - will become an extended
dormitory containing 2.2m cu m of new buildings. Originally, a large park
was planned here, in a town in which open and green spaces are as precious
as historical monuments.
Second, the so-called Fiat-Novoli plan has been made possible by the
demolition of the Fiat factory - again, this is at odds with the mixed
development concept.
Further, the Fiat-Novoli project offers no solution to the traffic and
mobility problem, while it adds thousands of inhabitants - plus cars - to a
heavily polluted area. A total of 6m cubic metres of new buildings, mostly
apartments/houses, are planned in a town where the population is falling and
where there are 18,000 empty flats.
Florence is strangled by traffic, but the new plan offers no solution in
terms of streets, public transportation, even underground car parking. And
there is bad news for tourists - the Michelucci-designed railway station is
to be demolished and replaced by the badly served Campo di Marte station on
the periphery. Nobody coming into Florence by train will again have the
cupola by Brunelleschi as their first view of the city.
The plan will cause disruption for 10 to 15 years. Why? Because the Florence
administration accepted in the plan the Italian Railways high-speed project.
This will cost some Pounds 600m, merely to allow 10 per cent of train
passengers to save 20 minutes on the Florence to Rome journey and 40 minutes
between Milan and Florence.
It is hard to believe that Florence will achieve a second renaissance as a
result of Dr Franchini's project. Many intellectuals, environmentalists,
political groups in the town council, and many citizens, oppose it.

Sir, It is not surprising that the Isles of Scilly top the school league
table of 108 local authorities ('Exam results improving, league tables
show', November 22), as Scillonians enjoyed the benefits of compulsory
education years before the mainland. This was due to the foresight of that
benevolent autocrat, Augustus Smith, who charged Scillonians a penny a week

THE BELL CURVE: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life By Richard
Herrnstein and Charles Murray The Free Press, 845 pages, Pounds 25/Dollars
30
The Bell Curve deserves attention not because it revives dubious claims
about large ethnic differences in intelligence, but because it makes a
plausible case that individual brain power or 'cognitive ability' is a far
more important determinant of economic and social success than hitherto
recognised. This is a 'big idea' that, if correct, is likely to exert
considerable influence on public policy in coming decades. Sceptics should
note that Charles Murray, an early critic of welfare spending, has unusually
sensitive intellectual antennae.
Murray and his co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein, a Harvard
psychologist, argue that variations in IQ help explain many puzzling social
phenomena. They believe incomes are growing more unequal, even for people
with similar qualifications, in part because economic competition is forcing
employers to reward personal productivity, which depends largely on IQ.
Low intelligence, meanwhile, appears to be closely correlated with nearly
all social problems, including poverty, illegitimate births, school
drop-outs, welfare dependency, divorce and crime. To give one example, the
proportion of American whites below the poverty line is 30 per cent for the
'very dull' (IQs below 75) against 2 per cent for the 'very bright' (IQs
above 125).
The point the authors drive home repeatedly is that IQ has become a much
more important determinant of an individual's life chances than the
socio-economic class of the parents - the factor that most researchers tend
to emphasise. Thus a bright child from a poor background has a much better
chance of graduating from college than a dull child from a privileged
background.
Intelligence was once fairly evenly distributed throughout society; most
high IQ individuals were neither well-educated nor rich because arbitrary
economic and social barriers prevented their advancement. Ironically, say
Murray and Herrnstein, progress toward the liberal goal of genuine equality
of opportunity is causing a pernicious new form of social stratification -
an aristocracy of the intellect. To a far greater extent than before, the
very bright are monopolising elite universities and hogging the best jobs in
'high IQ' fields, such as investment banking, law, medicine and the higher
reaches of public policy, academia and the media. These meritocrats tend to
be segregated from the rest of society - financially, culturally and even
physically (via private security guards).
You may object that this puts a ridiculous emphasis on IQ: surely many other
qualities such as perseverance, integrity and sociability also influence
personal performance. The authors dub this the 'compensating skills
fallacy': these other qualities are important but people with high IQs are
no less likely to possess them than the less able, they say. Superior
cognitive ability thus becomes the determining advantage; hence its power as
a predictor of performance.
The book invites criticism on many grounds. The argument about social
stratification by IQ, for example, is supported mainly by anecdotal
evidence: the authors do not establish a strong statistical correlation
between IQ and earnings.
And since the authors believe such stratification could undermine civil
society, it is curious that they urge a shift of educational resources
towards gifted children; their analysis surely suggests that it is the less
able who need more help. The notion that low IQ is the most important cause
of social problems also sits oddly with the experience of the past 30 years:
crime, welfare dependency and illegitimacy have mushroomed, yet measured IQ
has risen over this period, especially at the bottom end.
More controversial is their incendiary claim that the gap between the
average IQ of US whites and blacks is not only large but unlikely to
contract much in the foreseeable future. They need this finding to justify
their impassioned critique of 'affirmative action' policies to help
minorities. If you allow for ethnic differences in IQ, they claim, many of
the alleged signs of discrimination against blacks disappear or are
reversed. Holding IQ constant, blacks earn nearly as much as whites and are
more likely to graduate from college and enter elite professions. Blacks
only seem to be discriminated against because, as a group, they have low
IQs.
Yet Murray and Herrnstein admit that environmental factors account for 40-60
per cent of differences in IQ. Blacks are certainly less socio-economically
privileged than whites, so a substantial (but maybe temporary) measured IQ
differential is to be expected.
Moreover IQ is itself a rather fuzzy concept: the authors note that average
IQs may have risen as much as 15 points in just two generations (a
phenomenon known as the 'Flynn' effect). The only credible explanation is an
improved environment: for example better education and nutrition, especially
for the poor. Again the implication is that black and white IQs will tend to
converge as environmental differences are reduced - a trend perhaps already
evident in school test results. In the long run, colour-blind social
policies are desirable: individuals should be judged as individuals, not as
members of ethnic groups. But if IQ differentials mainly reflect disparities
in environment rather than innate differences, short-term biases in favour
of certain groups are not so illogical.
The authors deserve great credit for attempting to smash what has become a
ridiculous taboo on open discussion of IQ differences - and for making a
complex argument lucid. They may be exaggerating the significance of IQ, but
we will not know for sure until other researchers follow their lead into
forbidden territory. My guess is that The Bell Curve will trigger an
avalanche of research into the social and economic consequences of IQ
variations.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Arguments in support of boxing not
substantiated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr FLEUR FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nigel Spivey's article, 'Punch drunk and proud' (November 19/20),
rehashes the over-used and unsubstantiated arguments in favour of boxing.
His view reflects the current attitude of many of boxing's supporters.
With the evidence for chronic and acute damage in professional and amateur
boxers increasing by the year, it is difficult for supporters to claim no
damage is occurring. Boxing supporters therefore turn to their back-up
arguments regarding the benefits of boxing for young boys and to the
relative dangers of other sporting activities.
Boxers must be sick and tired of being told that, if they were not boxing,
they would be unable to overcome 'their disadvantages'. The situation for
young people in inner cities is of great concern to doctors, but the BMA
would recommend improvements in housing, unemployment, education and leisure
facilities rather than promoting an activity which leads to chronic brain
injury and life-long suffering.
As for comparisons with the dangers of other sports, the data are not beyond
question. The one distinguishing feature of boxing is that there are no
accidental injuries; each blow is a legitimate and intentional part of the
sport. If all the incidences of significant blows to the head were recorded
as injuries in boxing, as they are in other sports, the data would without
doubt reveal that boxing is a uniquely dangerous activity.
Let us hope that the armed forces give this new scientific evidence the
respect it deserves, rather than casting it aside in favour of
unsubstantiated claims about boxing's character building and disciplining
effects.

Sir, Re your article, 'Labour attacks ministers over spending on wine'
(November 21), is Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP, a teetotaller?
I am sure the Labour party serves wine at its official gatherings and I
would have thought Sir Ewen Fergusson, head of the government hospitality
fund advisory committee for the purchase of wine, should be congratulated
for providing wine at an average of Pounds 5.26 a bottle. He also seems to
run a tight quango if it only costs Pounds 1,500 a year to run.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Solvency of pensions is a decision
for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P N THORNTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Norma Cohen's article, 'Actuaries attack plan on pension solvency
standards' (November 18), and Lex ('Solvency standards', November 21) refer
to the proposed minimum solvency requirement (MSR) which will be introduced
in this year's pensions bill. The articles rightly identify a debate which
has gone on since the Goode Committee published its report, on the basis for
the MSR and, in particular, the extent to which equity returns are reflected
in it.
The fundamental issue at stake is the choice between two definitions of a
minimum solvency requirement. One is an MSR which provides a very high
degree of security for the members' benefits covered. This implies a
relatively high proportion of gilts and, for some schemes, could have
potentially costly implications, as in a significant number of cases they
will need either to increase funding targets or adjust the investment
strategy which they would otherwise have followed, or both.
The other is an MSR which includes a more significant equity element. This
will cause fewer problems for schemes, but somewhat less certainty about the
benefits being secured for the members has to be accepted.
It is about this choice that there has been so much debate within the
actuarial profession. This debate has been lively, but I am glad to say not
acrimonious. We have worked closely with the government officials concerned
to investigate the alternatives, but in the end we have made it clear that
we believe the job of striking the right balance is one for government and
not for the actuarial profession.

THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (PG) Henry Selick
DEAR DIARY (15) Nanni Moretti
STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE (18) Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio
I LOVE TROUBLE (PG) Charles Shyer
A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA (15)Bruce Beresford
The Nightmare Before Christmas fills us with terror. Not because it is
frightening but because it is so good. Watching it, all our delicate
preconceptions about popular movie-making start sliding around like tables
on a swell-tossed ocean liner.
We thought that Hollywood never extended itself in the cause of
sophisticated anarchy. We also thought that it never fashioned
feature-length animated films that catered for adults as much as for
children. But this puppet phantasmagoria, with its stop-motion figures and
crazed settings plundered from German Expressionism, should delight the
over-forties as well as under-fourteens.
We start in Halloweentown, where the rocky landscape is combed and curled
like a frozen seascape and where strange-shaped houses (a witches' hat, an
octopus) disburse stranger-shaped citizens. The Mayor has a revolving head
with two faces: one for beaming at the electorate, one for gnashing covert
teeth. The local Mad Scientist is part human, part cyber-duck. And our hero,
accompanied by a ghostly flying dog who seems made from origami, is a
long-legged, wire-thin dandy called Jack. (Short for Giacometti?)
He is the Pumpkin King. But bored with Halloween, he wanders into the woods
one day, stumbles down an Alice-like tunnel and discovers Christmastown.
Snow] Colour] Good cheer] He sings a song - the best in the movie, called
'What's this?' - and then hurries home to report his delight at finding a
new market for trick-or-treatism.
I shall reveal no more: or only to say that Santa Claus might be captured by
the Halloweentowners; that Pumpkin Jack might take over his beard, red coat
and reindeers; and that Christmastown will almost certainly call out the
police when shrunken heads start falling down their chimneys and giant toy
snakes eat their Christmas trees.
I cannot remember when I last heard the sound of happy, frequent laughter at
a Monday morning press show. But a film like this rejuvenates everyone. If
we thought that Tim Burton, the producer and original story writer, had
grown old with success after Batman, here he is returning to the
firefly-bright mischiefs of Beetlejuice. And director Henry Selick marshalls
an animation and special effects crew who must have been high and wild on
overtiredness. (A week's work in stop-motion produces about 10 seconds of
film).
Nightmare is 76 minutes of genuine merriment at the expense of regimented
merriment. Christmas is mocked, battered and assaulted: from the
Halloweentowners' atonal rendition of 'Jingle Bells' (sounding like
Schoenberg performed in a morgue) to the scene in which a Santa Claus sleigh
is unceremoniously blown from the night sky by anti-reindeer guns.
Anarchic? No doubt. Mean-spirited? Never. The film pushes on, via songs,
farce and decorative delirium, to an ending in which Christmas and Halloween
are both allowed their pre-eminent places as the great Yin and Yang - or
Jekyll and Hyde - of human festivals.
The week gets better. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary is bliss in three parts: an
episodic, sumptuously paranoid comedy from the Italian performer/filmmaker -
here playing himself - who makes Woody Allen seem a well-adjusted extrovert.
In part one our hero, a bearded lankshanks who might have strayed from an El
Greco painting, vrooms around Rome on his Vespa, voice-overing his thoughts
on life, love and cinema. He lists favourite films (Flashdance) and
unfavourite ones (Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer); he fantasises revenge
scenarios on film critics; he sobers up for a visit to Pasolini's
death-place.
In part two he walks among the Aeolian Islands; where like the homonymous
harp he is 'played' by the winds of comic happenstance. One running gag
concerns a friend addicted to TV soaps; another (inspired) takes off from
the simple notion of children answering phone calls intended for adults.
In part three he becomes a medical guinea pig, as a chronically
mis-diagnosed skin itch turns out to be cancer. (He has since recovered.)
Here and throughout, Moretti has the courage to let jokes grow unforced.
They become coloured with all the irony of quotidian calamity and textured
with all the rueful hilarity of everyday frustration and disappointments.
Strawberry And Chocolate is a Cuban film about being gay: which earns it
points for political nerve to add to those it can claim as a deft comedy of
AC/DC manners. Straight David (Vladimir Cruz) meets gay Diego (Jorge
Perugorria). Diego introduces David to the sensual delight of Scotch whisky,
opera records and - unselfishly - his man-hungry neighbour Nancy. David
responds slowly and with shell-shocked look.
Between-whiles the two men chatter about art, politics and homosexuality.
When the director, that veteran movie guerrilla Tomas Gutierrez Alea
(Memories Of Underdevelopment), fell ill with cancer, Juan Carlos Tabio
completed the film. But you cannot see the joins. Senel Paz's screenplay is
seamlessly sly and well-observed. And Havana itself winds around the cast
like some rococo, affectionate ghost, or one of those playfully omnivorous
snakes in The Nightmare Before Christmas.
A large snake should have been let loose on both I Love Trouble and A Good
Man In Africa. The first is a stuttering Julia Roberts/Nick Nolte comedy
thriller set in the Chicago newspaper world: a place where long raincoats
and flying pencils do not automatically turn you into Cary Grant and
Rosalind Russell (though a good script might help).
The second film is based on William Boyd's colonialism-spoofing novel. A
Good Man In Africa - which surely had some wit on the printed page - has
been turned into something resembling a village theatricals version of
Waugh's Black Mischief.
The village in question, though, is the Global Village. America's John
Lithgow essays the frightfully British ambassador, Sir Arthur Fanshawe.
Australia's Colin Friels attempts the frightfully English junior diplomat
Morgan Leafy. And another Australian, Bruce Beresford, fairly frightfully
directs.
One moment we are in 'Carry on up the cleavage' vein, with Morgan losing his
cool and his trousers to every eligible female in view (Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer, Diana Rigg). The next moment we are wondering how to deal
with the film's one real human being who keeps wandering across the screen.
He is Sean Connery as the titular good man, a doctor refusing to be
corrupted by African political sleaze.
Connery's presence is so majestic that he exposes aesthetic fraud or
triviality merely by standing next to it. The makers of this film should
have left the gate open for him to escape the lot on day one. That way their
al fresco children's party could have continued without the one reproving
adult.
Connery has already escaped the Highlander saga. Only Christopher Lambert is
left heaving the claymores in the tired and excruciating H3 (15, Andy
Morahan). Why not see instead The Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's classic
swashbuckler revived. Or - it is a busy week - you could catch a small but
almost perfectly formed Hong Kong film at the ICA, Days of Running Wild
(15). Hope, despair and comedy in the 1960s, caught on the wing by director
Wong Kar-Wai.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In his poetic, haunting, and seldom seen masterwork Landscape, Harold Pinter
strips drama to its most enigmatic essence. The two characters, Duff and
Beth, sit at either ends of a kitchen table, without ever rising. Nothing
happens but talk; they seem never to hear each other; she never addresses
him. The play, new in 1968, lasts only 40 minutes. We, listening, are
baffled - and, finally, heartbroken. For heartbreak is part of the subject
of this beautiful play.
Duff sits mainly in profile to us, leaning forwards to keep his hands on the
table, like a Cezanne card-player. Beth sits facing us, hands folded in her
lap, like Cezanne's mother. Man and woman: Pinter has distilled the age-old
tensions between the two sexes so potently that the tragic division of
gender has never seemed less bridgeable. The mysteries of the play lie in
the dichotomies between what she says and what he says.
Beth sits there motionless. It is possible that she is in a coma or trance;
certainly Duff addresses her as such. Yet the wonderful irony of the play is
that her thoughts dwell entirely in sensuous contemplation of the lyrical
past, while his thoughts ramble tensely. He is prose, she poetry. He talks
of mundane facts, she of delicate feeling. He thinks about only home and
work, she about would-be children and art. He speaks of sex as struggle, she
as intimacy.
And, though she speaks frequently of 'he' and 'him', it is by no means clear
if she is referring to Duff; we wonder about their (ex-?)employer Mr Sykes.
It is Duff who gives us most clues: we learn that he once told her of his
infidelity to her, we learn that she once, at some other time, broke down by
hammering at the gong. The clinching clue, I believe, to the identity of her
lover lies in the word 'grave'.
More important, however, and nearest to the play's title, are her words on
the principles of light and shade in drawing. Or, rather, light and shadow.
Pinter extracts beautiful nuance from the latter word. 'Shadow is
deprivation of light . . . Sometimes the cause of the shadow cannot be
found. But I always bore in mind the basic principles of drawing. So that I
never lost track. Or heart.'
Much more deserves to be said not only about this play but also about the
performance it is being given, under Pinter's own direction, by Penelope
Wilton and Ian Holm at the Cottesloe. This is the staging that was the
greatest revelation of the Pinter Festival at Dublin's Gate Theatre in May;
even without the festival's other five plays, it is marvellous to have it
here. I am now more aware of the moments when Beth and Duff seem to draw
near to each other in thought, and of the weight of grief that hangs over
him. But the slightest nuance here - the slightest turn of a head, the
connection of two consonants, the beat of her eyelids, the silence in the
air - is full of meaning. In repertory at the Cottesloe Theatre, South Bank.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: Maazel and the Bavarians - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Orchestras of the World is a bold title for a concert series. It
invites questions. The latest visitor to the Barbican was the Bavarian Radio
Symphony Orchestra with its music director since last year, Lorin Maazel.
The orchestra is well-known from its recordings with two earlier directors,
Rafael Kubelik and Sir Colin Davis, as well as its radio concerts broadcast
in Britain by the BBC.
Maazel offered two monumental symphonies as calling cards, Mahler's Ninth on
Sunday evening and Bruckner's Eighth on Monday. Maazel is certainly a vivid
conductor - some would say a bit a flashy. It is hard to ignore his balletic
manner on the rostrum, which veers between elegant nonchalance and a limp
wrist at one extreme, and exaggerated miming of the expressive effect he
wants to achieve at the other. But he certainly got results.
He had the strings seated in a different arrangement from usual, with the
violas to his right, cellos facing the audience, and second violins behind
the firsts on his left. This produced a good balance and it dramatised the
contribution of the violas as well as allowing the cellos a more direct
impact. All the strings played marvellously; the violins were warm and silky
in the unfolding sighs of Mahler's first movement and superbly controlled,
without any ragged attacks or frayed endings in the long, fading farewells
of the fourth movement.
In the two middle movements the woodwind players enjoyed themselves visibly
as well as audibly, smiling gleefully when the E flat clarinet squealed
wildly in the Rondo-Burleske. For all that, the sound as a whole was perhaps
too healthy and plump to be quite as sardonic as Mahler intended, and he
might have wanted the second movement Landler to be more clod-hopping and
uncouth. Still, as a whole, it was a really committed involving performance.
Bruckner's Eighth Symphony on Monday evening was even finer, and gave no
cause for questions about character. The warmth of the woodwind, with
notable rapport between principal flute and clarinet, a beautifully focused
oboe, the beefy and absolutely reliable brass - all were a joy. And again,
those marvellous strings remained disciplined, strong and ardent in the
severest test of their stamina.
The eighth has darker, more sinister shadows than Bruckner's preceding
symphonies, and its sense of uplift is achieved through sometimes painful
dissonances; yet they are rendered as objective natural forces by the
immense spaciousness of the design and Bruckner's characteristically abrupt
juxtaposition of material. Maazel, conducting from memory, steered with a
totally satisfying sense of pace. The work lasted more than 90 minutes yet
it never felt protracted: the audience sat rapt. The Bavarians certainly
earned their place in this series.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: St Cecilia's Day celebrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three centuries ago the Stationers' Hall, around the corner from St. Paul's
in Ave Maria Lane, used to promote celebrations of St. Cecilia's Day -
November 22 - with music and banqueting. A stained glass window in their
fine 17th-century hall depicts that patron saint of music.
A few years back some stationer, or anyhow some member of The Worshipful
Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, must have remembered the old
custom. Since 1992 there have been St. Cecilia-Tide concerts again, with
banquets; next year there will be a five-day mini-festival (sponsored by the
FT, as it happens).
These days, the obvious thing to put into a 17th-century hall is a
period-instrument band. The Stationers' Hall has the Fiori Musicali, a
baroque ensemble (with chorus) founded by their conductor Penelope Rapson.
On Tuesday they gave thoroughly attractive performances of Purcell's Funeral
Music for Queen Mary, and Bach's Magnificat in D and his A minor concerto
for violin.
The soloist in the latter was their leader Peter Fender: properly a primus
inter pares, not a commanding voice (baroque violin-technique hardly permits
of domineering brilliance), but notably subtle in his florid Andante
excursions. In the great Funeral Music the preludial and concluding marches
and canzonas went to sackbuts and 'flatt trumpets', with processing
mourning-drums, to imposing effect, and the chorus enunciated the 'Funeral
Sentences' - early Purcell anthems, in fact: nobody knows whether they were
part of the original package - with lucid eloquence.
Later, we admired Dr Rapson's unhesitating dispatch in the Bach Magnificat.
It emphasised the continuity of the Marian text through the dozen different
numbers, while giving full value to their differences in weight, colour and
address (public v. private). Her tempi were generally quick, vital and
nicely braced; her solo singers rose confidently to all their occasions.
Kate Eckersley was a poised, intelligent soprano, but the stand-out number
was the 'Et misericordia' duet for counter-tenor and tenor (Nicholas Clapton
and Nicholas Hurndall Smith). Together, their contrasted timbres - the one
reedy, cultured and elevated, the other warm and slightly baritonal - made a
magical amalgam, strange but quite beautiful.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: That Woman - a tour de force / Theate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I won't take my shoes off, don't worry,' says the eponymous heroine of That
Woman, a new comedy by John Antrobus. 'I don't go in for familiarity.'
Is this funny? In itself, not particularly. With that superb character
actress Patricia Hayes, however, it is the first great hoot of a memorably
hilarious evening. The character she plays - an old eccentric who keeps
inviting herself into young Jack's flat, and anywhere else, for a cuppa and
biscuits - is the kind of role we seem to have seen Hayes play a hundred
times, and yet there is not a jot of staleness in it. Hayes's voice still
ranges so easily from chest to head tones, from urgency to tremulousness,
and her diction is so good, that by the time she has got to the juicy word
'familiarity', slowly savoured, she has us in the palm of her hand.
That Woman is being presented upstairs in Riverside's Studio 3 as if its
actors were delivering a BBC radio play, scripts in hand: which is a
charming way of ensuring that Hayes herself, who alone seems in need of a
script, need not undergo the old actor's nightmare of forgetting her lines.
Indeed, since That Woman began as a pair of radio plays, How I Met Franz and
Rats, little camouflage is involved.
Antrobus's writing is a perfect vehicle for Hayes's gift for creating
monstrous bizarrerie out of her harmless-old-crone facade. (Would that we
could hear again the tremendous Sarah Gamp she once created in Radio 4's
Martin Chuzzlewit.) Her obsession here is that she has been the sexual
plaything of the medical profession. By the time she has got to 'I don't
know when I last had a stethoscope on my chest,' convulsions are occurring
all round the audience. Yet the role has its pathos ('I want to talk to
someone'), and eventually its bizarrerie goes beyond humour into purest
fantasy.
In the second half, she sets to work on a police inspector. She offers
herself as a material witness, but she wants also (a) tea and biscuits, and
a proper meal if poss. (b) seduction ('Out comes the truncheon' - spoken
with fabulous lasciviousness). Yet her behaviour in the police station is
more normal than the story she has to narrate. She tells of her passionate
affair with her late lamented: 'I was Josephine to his Napoleon, Emma
Thomson to his Kenneth Banner' (sic). The late lamented's wife had repressed
his artistic talent: 'She wouldn't let him express himself in oils.' But her
he painted: ''Let yourself go into a pose of the southern seas,' he said.'
What had she to offer him? 'Unendurable pleasure indefinitely prolonged.'
I would like to take Hayes's utterance of that last line to a desert island.
But, then, she is uproarious in her myriad different ways of saying 'Yes,
dear,' all of them loaded. And she is perfectly complimented by Brian Murphy
and Peter Woodward. Murphy, a wonderful study in working-class perturbation,
is a fine comic actor who is the more funny for giving every attention to
Hayes and his co-actors; Woodward, with his striking presence, anchors the
first half by playing the innocent deadpan dupe to this aged visitation.
Philip Grout directs. On press night, the cast seemed scarcely able to
suppress their own giggles. And we who watched gave our laughter full vent.
At the Riverside Studios, W6.

<TEXT>
Arousing pity comes easily to television's intimate immediacy. Tonight's
Witness: Life after Death (9pm C4) is one of those gentle, almost deadpan
probings of tragedy that leave you pondering the issues long afterwards. The
scene is Ulster: the Catholic woman whose husband was mistakenly killed by
the IRA is embittered; the ex-Loyalist paramilitary who served a jail
sentence after killing a catholic stranger is almost serene as he
acknowledges his guilt, a born-again Christian. The ways of God and men are
incomprehensible.
The film's integrity contrasts with the perceptible layer of smugness in
Forbidden Britain (9.45 pm BBC2). The series' assumption that we think
society's ills date only from modern times overlooks the fact some of us
read books. The slightly accusing note with which tonight's programme
unearths fascinating film of homelessness is a good fault at a time when the
chattering (and TV-making) classes think of history as a month-old colour
supplement, and are themselves unaware of life before the sixties when not
only sex but civilisation began.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: Slow dawning of electronic risk - Why Japan's
financial services industry is still struggling with new technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD REDHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan's financial services industry, information technology boffins tend
to work in back rooms developing computer systems to help traders and fund
managers make the best of a changing investment world. Much of their work is
a mystery, even to their colleagues in the trading rooms.
The pace of technological development has been slower than in the US and
Europe, and the pattern of computerised applications has been strongly
influenced by Japan's recent boom-bust experiences.
In the early 1980s, Japanese analysts and brokers relied on paper and
intuition to make their decisions in what was a less sophisticated financial
environment. Their counterparts in New York and London were already
investing in IT. But as investment opportunities in overseas markets have
increased, Japan's financial sector has tried to match competitors abroad.
Nikko Securities, Japan's second largest brokerage, was one of the first
into the fray. Its computer model for picking the best-performing stocks,
developed jointly with Barra of California in 1986, has become the standard
for Japanese equity analysis. Most investment houses still use variants of
it.
Its application took off as the stock market boomed in the 1980s. Brokerages
making large profits from index-linked funds saw opportunities in
computerised analysis.
'For brokerages, computer modelling and quantitative analysis came to mean
index funds,' said Hirofumi Yagi, general manager of Nikko's investment
technology research department.
Computers virtually ruled the trading rooms from 1987. But faith in
electronic analysis was undermined when shares tumbled in 1990 and financial
houses shifted the application towards risk control.
'Brokerages began to re-evaluate what they used their models for,' says
Yagi. 'We saw that our computer models could be used to control risk.'
Now Nikko uses computer techniques primarily to measure risk in investment
funds, to construct portfolios and for investment in overseas markets.
The company says it is still a long way behind the Americans and Europeans,
but it has started to hire graduates with higher degrees in mathematics and
physics to boost its 100-strong research operation. Nikko is looking at
neural networks and artificial intelligence for asset management and
allocation. It is also trying to enhance existing models that analyse the
performance of individual stocks.
Japan's life insurance companies have reached similar conclusions on the use
of computer models. Life insurers are some of the largest investors in
Japanese financial markets and most were using computer models for portfolio
risk analysis and allocation by the late 1980s.
Asahi Mutual Life Insurance, Japan's third largest insurer with assets of
Y10 trillion (Pounds 6.2bn), uses two types of model to support its fund
managers. The first is for risk analysis based on US techniques, and the
second is a locally developed product that gives the optimum weights for
stock and bonds in domestic portfolios.
The local model took the company around a year to develop, according to
Kouichi Kurata, manager of Asahi's quantitative research division. It uses
Sun workstations to crunch data on company earnings growth, valuation,
historical stock price momentum and P/E ratios to pick equities, and price
momentum information for domestic bonds. Kurata rates the model as quite
successful, although he says it often underperforms when used on investment
strategies for periods of less than six months.
Kurata and his five research staff are likely to start work soon on new
models for asset allocation and overseas equities.
Kurata shares the view that computer trading models were overused in the
boom years of the late 1980s.
'There was a lack of understanding of how these things worked at that time,'
he says. 'Now we are learning how to use them properly.'
Government concerns also limit the use of advanced IT in Japan. The Ministry
of Finance does not forbid the trading of derivatives by law, but it has
'guidelines' that deter financial institutions from trading in the more
exotic types of product such as equity-linked index swaps. The ministry, the
financial industry watchdog, is worried that unregulated trading of
derivatives may lead to bankruptcies, and heavy losses for investors.
Japan does not yet have markets for most of these financial products, but
Japanese institutional investors have set up trading operations in London
and other offshore centres where they can take part. The result is that most
of their best quantitative analysts are working overseas.
Yagi believes the government will eventually allow investment houses to
trade in new financial products locally, which may spur investment in
software and hardware.

FT  24 NOV 94 / People: Kleinwort Benson poaches from NatWest's investment
trust team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson Securities has broken up the top team of stockbrokers
covering the UK investment industry by poaching the bulk of the sales and
marketing staff of NatWest Securities investment trust team.
NatWest Securities' Hamish Buchan, the doyen of the investment trust sector,
said yesterday that the first he knew about it was when 10 of his staff
announced that they were quitting. He admitted that it was a big blow when a
team walked out en masse and was particularly painful because it had
coincided with his 50th birthday.
Buchan, who has headed Extel's list of investment trust analysts for all but
one of the past 21 years, said yesterday that he and Robin Angus, an equally
big figure in investment trust research, intend to stay at NatWest
Securities and rebuild the sales team. 'We think we have a fairly strong
franchise,' says Buchan.
It has been known for some time that Kleinwort Benson Securities has been
keen to break into the investment trust sector which is dominated by NatWest
Securities, along with Smith New Court and SG Warburg. Margins tend to be
better than in other parts of the equity business and there is the added
bonus of winning big fees on corporate business.
When Kleinwort Benson launched its heavily over-subscribed European
Investment Trust earlier this year it had to part with several million
pounds of fees to rival brokers. By having its own investment trust sales
team it could prevent this happening again and further its ambitions to
become a big player in overseas investment trusts.
It is understood that the team defecting to KB is headed by Robbie Robertson
and Roger Hullett and come from the London end of NatWest Securities'
investment trust operation. The best investment trust teams use their
research analysts to feed their sales force and it is significant that the
two best-known analysts at NatWest Securities have not defected.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: Body shops order CD-Rom parts - A system that
makes car repairs easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Retail, the UK car dealership group, is equipping its 54 body shops with
a system for estimating repairs based on a CD-Rom disc database.
The system stores data on 500,000 car parts on a single CD-Rom
(read-only-memory) disc, which is played on a drive connected to a personal
computer.
Several car-rental companies and insurers, including Guardian Insurance and
Royal Insurance, also use the system, called Glassmatix, to help agree
estimates more quickly with their approved body shops.
The system, produced and sold by Glass's Information Services, bases repair
times on data drawn from a UK research centre in Thatcham, funded by UK
insurers. Car-part prices in Glassmatix come from the manufacturers.
Steve O'Brien, UK fleet maintenance manager at Budget, the car rental
company, says he wanted estimates based on criteria that were standard in
the insurance industry.
At Budget, the damage manager examines a car and decides what new parts are
needed. He then passes a barcode wand over the relevant reference in a
catalogue. For example, he might swipe the barcode for a new side wing in a
1994 Ford Mondeo. The informa-
tion is later transferred to the PC.
The PC works out (based on a CD-Rom updated monthly) how much each repair
will cost, including parts and labour. It also works out the most efficient
order in which to do repairs, keeping labour costs to a minimum.
'We basically tell the body shops what we're expecting to pay,' says
O'Brien. This has contributed to a Pounds 1m cut in maintenance costs a
year, the company says.
The system also works out when a car is not worth repairing. O'Brien says:
'If repairs are going to cost more than 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the
car's value, we replace the car with a new one.'
The system means Budget spends less time rummaging through car-part
catalogues or phoning suppliers and haggling over repair estimates.
It has also enabled insurers, and other users, to see more clearly the size
of mark-up being made by some garages over the retail price of a component.
'At first we thought the system was wrong,' says Jeremy Seal, chief motor
engineer at Guardian Insurance. 'Now we're picking up on over-charging, even
if it is as small as 1.5 per cent.'
Guardian Insurance - part of Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance - is to equip
its staff engineers with a portable version of the system so they can send
estimates back to the office via the Ram Mobile Data network, the UK mobile
data service.
Some insurers, such as Guardian, also plan to use a related product -
Glassimage - which enables still or moving video images of damaged vehicles
to be sent to the insurer down telephone lines, or over a mobile data
network. The software, which compresses the size of each video image, was
developed in conjunction with video card company, Videologic.
Users will need a standard video camera, a video card and a modem to take
and transmit still or moving images.
The Thomson Corporation, which owns the Mitchell's CD-Rom system in the US
(on which Glassmatix is based) invested Pounds 6m to help Glass's develop
the UK version of the product. The company says it may have to wait several
years for a return. But there is a potential market of 2,500 insurance
assessors, the 5,000 biggest body shops and principal car dealers and fleet
managers.
Subscribing to Glassmatix costs Pounds 5,000 a year including paper
catalogues, monthly CDs and support, but excluding hardware. Glassimage
costs an extra Pounds 495 a year. There are similar products on the market.
The best known is Audatex, which is owned by Swiss insurers Swiss Re. Its
collision-repair estimating system draws information on parts and labour
costs from manufacturers. Audatex is planning to incorporate the insurers'
Thatcham data by January.

'Ten years ago I was a tank commander based in West Germany. If anyone had
told me that a decade later I would be swapping vodka toasts with Russian
tax officials in St Petersburg, I would have said they were mad.'
Now 36, Stuart Leasor hops round east Europe, helping governments spend
European Union grants on public relations campaigns to persuade recalcitrant
citizens to pay their taxes.
He persuaded the Polish finance ministry that publishing a 100-page guide to
the new tax laws for every household was not a great idea - Poland ended up
gathering 7 per cent more VAT than it had hoped for; saved 450,000 Ecus by
running a successful Bulgarian VAT pr campaign rather more cheaply than
anyone imagined possible; and has made sure that all 89 oblasts in Russia
now have a tax information office.
His small pr firm - Woodstock Leasor, formed with Sarah Tubbs, formerly of
Dewe Rogerson - now has people working throughout eastern Europe; clearly he
thinks prospects are good. He must - he's planning to marry a Kazakh working
in Kiev.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: How Fuji banks on the personal touch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fuji Bank, Japan's third largest bank and a big player in world derivatives
markets, is aware of the value of computers in the fast-moving environment
of swap and option trading.
The company recently bought a Cray mini-supercomputer for its New York-based
subsidiary's derivatives operations, linking it via a wide-area network to
workstations on the desks of its London and Hong Kong traders.
Back at headquarters in Tokyo's Otemachi business district, Fuji's
derivatives traders do not yet have the power of a Cray to help them in
their decisions. 'The pace of these markets is getting so fast that we
cannot compete without computers,' says Yoshiki Takeshima, general manager
of Fuji's market risk assessment division.
Fuji's derivatives traders use IBM and Hitachi workstations running price
simulation models for yen and dollar interest-rate swaps, futures trading
and options developed by programmers in the bank's financial engineering
division.
The models use historical pricing data and traders' simulations of future
price movements based on past trading patterns to give a market price for
the derivatives the bank offers to corporate clients for hedging purposes.
Takeshima stresses that the models are only guides for traders. Although
Fuji also uses some artificial intelligence, it does not let the computers
trade automatically.
'The trader makes the final call on the price,' he says. Japanese investors
still prefer their decisions to be made by a human being, according to
Takeshima. Telling investors that advanced technology is calculating the
price of a derivative can sometimes actually kill demand for the product.
Takeshima, a 23-year veteran of Fuji, is charged with making sure the models
contain adequate provisions for risk. His department looks over the models
and checks that they do not leave the bank overstretched. Value-added risk
calculations make the models accurate for most situations, except market
panic.
Takeshima sees Fuji being drawn into a spiral of ever greater investment in
computing power and software just to stay afloat.
Once Japan's Ministry of Finance lifts rules governing the booking of
profits from overseas derivatives trading and allows trading in other
financial products, the bank will need more complicated models to stave off
competition. 'The game will never stop,' says Takeshima.

FT  24 NOV 94 / People: HSBC's Dick Peterson moves to New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news for the over-fifties. Dick Peterson, a 59-year-old ex-Chase
Manhattan banker, has just been appointed chief executive of HSBC Holdings'
New York corporate banking business.
In an industry which sometimes seems to worship youth, Peterson has survived
longer than many of his contemporaries. He worked for Chase in Los Angeles,
London and New York, and joined Midland Bank in 1983 at the behest of Herb
Jacobi, another ex-Chase banker.
Although Midland Bank's US ambitions were cut short by its disastrous
acquisition of California's Crocker Bank, and Midland was itself acquired by
HSBC in 1992, Peterson opened Midland's branch in New York in 1983 and has
soldiered on when others have opted for early retirement.
Peterson has no plans to do the same because he still enjoys the business. A
former colleague at Chase describes Peterson as a 'tremendously experienced
guy' who has very good interpersonal skills, sound judgment and is 'very
good with clients'. Peterson would be the first to admit that he is not the
only banker with 30 years' experience under his belt with these attributes.
But he is one of the last to be still climbing the promotion ladder.
His new job involves integrating the New York corporate banking businesses
of Midland and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation into a new unit
called HSBC Corporate Banking. It will work closely with HSBC's Marine
Midland Bank.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A direct flight to
the travelling public - USAir's unusual method of explaining its safety
record to passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is probably no subject more sensitive to airlines and their passengers
than safety. Usually it is the last thing airlines want to discuss in
advertisements: however good their safety records, most carriers have
suffered fatal crashes, and the few that have not are reluctant to boast
about the achievement for fear of tempting fate.
How, then, to explain the advertising campaign launched this week by USAir,
the loss-making US carrier in which British Airways owns a 24.6 per cent
stake? In newspapers across the US, and some overseas,the airline has
addressed the subject directly, taking full-page advertisements to assure
the travelling public that safety is its first consideration.
The danger of such an unusual campaign is that it immediately prompts
travellers to ask why it has become necessary. In USAir's case, the answer
is clear: the airline has experienced a spate of five fatal air crashes over
the last five years, two of them in the last six months. Already bedevilled
by acute financial problems, it is now losing business because of deeper
customer fears.
USAir's advertisement, framed as an open letter to travellers from Seth
Schofield, chairman and chief executive, seeks to reassure passengers by
announcing two moves. The airline says it has appointed Gen Robert Oaks,
formerly commander in chief of the US Air Forces in Europe, to oversee the
safety of all the airline's operations, and says a US consultancy called PRC
Aviation has been commissioned to carry out an independent safety audit.
'In closing,' Schofield's letter ends, 'let me say that we will not rest
until each and every member of the flying public shares in the certainty of
our commitment to be the safest of airlines.'
Richard Weintraub, USAir's senior director of public affairs, acknowledges
that the advertising campaign is unconventional, but says the airline is not
in a conventional situation. Referring to USAir's fatal accidents in July
and September of this year, he says: 'There really is very little, if any,
precedent for two accidents of this nature occurring in such proximity.'
Arguably, the spate of accidents is coincidental. USAir points out that
there is no obvious link between the five crashes that have happened since
1989. The Federal Aviation Administration, the US government body
responsible for aviation policy, has had USAir under extra scrutiny since
1992 because of earlier accidents and because of the airline's financial
difficulties, but says USAir continues to meet the highest standards of
safety consistent with the FAA's safety regulations.
In terms of raw statistics, it is true that USAir tops the league table of
big US carriers for accidents per 1m flight hours over the last five years.
But those figures weigh particularly heavily against USAir because most air
crashes happen during take-off or landing, and USAir has more short-haul
flights than any other US carrier. In terms of accidents per departure over
the last five years, the airline ranks behind Continental and United.
Logic aside, however, it is hardly surprising to find that USAir's business
has suffered. Last month, the airline said it reckoned the crashes had cost
it Dollars 40m (Pounds 24.3m) in revenues in the quarter to September,
contri-
buting to net losses of Dollars 180.1m. Weintraub says the airline's latest
figures show that year-on-year bookings were up 12.6 per cent in the 10
months to October, but were up only 2.5 per cent in the month of October
alone.
Weintraub says USAir has little to lose by running the advertisements
because media coverage of the accidents has left few people unaware of them.
On the other hand, he says, market research and anecdotal evidence suggest
that the barrage of adverse publicity has introduced doubts about safety
into the minds of even its most loyal customers, and the advertisements
could do some good if they counter that. 'It is extraordinarily important
that we reach out and share our con-
viction about what we know to be a certainty, which is that we run a safe
airline,' Weintraub says.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sold on
self-regulation - The advertising code gets a new look in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertisers in Britain will be able to start the New Year by tearing up the
old rule book which governs what they can and cannot say in their copy.
A new version of the detailed codes which underpin non-broadcast
advertising's system of self-regulation (television and radio have their own
rules) will still require advertisements to be legal, decent, honest and
truthful. But from January, the rules which flesh out these principles will
be shorter, sharper, and more in tune with the current demands of the
marketplace.
This thorough overhaul of the advertising codes will be watched in other
countries. Britain's Advertising Standards Authority is playing a leading
part in arguing for the principle of self-regulation of advertising
throughout the European Union, as well as advising eastern European
countries on how to set up their own systems.
The new combined British codes of advertising and sales promotion practice,
which until now have been separate documents, will, for the first time, set
out rules in two areas where there have been profound changes in public
attitudes since the formation of the codes more than 30 years ago: motoring
and the environment.
The wording has yet to be approved, but it is likely that the code will
outlaw car and fuel advertisements which encourage 'anti-social' behaviour
or make speed or acceleration claims their main message. Advertisers will be
prevented from depicting vehicles in dangerous situations or in a way which
would encourage irresponsible driving.
On the environment, terms such as 'environmentally friendly' and 'wholly
biodegradable' will have to be qualified. Advertisers will need to make it
clear if there is a division of scientific opinion, or if the evidence for
an environmental claim is inconclusive. 'Extravagant' language and obscure
scientific terms likely to mislead people will also be discouraged.
A third, less material, addition will be the inclusion of a
'politically-correct' catch-all phrase. Advertisers will have to take care
not to cause offence on the grounds of race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation or disability.
The rest of the revision includes simplifying the language and sweeping away
defunct clauses. Out, for example, goes a section in the code on 'height
increase courses' which bans advertisements for the 'development of the
physique' from suggesting that 'thereby, users will become taller'. These
kinds of advertisement, like miraculous 'bust development' courses, are no
longer the prominent feature of the advertising columns they once were.
'People were ploughing through quite a number of rules to get to the ones
they wanted,' says Matti Alderson, ASA director-general explaining a general
feeling that much of the code was no longer relevant. 'One of the objectives
of the review was to emphasise those rules that were most important.'
There is some risk that, in the process of simplification and wider
definitions, the rules will become too lax in some areas, argues Stephen
Locke, director of policy with Consumers' Association, one of the bodies
consulted during the year-long examination of the codes.
'On motoring, for example, there's a reference to adverts for cars avoiding
any practices that are anti-social. But it's not clear what they mean by
anti-social - we'd like to see examples in this kind of area,' he says.
CA put forward a number of suggestions for changes in the way the ASA
operates, none of which has so far been accepted. Among them was a
requirement that the ASA accept telephone complaints - at present these have
to be written - and the introduction of tougher sanctions against repeated
offenders. CA would like to see a system of fines available for use in
extreme circumstances: at the moment the ASA relies chiefly on adverse
publicity and help from publishers and the postal service to enforce the
code.
But overall, it is in consumers' interests that advertising is regulated by
the industry, says Locke: 'It's widely seen as a success story. There's no
doubt we get more out of self-regulation than we would out of statutory
regulation, not least because it can be more flexible and give the benefit
of the doubt to complainants - it doesn't have to be legalistic in its
approach.'
Advertisers are certainly keen to keep the legislators at bay. In a speech
on advertising freedoms, due to be delivered at Leeds University tonight,
Peter Mitchell, Guinness's strategic affairs director and president of the
World Federation of Advertisers, argues that self-regulation 'has the
ability to be speedy, cost-efficient, effective and available at no charge
to the complainant'.
Self-regulation must continue to work well, 'otherwise the public perception
that advertising is legal, decent, honest and truthful begins to decline'
and the pressure for intensified regulation would grow, says Mitchell.
The ASA is convinced that Brussels recognises the value of self-regulation
and will, in general, try to avoid imposing centralised, harmonising
legislation on the industry. The Brussels-based European Advertising
Standards Alliance, which co-ordinates 18 self-regulatory bodies across the
EU, plus Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, has stressed to the European
Commission that attempts to harmonise would be unwise. Instead, Oliver Gray,
EASA director-general, sees 'over time a convergence of principles of
self-regulation'.
The self-regulation message is also spreading east. A joint EASA/ASA team
has visited Prague to help set up a council for the self-regulation of
advertising in the Czech Republic, and there have also been requests for
help in setting up codes from Poland, Slovenia and Latvia, says Gray.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Tidying up the US corporate landscape -
Proposals to tighten restructuring and other one-off charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashion among US companies for taking big restructuring charges may be
drawing to an end.
In recent years, such one-off charges have become a familiar part of the
corporate landscape as many of the country's biggest companies have sought
to overhaul their operations to make themselves more competitive. Often,
this work has been carried out under the broad-ranging (and fashionable)
banners of 're-engineering' and 'downsizing'.
Tighter accounting regulations are about to make the process less
attractive. Last week, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's emerging
issues taskforce agreed on a stricter set of rules to govern this area of
financial reporting - though they do not go far enough, according to the
securities regulators.
The problem until now has been a lack of definition. What future costs
should a company recognise in its current accounting period? Being by
definition a prudent breed, many accountants like companies' accounts to
reflect certain future liabilities, otherwise their current earnings would
not reflect the reality of their business.
However, drawing the net too widely allows companies to bundle up costs that
should properly be charged against future earnings. That leads to bigger
up-front charges and flatters future profits. (Perhaps for that reason, it
is not uncommon to see the biggest charges being taken by companies that
have recently had a change of management at the top.)
The FASB has edged its way towards an answer piece by piece. In May this
year, it came up with an answer to how the costs of planned redundancies
should be handled. Last week, it reached a consensus on the more thorny
subject of other, non-redundancy costs associated with restructurings. And
early next year the board will conclude its thinking on a related area: the
write-down in the value of assets, which often occurs in connection with a
corporate restructuring.
The title of its paper on the first two aspects of this work, due to be
published on 6 December, gives a fair idea of how the emerging issues
taskforce's thinking has developed. It is called, rather long-windedly:
'Liability recognition for costs to exit an activity (including certain
costs incurred in a restructuring)'.
As this makes clear, taking a one-off charge in future will be limited
largely to where companies are shedding businesses. Only those costs 'not
associated with, or (which) do not benefit, activities that are continued'
will count.
At one sweep, this appears to wipe out many of the opportunities for taking
restructuring charges that companies have used this year. Among the clearest
examples (and ones highlighted in this column in March) were the series of
restructuring charges taken by US regional telephone companies last winter.
Nynex, for instance, said a Dollars 400m charge it took included 'retraining
employees, relocation expenses (and) systems re-engineering'. BellSouth,
which took a Dollars 1.2bn charge, said Dollars 550m of the cost was related
to 'implementing new, state-of-the-art systems'.
Clearly, these items would not meet the new taskforce rules. There are many
other examples around. In a speech earlier this month, Mr Walter Schuetze,
chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said a review by
his agency had turned up 'restructuring' charges that included: 'future
expenditures for equipment such as computers, software for those computers
or computers already on hand, relocating and retraining employees,
advertising and legal services, consulting services, expected adverse
factory overhead variances on future production runs, expected increases in
returns and allowances on future sales, increased warranty liabilities on
future product sales, and the like'.
The new emerging issues taskforce regulations lay down a tighter set of
rules for the circumstances in which charges can be taken, and the types of
cost that can be included.
Those one-off charges that still qualify can only be taken after a company
has committed itself to a restructuring plan (which normally means getting
board-level approval). Also, the plan cannot simply be a vague expression of
a future intention: according to the FASB, companies will have to have
identified the method by which they are going to dispose of the businesses
concerned, as well as the expected date they will complete the exercise. The
expected completion of the plan has to be soon enough for it to be unlikely
that a company's management will change its mind about the idea.
Also, restructuring costs can only be taken if they meet one of two tests:
they must either be extra costs that a company faces as a result of the
restructuring plan, or contractual costs that it cannot get out of (an
example of the latter would be the cost of terminating a lease on property
which is no longer needed in the business).
There are those who think the rule-makers have not gone far enough - among
them Mr Schuetze at the SEC. Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'In my
opinion, they have allowed for the recognition of liabilities that do not
meet the FASB's definition of a liability, and which are more in the manner
of contingencies.'
Liabilities should only be recognised when there is some contractual or
legal obligation to make a payment, he says. 'Obligations do not arise
because a board of directors decides something.'
Mr Schuetze concedes, though, that the FASB has at least reduced the scope
for abuse. Before the accounting regulators began their work early this
year, 'the ingredients and amounts included in restructuring charges ran
from A to Z'. Now, he says, 'they're reining it in: it runs from A to G, or
maybe A to I'.
Whether the SEC will be satisfied with this, or whether it will push the
matter further, remains to be seen. At this stage, Mr Schuetze refuses to be
drawn on the question.
In theory, some big restructuring charges already taken - including those
reported by Nynex and BellSouth - could be open to challenge by the agency.
The new taskforce regulations, though they come into force before the end of
this year, are not retrospective. That means they apply to charges taken
during the final quarter of the year, but not those reported in earlier
accounting periods. However, the SEC has the power to force companies to
restate figures included in earlier regulatory filings. It is a power the
agency is most likely to use when vetting prospectuses issued by companies
in connection with the sale of new securities.
In the meantime, the emerging issues taskforce is getting ready to issue its
thoughts on asset write-downs. Here, again, there is a temptation for
companies to take big one-off charges to reduce future amortisation charges
to earnings, whether from tangible assets or intangibles like goodwill.
The taskforce's approach is based on the use of discounted cashflow
analyses: when the book values of assets, or groups of assets, are higher
than the present values of the future cashflows the assets are expected to
generate, they should be written down.
This, at least, is one area where the SEC is likely to go along with the
FASB. Unlike an expected restructuring cost, an asset represents 'a prior
expenditure, not a future expenditure', says Mr Schuetze. 'That is a vital
distinction.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Steady recovery for two years predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy is improving in an 'uncharacteristically smooth manner', with
steady recovery predicted for at least two more years, according to the
latest quarterly forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
Nevertheless, the private research group questions whether this means that
the UK has achieved any real economic miracle. It suggests that the healthy
combination of low inflation and fast growth simply represents 'the response
that might be expected' in a recovery in an economy that has just
experienced a 'deep recession where balance sheet difficulties were
prevalent'.
Overall, the institute has now revised its forecast for output growth for
1994 up to slightly over 3.5 per cent. This is higher than its forecast of
2.9 per cent growth made in the early summer, but still below most City
forecasts.
Nevertheless, Mr Garry Young, UK economist at the institute, yesterday
pointed out that the forecast had been made before the publication of
official figures last week which showed that gross domestic product in the
third quarter of this year grew at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent. He added
that the forecast would probably be revised further upwards.
Growth for next year is expected to fall to 2.75 per cent, due to a presumed
slowdown in the North Sea oil and gas sector. The institute's underlying
inflation forecast has been revised down, and is now 2.8 per cent for next
year compared with its previous forecast of 3.8 per cent. The institute
notes the main reason for this was low growth in labour costs.
Although the institute does not expect interest rates to rise to the levels
assumed by the markets, it nevertheless predicts that the authorities' tight
anti-inflation stance will help the exchange rate profile to stay broadly
constant. This is in contrast to its previous forecast, which assumed that
sterling would steadily depreciate. Vocational guidance for British school
leavers is inferior to careers advice given to young people in other
European countries, a study released today says, Motoko Rich writes.
The report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
compares careers education in the UK with Germany, Switzerland and the
Netherlands.
It found that careers training in mainland Europe gave young people of
'average and below-average attainments' better expectations than in Britain.
The report said that teachers were instructed in vocational guidance while
their British counterparts were not.
Advice was focused on specific careers and continental students were
provided with more effective work experience programmes than young people in
Britain.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Internet used 'at 30% of companies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 30 per cent of UK businesses are already connected to the Internet,
market research findings showed yesterday.
The study, conducted by Hi-Tech Marketing on behalf of Pipex, an Internet
service provider, was based on responses from 300 companies and other
organisations.
More than 95 per cent of those not connected to the Internet, the informal
system of computer networks which connects databases and computers across
the globe, expect to do so within the next 12 months.
Among those who are connected, most believe its use as a communications tool
outweighs its use as an information service. More than two-thirds use the
Internet most frequently to send electronic mail - to customers, suppliers
and employees elsewhere in a group.
Almost half - 49 per cent - of the respondents listed file transfer as the
second most frequent use, followed by sourcing and providing information,
listed by 40 per cent. Software distribution was cited as the fourth most
important application.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, plans to provide its analysis of the
Budget on the Internet less than 12 hours after the chancellor addresses the
Commons on Tuesday. The announcement follows the Treasury's decision to
publish the Budget speech on the Internet via Pipex.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Health officials forced to disclose information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parliamentary ombudsman has forced the Department of Health to release
information about talks it claimed to have held with pharmaceutical industry
representatives.
It is the second time that Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman, has
used his powers under the government's code of practice on access to
official information and forced civil servants to hand over information they
wanted to keep secret.
The code was introduced by in April amid claims that it would open to the
public documents and research previously kept secret.
The ombudsman was appointed as an independent referee to rule on disputes
between indivi-duals and civil servants.
Mr Reid reveals his decision in a report published today. The report also
gives details of another case in which he upheld the Inland Revenue's
refusal to reveal information about an individual.
Earlier this year Mr Reid disclosed that he had forced the Department of
Transport to hand over a report it had tried to keep private.
Mr Reid said: 'My report shows that the code can work to enable members of
the public to acquire information which would otherwise be denied them.'
The Campaign for Freedom of Information asked in May for information from
the government on its discussions with the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry about introducing a voluntary code on disclosure of
the contents and production of pharmaceuticals.
The pressure group suspected that formal talks had not begun and argued to
the ombudsman that reference to discussions by the government were
'spurious'.
The department refused to give any details until the ombudsman intervened.
The group was then told that 'an informal meeting on January 26 1993' had
been held between a DoH official and the ABPI and that there was 'further
contact by letter on February 1 1993'.
Meanwhile, the ombudsman has hinted that he believes there may be too many
areas under which access to information can be refused.
He said yesterday: 'It may be that the code goes further than it need in
some of its exemptions.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Call for reform of tax claim law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the law governing the right to reclaim overpaid tax was called for
yesterday by the Law Commission, the government's law reform body.
The commission reviewed the law following criticism by the Lords in a 1992
case.
The right to recover taxes overpaid by mistake or in response to a demand
which the revenue authorities had no power to make depends on conflicting
statutory provisions and a common law recovery right developed by the Law
Lords.
The commission recommends a new statutory recovery right for direct taxes
allowing taxpayers to reclaim all sums 'paid but not due', subject to
several qualifications.
Repayment must be claimed within six years, and recovery will be denied
where it would unjustly enrich the taxpayer or where the taxpayer could have
raised the issue on an appeal against an assessment, but did not.
The Law Commission recommends that the present rule, dating from 1802, which
prevents recovery of sums paid or benefits received under a mistake of law,
should be repealed.
But taxpayers will not be allowed to argue retrospectively that payment was
made under a mistake of law.
For indirect taxes, the commission recommends a new recovery right for
excise duties based on the recovery regime for value added tax.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Societies neutral on regulation shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of bringing building societies within the same regulatory
regime as banks was highlighted yesterday by MPs on the Treasury committee.
The Building Societies Association was asked about the idea of merging the
Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, with the
supervisory division of the Bank of England.
It was giving evidence to the committee's inquiry into financial regulation.
Mr Donald Kirkham, association chairman, told the MPs: 'We are fairly
neutral about who regulates us, provided that it's effective.'
While the association said it did not see the need for change and that the
commission had been a successful regulator, Mr Adrian Coles,
director-general, said 'it would not be a dreadful disaster if it was
merged' provided the supervisor's expertise was not lost.
The comments came the day after Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second
largest, called for a single regulatory framework for financial services
with one watchdog covering areas currently handled by a range of
organisations.
Until recently, the arguments for regulatory convergence came largely from
banks and their supervisors, with societies merely expressing support for
their regulator.
The Treasury did not address regulation in the consultation paper it
published for its review of societies' powers.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Cadbury set to weaken trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury, the confectionery arm of Cadbury Schweppes, is planning to weaken
the trade unions at its plants through a new strategy for its 5,000 UK
employees, according to internal company documents obtained by the TGWU
general union.
An internal company paper says: 'The role of the trade union needs to be
marginalised by greater focus on direct communication and consultation but
without an overt statement to this effect.' The paper is a summary of the
'personal values agreed by senior factory managers' at a meeting on
September 29.
The leaked document suggests that the company will need to reduce its
workforce, and says it may have to consider a 'potential downsizing
scenario'.
It also says: 'Employee support for the trade union should . . . decrease
over time. However, it is not likely that the trade union would be
derecognised, given the likelihood of downsizing. A redefined role for the
trade union is therefore required.'
The company adds in the paper that for those groups whose unions have been
derecognised, 'it is important they are not exploited by the company as this
would lead to pressure for renewed trade union involvement'.
Cadbury also intends to investigate 'how involvement can continue without
formal union structures'.
Cadbury's other plans include 'severing the link between the retail price
index and pay and replacing collective bargaining with individualised
arrangements' tied to skill, competence and performance-related salaries'.
The company also wants to make level one of the national vocational
qualification the skill standard for all production workers.
Mr Brian Revell, the TGWU's national secretary for the food industry, said
the new strategy was disappointing. 'It is certainly not consistent with the
company's respectable Quaker image of the past,' he said, and suggested it
was being 'basically . . . manipulative'. Shop stewards from Cadbury unions
are due to meet this weekend to discuss their response.
The company said last night that Cadbury was 'looking at possible options
for the future'.
It aims to shift consultation away from the unions, and says it also wants
to establish 'a performance-focused culture' in its plants with a
'revaluation of the balance between basic pay for the job, payment for skill
enhancement and pay associated with sharing in the success of the business'.
The document adds: 'A key issue for the near term will be the need to reduce
numbers if volume growth is not achieved and plant efficiencies continue to
improve.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Zeneca moves to individual pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca, the chemical and pharmaceutical company, has decided to end
collective bargaining with unions representing 8,200 white-collar staff in
its UK plants.
The company has given union officials six months' notice of its intention to
abandon company-wide negotiations on pay and conditions of service including
hours of work, holidays, working arrangements, shifts and security of
employment.
From next April, the pay of Zeneca's staff will be determined through
assessment by local management of individual performance, ending the old
system of annual across-the-board cost-of-living awards in addition to merit
review rises.
Zeneca's move has come as a shock to union leaders. Earlier this week they
met Mr David Barnes, the company's chief executive, to discuss the new
strategy.
They told him the overwhelming majority of white-collar staff in Zeneca was
opposed to the end of collective bargaining and urged him to test their
views by holding an independent survey.
In a statement to the staff, the five unions involved accused the company of
'blatant ideological opportunism'.
The statement said: 'It represents the reversal of every assurance given to
the unions and every statement made by the company . . . It has been done in
an underhand way and against all the principles of consultation which have
developed at national level over many years.' The company said less than 30
per cent of white-collar staff belonged to a trade union. Unions could still
represent their members in the company on disciplinary and grievance issues
as well as health and safety. 'We wish to continue to have an open dialogue
with the unions,' it said.
Zeneca said it had no intention of ending collective pay bargaining for
manual worker grades. 'We have no experience of operating a merit pay scheme
with them,' it said.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Non-stop to the private sector: Why the route to stock
market flotation is being speeded up for Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Railtrack, the company which owns British Rail's track,
signalling and stations, will be announced by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport
secretary, this afternoon.
If leaked official documents obtained by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow
transport secretary, are to be believed, the government has set a target
date of the first three months of 1996 for the stock market flotation.
Railtrack is the single largest element in the newly fragmented British
railway network and a key to the success or failure of the privatisation
programme. Its role is to rent its track and stations to the train
operators.
With a possible market value of about Pounds 4bn, the company's move to
market will provide a significant boost to public funds and a considerable
challenge for the City.
Such a rapid move into the private sector did not feature in the
government's original plans for the railway industry. The original intention
was to keep Railtrack in the public sector while the passenger and freight
train operations were franchised or sold off.
But the government has been forced to make the timetable tighter because of
its poor showing in the opinion polls. Labour has threatened to return the
railway to public ownership if it wins a general election in late 1996 or
early 1997, an objective which would be difficult to achieve if substantial
parts of the network were functioning well in private hands.
On top of the political constraints, the government has had to contend with
delays in privatising the other parts of the network - compounded by a
four-month signal workers' strike this summer.
Reaching agreement on the hundreds of contracts required to regulate
relations between the new players in the railway market is proving far more
time-consuming than at first thought.
Mr Robert Horton, the chairman of Railtrack, has characterised this process
as being no different to retailer Marks and Spencer reaching agreement with
suppliers. But for a centralised railway used to operating by memo and the
rule book, ordering matters by commercial contract is a new experience.
The pace of Railtrack's privatisation has also been driven by ambitions
among the company's management. Mr Horton, a hard-driving, former chairman
and chief executive of British Petroleum, is keen to take his company into
the private sector as soon as possible. Endless meetings with civil servants
are not to his taste, he says.
For all the excitement generated by the prospect of the government's
announcement, there is as yet very little information for the City to use in
evaluating Railtrack. Investors are like commuters asked to buy a ticket for
a revolutionary new train which is not due to come into service for at least
18 months.
Among uncertainties over Railtrack are:
The attitude of the rail regulator, Mr John Swift, to the charges Railtrack
plans to levy on train operating companies. Mr Swift has expressed concerns
about Railtrack's monopoly and the high level of returns on assets the
Treasury expects the company to make. He could impose tight constraints on
Railtrack's charges.
The details of the access agreements being negotiated between Railtrack and
the passenger train operators. These should be finalised within the next few
months. Matters such as compensation arrangements in the event of the
collapse of an embankment will affect Railtrack's profits.
The extent to which the Treasury is prepared to maintain subsidies to the
train operators. These will be passed on to Railtrack in the form of access
payments. The franchising director, Mr Roger Salmon, believes he has firm
commitments from the Treasury but private investors may not be reassured.
The first exploratory analysis of Railtrack's prospects - published last
week by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank - estimated its market value at
between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn, considerably less than the notional
Pounds 6.5bn Treasury valuation of its assets. It is perhaps fortunate that
the City will have more than 12 months to refine its calculations and to
reconcile the numbers.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Political Notebook: A tonic for backbench nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories, clearly, have not learnt the lesson. The plotting and the
preening at Westminster these last few days have exposed once again the
instinct for self-destruction which permeates Tory backbenches. In today's
stupid party (Conservatives used to take pride in the epithet)
self-publicity comes before self-restraint.
Mr John Major, once again the subject of a whispering campaign in the
lobbies, is dismayed. By and large, his cabinet colleagues share his dismal
opinion of the rightwing trouble-makers. The so-called cabinet bastards have
been seeking with limited success to restrain their Eurosceptic acolytes on
the backbenches.
There is more to come. Mr Major has become entangled in the contest between
Sir Marcus Fox and Sir Nicholas Bonsor for the chairmanship of the 1922
committee of backbenchers. It is a far more complicated struggle than
commentators have had the patience to explain. But the point is that it
provides plenty of soundbite opportunities for those with grudges against No
10. So too does the forthcoming vote on the European Union budget.
The odds are that Mr Major will once again survive. Like the hero of an
old-fashioned children's comic, the prime minister has become accustomed to
emerging blackened but still standing from each successive explosion. His
enemies have another week to garner the 34 signatories needed to mount a
leadership challenge. They are living in hope rather than expectation.
Barring a fatal accident during Monday's EU vote (there is always a chance
that this party will shoot itself in the head), Mr Major's hope of restoring
a semblance of order now rests on the broad shoulders of Mr Kenneth Clarke.
The chancellor's task in Tuesday's Budget is to demonstrate that the
government has a chance - however small - of winning the next general
election. Mr Major will only be safe if and when the irreconcilable minority
on the backbenches can no longer feed on the deep electoral anxieties of the
uncommitted majority. So Mr Clarke must show that spending and borrowing are
under control, the recovery is sustainable and that tax cuts are within
sight.
The FT's customary pre-Budget survey of opinion on the backbenches distills
the priorities of the would-be loyalists as well as the dissidents.
An overwhelming majority expect swingeing reductions in the cash plans for
next year's public spending total. Anything under Pounds 5bn will be a
disappointment. Some 31 per cent of the 70 Tory MPs who replied to a
detailed pre-Budget questionnaire said they wanted reductions of Pounds 6bn
or more.
The odds are that Mr Clarke will not disappoint them. Ministers smile at the
speculation that he has Pounds 5bn up his sleeve - so it should be safe to
assume that the chancellor has another Pounds 3bn or so in reserve.
As for tax cuts, the backbenchers for the moment are prepared to give Mr
Clarke the benefit of the doubt. There is intense concern still about value
added tax on fuel. A third would like him to hold the rate at 8 per cent.
But a majority are prepared to grit their teeth.
Look ahead to next year and 1996 and the picture changes. The message is
clear: we will bear the pain now as long as you deliver the bribes to the
voters in good time for the election. Rank-and-file MPs are as conscious as
was Mr John Maples in his ill-fated memorandum to Mr Major that the worthy
combination of stable growth and low inflation is not enough. The punters
want money put in their pockets. Nearly two-thirds of the MPs insist
pre-election tax cuts are vital or important. Most of the rest think they
are desirable. Only 4 per cent regard them as unimportant. Take note, Mr
Clarke.
There are doubts, too, over interest rates. The pre-emptive increase in
September won broad support. But the backbenchers do not like the idea of
the government being pushed around by the Bank of England. Two-thirds want
the chancellor to wait before applying the brakes again.
The MPs are clear how Mr Clarke should spend any spare cash. A substantial
majority want him to meet his commitment to remove the worst of the poverty
and unemployment traps. Almost as many believe he must add some lustre to
their tarnished claim to be the natural party of small business.
The chancellor rightly is perceived to be heir apparent should Mr Major one
day decide he has had enough of being blown up by his own supporters. Mr
Clarke's ratings in the FT survey - more than 80 per cent say his
performance has been excellent or good - reinforce the claim. But, this time
around at least, Mr Major is as anxious as anyone that Mr Clarke produces a
Budget to calm Tory nerves.

            WHAT TORY MPs WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE BUDGET
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Results shown in rounded percentages.  Totals do not necessarily add up
to 100 because respondents have in some cases chosen more than one
option or have not answered every question.  Written questionnaires

FT  24 NOV 94 / Treasury drops dividends probe after pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has abandoned its review of whether companies' dividend
payments are too high and there will be no measures in the Budget next week
aimed at controlling dividends.
A senior government official said the issue was dropped after it was
attacked by Lord Hanson, chairman of the Hanson conglomerate. The official
said: 'The issue became too much of a hot potato after Hanson attacked the
review. No one wanted to pick it up.'
Mr Stephen Dorrell, as financial secretary to the Treasury, initiated an
inquiry a year ago into whether the tax structure encourages companies to
allocate an excessive proportion of retained profits to dividends compared
with funds for investment. It was part of a wider review of the financing of
industry.
Mr Dorrell disclosed details of the probe in a speech to a Confederation of
British Industry conference in the spring.
He was immediately attacked by Mr Paddy Linaker, then chief executive of
M&amp;G, the fund management group. But a far greater embarrassment was the leak
of a letter to Mr Dorrell from Lord Hanson, accusing the minister of
'sounding like a socialist'.
Lord Hanson then urged the prime minister to keep a firm hand on the
dividend review.
A government official said yesterday that since then the probe has been
quietly shelved.
Companies are making artificially high dividend payments to keep pension
funds happy and protect themselves against hostile takeovers, a study by the
School of Business and Economics at Leeds University said yesterday.
All 700 respondents said companies were pressured by City opinion to be more
generous with dividend payments than they would like.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Curry dashes hopes to increase private rented accommodation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Curry, the housing minister, yesterday dashed hopes that a class of
investment trust to increase private rented accommodation would be
introduced in the Budget, Robyn Chalmers writes.
The trusts aim to boost institutional investment in the private rented
sector. They would be free from capital gains tax and pay corporation tax at
the lower rate of 25 per cent.
Mr Curry said that no industry estimates had been provided on levels of
subsidy needed.
Once an estimate had been concluded he would be prepared to explore the
option in line with the government's stated aim of encouraging growth in the
sector.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Clarke may act over executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders may be given increased powers to curb excessive pay increases
for top company executives, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, disclosed in
the Commons yesterday.
He revealed that the practical issues involved were under examination as the
government came under renewed pressure to condemn the 75 per cent rise
awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive.
It is understood that the chancellor has had preliminary discussions with Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about the legislative
implications of increasing shareholder power.
Mr Clarke ruled out renewed Labour demands for the imposition of a windfall
tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, and for executive
salaries to be brought within the regulatory regimes which oversee their
pricing policies.
He said he disapproved of large salary increases in any company which went
far beyond what could be deemed reasonable in relation to their performance.
The continuing chorus of disapproval about the rewards available to the
heads of the privatised utilities dominated the final stages of the six-day
debate on the Queen's Speech.
Sir Edward Heath updated the phrase he used when, as prime minister, he
condemned the activities of Lonrho, by describing Mr Brown's increase as the
'unacceptable post-privatisation face of capitalism'.
He added: 'Why do I condemn it? Because it shows he has absolutely no
understanding of public relations between his corporation and the public -
absolutely none.'
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, also opposed a
windfall tax - but called for excess profits to be returned to consumers
through rebates.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the profit levels of the
privatised utilities had increased by 50 per cent during the recession when
other companies had been forced to cut back. He said the people of Britain
were 'increasingly disgusted' by the excessive pay rises. Mr Brown also
called for action in next week's Budget to 'end short-termism' in relation
to dividends, but admitted that there was little prospect of the action
materialising.
Mr Clarke said he had been able to prepare the Budget against the background
of the 'most encouraging set of economic prospects' for many years.
The 'lasting recovery' that he intended to deliver would give real hope in
the future 'for prosperity and for jobs'.

awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive.
It is understood that the chancellor has had preliminary discussions with Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about the legislative
implications of increasing shareholder power.
A Labour attempt to condemn the broken election promises, and the failure to
deal with the 'excesses in the privatised utilities' was defeated by a
government majority of 46 (312-266) at the end of the six-day debate on the
Queen's Speech.
Mr Clarke ruled out renewed Labour demands for the imposition of a windfall
tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities, and for executive
salaries to be brought within the regulatory regimes which oversee their
pricing policies. He said he disapproved of large salary increases in any

windfall tax - but called for excess profits to be returned to consumers
through rebates.
Mr Clarke said he had been able to prepare the Budget against the background
of the 'most encouraging set of economic prospects' for many years.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, announced that he was close to reaching
an agreement with Labour and other parties to reduce the number of late
sittings. He envisaged that debate on some bills would be limited through a
voluntary timetable.
He also suggested that some debates on backbench motions would be switched
to Wednesday mornings to Friday sittings.

<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour will today unveil proposals to give employers a sizeable tax rebate
in return for hiring the long-term unemployed.
The party will suggest that employers be offered a rebate of at least Pounds
50 a week for a period of six months. The rebate would apply in cases where
those taken on had been unemployed for more than two years.
The proposal will form part of an alternative Budget to be presented today
by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and
other senior shadow cabinet members.
The party's package will focus on three areas: investment, getting the
unemployed back to work, and taxation.
Mr Brown indicated earlier this month that the alternative Budget would be
designed to rebuild the economy and ease the impact of tax increases on the
less well off.
He said it would demonstrate how the government could avoid implementing the
second phase of the increase in value added tax on domestic fuel - from 8
per cent to 17.5 per cent - which is planned for April.
The increase could be replaced by revenue from other sources, including a
windfall levy on the 'excess' profits of regional electricity companies.
Other measures would include an energy-efficiency programme, intended to
create employment for building workers and a training programme for the
unemployed.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Steady recovery predicted for next two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy is improving in an 'uncharacteristically smooth manner', with
steady recovery predicted for at least two more years, according to the
latest quarterly forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research.
Nevertheless, the private research group questions whether this means that
the UK has achieved any real economic miracle. It suggests that the healthy
combination of low inflation and fast growth simply represents 'the response
that might be expected' in a recovery in an economy that has just
experienced a 'deep recession where balance sheet difficulties were
prevalent'.
Overall, the institute has now revised its forecast for output growth for
1994 up to slightly over 3.5 per cent. This is higher than its forecast of
2.9 per cent growth made in the early summer, but still below most City
forecasts.
Nevertheless, Mr Garry Young, UK economist at the institute, yesterday
pointed out that the forecast had been made before the publication of
official figures last week which showed that gross domestic product in the
third quarter of this year grew at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent. He added
that the forecast would probably be revised further upwards.
Growth for next year is expected to fall to 2.75 per cent, due to a presumed
slowdown in the North Sea oil and gas sector. The institute's underlying
inflation forecast has been revised down, and is now 2.8 per cent for next
year compared with its previous forecast of 3.8 per cent. The institute
notes the main reason for this was low growth in labour costs.
However, it also credits the government, noting that there is an 'increase
in the credibility which we expect to be attached to the commitment by the
monetary authorities to keep down inflation'.
Although the institute does not expect interest rates to rise to the levels
assumed by the markets, it nevertheless predicts that the authorities' tight
anti-inflation stance will help the exchange rate profile to stay broadly
constant. This is in contrast to its previous forecast, which assumed that
sterling would steadily depreciate.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Ulster's isolation compounded by lack of integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The isolation of Ulster is compounded by its lack of integration with the
republic of Ireland, the institute says in its review, Stewart Dalby writes.
It sees hope in the peace process, saying that an end to the troubles could
help bring about an integration in the vital areas of manufacturing and
food.
The institute calls into question a perception that Ulster's fringe position
in the UK could be a deterrent to inward investment. The review says
transport costs from the province to places such as Berlin and Milan are
substantially lower than costs to the same places from Dublin. Costs to New
York are 27 per cent less.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Weaknesses seen in careers advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vocational guidance for British school leavers is inferior to careers advice
given to young people in other European countries, a study released today
says.
The report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
compares careers education in the UK with Germany, Switzerland and the
Netherlands.
It found that careers training in mainland Europe gave young people of
'average and below-average attainments' better expectations than in Britain.
The report said that teachers were instructed in vocational guidance while
their British counterparts were not.
Advice was focused on specific careers and continental students were
provided with more effective work experience programmes than young people in
Britain.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Lack of overtime 'blocks feelgood'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A key reason for the lack of a 'feelgood' factor in the economy is the low
level of overtime, says a report by Kleinwort Benson, the broker.
It argues that the new flexibility in the labour force has significantly
eroded the level of overtime and left people increasingly insecure about job
prospects.
Overtime rose by 1m hours a week on average between August and September, to
reach 9.84m hours, its highest level since last July, but below the levels
of two years ago.
A 37-hour basic working week has become the norm for Britain's manual
workers, a study by Industrial Relations Services has found.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Channel 4 attacks complaint ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 last night issued a strong attack on the Broadcasting Complaints
Commission.
According to Broadcast magazine the commission has ruled that A Tale Of Two
Cities, a programme by Mr Duncan Campbell's production company IPTV, was in
some respects unfair to Mr Derek Donaldson and that there was unwarranted
invasion of his privacy during filming.
Mr Campbell had tried to interview Mr Donaldson about claims over his role
in the theft of documents from an Edinburgh police station relating to the
'Fettesdgate affair' involving alleged offences by gay lawyers.
Channel 4 said last night that Mr Donaldson had beaten up Mr Campbell in a
successful attempt to prevent the original transmission of the programme and
as a result had been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.
It added: 'By treating Donaldson like any other complainant, the BCC has
devalued its own procedures.' Mr Donaldson's complaint should not have been
heard, it said.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Ministers fail to speed up the superhighway: Little is
changed by the government's latest statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even seasoned observers of the fast-changing telecommunications scene took
time to absorb the implications of the government's latest statement on the
development of the 'information superhighway', published earlier this week.
In 35 pages it reinforces the government's commitment to the multimedia
revolution but does little to alter the commercial playing field.
The statement is in part a formal response to the views of the parliamentary
committee on optical fibre networks which were published earlier this year.
The MPs argued that British Telecommunications should be free to offer
broadcast entertainment across its existing network - a conclusion which BT
wholeheartedly supports.
This week's government paper, Creating the Superhighways of the Future,
rejects that idea, but seems to offer BT and public telecommunications
operators the opportunity to test their broadcasting ambitions on a small
scale. But very little has changed.
BT wants to offer the broadest range of services across its network. The
government, anxious to stimulate competition in telecommunications and to
encourage investment by cable television companies, has denied it permission
to broadcast entertainment.
It is not, however, prevented from offering 'on-demand' services such as
movies, home shopping or home banking. An ambitious series of trials in the
south-east of England will test its ability to deliver these services.
Under the terms of the government's last telecommunications review in 1991,
there will be no revision of the ban on broadcast entertainment before 2001.
This week's paper underlined that commitment.
Cable companies, however, were empowered to offer telephone services as well
as entertainment over their networks under the terms of the 1991 review.
This assurance of phone revenues was critical in persuading cable companies
to make the heavy investments needed - a total of about Pounds 10bn by 2000
 -to construct an adequate cable infrastructure.
By the end of next year about 6.5m homes will be connected to cable and more
are being connected at a rate of between 1m and 2m a year.
The 1990 Broadcasting Act rewrote the licence for cable television
operators. The newly named Local Delivery Operators can deliver
entertainment using radio technology as well as cable to clearly defined
franchise areas such as a city or local authority area.
There are 127 existing franchises; a further nine have been advertised which
will be let under the new terms. A further 30 or so have yet to be defined
geographically. When that has been done, about 95 per cent of the country
will be covered.
This week's paper argues that BT and other telecommunications operators have
been able, since April, to apply for any advertised franchise. If they were
successful, the government would be prepared to grant a licence to supply
entertainment within the area of the franchise. They would be able to use
either their existing technology - in BT's case, the conventional telephone
lines into the home - or another, such as cable or radio.
In fact, this freedom has always been available to BT although it has rarely
sought to advertise the fact. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable
Communications Association, the cable trade body, said yesterday: 'All the
government is saying to BT is 'Come and join the cable party'.'
BT has no intention of contributing to a piecemeal approach to the recabling
of Britain. It owned a number of cable franchises at one stage but sold
them. It has not overinvested in Westminster Cable, one franchise it
retained. It wants to spend Pounds 15bn to create its own network in
competition with the cable operators.
Nothing in the government's latest paper alters this stalemate.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Getting the dirt on mucky past: The latest moves in the
struggle to clean up contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's forthcoming legislation on contaminated land will be the
latest stage of a five-year struggle to get to grips with the legacy of
Britain's industrial past.
In 1990 the Commons environment committee published its first report on
contaminated land, estimating that up to 100,000 sites could be described as
contaminated.
The government was quick to respond - too quick, according to its critics.
Section 143 of the Environmental Protection Act, passed in November 1990,
proposed that district councils maintain publicly available registers of
contaminated sites.
The idea, in line with the environment committee's proposals, aimed to
assist local authorities and developers by identifying potential problems.
But the proposal soon ran into difficulties as the government consulted
local authorities and the property industry on what the register should
include.
It is costly to establish if a site is actually contaminated, so the
government proposed that inclusion should be based on the historic uses of
the land. The first consultation document suggested a list of 40 uses which
could potentially cause contamination.
Environmental groups applauded the proposals but landowners and property
developers argued that the net had been cast too widely.
There was clearly a risk that formerly industrialised areas would be
blighted as developers chose to build on greenfield sites instead.
The Merry Hill shopping centre, built on a former steelworks, was just one
site in the heavily industrialised Black Country which would have been
affected. The Department of the Environment's London headquarters, built on
the site of a gas works, would also have appeared on the register.
The number of uses that might cause contamination was later reduced to
eight, which would have cut the area covered by 90 per cent.
However there were other reasons why the proposals were seen as unworkable.
One problem was that contaminated land would have stayed on the proposed
register even after cleaning. The government's arguments for this were: that
information on the site's history would be necessary when any future change
of use was proposed; contamination from a site might have moved to adjacent
sites; treatment rarely removed all contamination, while new hazards might
be discovered later.
More seriously, the proposals did not address the problems of clean-up
targets and funding. Without targets or an idea of who should pay to meet
them the register would not have solved the underlying problem.
Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, announced in March last year
that Section 143 would not be brought into force. But that was by no means
the end of the problem. Numerous acts of parliament set out criminal and
financial penalties for contamination. Property owners had no way of knowing
the extent of potential liabilities.
The question of liability was clarified by the Lords ruling last December in
a battle between Cambridge Water and Eastern Counties Leather over liability
for water pollution.
The Lords ruled that Eastern Counties Leather, a leather treatment company,
could not be held responsible for pollution caused years ago because it
could not reasonably have foreseen the damage.
In doing so, they rejected the application of strict liability of the kind
which applies in the US - that polluters are liable regardless of whether
they foresaw the damage or took steps to alleviate it.
In March the government published a consultation paper, Paying For Our Past,
with preliminary conclusions about the direction of future legislation.
The paper included three principles:
US-style strict liability would not be introduced. In line with the
Cambridge Water ruling polluters should, in general, only be liable if they
were at fault and could have anti-cipated the problem.
Land need not be cleaned to a pristine state, only to the level necessary
for its intended use. The proposal, which has been attacked by
environmentalists, is an attempt to avoid some of the huge clean-up bills
which have arisen in other countries.
Although polluters should be primarily responsible for clean-up costs, banks
should, in some circumstances, be held liable for cleaning pollution caused
by companies to which they had made loans. This worried bankers, who argued
that it would discourage lending to industry.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Tories face December by-election test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The date of the Dudley West by-election has been set for December 15 - the
latest threat to the government's slim House of Commons majority.
Labour will be disappointed if it cannot win the West Midlands seat, in a
contest in which the Conservatives will defend a majority of less than
6,000.
Losing the seat would trim the government's majority to 13.
The by-election was caused by the death last month of Mr John Blackburn, the
sitting MP.
In the last general election, Labour cut the Conservative majority by nearly
half, even though the number of votes cast for Mr Blackburn increased by
2,500.
Mr Blackburn won the seat from Labour in 1979. It contains the market towns
of Kingswinford and Sedgley and has a high proportion of home owners.
Mr Graham Postles, the Conservative party candidate, said yesterday that his
campaign would focus on the issues of the economy and law and order. He said
that he would also seek to expose 'the reality behind the rose-tinted facade
of Tony Blair's new model Labour party'.
Mr Postles, the director of an insurance company in Halesowen, lost narrowly
to Labour's Mr Bruce George in Walsall South in the 1987 general election.
Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, will join his party's candidate, Mr
Ian Pearson, at Labour's campaign launch today. Mr Pearson is joint chief
executive of the West Midlands Enterprise Board.
Two other candidates have been named so far: Mr Michael Hadley (Liberal
Democrat) and Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony).
1992 result: Dr John Blackburn (C) 34,729, Kevin Lomax (Lab) 28,940, Gerry
Lewis (Lib Dem) 7,446. Turnout 82.1 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far-reaching guidelines for UK corporate users of derivatives are published
today in the wake of a succession of write-offs inflicted by interest rate
swaps and other complicated financial instruments.
The Association of Corporate Treasurers argues that companies must guard
against 'the failure to implement and operate controls at a very basic
level' that typically lies behind the worst losses.
That was the fundamental danger, Mr Derek Ross, chairman of the association,
said yesterday. He downplayed the role of complex products such as
'swaptions' and 'captions' that have taken much of the blame for losses.
The association, the professional body which groups together corporate
treasurers and finance directors from the UK's largest companies, laid
responsibility with top management.
The statement on best practice says: 'Strategies, policies and procedures .
. . must be clearly agreed by senior management and at least endorsed by the
board of directors.'
Nine tenths of companies state in surveys that they use derivatives to hedge
rather than to speculate, but the association argues that 'hedging' is too
ambiguous a concept to be sufficient as a policy statement.
The initiative comes in response to a procession of corporate setbacks. MG
Corp's oil futures positions cost Metallgesellschaft, its German parent,
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greeting
Cards of the US are both suing Bankers Trust after interest rate swaps went
wrong.
UK companies have escaped the latest wave of reported losses and some
executives argued that the media and politicians, particularly in the US,
have over-reacted to derivatives. There is no problem.'
Most controversial for less intensive users of derivatives is the
recommendation that companies establish 'an independent risk management
function' separate from treasury and dealers.

FT  24 NOV 94 / New CSO figures paint a detailed picture of imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports to third world countries and other regions outside the European
Union account for almost two-thirds of cigarettes produced in Britain.
Meanwhile imports account for only about a 50th of the total value of the UK
cigarette market, but nearly two thirds of the total volume of cigarettes
sold. This indicates that domestic brands are concentrated at the quality
end of the UK market.
These are the type of statistics that have emerged in a new series of
business publications providing information on import penetration levels of
different sectors.
The series was launched in London yesterday by the Central Statistical
Office and Taylor Nelson AG, the market research group. The series collects
information from 28,500 businesses and allows penetration levels to be
calculated from some 4,800 sectors.
The reports on the sectors will become available over the coming months.
However, samples of preliminary data for last year on areas such as the
tobacco sector yesterday indicated that the UK is now running a significant
trade surplus in the cigarette market.
Although the data still has to be approved by the CSO, the preliminary
statistics show that while tobacco exports account for only a tenth of the
total value of UK cigarette output, they represent more than three-quarters
of the volume.
Elsewhere, the data showed that import penetration in the industrial
clothing field fell significantly in some sectors while the average price of
some textiles items dropped as much as 30 per cent.
The report notes that the fall in the level of import penetration probably
reflects the sharp drop in the price of items sold by UK manufacturers - a
trend that suggests that in some sectors at least, UK manufacturers
continued last year to benefit from sterling's devaluation by becoming more
competitive than their overseas rivals.
But although UK products dominated the market for men's work jackets, for
example, exports crept up in other sectors such as men's work trousers.
The statistics show that UK producers accounted for almost all of the Pounds
51,520 sales of men's synthetic overalls last year, with import penetration
falling from about 3 per cent to about 1 per cent in the year.

FT  24 NOV 94 / BBC to push ahead with digital television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has decided in principle to push ahead with the launch of digital
terrestrial television and a near-national service could begin as early as
the autumn of 1997.
A BBC study of the issue following the government white paper on the future
of the corporation has come to a positive interim conclusion.
Terrestrial digital television involves turning the conventional television
picture into digits, the language of computers, but broadcasting through
land-based transmitters rather than by satellite.
The technology would allow the launch of wide-screen television - giving a
picture shaped like a cinema screen - and a number of extra channels.
As many as 12 new digital television channels could be created in the UK and
broadcast alongside the conventional four national channels.
The BBC believes digital technology will win over existing analogue
technology in the end. A crossover period of 10 to 15 years is likely,
however, when the two systems will have to be broadcast at the same time so
that no one is deprived of their basic television service.
The BBC may carry out its first public technical trial in March and a
limited regional trial could get under way in 1995 or 1996.
The BBC, as a publicly funded organisation, can initiate the first steps in
creating a digital terrestrial service. Executives emphasise, however, that
nothing of substance will happen unless the project is supported by other
British broadcasters and by the consumer electronics companies which would
manufacture the set-top boxes and new television sets.
Mr Charles Allan, chief executive of both Granada Television and LWT,
recently expressed interest in digital terrestrial television and the
possibility of creating new channels that it offered.
The BBC has been having talks with consumer electronics companies such as
Sony and with representatives of the ITV system.
In its white paper on the corporation's new Royal Charter the government
appeared to link a BBC move into digital television with privatisation or
partial privatisation of its transmitter network. The assumption appeared to
be that some of the money raised could be used for funding the launch of
digital.
The BBC argues that keeping it intact will increase its ability to make the
investment and commitment needed for digital.
The hope in the BBC is that a digital terrestrial service might be launched
by 1997 covering up to 80 per cent of the UK, possibly with a private-sector
partner.
On Monday the BBC will announce it is going ahead with two 24-hour a day
satellite channels for Europe in a joint venture with Pearson, the media and
entertainment group that owns the Financial Times.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Naval dockyards attract only one bidder each
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday accused the government of botching another
proposed privatisation after the Ministry of Defence announced it had
received only two initial bids for the Royal dockyards at Rosyth in Fife and
Devonport in Plymouth.
Five months after the government announced it was putting the yards up for
sale, the ministry said that Devonport Management had been the only bidder
for the Devonport yard and Babcock International Group the only bidder for
Rosyth.
The companies have been managing the respective yards on behalf of the
government since 1987, but their contracts are set to expire shortly.
It is understood that a dozen other companies, including GEC and BAe, had
registered an interest in buying the Devonport yard earlier this year.
However, the MoD has asked companies bidding for the yards to carry the
heavy risks involved in fixed-price contracts and to give guarantees over
the cost of refits for at least the first five years after sale. In a
Commons written answer yesterday, Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement
minister, said the government was evaluating the bids. He added: 'Outcomes
other than sale cannot be ruled out.'
His announcement came two weeks after the government abandoned plans to
privatise the Post Office, and drew a rebuke from Labour.
Dr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'This is yet another failed
government privatisation plan. It is now time the government stopped putting
ideology before practicality. You can't privatise Britain's security
requirements.'
Labour accused the government of spending more than Pounds 2m hiring City
consultants and bankers to advise on the privatisation, only to find an
absence of competition when the initial deadline for tenders had passed.
A range of management consultants and banks have advised the government on
the sale, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Kleinwort Benson. Under Treasury
guidelines, ministers are obliged to hire specialist consultants when
considering privatisation of state assets.
The MoD said last night that bids could still be received even though the
initial deadline had passed. It added: 'We will be going into negotiations
for the final bids shortly, but the government will only accept bids that
provide value for money for the taxpayer.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Death rates in large Scottish hospitals are to be published next month in a
move viewed with concern by some doctors. Talks are taking place about
implementing a similar plan in England.
One of five 'key indicators' to be published for 30 trust hospitals will be
the death rate for patients treated for heart attacks.
Doctors warned that the information would have to be presented as fully and
fairly as possible to minimise the risk of misinterpretation.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Carsberg refers property centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has referred the
solicitors' property centre which advertises 80 per cent of houses for sale
in Edinburgh, to Scotland's restrictive practices court, seeking a
declaration that it operates a rule that works against the public interest,
James Buxton writes.
He says a rule which forbids solicitors who are members of the centre from
advertising homes through the centre if an estate agent is also advertising
them restricts competition and consumer choice.
Last year Sir Bryan referred the Aberdeen solicitors property centre to the
court. The case has not yet been heard.
In Scotland, many houses are sold through solicitors rather than estate
agents. In some places solicitors have set up centres where properties for
sale through them are advertised.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Outspoken Tory resigns party post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Patrick Nicholls last night resigned as a Conservative party
vice-chairman after making an outspoken attack on the French and Germans in
his local newspaper.
The MP for Teignbridge and former minister said he bitterly regretted any
embarrassment he might have caused to the government in the article, which
was disowned by Conservative Central Office.
He said remarks about Germany and France had deflected from the main message
of the article which was that 'our destiny lies in Europe'.
He said his comments had also deflected attention from the fact that the
prime minister had been 'singularly successful in securing Britain's
interests in Europe'. That was why he would be supporting the government in
the vote on Monday on a bill increasing Britain's contributions to the
European Union budget.
Mr Nicholls quit as junior environment minister when caught drink-driving at
the 1990 Tory party conference. He had previously been at the employment
department where he was a member of the ministerial group on alcohol misuse.
Writing in the Western Morning News, Mr Nicholls ridiculed Germans as
warmongers and French as cowards. He said Germany's main contribution to
Europe had been to plunge the Continent into two world wars within living
memory. 'Too many of my compatriots have died to the strains of Deutschland
uber Alles,' he said.
Mr Nicholls dismissed the French as 'a nation of collaborators', who
presented themselves as a nation of resistance fighters. France was
'incapable of winning any war unless it is fought by the French Foreign
Legion, and only then because it is officered for the most part by English,
Americans and Germans'.
Mr Nicholls wrote: 'I wish I was not in the European Community. It is far
from the merely economic community we were led to expect, and if I thought
it was feasible to leave it, I would be off tomorrow.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he deplored 'a statement of rather
old-fashioned prejudices against anybody on the continent of Europe'. Mr
Nicholls' comments were not a helpful approach. 'One of the things I am
anxious to do is have an intelligent European debate.'
Mrs Noreen Atkinson, Mr Nicholls's constituency chairman, said she thought
he had been trying to put the case 'very squarely'.
Mr Nicholls, 46, is a former ministerial aide to Mr David Mellor in the Home
Office and Mr John Gummer in the Ministry of Agriculture. He fought off a
strong centre-party challenge to win his seat in 1983.
A strong loyalist with a reputation for forcefully defending government
policies, he was given special responsibilities for campaigning in May 1993
when he was appointed one of the five vice-chairmen who help run the party
organisation under Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Tory chairman.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Lottery jackpot set to reach Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, the National Lottery operator, expects this week's jackpot to reach
Pounds 4m - a figures which implies ticket sales of around 28m.
Everyone involved in the National Lottery expects sales this week to be
considerably down after the enormous publicity surrounding last week's
launch and the novelty of the first draw.
The consortium is now looking to see how the 'normal' pattern of sales
settles down. Around 50 per cent of total sales can usually be expected on
the Friday and Saturday - just before a draw.
Ticket sales in the first week of the lottery far exceeded expectations and
totalled 49m. The Pounds 5.9m jackpot was shared between seven winners and a
total of 1.15m people won part of the Pounds 22m prize fund.
On Tuesday a cheque for Pounds 12.6m was handed over to the National Lottery
Distribution Fund for eventual use by the five good causes that will benefit
 -the arts, charities, national heritage, a millennium fund and sport.
Already the lottery is showing signs of changing shopping habits. Spar, the
convenience store group which has about 400 outlets selling tickets,
believes the extra business generated could add Pounds 100m to its Pounds
1.2bn annual turnover.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Conservatives divided over EU budget forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory MPs were deeply split last night over an analysis of forecast UK
contributions to the European Union budget released by the Treasury.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, took the extraordinary step of releasing
figures from the Budget Red Book, expected on Tuesday, to provide a sound
statistical argument for a crucial parliamentary debate on Monday.
Mr Clarke said the figures proved 'incontrovertibly' that the increase in UK
contributions caused by the European communities finance bill would be
limited to Pounds 75m next year and Pounds 250m a year by 1999.
But Eurosceptic backbenchers seized on an admission that this year's net
contribution would be Pounds 720m higher than forecast, and said the
analysis justified claims that UK payments would rise by up to Pounds 1bn by
the end of the century.
Mr Edward Leigh, a rightwing former minister, said the analysis 'justifies
everything that we have been saying'. He added: 'We are not talking about
small amounts of money, we are talking about a serious issue of principle.'
Mr Clarke said he was 'quite confident' that the government would win the
second reading vote on the bill following the government's announcement that
it would call a general election in the event of a rebel victory.
The Treasury figures, released in a Commons written answer, update last
year's Red Book forecasts for net UK contributions from Pounds 1.7bn to
Pounds 2.4bn for the current year, an increase of Pounds 720m.
The figures also show that the forecast payment for next year has been
reduced by Pounds 64m to just under Pounds 3.4bn, and the forecast payment
for 1996-97 has fallen by Pounds 179m to Pounds 3.3bn.
Overall, Britain's net contributions are now forecast to be Pounds 963m
higher over the three years to 1996-97 than was expected, partly because of
the effect of faster UK growth on the complex formula that determines
payments.
However, none of the forecast rise is attributable to the provisions of the
bill, which implements a deal reached by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
and Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, at the Edinburgh EU summit in 1992.
In separate figures stripping out irregularities in payments caused by
technical factors, the Treasury forecasts that underlying net contributions
will rise from Pounds 2.5bn this year to Pounds 3.5bn in 1999.
It says that Pounds 600m of the Pounds 850m rise between next year - the
first affected by the bill - and 1999 is due to growth and inflation. Only
Pounds 250m is attributable to the Edinburgh deal.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Molyneaux urges Ulster jobs plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday urged the
government to make the whole of Northern Ireland an enterprise zone in a
move he said would have an immediate effect on jobs.
He called on companies planning to attend next month's international
investment forum in Belfast to consider placing Pounds 250,000 a year of new
trade with Northern Ireland companies.
He said the access of small and medium-sized companies to European Union
funding should be improved.
Mr Molyneaux warned MPs that there was still 'some way to go' in the peace
process.
He said Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, had 'not yet washed the
bloodstains off the hands he now holds out to the world as a man of peace'.
He added: 'The first step and only the first step has been taken by various
paramilitary organisations.'
In a sign of his influential role, Mr Molyneaux was watched by no fewer than
five government ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Molyneaux said his enterprise zone plan would 'create a dynamic economy
driven by the private sector'.
In another indication of the changing environment in the province, an Irish
government official was yesterday among International Fund for Ireland
representatives who appeared before the Commons Northern Ireland committee.
It is thought to be the first time a Dublin civil servant has appeared
before such a body.
The fund, set up by the British and Irish governments to promote investment
in the depressed economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties,
could create up to 20,000 jobs over the next three or four years, Mr William
McCarter, the fund's chairman, has said.
The fund receives contributions from the US, the European Union, Canada and
New Zealand.

FT  24 NOV 94 / BAe to shed 750 Airbus workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is to shed 750 jobs next year at its Airbus plants at
Filton, Bristol, and Broughton, near Chester.
Most of the losses will be at Filton, where 550 jobs will go with the
completion of a contract for the conversion of VC10 aircraft into RAF
refuelling tanker aircraft. BAe said the majority of jobs would be lost in
the first quarter of 1995, and would affect all categories of staff. It
hoped all redundancies would be voluntary.
The Airbus division employs 6,500 at the two plants and BAe has reduced the
workforce by 900 this year. In September, Raytheon, the US company which
bought the BAe executive jet division, announced it would close by 1997 an
adjacent factory in Broughton with the loss of 550 jobs.
Mr Chris Geoghegan, BAe Airbus managing director, said the reduction in
defence spending and pressure on civil programmes emphasised the importance
of the proposed European Future Large Aircraft. He urged the government to
consider it seriously rather than rushing to buy the Hercules C130J from
Lockheed as the RAF's transport aircraft
Nuclear Electric yesterday said 80 jobs were to be shed at Sizewell A power
station in Suffolk. The first 50 jobs will go over the next year. Staff are
being asked to take voluntary redundancy.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Hopes for housing trusts dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Curry, the housing minister, yesterday poured cold water on hopes
that a class of investment trust to increase the supply of private rented
accommodation would be introduced in the Budget.
Interest groups including the Association of Residential Letting Agents, the
independent Housing Investment Group and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had
hoped legislation would be changed to allow for authorised housing
investment trusts.
The proposed trusts were aimed at promoting institutional investment in the
private rented sector. They would be free from capital gains tax and pay
corporation tax at the lower rate of 25 per cent.
Mr Curry told a conference in London that no industry estimates had been
provided on levels of subsidy needed.
Once an estimate had been concluded, Mr Curry said, he would be prepared to
explore the option in line with the government's objective of encouraging
growth in the sector.
Mrs Patsy Baker, of the Housing Investment Group, said the organisation had
suggested that the government make Pounds 250m available to the trusts by
way of a grant.
She said the grant would bridge the yield gap of 1.5 per cent existing
between investor requirements and the returns available in the private
rented sector.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Zedillo assails US measure: Proposition 187 violates human
rights, says Mexican politician
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's president-elect, was ready to tell President
Bill Clinton yesterday that he viewed anti-immigrant initiatives like that
approved in California this month as 'a violation of basic human rights'.
In a breakfast session with reporters prior to a White House lunch, Mr
Zedillo said he would insist that cross-border issues like illegal
immigration be dealt with bilaterally and not left to unilateral state
action.
He pointed out that Mexican laws already guaranteed the access to education
and healthcare for all, regardless of nationality, that California's
Proposition 187 would deny to undocumented aliens. He hoped the US would
engage in an 'extensive' public debate which would end up by reflecting the
'traditional American values' which had always welcomed immigrants.
Unlike the outgoing Mexican government, Mr Zedillo made no explicit link
between illegal immigration and a deepening of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, approved 12 months ago.
He argued that Nafta should contribute to the sort of economic development
which would lessen the pressures on Mexicans to seek employment in the US.
The pact has already resulted in a 20 per cent growth in bilateral trade,
turning Mexico into the fastest growing market for US exports. He also
foresaw a wider hemispheric free trade area in the foreseeable future,
starting with Chile.
Mr Zedillo said he recognised with gratitude the position that Mr Clinton
and his administration had taken against Proposition 187, the implementation
of which, due next year, is already under challenge in state and federal
courts.
However, anti-immigrant sentiment has been fuelled by the California
referendum and now threatens the social benefits of those foreigners legally
resident in the US.
One version of the draft welfare reform bill being considered by the new
Republican majority in the House contains such a threat, with a few
exemptions for the elderly.
This bill would also require that welfare agencies report to the federal
government any case in which a recipient is suspected of being an illegal
immigrant, as Proposition 187 does for doctors and teachers.
This week two former Republican cabinet members, Mr Jack Kemp and Mr William
Bennett, again voiced their misgivings about immigration controls. Mr Kemp,
former housing secretary and a potential presidential candidate, warned that
the Republicans risked turning themselves 'inwards to a protectionist and
isolationist and more xenophobic party', contrary to its traditions.
But their arguments have already been directly criticised in the National
Review, the magazine for conservative thinkers.
One article in its latest edition, headlined 'America's identity crisis,'
claims that all immigration, legal and illegal, 'strengthens and reinforces
ethnic subcultures', produces minimal economic benefit and is directly
responsible for what the author condemns as the flowering of
multiculturalism and the growth of the welfare state.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Orders for durable goods fall in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply lower orders for new cars and aircraft pulled down the value of US
durable goods orders in October, the Commerce Department said yesterday,
Reuter reports from New York and Washington.
Orders fell 1.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 152.8bn (Pounds
97.3bn) after a revised 0.3 per cent rise in September. Wall Street
Economists had forecast a 0.4 per cent gain in October.
It was the first decline in three months - caused entirely by a sharp
decline in transport goods orders, which plunged 9.4 per cent to a
seasonally adjusted Dollars 35.2bn. Excluding transport, orders rose 1.1 per
cent after a 0.4 per cent September increase.
Analysts said the fall in could signal early signs of fatigue in the US
manufacturing sector. 'This is a warning sign for smokestack America,' said
Mr Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
Some areas of the report displayed surprising weakness, said Mr Roach,
particularly non-defence capital goods orders, which fell 2.9 per cent after
a 3.6 per cent rise in September. 'This suggests the capital goods rate of
growth will probably moderate from the vigorous gains we had earlier this
year,' he said.
However, others expressed caution in interpreting the figures. 'I'm
surprised by the marked weakness in transportation orders, but I hesitate to
read too much into it,' said Ms Carol Stone, economist at Nomura Securities
International. She pointed to other sectors, such as industrial machinery,
which continued to advance at a brisk pace.
Officials said the value of durable goods orders excluding transport was a
record Dollars 117.6bn. Defence orders fell in October by 16.9 per cent
after rising 11.6 per cent in September. Electronic and electrical goods
orders rose 0.5 per cent after a 4.3 per cent September gain. Shipments of
durable goods were down 1.2 per cent in October after a drop of 0.8 per cent
the month before.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Metropolitan Phoenix rises as construction industry hots up:
Building employment is booming, but competitive market is helping restrain
pay inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ARIZONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a construction-driven economy like the Phoenix metropolitan area, where
building accounts for 30 per cent of all new job creation, you can see the
signs of expansion all around you: in the red-tiled homes sprouting among
newly-planted palm trees and saguaro cacti in the north valley and the shiny
office buildings and shopping centres downtown.
Other sectors are prospering, too. Intel is putting up a Dollars 1.3bn
microchip plant in the southern suburb of Chandler, and surging copper
prices have brought good times again to Arizona's old-established mining
industry.
Employment in the state is projected to climb by 5 per cent this year, with
much of the growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and construction
employment has been expanding at an annual pace above 15 per cent.
'The Greater Phoenix economy is booming, and signs point to continued
prosperity over the next several years,' proclaims the Greater Phoenix
Economic Council, a public and private sector partnership which boosts
development in the metropolitan area.
As the Federal Reserve seeks to cool down a national economy where
employment is growing only half as quickly, hot spots like Phoenix are the
sort of area where the inflationary pressures the Fed fears might be
expected to be showing up already.
But local economists say that even the most rapidly growing sector of the
local economy - construction - is not showing the kind of wage inflation
that might be expected.
'There is definitely a lot of pressure on wages but I don't believe that it
is being translated into higher wage levels. It's a sufficiently competitive
housing market that you couldn't simply raise wages, or you'd be priced out
of it,' says Mr Dan Anderson of Arizona's Department of Economic Security.
Home prices in Phoenix have risen by 3.3 per cent over the past year to an
average of Dollars 91,100, but remain well below those in nearby cities such
as Albuquerque or Las Vegas, and less than half the average of Los Angeles
or San Francisco.
Bottlenecks are emerging, however, particularly for construction skills such
as framing carpenters. 'When you see hand-painted signs on building lots
saying 'Framers wanted - apply on site' you know there are skill shortages,'
says Mr Bill Stephenson, director of economic development with Arizona
Public Service, the largest local utility.
Skilled framers are more likely to look for work in neighbouring Nevada  -
also experiencing strong construction activity - or in southern California,
where demand for construction labour has been heavy this year as the Los
Angeles area seeks to rebuild after January's earthquake.
'The wages California pays are clearly higher than wages offered here. We
simply could not compete with them,' says Mr Anderson.
'Basically, the building companies have hired all the really skilled people
they can and they are now down to hiring people who are really learning on
the job, and those people are not paid that much,' says Mr Tracy Clark of
the Economic Outlook Centre at Arizona State University in Tempe, a
southeastern suburb of Phoenix.
Instead of raising wages or prices, builders are simply stretching out their
construction times.
'Where they might have been able to complete a house in 90 days we are now
seeing 120 or 150 days,' says Mr Anderson.
In other segments of the labour market, however, Arizona still has a degree
of slack.
'We've got tool and die makers selling hardware at the department store,
waiting for the right job to come along,' says Mr Stephenson of Arizona
Public Service.
Local economists say growth this time around is built on much more solid
foundations than the construction boom of the mid-1980s, which burst
spectacularly when the tax breaks which had prompted it were repealed.
This year, construction activity has been centred on single family homes,
with building closely tied to real demand. The boom in this sector is now
slowing down, as pent-up demand from the recession has now largely been
satisfied, and is expected to glide down to a pace tied to the state's
population growth, forecast at around 2.6 per cent a year. Apartment
construction may now start to pick up the slack, but the building industry
is not expected to have all cylinders firing at once.
Still, there is one sign of speculative overheating that the Fed might want
to keep an eye on. The Arizona Cardinals American football team plays in a
first rate stadium deemed good enough to host the Superbowl national
football championship game in 1996, but Mr Bill Bidwill, the team owner, is
already talking about building a new stadium.
Cynical Phoenix sports fans suggest that Mr Bidwill might want to build a
winning team before he starts thinking about a new stadium.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Brazil refineries hit by oil workers' stoppage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's oil workers went on strike yesterday over a long-running wage claim
which the accident-prone government of outgoing President Itamar Franco
seems increasingly incapable of solving.
Most of the country's 10 main refineries, including the three biggest, were
reported to be affected by the stoppage which union officials said would be
stepped up over the coming days. With diesel and some household fuel stocks
low because of recent heavy demand, Brazil could face shortages of these
products if the strikes last more than a few weeks.
In an apparent bid to shore up stocks, the government last night announced a
15 per cent tax on all petroleum and chemical exports. Import tariffs on
these goods would also be lowered from 20 per cent to 2 per cent. Brazil is
a net oil importer, with most of its supplies coming from Saudi Arabia and
Argentina, but the country does sell some refined products to the US.
The oil workers first went on strike for a week at the end of September over
a 108 per cent pay claim and other demands. Mr Franco intervened and agreed
to most of the workers' claims without consulting their employer, the
state-owned oil monopoly Petrobras.
The president's accord would have cost Petrobras more than Dollars 400m,
which the company says it cannot afford, and could have prompted high wage
claims throughout the public sector and undermined Brazil's new currency,
the Real. When this was explained to the president, he cancelled the accord.
However, initial approval by the president and the energy ministry has
considerably strengthened the resolve of the workforce. They say they will
not accept anything but reinstatement of the original accord and have
rejected a labour tribunal ruling that they should only receive a 13 per
cent rise.
Brazil's inflation rate, as measured by the government's main IPC-r index,
jumped to 3.27 per cent in the month to mid-November, against only 1.86 per
cent in the previous four-week period.
The increase, which is higher than expected, will add to the government's
problems. According to law, salaries have to be increased in line with the
index, which has now risen nearly 20 per cent since the Real currency was
launched in July.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Australian unions start to flex their muscles: High pay
claims have prompted Keating to urge employers not to buckle under
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are anxious times in Australian boardrooms. Across a wide range of
industries, unions have been putting in large pay claims, and threats of
industrial action have been quick to follow.
Among the most publicised demands has been the claim for a 15.8 per cent
wage rise, spread over two years, from the 75,000-member Transport Workers
Union. This has been echoed by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union,
representing 40,000 workers asking for a similar figure. The National Union
of Workers, which represents blue-collar employees in factories and
warehouses, has claimed 14.7 per cent, also over two years.
So far, there has been more in the way of sabre-rattling than serious
industrial disruption as the claims have been pursued. This week saw
localised strikes by teachers in New South Wales and workers at Australian
Meat Holdings, the nation's biggest meat-processing operation.
But the upheavals pale beside the chaos which could ensue if the TWU makes
good its threat to disturb road transport services in the run-up to
Christmas.
The main issue is where these claims will eventually be settled. Mr Ralph
Willis, Australia's treasurer, has pointed out that many of the headline
figures are mere negotiation numbers. Moreover, some degree of 'wages
break-out' was probably inevitable, as employees made up for several years
of recession-enforced restraint.
But this wages round is being played out under different rules from
previously.
Over the past two years, Australia's traditional system of centralised
awards and arbitration, backed by a pact between the Labor government and
the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pursue wages outcomes which kept
the nation's inflation rate in line with that of its trading partners, has
reduced in importance.
Instead, an increasing number of workers have moved to company-based wage
agreements.
According to Department of Industrial Relations data, at least one-fifth of
all wage and salary earners are now covered by formal enterprise agreements.
The number of agreements, it estimates, has risen from about 360 in August
1992, to 2,700 at present. But both statistics may be understated, since
they only look at employees in the federal awards system, not those covered
by state-based awards.
The optimists say the new system should be more efficient, because companies
will only pay above-inflation wage rises when justified on productivity
grounds.
Given that labour productivity has been rising by about 1-2 per cent
annually and the inflation target is about 2 per cent, the implication is
that aggregate wages should increase by about 3-4 per cent a year, but with
considerable flexibility for individual companies around this figure.
The problem is that wage-bargaining psychology is stubborn. Economists have
noted a trend in the latest wage round for a standard pay claim to be served
on all employers in a given industry, regardless of their individual
circumstances.
Since last year's industrial relations reform legislation beefed up workers'
rights in dispute situations, there are fears that less efficient companies
will be pressured into settling at the same level as their more productive
competitors, simply to buy peace.
'There is a risk that firms whose sales have been growing quickly will 'roll
over' to avoid disruption to business, planning to push through price rises
in the face of strong demand to offset higher labour costs,' analysts warn.
Already, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, has urged employers to stand
firm. Yesterday, Simon Crean, a former union president and now employment
minister, added that claims such as those of the TWU should be capable of
being resolved by 'sensible discussion'.
Employers' organisations, which have long sought this devolved system, are
optimistic. 'Certainly, there are a lot of employers being spooked by the
level of claims, and that in itself is a worry,' says Mr Stephen Kates,
economist at the Australian Council of Commerce and Industry.
'But I think the reality is that most businesses will find they can't push
the added costs (of above-inflation pay settlements) through to prices.'
Financial markets seem less convinced. The yield on Australia's 10-year
bonds stands at about 10.8 per cent, way above that of the US, which stands
at about 8 per cent, and closer to the levels of Spain or Italy. While wages
are only one ingredient in the inflation equation, it is not a sign of
confidence.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Taiwan set tobenefit from US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan is poised to benefit from economic recovery in the US, its biggest
export market, and continued growth in its fastest-growing market, China,
analysts said yesterday.
The government's central statistics office said growth in the island's gross
national product reached 6.08 per cent in the third quarter of this year, up
from a revised 5.62 per cent in the second quarter and 5.8 per cent in the
third quarter of 1993.
The forecast for the fourth quarter was lifted to 6.9 per cent from the
previous forecast of 6.44 per cent.
'The economic picture is more optimistic following an improvement in export
performance,' Mr Daniel Chen, chief economist at Chinatrust Commercial Bank,
said.
'The main pumping factors behind growth in 1994 have been increased exports
and improved private-sector investment. This trend will be sustained into
next year.'
The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics raised its
forecast for 1994 GNP growth to 6.10 per cent from 6.01 per cent, and
forecast 1995 GNP growth at 6.52 per cent. In 1993, the island's GNP rose
6.02 per cent, revised upward from an earlier figure of 5.94 per cent.
The statistics office said the leading indicator for economic growth would
in future be gross domestic product instead of gross national product. It
predicted gross domestic product would grow 6.42 per cent in 1994 and 6.49
per cent in 1995.
Next year's growth would be the result of a global economic recovery and
higher exports, as well as more investment in Taiwan's electronics and steel
industries, the statistics office said.
Economists cautioned that the demise of China's ailing paramount leader, Mr
Deng Xiaoping, could damage Taiwan's share and property markets. Uncertainty
surrounding parliamentary elections next year, and first-ever presidential
elections slated for early 1996, could also damp private-sector investment.
The ruling Kuomintang is expected take steps to stimulate the economy next
year to enhance its prospects in those elections, Prof Wea Chi-lin of
National Taiwan University said. He predicts the central bank is likely to
nudge interest rates higher following municipal polls early next month, in
line with recent US rate rises, but will bring them down again in mid-1995
to encourage investment.
The statistics office said per capita income should reach Dollars 11,629
(Pounds 7,260) in 1994, up from Dollars 11,296 as previously forecast. The
figure for 1993 was revised to Dollars 10,852.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Free-enterprise Marxists support mountain kingdom's monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Few parties with the name Marxist-Leninist have ever won a free election.
But five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Nepal Communist party
(United Marxist Leninist) has accomplished this rare feat.
The communists are on the verge of forming a government after success in
last week's general election. The red flag has been hoisted in a country
with a constitutional monarch who held power until as late as 1990. Marx
would have been impressed with how quickly Nepal has apparently moved from
feudalism to socialism.
Yet all is not quite as it seems in the mountain kingdom. Despite their
ideologically correct name and the portraits of Marx and Lenin which adorn
the party offices, the Nepali communists bear little resemblance to
Bolsheviks.
Almost the first thing Mr Man Mohan Adhikari, the party leader, did after
his election victory was to call on King Birendra and pay his respects,
telling him he had nothing to fear; the communist party would 'firmly
support monarchy in Nepal as a symbol of unity' and 'pursue free-market
economic policies'.
The communists are much more nationalist than the purer forms of socialist
doctrine would permit. Mr Adhikari made much on the campaign trail of the
conservative Nepali Congress party government's allegedly close ties with
India. But he is hardly the first communist to stoke the fires of
patriotism.
The party has to approach government with caution. With only 88 seats in the
205-member parliament, it plans to rule as a minority government. It will
rely on tacit support from allies either in the Congress party or the
right-wing royalist grouping, the Rastriya Prajantra party. The prospects
seem uncertain.
The election was called after arguments erupted within the party between the
three at its head: Mr G. Koirala, 71, the former prime minister; Mr K.
Bhattarai, party president, 70, and Mr Ganesh Man Singh, 80, party supremo.
After decades of campaigns against royalist domination culminating in
demonstrations that ended royal rule in 1990, the three men had trouble
adjusting to running the government.
By this summer, the country had had enough of the party's record of
in-fighting and nepotism. So when Mr Koirala precipitated a general
election, voters took the opportunity to vote his party out of office.
Mr Adhikari, who at 72 is of the same generation as his Congress
counterparts, started his political career in the Indian independence
movement before moving to Nepal, where he spent several years in jail for
his attacks on the monarchy. For years, his party was split between
pro-Soviet and pro-China factions and received funds from North Korea. As
late as 1989 it supported the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.
But the international decline of communism and the advent of parliamentary
politics in Nepal after 1990 prompted the party into some long-overdue
revisionism from which it has emerged as more social democrat than
socialist.
A western diplomat in Kathmandu says: 'I think we could work with these
people. They are not guerrillas.'

He sports a polo shirt and khaki jeans, rather than the otherwise universal
Saudi uniform of white thobe (robe) and ghuttra (headdress). 'Because of my
dress people don't think I'm a Saudi,' he says. 'People address me in Urdu
or Hindi.'
Urdu or Hindi, because the more usual denizens of the factories of Saudi
Arabia's fast-growing light industrial sector are Indians, Pakistanis, or
perhaps Bangladeshis and Filipinos. Until lately, Saudi citizens have been a
rare sight on the shop floor.
Cheap, contracted labour from the sub-continent and East Asia still
overwhelmingly predominates in the dozens of furniture, cable, glass,
electrical and other factories in Riyadh's industrial zones.
But Mr Salman is among a growing number of Saudis departing from the
traditional career path of most of their countrymen - a secure job with the
government - for the higher-pressure work of the private sector.
Zoujaj, which produces 700,000 bottles a day for clients including Coca Cola
and Pepsi, counts 37 Saudis on its 244-strong payroll.
Across the road at the Saudi Lighting Company, a fast-growing light fittings
group, 50 Saudis are on the 600-strong staff and, says Mr Mohammed Mustafa,
finance director: 'They're picking up. We are now getting Saudis knocking at
our door for jobs: once you had to go and look for them.'
Bankers and hoteliers say there has been a clear rise over the past three
years in the number of Saudis willing to accept private-sector jobs at rates
of pay they would previously have spurned.
'We have little trouble these days finding Saudis for some jobs at about
Saudi Riyals 3,500 (Pounds 583) a month,' one Riyadh banker says.
Accurate labour statistics are not published in Saudi Arabia. But it is a
fair estimate that more than 90 per cent of Saudis either work directly for
the government or for parastatal groups, a proportion replicated in most
other Gulf states.
Hours tend to be undemanding, working conditions comfortable, salaries start
at about SR5,000 a month for a graduate entrant; government jobs offer
virtual tenure.
However, with the government in the clutches of a two-year-old cash flow
problem and ministries this year cutting budgets by 19 per cent, state
bodies have imposed an informal hiring freeze.
Most bureaucracies were overstaffed in any case, according to local
economists.
At the same time, the Saudi private sector has continued growing over the
past two years, bolstered by an array of state incentives, including cheap
permits on industrial zones and concessionary lending from organisations
such as the Saudi Industrial Development Fund.
According to the commerce ministry, the number of licences for private
concerns rose 28 per cent between 1991 and 1993, to a total of 423,800. More
private companies are producing more job opportunities for young Saudis.
The population is growing at about 3.7 per cent a year, pouring
90,000-100,000 prospective workers onto the job market annually - numbers
the bloated state bureaucracy cannot swallow.
Such market pressure is forcing young Saudis to consider working in the
private sector, although such movement is a growing trend rather than a
tidal wave at present.
But there have been recent signals from the government that it might be
preparing to give this trend a bigger push.
The government has for years tried to encourage Saudis to join the private
sector: the present five-year plan, penned in 1990, said it expected 96 per
cent of new jobs in the kingdom to come from private enterprise, and state
plans since 1970 have consistently advocated 'Saudi-isation' of the private
sector.
However, while Saudi labour law formally decrees that 75 per cent of all
companies' workforces should be Saudi, Mr Hussein Sijini, deputy minister of
planning, says the government has never enforced this for fear of impeding
the private-sector growth which it sees as vital to the kingdom's policy of
diversification away from oil.
Saudi workers are expensive. Where a young Saudi technician might come at
SR3,500 a month, Indians or Filipinos are usually paid SR1,400 a month, plus
a package of board and lodging.
A recent visit to Riyadh by a team from the UK Inland Revenue has prompted
local bankers and businessmen to wonder if the government is considering
fiscal incentives to companies which hire Saudi workers.
Such measures may be contained in the forthcoming January 1 budget.
Hpwever, for some Saudis, such incentives are unnecessary. 'A lot of us just
had enough of the government system,' says Mr Omar al-Shuwaier, who left a
government department two years ago to form and manage Rowad National
Plastic, Saudi Arabia's first plastic sheeting company.
'We don't want to work for the government system with its routines, or for
the old-style private companies where it's all on a personal basis; if the
owners don't like you, they kick you out.'
Instead, Mr al-Shuwaier says, he and some Saudi colleagues prefer the more
ordered and formal board of directors and western-style management
structure.
'I see more people like me in industry,' he adds.
'Our financial and administrative manager used to work with the government,
but since he's been with us, he no longer has the time to drink tea and read
the newspapers.
'The challenge he has is new, the experience - it's huge. We're not the
highest paid here, but there's a system here - a more reliable system.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Kazakhstan uranium put out of reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, ALMA ATA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday successfully completed the secret transfer of 600 kilograms
of highly enriched uranium from a storage facility in Kazakhstan considered
highly vulnerable to theft.
Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, told a press conference: 'We have
put this bomb-grade nuclear material forever out of the reach of potential
black marketeers.' He said the uranium could have been used to produce 'more
than 20' nuclear bombs.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, described the operation as 'a
landmark event in President Clinton's non-proliferation strategy,' along
with last week's approval by the Ukrainian parliament of the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty and the recent agreement with North Korea.
The US operation, code-named Project Sapphire, was conducted over the past
six weeks after the government of Kazakhstan, one of the four former Soviet
states with nuclear capability and a signatory to the NPT last year,
privately advised Washington it could not guarantee the safety and security
of the stockpile at its Ust-Kamenagorsk facility.
President Clinton authorised the operation on October 7 and it was placed
under the direction of Vice-President Al Gore. A US team then worked
non-stop in Kazakhstan to arrange the transfer in conditions of high
secrecy.
The first shipment left Ust-Kamenagorsk airport last weekend, with the final
consignment arriving in Delaware yesterday morning en route to the
re-processing plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
The operation was funded by the US under the Nunn-Lugar Act which provides
about Dollars 800m (Pounds 500m) in the current fiscal year to assist
de-nuclearisation efforts in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
'There is no better example of how the Nunn-Lugar programme can help
eliminate a national security threat before it arises,' Mr Perry said. 'This
is defence by other means and in a big way.' His remarks were directly aimed
at Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, probable next chairman of the
Senate foreign relations committee, who has threatened severely to cut
funding for such operations.
Mr Perry rejected a Moscow report that the uranium could not have been used
to make bombs. 'It is weapons-grade material. I state this unambiguously.'
Asked if there were other vulnerable caches, he replied: 'I cannot state
categorically that there is no other such source anywhere else. As far as we
know, this is it.'
A defence department official later said that though the uranium came in
slightly different forms, the majority was 'almost pure U-235,' extracted
from SS-18 missiles stationed in Kazakhstan.
Kazakhstan's nuclear energy minister said the uranium was used during the
Soviet period as fuel for nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear reactors,
not for atomic weapons.
Mr Vladimir Karmakov also said that Kazakhstan conferred with Russian
military officials before informing the US.
'We asked the permission of the Russian military structure, then gave the
information to the United States,' Mr Karmakov said.
US concerns that what the state department calls 'rogue states' - such as
Iraq and Iran - might acquire nuclear capability have been high for the past
two years. Reports of smaller quantities of enriched uranium intercepted in
Germany earlier this year had heightened these alarms.
Mr Perry was effusive in praising the co-operation from the government of
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, which, he said, 'demonstrated a sensitivity
to regional security by consulting with the Russian government before
proceeding with Project Sapphire.' The Washington-Moscow channel of
communication was principally through Mr Gore and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
Russian prime minister, he added.

At least 110 people were killed in a stampede that followed a police baton
charge on tribal protesters in the western Indian city of Nagpur yesterday,
domestic news agencies reported. They said the problem began when a crowd of
protesters tried to break a police cordon set up to prevent them from
marching on the Maharashtra state assembly.
The agencies quoted police as saying their men pushed back the protesters
with long, iron-tipped bamboo canes and that began a panic-stricken
stampede. They quoted Kripashankar Singh, a senior member of the Congress
party which rules Maharashtra, as saying at least 110 people were killed.

Shell Australia and BP Australia, both part of the larger international oil

competition watchdog, over alleged price collusion in the Sydney and
Melbourne retail petrol markets. Shell issued a statement yesterday stating
that it would 'mount a vigorous defence' against allegations that it
colluded with other oil companies to increase retail petroleum prices in
Melbourne and Sydney between 1988 and 1991. BP Australia confirmed that it,
too, was served with legal proceedings by the Commission yesterday. These,
it said, alleged certain anti-competitive practices in the Sydney and
Melbourne motor spirit markets between May 1991 and June 1992.

Zimbabwe's central bank, facing an outcry over punitive interest rates, has
cut its lending rates to financial bodies, but economists yesterday said the
action was too little, too late to bolster growth. The central bank said
late on Tuesday it was lowering its rediscount rate - the benchmark rate at
which it lends to financial institutions - to 29.5 per cent from 30 per
cent. Citing a fall in annual inflation, it also cut the overnight
accommodation rate - the punitive rate charged to financial bodies for
overdrawing - to 35 per cent from 38 per cent.

<TEXT>
The British Foreign Office yesterday called in tour operators yesterday and
advised them to bring more than 2,000 holidaymakers home from Gambia because
of a deterioration in the political situation. However, Gambia Experience,
one of the largest operators to the country, said it would allow its
customers to decide whether or not they wanted to continue their holidays.
The Foreign Office said it had been monitoring the situation in Gambia since
a coup, in which Lt Yahya Jammet seized power from Sir Dawda Jawara, and
there had been a steady deterioration. It said the political situation was
uncertain and could deteriorate quickly. The advisory notice follows an
attempted counter coup against on November 11 which Lieutenant Jammet blamed
on former finance minister Mr Bakary Dabo.

Britannia Airways, the world's largest charter airline, yesterday announced
orders and options worth Dollars 800m for eight Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The
airline, part of the UK's Thomson Travel Group, has ordered four aircraft,
to be delivered in the spring of 1996, and taken an option on a further four
 -scheduled to arrive at the rate of one a year to the year 2000.
The acquisition of the 767-300s continues a rolling programme of fleet
modernisation, announced last year. The new aircraft will replace existing
757s and 767-200s, said Britannia, and will be powered by General Electric
engines. The present fleet comprises 19 Boeing 757s and nine 767-200s with
an average age of three years.
The first four new aircraft will be used primarily on long-haul flights to
Australia, New Zealand, Africa, the US and India, and will be configured
with 328 seats for long-haul operations. Mr Roger Burnell, Britannia's
managing director, said aircraft such as the 767-300 would enable Brittania
to continue to offer low cost air travel, particularly on long-haul routes.
The aircraft will be financed through a mixture of leasing and acquisition,
but Britannia said the 'fine tuning' had yet to be worked out.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The deal announced yesterday by President Bill Clinton and Republican leader
Robert Dole strengthens the chance that the Uruguay Round world trade pact
will be passed when it comes to a Senate vote next week.
Supporters of the Gatt yesterday were jubilant; 'I think we've just won,'
said Mr Harry Freeman, a free trade lobbyist who has been urging newspaper
editors to endorse the Gatt deal. Mr Bill Lane, of the US construction
machinery group Caterpillar, said: 'It is a great deal for our customers and
a sad day for our foreign competitors. This is the breakthrough we have been
waiting for.'
Supporters were particularly pleased with Senator Dole's vow to work for a
'big big' bipartisan victory in the Senate. This may have recovered some
ground lost by his earlier effort to link Gatt passage with the Republicans'
long-sought cut on capital gains taxes.
All week lobbyists and moderate Republicans have been grumbling that 'he
stands for nothing' when Mr Dole seemed to risk abandoning his long-held
free trade views to jeopardise passage of the world's largest trade pact for
an unrelated issue. In the end, he received a vague promise from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, treasury secretary, to work with the Congress on capital formation
and 'to give it a serious and careful review'.
'It was never my purpose to kill the Gatt,' said Mr Dole. 'I wanted to fix
the Gatt. Maybe I haven't done a perfect job but I think. . . we've moved it
a long way.'
President Clinton said: 'An understanding has been reached with Senator Dole
to reaffirm our United States sovereignty and to make sure that
reaffirmation will be protected in the Gatt process.'
The World Trade Organisation's (WTO) arbitration of trade disputes caused Mr
Dole and some other members of Congress to question whether US sovereignty
would be adequately protected.
White House officials said the president had agreed to Mr Dole's demand for
a special US review panel to oversee decisions of the WTO. This panel could
trigger a congressional vote on US withdrawal from Gatt.
However, Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, described the sovereignty
issue as a 'red herring'.
He said: 'There are those who want to do damage to the agreement who
continue to raise that issue. It is a non-issue. There is nothing in the
Gatt that restricts our ability to enforce our own trade laws.'

rapid growth
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese household and electrical appliances are showing rapid growth in
production, domestic sales and exports in 1994, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The China Household Electrical Appliances Association reported that rising
consumer confidence had boosted both output and sales of refrigerators,
washing machines and air-conditioners.
Ms Jiang Feng, the association's vice-general secretary, told the China
Daily newspaper that growing demand for smaller electrical appliances, such
as irons, microwave ovens and electric cookers is stimulating producers to
upgrade their products.
In foreign markets, nine-month exports of Chinese appliances were Dollars
1.08bn compared with Dollars 1.35bn for all of 1993, the newspaper said.
Air-conditioners were the fastest growing export item. In the first six
months of 1994, China exported 156,000 units, an increase of 90,000 over the
same period in 1993.
China has more than 100 air-conditioner manufacturers, including 20 large
groups. In the past, imports have cut into domestic sales, resulting in
large stocks of unsold units, the China Daily said. In 1993, China imported
more than 100,000 foreign-made air-conditioners and competition from abroad
had spurred Chinese manufacturers to improve the quality of their
air-conditioners, according to the newspaper. The appliance Association
predicted that Chinese brands would achieve dominance in the domestic
air-conditioner market next year, just as Chinese freezers, refrigerators
and washing machines have become dominant in their respective market
sectors.
In the first nine months of 1994, China produced 8.2m washing machines, a
27.2 per cent increase from the same period in 1993. Washing-machine output
for the full current year is expected to reach 10m units.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China likely to approve power deals -
Energy demand soars; Investors expect 15-22% return; Dollars 1.2bn Guangdong
plant

High level meetings in Beijing over the next few weeks are expected to
sanction the first of about 50 proposed power station projects worth
billions of dollars relieving a logjam on approvals which has frustrated
some of the world's largest power companies.
Power industry representatives will be looking particularly to an economic
'work conference' and follow-up planning sessions for indications that
argument over rates of return payable on equity investment in Chinese
infrastructure has been resolved.
The Ministry of Electric Power Industry declined comment yesterday on
reports that China had sanctioned a new formula that would satisfy
investors. Equity participants in proposed power projects had baulked at a
12-15 per cent 'cap' on returns on investment.
But a western official in Beijing, whose responsibilities include the power
sector, said China appeared at last to have recognised that if it wanted
projects to go ahead it would have to yield to investor demand for more
generous returns. He said that under a proposed new formula returns would
range between 15-22 per cent depending on the efficiency of new plants.
Chinese-equipped plants run at about 60 per cent 'availability', while
foreign-supplied equipment provided efficiency ratios that were close to 90
per cent. Higher returns would be guaranteed for more efficient plants.
Among international power companies involved in negotiations with Chinese
institutions are GEC of the UK, and Mission Energy, Wing International,
General Electric and Entergy Corporation of the US.
Industry representatives regarded as a 'promising development' the Dollars
1.2bn preliminary agreement announced this month for construction of twin
660MW coal-fired power plants and associated facilities in Guangdong
province. The project brings together Entergy, Marubeni of Japan, Hong Kong
investors and local power authorities in Guangdong.
The representative in Hong Kong of a large European power utility described
the Guangdong deal as an indication of progress, but he also noted detailed
discussions had not begun on implementation. Beijing was also yet to approve
the agreement.
An official of the Ministry of Electric Power confirmed yesterday that the
ministry was working on its final proposals for the ninth five-year plan to
carry China through to the year 2000. These will be presented to a national
planning conference early next month.
Rapidly rising demand for energy, due to China's explosive economic growth,
and an increasing shortfall in available power have put pressure on the
government to accelerate approval of new plants.
According to a recent report by CS First Boston, China's 'reserve ratio' of
available power became negative for the first time in 1991 and the situation
had continued to worsen
'The surplus of energy has seen a precipitous drop through the 1980s and
into the 1990s,' the report stated. 'In 1981, the surplus was 11.8m tonnes
of SCE (standard coal equivalent) or a reserve ratio of 1.9 per cent. China
has seen a rapid and sustained drop in its reserve ratio annually since
1981.' The CS First Boston report estimated that new spending on the power
sector would 'have to exceed' Dollars 14bn-Dollars 15bn a year for the rest
of the decade to keep pace with current demand.
Mr Jiang Shaojun, director of the General Office of the Ministry of Electric
Power, estimates that China's 'shortfall' of energy nationwide averages 20
per cent, with shortages most acute in the fast growing southern coastal
regions. He said that China planned to add another 117,000MW of generating
capacity by the year 2000 to reach a planning target of 300,000MW. He
estimated the cost of adding 117,000MW at Yn570bn (Dollars 67bn), somewhat
less than western estimates.
Mr Jiang described China's ambitions of reaching its power planning targets
as a 'huge task'. He also said it was essential that China 'cut down on
waste' in the delivery and utilisation of power.
In Hong Kong, Mr Paul Schulte, China analyst with CS First Boston, said
Beijing faced a difficult challenge in convincing equity investors in the
power sector that their investments would be secure and reap reasonable
returns.
He described as 'stumbling blocks' worries about the arbitrary setting of
electricity tariffs, stability of the currency, inflation, and guaranteed
reasonable returns on investment. 'If these issues are not resolved, many of
these projects involving foreign investors will be dead in the water,' he
said. 'They are not going to have foreign investment.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Russian trade turns westward - A fall of
commerce with other former Soviet states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia now trades more with developed countries, especially with western
Europe, than with other former Soviet states - a dramatic change in trading
patterns over the past three years.
The first figures showing trade with developed countries and the other
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) were released
yesterday at a conference of senior Russian and European Union officials and
ambassadors.
The data show that, in the first two quarters of this year, Russia's trade
volume with the members of the European Union, stood at Dollars 16.8bn
(Dollars 9.9bn exports and Dollars 6.9bn imports) - 37 per cent of its total
trade.
This compares with Dollars 10.8bn trade turnover with the other CIS member
states (Dollars 6.2bn exports and Dollars 4.6bn imports) - 24 per cent of
its total trade. Trade with the former partners in Comecon, the trading bloc
which used to unite the socialist countries, has fallen even faster: central
and eastern European countries had a trade turnover of only Dollars 5.7bn
with Russia in the first half of this year (Dollars 3.7bn Russian exports
and Dollars 2bn imports).
By far the largest part of Russian exports to these and other countries is
raw materials, especially energy.
Russia has cut back on energy supplies to the CIS states, preferring the
greater ability to pay and the higher prices paid by states outside of the
former Soviet Union - a policy which the government has said will continue
this year and which is likely to cause problems to the weakerCIS members.
Germany is by far the most important trading partner for Russia within the
EU - and in the world. Bonn's 1993 trade turnover with Russia stood at
Dollars 5.8bn, compared with China's Dollars 4.02bn. Mr Reiner Hartmann, the
Moscow representative of Ruhrgas - the biggest foreign customer for Russian
natural gas - said that Germany takes 30 per cent of its gas and 12 per cent
of its crude oil from Russia.
'Without any doubt Russia's market today and tomorrow is in western Europe -
and for the European Union, Russia is the most significant trading partner
on the continent.'
Russia is the fifth largest trading partner for the EU after the US,
Switzerland, Japan and China. A background paper produced for the conference
says that there is 'enormous potential' for a growth in trade.
'In the long run one might expect these trade flows to converge on something
closer to the scale of the EU's trade with the US, currently seven times
greater. While it will take many years for such economic structures to
develop, the geographical proximity of Russia and the EU will facilitate a
great trade expansion,' the paper said.
Russia has progressively liberalised trade policies over the past three
years - though it re-imposed some tariffs earlier this year. The government,
however, faces calls for more protectionist measures in the face of
continuing decline in Russian industrial production. The structure of
Russian imports has switched massively from capital goods and equipment to
consumer goods, especially food.
The Agreement on Partnership and Co-operation, signed by President Boris
Yeltsin and EU leaders in Corfu in June, established a legal framework for
trade in goods and services and for the operation of foreign investments.
The agreement is designed to evolve until 1998, when a review of its
operation will be held to determine whether or not a free trade regime can
be established between the EU and Russia.
EU states also play a dominant role in the formation of joint ventures -
with over 90 per cent of total ventures being between a company from one of
the EU states and a Russian enterprise.
However, the expansion is not without attendant problems. Mr Sergei Krylov,
Russian deputy foreign minister, said EU states still practised substantial
discrimination against Russian goods. 'We want no particular advantages,' he
said, 'we want only agreed entrance to the European market.'
Mr Oleg Bogomolov, a former official dealing with Comecon relations and now
a leading deputy, said that 'the breaking of the links with our former
partners has been painful for them and us - and our trade with western
Europe should not be to the detriment of trade with the CIS'.
Mr Georgy Gabunia, deputy trade minister, and Russia's chief negotiator of
the agreement between the EU and Russia on partnership and co-operation
signed in June, said that when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join the
EU 'it will affect us adversely because we have freer trading arrangements
with them than with the EU'.
And Mr Sergei Baburin, a leading nationalist deputy of the state duma (lower
house) told the conference that 'the influence of western Europe on Russia
means an increase in pro-communist and nationalist sentiment here. . . .the
western European view of Russia as a source of crime, of drugs, of
prostitution is a result of these policies which the western states have
urged upon us'.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: New trade group shuns UN links - Gatt
members near-unanimous in rejecting Boutros Ghali scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The preparatory committee of the future World Trade Organisation has
rejected any formal links with the United Nations, decisively rebuffing a
campaign by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to bring the
WTO within the UN system.
Mr K Kesavapany, Singapore's ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade and chairman for institutional matters, yesterday said that Gatt
members had found no grounds for 'any formal institutional arrangement'
between the WTO and the UN.
Mr Boutros Ghali has been lobbying hard in New York for the WTO to become a
specialised UN agency or, failing that, to have the same kind of looser UN
attachment enjoyed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
However, the idea has met with virtually unanimous opposition among Gatt
members in Geneva, including the Quad group of leading traders, the US, the
European Union, Japan and Canada. Developing countries are equally
unenthusiastic, with the exception of Egypt, Mr Boutros Ghali's home
country.
The WTO, due to take over from Gatt on January 1, will have to co-operate on
various aspects of trade policy with a number of international
organisations, including the World Bank, the IMF and the World Intellectual
Property Organisation, a UN specialised agency.
However, Mr Kesavapany said that, with one exception, pragmatic ties between
the WTO and the various intergovernmental bodies could be established by the
WTO's governing council. The exception relates to co-ordination with the IMF
over balance of payments issues.
Officially, Gatt members take the view that as contractual agreements, Gatt
and the WTO are legally incompatible with the UN structure because their
rules must be negotiated not imposed by a higher authority. Unofficially,
trade diplomats are anxious to keep the WTO well away from the political and
bureaucratic clutches of the UN. Gatt, with a relatively small staff of
about 450, is generally considered to be among the most efficient of the
international organisations in Geneva, partly because it has managed to
avoid the destructive politicisation experienced by much of the UN system.
Gatt's relations with the UN are governed by an agreement of August 1952
covering ad hoc co-operation - an approach likely to be continued by the
WTO.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japanese spinners want cheap imports
squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's textiles industry is to ask the government for protection under the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) to stem a surge of cheap imports from China
and other Asian countries.
The Japan Spinners' Association said it was hoping to file an application
requesting the Japanese government to restrict imports of low-priced cotton
yarn. The Japan Chemical Fibres Association is also considering an
application.
The moves follow an announcement by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry that it has established rules for imposing emergency restrictions
on textile imports under the MFA. The rules, which would apply for three
years, call for year-long investigations and bilateral negotiations before
the imposition of restrictions. They are designed to give the domestic
industry time to allow it to carry out structural reforms, Miti said.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade minister, yesterday stressed the international
acceptance of the new rules: both the US and the European Union had
introduced restrictions on textiles imports under the MFA.
Japan's textile industry has come under growing pressure from cheap imports,
notably in the past two years with the yen's appreciation. Textile imports
rose 13 per cent to Y1,511.5bn (Dollars 15.34bn) in the first nine months of
this year compared with the same period in 1993, according to the Japanese
government.
The industry, which was profitable until 1986, suffered a Dollars 10bn loss
last year, expected to rise to Dollars 14bn this year, according to the
Japan Chemical Fibres Association.
In the first half of 1994, imports of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics reached
a peak according to the Japan Spinners' Association. The number of companies
in the cotton spinning industry fell by about 10 per cent last year from 162
to 145, the association noted.
The trade ministry has, however, been cautious in its approach to
restricting textile imports.
Japanese retailers have benefited from being able to import directly from
low-cost textile manufacturers in China and elsewhere. Consumers have also
enjoyed lower prices offered by retailers as a result of cheaper imports.
The ministry is aware of the technical difficulty in proving that imports
have damaged domestic industry.
There are also the political considerations regarding a decision which could
alienate consumers as well as the developing countries which may be hurt by
restrictions, one industry official noted.
The government would also be reluctant to risk being exposed to criticism
that it is going against the tide of free trade which it has so fervently
advocated in its trade negotiations with the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French industrial output in September fell 0.4 per cent below its level in
July and August, Insee, the government statistics agency, reported
yesterday.
The impression that after robust recovery in the first half of the year, the
French economy has undergone a slight autumn chill is likely to be
reinforced later today when Insee publishes its estimate of gross domestic
product in the third quarter.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, warned this week that the
economy never moved in a linear direction and that the growth performance
could 'not be expected to be as high as in the first half', when GDP rose
0.7 per cent in January-March and by 1 per cent in April-June.
However, he said the government was not lowering its forecast that the
economy would grow by more than 2 per cent this year and by more than 3 per
cent in 1995. Insee economists said that some autumn slowdown was inevitable
given the fact that part of the first half's strong rebound was due to
companies restocking their inventories, which had been more or less
completed.
The Balladur government yesterday approved a year-end correction to its 1994
budget, which lopped a fractional FFr162m (Pounds 19.3m) off the deficit
following bigger tax receipts.

The rate of growth in German money supply eased more than expected last
month putting it nearer the Bundesbank's 1994 target range after thsteep
rises earlier this year. But the improvement is not expected to prompt the
central bank to lower interest rates at today's council meeting. It said M3
rose at an annualised 6.9 per cent in October after 7.8 per cent in
September. But Mr Richard Reid, UBS economist, said because DM4.3bn went
into money market funds, now allowed in Germany, in October, the M3 figure
'was not as positive as it appeared'.
Germany's budget deficit will be well below target for this year and 1995
because of strong economic growth, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister said
yesterday. Mr Waigel said the federal budget deficit for 1994 would be about
DM10bn below the forecast DM69.1bn. The 1995 budget deficit will also be
about DM10bn less than forecast.

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, said last night she
might dissolve parliament and call new elections if anti-European Union
parties tried to block ratification of EU membership, despite a Yes vote in
next Monday's referendum.
'I have always been against implementing the power of dissolution. But now
I'm more open to the fact there can be good reason to do so,' she told a
pro-EU rally in the west coast city of Kristiansand.
The Centre party and the Socialist Left party, leading the No campaign in
the referendum, have threatened to block ratification if Norwegians vote in
favour of joining the Union by a small margin.
The two parties have never defined what they consider a small margin to be.
However, for Mrs Brundtland to dissolve parliament would require a change in
Norway's constitution. Two years ago, a proposal for such a change was put
before parliament and could be addressed during this term.
The amendment would require two-thirds of the parliament to push it through
and political analysts said that it would be possible to get the support
needed for the change.
EU membership ratification requires a three-quarters majority in the
parliament. Between them, the two parties could muster the support they need
to block EU membership ratification by gathering support from other anti-EU
parties such as the Christian Peoples' party.
Just 49 votes would be needed to block ratification, and between them the
Centre party and Socialists have 45 seats in parliament while the Christian
Peoples' party has 13.
But Mrs Brundtland stressed that the issue of dissolving parliament and
calling new elections has not been formally discussed within the government
nor in her Labour party.
On Tuesday, she said she did not believe the Euro-sceptics would risk going
against the will of the electorate by blocking ratification. Although the No
camp has long held a lead in the polls, a survey published yesterday showed
for the first time a 50/50 split between the Yes and No camps.
Officials close to the prime minister said if there is a Yes majority
supporting membership it would likely be no more than 52 per cent.
Mrs Brundtland has repeatedly said she would not resign if Norway rejects EU
membership for the second time since 1972.

<TEXT>
An action plan urging rapid and widespread liberalisation of mobile
telecommunications was yesterday sent by the European Commission to the
European parliament and the council of ministers. After a five-month public
consultation with telephone companies, industry organisations and
individuals, the Commission has concluded that EU competition rules should
apply fully to the mobile sector, that a code of conduct should be developed
for service providers and that they should be granted full access to the
market. The plan also highlights the need to promote the availability of
frequencies and numbers and to promote special programmes that will support
emerging mobile technologies. Europe's mobile telecoms sector is already
fairly deregulated with only a handful of member states continuing to
maintain a monopolistic hold over operators. The commission has already
taken action against individual member states requiring them, under
competition rules, to license at least a second operator. Italy, Ireland and
Belgium have not yet complied. The commission is to propose that all
remaining exclusive and special rights in the mobile sector be abolished as
soon as possible.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Tapie ordered to pay Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Paris court ordered Mr Bernard Tapie and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds
40m) to Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned bank, because
an agreement reached with them in March was no longer valid. The judgment,
by Mrs Jacqueline Cochard, president of the Tribunal de Grande Instance,
could trigger a rapid sale of assets controlled by Mr Tapie and pledged as
security against a five-year plan to repay loans believed to total about
FFr1.2bn. The Hotel de Cavoye, his luxurious mansion in Paris, could soon be
on sale, with some valuations putting its worth at FFr100m-FFr160m. His
yacht, the Phocea, which is moored in Marseilles, his company shares, and
his collection of antiques and paintings could also be sold. Mr Tapie has
said he would appeal against the ruling. It is likely that his assets are
worth less than half his debts to the bank.

The Russian parliament yesterday rebelled against President Boris Yeltsin's
nominee for the chair of the central bank - defeating the candidacy of Mrs
Tatyana Paramonova by 127 votes to 10. The surprise vote came 'not because
we did not like Tatyana Paramonova but because we did not like the way she
was proposed and the way Victor Gerashchenko (the previous chairman) was
relieved of his post' according to Mr Sergei Baburin, one of the leaders of
the nationalist opposition in the state duma (lower house)'. Mr
Gerashchenko, with other senior officials and ministers, was a victim of the
sudden fall of the rouble on 'Black Tuesday' last month and the resulting
wrath of the president. The vote leaves Mrs Paramonova, a former deputy
chairwoman, as acting head of the bank - a weak position at a time when the
financial authorities in Russia are pushing for the acceptance of a tough
budget for next year aimed at bringing down inflation to 1 per cent a month
by the end of 1995. Mr Yeltsin faces the choice of keeping her in an acting
position, or proposing a compromise candidate.

Economic growth in the European Union will rise to an average 2.6 per cent
this year, accelerating to 2.9 per cent in 1995 and 3.2 per cent in 1996,
according to forecasts published yesterday by the European Commission. But
the number out of work is likely to remain above 17m this year, with the
average rate of unemployment expected to fall by only 1 per cent to 9.8 per
cent in 1996. 'This is unacceptably high,' said Mr Henning Christophersen,
the outgoing economics commissioner.
The Commission is pressing for fresh measures at next month's European
summit in Essen to reduce 'structural unemployment', including deeper cuts
in non-wage costs, more vocational education, and a switch in unemployment
allowances into wage subsidies.
The solid economic recovery in Europe follows a meagre 0.4 per cent growth
in 1993. As a result, government deficits are expected to fall from 5.6 per
cent of GDP this year, to 4.7 per cent next and 3.9 per cent in 1996. These
levels are above the Maastricht treaty's targets for monetary union, but the
forecasts assume no change in existing policies. Inflation is likely to pick
up in 1996 but present levels are not dangerous, said Mr Christophersen. The
worries are rising long-term interest rates and a weak dollar undercutting
EU exports in world markets.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Joker in the pack of Norway's fishermen: The country's
seamen are not universally anti-EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When Jens Petter Sollie, a young campaigner for Norwegian membership of the
European Union, yesterday clambered aboard the MS Joker, a trawler tied up
in the remote fishing port of Svolvaer, he discreetly slipped off his 'Ja'
lapel badge and braced himself for a salty blast of invective against
Brussels.
Norway's fishermen have a formidable reputation as the most implacable
opponents of the EU in a country famous for its deep Euro-scepticism -
especially in the Lofoten Islands, a craggy, snow-blown archipelago of
jagged mountains whose Arctic fjords are kept open in the long winter by the
warming currents of the Gulf Stream.
But Mr Sollie, campaign organiser for Norway's European Movement in the
county of Nordland, was in for a pleasant surprise. Skipper Arvid Sandoe and
his four-man crew offered a friendly welcome. They dropped a few well chosen
insults against Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the pro-EU fisheries minister. ('He's
only fishing for votes,' said one). But two of the five men admitted they
would be voting Yes in next Monday's referendum on EU membership.
Mr Sandoe said he had already cast a No vote through a postal ballot, but
confessed he had been hesitant. 'I still feel a little uncertain about it,'
he said, offering no objection whatever to the decision of his son Baard, a
crew member, to vote Yes on the basis that for Norway as a whole, membership
was positive.
The Joker, its home port further south in Trondelag, may have been no more
than a seagoing statistical freak. But, taken with outspoken support for EU
membership expressed this week by a group of fish farmers and processors, it
suggests that the ranks of Norway's fishing communities are not so rigidly
anti-EU as has often been portrayed.
Certainly the vast majority of Norway's 25,000 fishing vessel owners and
crew are expected by both No and Yes camps to vote against membership. The
fear that Norway's jealous husbandry of its fish resources may be undone by
joining the EU's common fisheries policy - and its stocks of herring and cod
plundered by southern raiders from Spain and Portugal - runs deep.
Their opposition is a keystone of the nationwide No campaign, especially in
the north where opinion against the EU is running high. For although small
in numbers, the fishermen have a political punch far weightier than their
numerical strength - as have the country's highly-subsidised, anti-EU
farmers. Without strong fishing and farming, the popular policy of
sustaining stable population numbers in the remote regions could begin to
unravel.
The trenchant opposition to the EU of Norges Fiskerlag (the national
fishermen's organisation) is therefore of strong political significance. Mr
Olsen's accession deal with Brussels on fish gave only marginal concessions
in Norwegian waters to foreign fishermen. It confirmed Oslo's complete
control over its fish resources until 1998 - allowing Norway to continue
tough conservation rules which have seen fish stocks and fishing quotas in
Norwegian waters rise significantly.
But Mr Steinar Jonassen, who runs the Nordland branch of Norges Fiskerlag,
says his members are worried about what will happen after 1998 - and
especially after 2002 when the EU fisheries policies are up for review and
Spain and Portugal are due to be fully integrated. 'Even though the minister
says he has Brussels' commitment that the EU will base policy on Norwegian
practices we don't feel we have good enough guarantees for that,' he says.
Lately, however, voice has been given to concerns in the fish farming and
processing industry that a greater threat lies in staying outside the EU. A
newly formed National Organisation of Fish Farmers and the Fishing Industry,
representing 650 concerns employing 11,000 people, declared its support for
membership this week, saying it would be 'decisive for growth in the
Norwegian fishing industry and increased activity along the Norwegian
coast.'
It argued that the removal of EU duties and tariffs on Norwegian products
would give a boost to the local processing industry, which has, for example,
lagged far behind that in neighbouring Denmark. The new organisation said
fish farmers, who account for less than one quarter of Norway's NKr20bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) annual fish exports, could double their exports to NKr7bn
over the coming years, but only if they had access to EU markets.
As Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Prime Minister, marshals her forces for a
last push to overturn months of No supremacy, she is encouraged by such
public statements to think that in the last few days, many Norwegians may
finally conclude that the potential benefits of EU membership outweigh some
of the more traditional fears about joining.
On Svolvaer's windswept quayside, Jens Petter Sollie was careful not to
deceive himself that his visit on board the Joker meant he could win over
the fishermen. But it did encourage him to think that a nationwide No on
Monday was not a foregone conclusion. 'If we can win a 35 per cent Yes in
the north, then over the country as a whole, it will be a Yes,' he said.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Court orders Tapie to pay Pounds 40m to bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman,
yesterday lost his fight to keep control of some of his most ostentatious
assets in a long-running legal dispute with his principal bank.
A Paris court ordered Mr Tapie and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds 40m) to
Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned bank, because an
agreement reached with them in March was no longer valid.
The judgment, by Mrs Jacqueline Cochard, president of the Tribunal de Grande
Instance, could trigger a rapid sale of assets controlled by Mr Tapie and
pledged as security against a five-year plan to repay loans believed to
total about FFr1.2bn.
The Hotel de Cavoye, his luxurious mansion in the fashionable seventh
arrondissement in Paris, could be up for sale by the middle of December,
with some valuations putting its worth at FFr100m-FFr160m.
His yacht, the Phocea, which is moored in Marseilles, his company shares,
and his collection of antiques and paintings could also be sold. Credit
Lyonnais said it planned to proceed with attempts to realise the assets as
quickly as possible.
However, Mr Tapie has said he would appeal against the judgment if it went
against him, as one of a number of outstanding legal actions currently in
train.
In the run-up to yesterday's verdict, Credit Lyonnais had argued that Mr
Tapie had failed to keep his side of the accord in March by not producing
independent valuations of his assets to the deadlines previously agreed.
It is likely that his assets are less than half his debts to the bank.
Credit Lyonnais is still searching for some of Mr Tapie's assets, including
antiques smuggled out of his Paris house over the summer.
Mr Tapie has instigated a series of legal battles which will come to court
over the next few weeks, but which Credit Lyonnais described as 'a strategy
to win more time'.
In his next appearance tomorrow, the tribunal de commerce will determine
whether his companies are bankrupt.

<TEXT>
Spain has upgraded its growth forecast for this year to about 2 per cent
from 1.3 per cent, Mr Pedro Solbes, economy and finance minister, said
yesterday. The recovery follows a decline of 1 per cent last year, the worst
recession for three decades. Mr Solbes told an FT conference the government
had to aim for rapid enough growth to bring down its 'excessively damaging'
24 per cent unemployment rate . The outlook was for growth of 3 per cent
next year and 4 per cent from 1996. This could be made compatible with lower
inflation and a 'reasonable equilibrium' in public sector finances and the
balance of payments. Consumer price inflation was expected to come down to
around 4.1-4.2 per cent at the end of the year, the lowest annual rate for
at least 25 years, Mr Solbes said.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Milosevic blames Krajina Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia yesterday put pressure on Serb
leaders from Croatia to halt their offensive on a Moslem enclave in
neighbouring Bosnia, and even blamed his former proteges for the Nato attack
on a Serb-held airfield.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, last night met
Mr Milosevic and Mr Milan Martic, leader of Krajina, the self-styled Serb
state in Croatia.
Senior UN civilian and military chiefs were trying to get Mr Milosevic to
exert his influence on Mr Martic to stop aiding their kin across the
frontier in Bosnia, who are attacking a UN safe area in the north-west, said
diplomats.
After the talks, Mr Milosevic called on Mr Martic and the Krajina Serbs to
'resist the forces which are trying to drag the region into war at a time
when efforts are under way to restore peace in Croatia.'
However, Mr Martic and the Krajina Serbs appear more ready to link their
destiny with their Bosnian Serb counterparts, rather than adhere to orders
from Belgrade or the international community.
International mediators, aided by Mr Milosevic, have tried to drive a wedge
between Serbs from Krajina and Bosnia.
Politika, the Serbian daily newspaper which is a mouthpiece for Mr
Milosevic, yesterday lashed out at Krajina leaders for provoking the Nato
attack on Udbina airfield, which was used to launch several air raids on the
nearby Bihac enclave.
'The leaderships of the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs must understand that they
cannot, by provoking air strikes, change Belgrade's and Yugoslavia's peace
policy,' said Mr Hadzi-Dragan Antic, editor of Politika.
'Advocates of the war option are again trying to spread the flame of civil
war on the territory of former Yugoslavia,' wrote Mr Antic.
But yesterday's commentary in Politika contrasted sharply to a statement
from the Yugoslav federal government which is also under Mr Milosevic's
control. It denounced as 'unprovoked' and 'irresponsible' the Nato action,
which could lead to an escalation of the war.
These mixed reactions indicate that Mr Milosevic must send different, and
contradictory signals, to constituents in Serbia and abroad. This reflects
that he has little room for manoeuvre - under pressure from within his
ruling elite, on one hand, and on the other, faced with a deteriorating
economy, he is anxious to get UN sanctions lifted.
Furious with Bosnian Serb refusal to obey Belgrade and endorse an
international peace plan, which would ease UN sanctions, Mr Milosevic in
August abandoned his Bosnian Serb proxies.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Kohl puts jobs at top of Germany's priority list

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday called for a 'national alliance'
of business, industry, and trade unions to create more jobs. He also pledged
to reduce the bureaucracy and introduce cuts in social spending.
In a speech outlining the government's programme for the next four years, Mr
Kohl said it was crucial to speed up the integration of central Europe into
the European Union.
'It is in the interests of the Germans, but also in the interests of Europe,
that the western border of Poland does not remain the eastern border of the
European Union,' he said.
'At the European Union summit in Essen, (next month) we want a strategy to
advance the young democracies of central, east and south-eastern Europe,' he
added.
Mr Kohl, last week re-elected chancellor by one vote for a fifth term, told
the Bundestag: 'We have to bundle all our energies to make Germany fit for
the 21st century. We need an alliance for the future. I invite everybody to
join us daring to renew our state and society. Work for everyone must be our
common goal.'
Mr Kohl said jobs must be created for the long-term unemployed as well as
the disabled. But he stressed that part-time work should be made more
attractive and flexible as one of the means to open up the job market, now
considered to be the government's top domestic priority.
But Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, ruled
out any form of 'grand coalition'. 'Our opposition will aim to make life
better for people in this country, not to keep you (Mr Kohl) in office.
Every day you are in office is one day too long for us,' he said.
The SPD is determined to exploit the government's slim majority of 10.
However the opposition in the Bundestag, which includes the Greens, the SPD
and the reformed east German communist Party of Democratic Socialism are for
the moment too disunited to present a serious challenge to Chancellor Kohl's
governing Christian Democratic Union-led coalition.
If anything, CDU officials believe the immediate threat to the coalition,
which comprises the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party,
comes from the Free Democrats, the junior partner. The FDP had its number of
seats reduced by 32 to 47.
'Kohl had to be careful in this speech not to provoke the opposition,' a CDU
senior official said. 'He needs the SPD in the Bundesrat (upper house) to
get any legislation through. This will be a tough period for the
government.'
He added that the stability of the government will be tested during state
elections in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia next year.
'We are in big trouble if the FDP fail to get above the 5 per cent, the
minimum required to enter parliament.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Italian coalition partners call for crisis meeting
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Key partners in Italy's right-wing coalition government last night called
for a crisis meeting to assess its chances of survival in the wake of the
decision by magistrates to investigate corruption allegations against Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
The move highlighted the division within the Berlusconi government pitting
the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi against its partners. It
raised fears whether the government would last long enough to ensure the
1995 budget passed its last and hardest phase in the senate.
Yesterday, concern over Italy's political instability forced the lira to
another historic low against the D-Mark, being quoted at L1,035 against the
German currency.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro urged the passing of the 1995 budget. This
came after he met the speakers of the two houses, Mr Carlo Scognamiglio and
Ms Irene Pivetti, two people likely to play a vital role in the coming days.
The statement pointed out the present government could be changed only by a
parliamentary vote of no confidence.
Tensions within the government have been heightened in the wake of Tuesday's
decision by Milan magistrates to place Mr Berlusconi under investigation for
alleged corruption while running his Fininvest business empire.
Mr Bossi said the government should only survive until the budget is
approved. But yesterday the League leader and other members of his party
were absent from a meeting of the coalition. This was attended by Mr Cesare
Previti, defence minister and chief co-ordinator of Mr Berlusconi's Forza
Italia movement, Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance, and Mr Pierfernando Casini, head of the small Christian Democrat
Centre.
Their call for an immediate clarification of where each coalition partner
stood appeared aimed at forcing Mr Bossi's hand as well as assessing
survival tactics. Mr Berlusconi yesterday stood by his claim of innocence.
But Milan magistrates indicated they had taken evidence against him from 16
sources. Today, talks are due between government and unions in an attempt to
head off the planned general strike on December 2 to protest at the budget
and plans to cut pensions.

<TEXT>
The second Nato air strike in Bosnia 'can lead to nothing but prolonged
bloodshed,' the Russian foreign ministry warned yesterday in an apparent
attempt to distance itself from the more aggressive policy recently adopted
by the international community in the former Yugoslavia.
'We are seriously worried about the alarming new information from Bosnia,'
Mr Grigory Karasin, the foreign ministry spokesman, told Itar-Tass
newsagency. '
On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed cautious approval of the
first air strike against an airbase which had been used by rebel Serbs to
bombard the besieged town of Bihac. But in subsequent comments, Russian
representatives qualified their support with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister, warning that further air strikes might prompt Russia to withdraw
its peacekeeping forces from Bosnia.
The Russian government is under increasing domestic pressure to act to limit
foreign military intervention in the former Yugoslavia. The lower house of
parliament yesterday passed a resolution urging Mr Yeltsin to use all
possible means - including the exercise of Russia's veto in the UN security
council - to halt military action in the Balkans.
The resolution said although parliament recognised that the military action
was within UN mandate it did not believe the air strikes were 'essential or
appropriate'.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Liberal
Democratic party of Russia, has been trying to whip up opposition to the
Russian government's support for UN policy saying it is unacceptable to use
force to settle a political dispute. 'The conflict cannot be resolved by
military means,' he said.
Mr Kozyrev will tomorrow meet Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister,
in Bonn to express Russia's disquiet at the latest events in Bosnia and
'synchronise watches' for the foreign ministers' meeting on the former
Yugoslavia.

FT  24 NOV 94 / UN troops blockaded in Sarajevo

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb leaders threatened to declare all-out war on the United
Nations, blockading about 150 peacekeepers around Sarajevo, in retaliation
for Nato air strikes on Serb targets.
Sarajevo radio said Serb forces were trying to take back their heavy weapons
from three UN-supervised collection sites.
Fearing retaliation from angry Serb forces, the UN yesterday morning began
withdrawing the bulk of its troops supervising nine weapons depots, created
last February as part of an exclusion zone round Sarajevo.
One person was killed and three wounded when Serb forces opened fire on a
tram driving through the centre of Sarajevo near the Holiday Inn where many
foreign journalists stay, Bosnian radio reported.
The move comes after a warning from Mr Jovan Zametica, adviser to the
Bosnian Serb leadership, just before the assembly of the self-styled state
met to consider the declaration of a state-of-war throughout Serb-held
territory in Bosnia.
'If they (the air strikes) prove to be pure aggression of Nato at the
request of the UN, then Republika Srpska will consider that the UN has sided
with the enemy,' he told the Bosnian Serb news agency.
'This would mean war with the UN,' he warned.

Ireland's search for a new government took an unexpected turn yesterday with
Labour proposing Mr Dick Spring, the party leader, as a possible 'rotating'
prime minister in a future coalition.
Last night a new government composed of Fianna Fail, the largest party, and
Labour still seemed the most likely outcome, following the collapse of the
outgoing government last week and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as
prime minister over the controversial paedophile priest extradition case.
However Labour's proposal, announced after a meeting of its parliamentary
party on Tuesday night, is being seen as a clear overture to Fine Gael, the
main opposition party - a conservative group which has been in coalition
with Labour before.
With parliament adjourned until next Wednesday, Ireland is set for a period
of intense political horse trading.
Fianna Fail's parliamentary party was meeting yesterday for the first time
since the appointment of Mr Bertie Ahern as new leader. However all the
attention was on Fine Gael and Labour after the 'rotation' proposal.
Mr Spring is widely seen to have been the main beneficiary of last week's
crisis with a personal rating in weekend polls at an all time high of 67 per
cent.
Labour yesterday insisted the issue would be part of any negotiations with
either party - Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.
Labour and Fine Gael have been in coalition three times before, during 1973
and 1987: it was a Fine Gael Labour government which negotiated both the
Sunningdale agreement of 1972 and the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
However relations became strained after the 1992 general election with
Labour finally entering government with Fianna Fail. The idea of a
'rotating' prime minister was proposed then by Labour after the party's good
showing in the election - and dismissed out of hand by Fine Gael.
Today observers believe Fine Gael may prove more receptive. Fine Gael leader
John Bruton has not performed well in the polls, although the party has 47
seats against Labour's 33.
Fine Gael's deputy leader, Mrs Nora Owen, said only that the party would
'put our proposals on the table when we enter into negotiations.'

FT  24 NOV 94 / Strike-hit Iberia turns to Plan B
</HEADLINE>

Iberia, Spain's financially crippled national carrier, faced a major
industrial dispute yesterday as its management announced after a board
meeting that it would shed 5,200 jobs from its 25,000 labour force and
drastically reduce the size of the airline.
Unions, which had rejected an earlier management plan to cut salaries by an
average 15 per cent, said they would blockade Spain's airports in protest at
the management's plans.
As the confrontation at Iberia began to look ominously like the violent
industrial dispute at Air France a year ago, the company's employees began
holding mass meetings at Madrid's Barajas airport and at other domestic
airports last night.
With tension running high, one union spokesman said: 'We are not preparing
strikes, we are getting together to plan the closedown of air traffic in
Spain.'
Mr Javier Salas, chairman of Iberia, and president of INI, the state holding
group that owns the airline, said the company would hive off some of its key
units under a series of emergency measures that Iberia's board has called
Plan B.
The proposed measures effectively mean that Iberia renounces its ambitions
to be a global carrier and scales down to become a regional airline.
Plan B involves the sale of Iberia's subsidiaries to INI for subsequent
disposal. Iberia would hive off its shareholdings in a string of airlines
including Aerolineas Argentinas, Chile's Ladeco, Venezuela's Viasa and the
domestic carriers Aviaco, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterraneo.
The measures involve the segregation of the company's handling, maintenance,
information systems and marketing units and their eventual sale. Iberia,
after such a break-up, would consist of a reduced aircraft fleet and a staff
of around 5,000, mostly pilots and cabin crews.
Mr Salas said the survival of Iberia in its present form would only be
possible if the earlier viability plan, which involved pay cuts and the loss
of 2,000 jobs, was accepted by the unions. Unions have already staged two
24-hour stoppages this month that grounded 75 per cent of Iberia's flights
in protest at the pay cuts.
Economy minister Mr Solbes said yesterday that if the airline's management
failed to gain union consent to its original viability plan it would have
full government backing to take other measures because 'there is no other
alternative.'
Under the terms of the viability plan, Iberia would also have sought
authorisation for public subsidies totalling Pta130bn (Pounds 640m) from the
European Commission. This request however depended on union agreement to the
pay cuts. Under Plan B, the management shelves the recapitalisation plan and
will instead meet the urgent need for fresh funding by breaking up the
company and scaling down the airline to a fraction of its present size.
Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn this year, up on earlier estimates of
Pta30bn, and its accumulated losses by December will have effectively wiped
out a Pta120bn capital injection that was authorised by Brussels in 1992. Mr
Salas has said there is a 'serious risk' that the company could be 'legally
bankrupt and forced into liquidation' early next year.

FT  24 NOV 94 / World markets tumble in wake of Wall Street's decline
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Share prices fell worldwide yesterday as the aftershock of Tuesday's
91-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average rippled through
international stock markets.
Traders remained worried about further US interest rate rises, which would
slow the US economy and corporate earnings growth. Investors appeared to be
selling shares and opting for the higher income from bonds.
The shares sell-off continued this morning when the Tokyo market opened. The
Nikkei 225 average fell about 200 points in early trading. Brokers said
selling was across-the-board.
US shares fell again yesterday after steep stock market falls in Europe and
Asia. At one stage, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30
points, with computerised selling programs again responsible for much of the
decline. The market later rallied and at the end of the second busiest
trading day of the year, the Dow closed only 3.36 down at 3,674.63.
Meanwhile, the price of the key 30-year US Treasury bond closed up almost
three-quarters of a point, pushing the yield down to 7.94 per cent, its
first dip below 8 per cent this month.
The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by three-quarters
of a percentage point last week - the sixth rise this year - appears to have
been a watershed. So far this year, the Dow average of 30 leading stocks has
outperformed the broader US market, but investors have now decided to sell
the big industrial, or 'cyclical' stocks, which make up much a large part of
the Dow. They fear the earnings of these companies will suffer as the Fed's
rate increases slow growth next year, and believe government securities
offer more security and better returns at the moment.
Mr Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Kidder Peabody in New York, said:
'I think people feel it's more attractive to put their money in the bond
market right now.'
In London, the FT-SE 100 index opened about 40 points lower and, with no
relief from early Wall Street trading, ended 51.2 points down at 3,027.5,
its fifth-largest fall this year.
Other European markets fell by about 1 per cent to 2 per cent, with the Dax
index in Germany down 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading.
Asian stock markets reacted badly to Tuesday's Dow decline. Hong Kong led,
with the Hang Seng index dropping a further 4.2 per cent after Tuesday's 3.8
per cent decline.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Cabinet to resign if rebels defeat Euro-budget bill: Clarke
raises stakes in fight with Tory rightwingers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday raised the stakes in the government's battle
with its Euro-sceptic backbenchers by revealing a cabinet pact to resign en
masse if the government loses a crucial vote on Monday.
The chancellor's disclosure followed rightwing anger over Treasury figures
admitting that UK contributions to the EU budget will be Pounds 732m higher
than expected this year due to faster economic growth.
The party's discomfort over Europe was further highlighted last night when
Mr Patrick Nicholls, a Tory MP, resigned his post as Conservative
vice-chairman after launching an outspoken attack on the French and Germans
in his local newspaper.
The Treasury's admission was seized on by Euro-sceptics as justification for
their plan to oppose the second reading of the European communities finance
bill.
It prompted rightwing claims that up to 24 Tory backbenchers are now willing
to back a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Conservative party,
probably by someone intended to draw out a serious challenger.
Mr Clarke yesterday demolished Euro-sceptic claims that the defeat of the EU
finance bill would trigger a leadership vote rather than the general
election threatened by Mr Major. Mr Clarke said 'the entire cabinet' agreed
with the prime minister's decision to make the bill an issue of confidence,
and ruled out Mr Major's replacement by any senior government member.
'If anything silly were to happen on Monday, it would be the inevitable
consequence of the defeat that the government would fall,' he said.
Asked if any of Mr Major's colleagues would forestall an election by
standing for the leadership if the bill was defeated, Mr Clarke replied: 'No
member of the present cabinet could honourably take such a course.'
He also dismissed Euro-sceptic claims that the Queen might refuse a
dissolution.
The decision to risk the future of the government by treating the bill as a
confidence issue was taken by Mr Major and a group of six senior cabinet
ministers at Downing Street 10 days ago. The ministers present - Mr Clarke,
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip - all backed Mr Major's
strategy.
Downing Street officials said the issue was not minuted formally by the
cabinet, but other ministers were consulted by the prime minister and
chancellor.
Mr Clarke said the increase in this year's forecast contribution, from
Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2.4bn, reflected faster economic growth and factors
such as changes in the timing of payments under the EU's Common Agricultural
policy.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Counter staff to strike against 'back-door sale' of post
offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One-day post office strikes will be held in the run-up to Christmas after
counter staff around Britain rallied to their union's call to oppose the
'back-door privatisation' of services.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the Commons
that industrial action by counter staff was 'extremely unwise'. He said
strikes were aimed at trying to 'frustrate the management of the Post Office
transferring individual post offices from the public to the private sector'.
There were majorities in favour of striking in only 20 out of 71 areas. In
the ballot, a narrow majority of the entire UK counters' staff rejected the
strike call, by 51 per cent to 49 per cent. Each postal area has been
allowed to decide whether to take industrial action.
Substantial support for a strike was recorded in London, Glasgow and
Merseyside, as well as Bristol, Worcester and Hereford, Sheffield,
Shropshire and mid-Wales, Reading, Exeter, Plymouth and east Cornwall,
Aylesbury, Hemel Hempstead and High Wycombe. Cities voting against included
Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle.
The Post Office said the ballot result was 'a resounding rejection of
unnecessary industrial action'. The union had 'no natural mandate' and any
strikes would be 'pointless and misguided'. Only a 'small minority of crown
offices could be affected by a few single-day stoppages', the Post Office
added. 'More than 19,000 post offices will be open for business as usual.
Whatever action the Union of Communication Workers takes will have no affect
whatsoever on the nation's Christmas mail.'
Mr Ernie Dudley, the union's national officer, said: 'Many of the areas most
affected by closures will be taking action over the next month in a campaign
which will unite post office workers with the public and build on the recent
defeat of Post Office privatisation.'
The union said that, in spite of the U-turn over privatisation, the Post
Office counters' service was continuing to shut down main offices,
franchising many of them to retailers. It pointed out that half the
country's main post offices have closed since 1989, and only 800 have
experienced counter staff.
Mr Dudley said only 397 main post offices would remain by 1999. 'Unless we
take action now, 400 will close in the next four years. The planned strikes
will give people a taste of what the future may hold if the needless policy
of closures does not stop.'
But the Post Office denied it was closing main post offices and said the
number providing a full range of services was about 1,500, the same as four
years ago.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Clinton and Dole seal deal over US vote on trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton and Republican Senate leader Robert Dole yesterday
announced a deal which paves the way for congressional approval of the
Uruguay Round trade pact. The pact, the result of over seven years of
negotiations between more than 100 countries, will usher in a new era in
world trade.
Leading trading nations, including Japan and the European Union, have been
waiting for US ratification of the trade pact before proceeding with their
own legislation to bring the accord into being.
Mr Dole, whose support is vital, promised to work for a 'big big vote' for
the deal in the Senate. A vote is scheduled for a week on Thursday. Sixty of
the 100 senators must approve a crucial waiver of budget rules for the
legislation to pass. Congress is to return for a special post-election
session to vote on the pact which would lower world trade barriers and
liberalise global trading. Mr Clinton said the US has moved 'one step closer
to gaining broad, bipartisan support for the Gatt'.
Mr Dole said: 'I will be writing a personal letter to each of my Republican
colleagues in the Senate . . . suggesting that in my view, we ought to be
all in support of Gatt when it comes up next week.'
He also said he had never attempted to 'kill the pact' but needed additional
safeguards to assure his constituents that new World Trade Organisation, to
be set up to arbitrate trade disputes, would not impinge upon US
sovereignty.
As part of the compromise, the administration has agreed to establish a
panel of federal judges to monitor dispute settlements in the WTO to ensure
US interests are protected.
Many trade experts fear the proposed panel could undermine the dispute
settlement provisions agreed under the Uruguay Round and other countries
might establish review panels.
Mr Dole's opposition to the trade accord had been unexpected because of his
history of supporting free trade. His stand posed a dilemma for the White
House, still reeling from recent election results.
Mr Dole emerged without administration support for lower capital gains
taxes. As a face saver, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, gave a
vague promise to 'review any proposal on capital formation that come out of
the 104th Congress'.
However, the administration gave Mr Dole assurances on continued funding of
farm programmes. Mr Dole's state, Kansas, is the largest producer of wheat.
The new review panel will be appointed by the president, the chairmen of the
House ways and means committee and the Senate finance committee.
The panel will review all final WTO dispute settlement reports adverse to
the US to determine if the organisation exceeded its authority.

FT  24 NOV 94 / Backbenchers urge spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs are demanding swingeing public spending reductions in
Tuesday's Budget to pave the way for tax cuts before the next general
election, writes Philip Stephens, political editor.
More than half the Tory MPs responding to a Financial Times poll want Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut Pounds 5bn or more from next year's
Pounds 263bn expenditure total. Amid widespread agreement on the backbenches
that the social security budget should be his main target, nearly a third
call for overall reductions of more than Pounds 6bn.
Mr Clarke's personal rating has risen sharply, with 82 per cent saying he is
doing an excellent or good job compared with 68 per cent a year ago. But
nearly two-thirds of those questioned believe that a public spending squeeze
now must be followed by 'sizeable' tax cuts before the election. Only a
handful regard pre-election tax cuts as unimportant.
The survey, based on written responses from 70 Conservative Tory MPs,
reveals serious disquiet about the planned imposition next April of valued
added tax on fuel at the full 17.5 per cent rate.

FT  24 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Belgian metals group
to float Swedish arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 25th November 1994) appended to this article.
Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, is to reduce further its interests
in the zinc business by floating Ammeberg Mining Corporation, its Swedish
mining subsidiary, on the Stockholm stock exchange on terms which value it
at about SKr1.26bn (Dollars 170m).
UM plans an initial public offering of nearly 11m Ammeberg shares, or 95 per
cent of the company, at between SKr103 and SKr112 each. Underwriters have
the option to buy additional shares to cover over-allotments and, if this is
taken up, UM will have no further ownership interest in Ammeberg.
Gross proceeds from the offering before the exercise of over-allotment
options and commissions were expected to be between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.39bn,
UM said.
The offering will consist of retail and institutional offerings in Sweden
and an international institutional offering. About 30 per cent of the shares
available will be offered in Sweden, including about 5 per cent to retail
investors. It is scheduled to be completed by mid-December.
Ammeberg operates the Zinkgruvan underground mine, in south central Sweden,
which opened in 1857 and last year produced about 63,000 tonnes of zinc,
15,000 tonnes of lead and 30 tonnes of silver.
UM said last year it wished to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc
producer. It has closed its zinc refining plant at Overpelt in Belgium, and
last year cancelled plans to double capacity at its Balen zinc refinery,
also in Belgium.
In February, UM sold its Union Zinc subsidiary in the US to Savage Resources
of Australia for USDollars 200m. Flotation of the Swedish zinc subsidiary
will round off this rationalisation process.
CORRECTION
The price range for the offering of shares in Ammeberg Mining by its parent,
Union Miniere, is SKr112 to SKr130, not SKr103 to SKr112 as stated
yesterday. This values Ammeberg at between SKr1.26bn and SKr1.46bn (Dollars
170m to Dollars 197m).

FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods hits at multiple in last BFI deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods yesterday sought to convince shareholders they should reject the
hostile Pounds 391m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US by
claiming that the predator had paid a substantially higher price for its
last major acquisition.
Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders: 'BFI's
reference to an implied multiple for our US businesses of one times revenue
conveniently takes no account of the implied multiple of two times revenues
which it paid for its 50 per cent interest in Otto Waste Service (of
Germany).'
Mr Foreman added that comparable US waste management companies traded on an
average multiple of 1.9 times revenue, before taking account of a premium
for control.
BFI is offering 116.75p per ordinary and 92p per preference share. It has
promised to pay the 3.25p dividend proposed, to accepting shareholders.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Improved Saab-Scania boosts
profits at Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investor, the central holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg
empire, saw pre-tax profits surge to SKr2.28bn (Dollars 311m) in the first
nine months, after a strong performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned
vehicle and aerospace unit.
The result, which compares with a SKr156m profit in the same 1993 period,
came after Saab-Scania rebounded to a profit of SKr2.18bn after financial
items, from a SKr362m loss.
Saab-Scania's performance has been driven by higher sales and earnings from
its Scania truck and bus division. These offset falling sales and increased
losses at Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence.
Investor, which apart from Saab-Scania has strategic holdings in leading
Swedish companies such as Astra, Ericsson, Stora and Electrolux, said the
value of its investment portfolio on September 30 was SKr28.9bn, down 1 per
cent from the start of the year after adjusting for net changes.
The group expanded its portfolio through the purchase of its Export-Invest
stablemate earlier this year.
The result included SKr710m in capital gains and SKr477m in dividend
receipts. Shares were sold for a net SKr852m.
The group's net worth amounted to SKr40.5bn, or SKr203 a share, on September
30 against SKr37.5bn, or SKr206, at the start of the year. Net debt has
fallen to SKr4.61bn from SKr4.85bn.
Saab-Scania saw sales climb to SKr22.2bn from SKr17.6bn, while operating
income after depreciation soared to SKr2.32bn from SKr108m.
The star performer was Scania, where sales jumped 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn
and operating income after depreciation rose to SKr2.45bn from SKr311m.
Sales of trucks and buses rose 28 per cent to 23,500 units, helping the
division to lift its share of the west European truck market to 12.9 per
cent from 11.7 per cent.
Orders rose 61 per cent in volume terms, to 29,100 trucks and buses.
Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence was dragged to a deeper operating loss of SKr242m
from SKr227m, mainly because of lower sales of commercial aircraft. Saab
Aircraft, which manufactures Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional airliners, saw
sales drop to SKr881m from SKr1.35bn, while orders fell to SKr395m from
SKr667m.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: UAP in accord for younger staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance companies,
yesterday announced a labour contract with the government so that it can
take on younger people.
The group said its workforce was too old - with an average age of between 35
and 45 - and it wanted to employ younger people. About 250 of the existing
staff will be going part-time and the remaining 150 will take on more
flexible hours.
UAP, privatised earlier this year, will hire 400 new staff next year,
including large numbers of long-term unemployed, while placing an equivalent
number of staff on part-time and flexible contracts.
The accord, signed by Mr Jacques Friedmann, UAP's chairman, and Mr Michel
Giraud, the French minister of labour, will require the state to pay up to
30 per cent of the salary of those working part-time for up to five years.
In exchange, some 40 per cent of those hired by UAP during 1995 will have
been unemployed for more than one year, and aged over 50. The rest will be
younger than 30.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Films lift Disney to record: Downturn in theme parks more
than offset by 43% rise in film sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King,
more than offset a downturn in theme parks to produce record fourth-quarter
earnings of Dollars 226m, against a loss of Dollars 78m. Group operating
profits, before losses in Euro Disney, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m.
For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full
year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m versus
Dollars 684m.
According to Disney, The Lion King is now established as its most successful
feature ever, and is on track to be one of the five most successful films in
history. In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to
Dollars 189m on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn.
The executive most credited with this result, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, made a
highly public departure from Disney at the end of the financial year. His
job as chairman of Walt Disney Studios has been divided among other Disney
executives.
Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) fell 18 per cent
to Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher. International tourist traffic
fell, the company said, and costs had been written off for the proposed
Civil War theme park in Virginia, which Disney was forced to abandon.
The company said yesterday it was still contemplating a new theme park in
Florida, but had yet to decide whether to go ahead or what the theme might
be.
Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters
and books from the films, rose 33 per cent to Dollars 95m on sales up 36 per
cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The Lion
King, Disney said.
For the year as a whole, operating profits from films rose 38 per cent on
sales up 30 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Disney said the year had also been
helped by the animated features Aladdin and The Return of Jafar, as well as
by strong video sales of older features such as The Jungle Book and Bambi.
The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, from Dollars 415m,
for the quarter and Dollars 110m (Dollars 515m) for the year. Earnings per
share for the quarter were 42 cents, against a loss of 15 cents, and for the
full year were Dollars 2.04, against 55 cents.
Full-year net income was Dollars 1.1bn compared with Dollars 300m.
Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with
Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has now
authorised the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still
authorised under the existing programme. At yesterday's closing price of
Dollars 43, this could cost the company about Dollars 4.3bn.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Unilever drops Dollars 60m Kazakh plant bid: Move is further
sign of trouble for country's privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALMA ATA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has withdrawn a Dollars 60m bid for two
state-owned margarine factories in Kazakhstan, in a further sign of trouble
for the country's privatisation programme.
The withdrawal this week comes two months after the Kazakhstan parliament
began pushing to suspend the privatisation programme alleging that auctions
had been fixed to benefit powerful families.
The state privatisation committee has set a December 1 deadline for Unilever
to submit a new bid for the factories, located at Alma Ata and Karaganda. Ms
Susan Bruno of KPMG Peat Marwick, which advises the state committee, said.
'They (Unilever) are definitely still interested. They want to keep this
thing alive,' Ms Bruno said in a telephone interview.
Unilever won a tender for the plants and signed a preliminary agreement in
June, a deal worth Dollars 60m in cash and investment. The deal was supposed
to close in August, but Unilever began having difficulty obtaining licences
and guarantees from various government ministries.
Finally, the company was unable to obtain a guarantee for a steady local
supply of its main staple, sunflower oil, something that had been stipulated
in the preliminary agreement.
The company's new offer could be lower, since it appears it must supply its
own sunflower oil from outside the republic, Ms Bruno said.
The Unilever deal is important, since it is one of three large initial
privatisations meant to send a signal to foreign investors that Kazakhstan
is serious about attracting outside capital.
One of the two other deals, RJR Nabisco's purchase last summer of two
confectionary plants, also seemed in doubt when state officials began trying
to alter parts of the contract, according to western businessmen close to
the deal.
As a whole, Kazakhstan's seven-month-old privatisation programme has
produced mixed results.
The programme is divided into three parts - tenders of large enterprises
such as the confectionary and margarine plants; mass auctions of some 7,500
small and medium-sized enterprises; and privatisation of small concerns such
as shops.
The small-scale privatisation appears to have gone well, diplomats and
western business analysts say, but the sale of medium and large-scale
enterprises has been slow.
Western diplomats, for example, confirmed that the sale of medium-sized
concerns initially did appear to have been rigged.
Many were sold to favoured families without prior advertisement of the
properties, they said.
'A lot of them were done very quickly, and ended up in the hands of the rich
and famous,' said one western diplomat.

repurchase programme
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merck, the biggest US pharmaceuticals group, announced plans to buy back up
to Dollars 2bn of its shares. The repurchase programme would help repair
some of the dilution to the company's earnings per share which stemmed from
the acquisition of Medco Containment Services at the end of last year,
writes Richard Waters in New York.
A sales company with lower profit margins than Merck's drug making business,
Medco held back Merck's earnings to 62 cents a share in the most recent
quarter, the same level as a year ago.
Merck has been an active buyer of its own stock in recent years, having
completed Dollars 3.7bn of repurchases between 1985 and 1992.
The company had bought a further Dollars 371m under another Dollars 1bn
programme before the purchases were halted by the planned Medco deal.
The programme was resumed in September of this year is currently near
completion, the company said.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Lilley rejects call over pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, last night rejected demands
that the new private pensions regulator should be financed by the taxpayer.
He insisted it was 'proper' that the cost should be met by occupational
pension schemes.
He emphasised that not all taxpayers benefited from such schemes and did not
see why they should meet the cost.
In the first vote of the new parliamentary session the government defeated
Labour calls for regulations to control the mis-selling of private pensions
and for the abandonment of the jobseekers allowance by a majority of 37
(309-272).
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, underlined the need to
ensure that the new regulator was seen to be independent. He warned: 'He
will not have that independence if the industry is seen as his paymaster.'
Mr Lilley looked to the encouragement of increased self-provision of
pensions and the reinforced incentive to work provided by the jobseekers
allowance to limit the cost of social security provision.
Earlier, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, brushed aside
suggestions that policy decisions on limiting tobacco advertising had been
influenced by lobbying organisations. She was challenged about a report in
The Guardian newspaper referring to a meeting between Mr Keith Mans, her
parliamentary private secretary, and the Outdoor Advertising Action Group.
Mrs Bottomley said Mr Mans, who is Conservative MP for Wyre, had no
recollection of such a meeting. She insisted no holder of her office would
be able to do the job unless used to 'energetic lobbying' from people
concerned with particular policies.
The six-day debate on the Queen's Speech ends today.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Call for change in societies' rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society, the country's second biggest, yesterday called
for a single qualifying period before society members become eligible for
rights and benefits of membership.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said in giving evidence to the
Commons Treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that there was
a case for a single statutory test of membership - having been an investor
or a borrower for a set period of time such as two years - which would apply
for voting and ownership.
While such a change would reduce the number of members eligible to vote,
when there was increased emphasis on societies' accountability, it would
remove some of the anomalies of the current arrangements.
In the case of the Lloyds Bank bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society only C&amp;G investing members of more than two years' standing could
receive a cash share of the price, although a larger number of members -
including borrowers - could vote on whether to accept the offer.
The society's written submission to the committee called for a single
regulatory framework for financial services with just one watchdog covering
areas now handled by a range of bodies including the Building Societies
Commission and the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City
regulator.
MPs on the cross-party committee pressed Mr Davis about why Nationwide had
entered a 'tied' relationship to sell the financial services products of
Guardian Royal Exchange, the insurer, instead of offering independent
financial advice.
He said the link provided a chance to work closely with the supplier and
improve administration in order to reduce costs.

FT  23 NOV 94 / BNFL financing reclassified
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has been reclassified so its finances fall within the
public sector borrowing requirement. It was set up in 1971 as a private
company with the government as its only shareholder. That allowed it to
borrow money from commercial sources.
Treasury ministers said the change should not affect BNFL's commercial
operations nor lead to any greater intervention by the government.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: That Woman - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I won't take my shoes off, don't worry,' says the eponymous heroine of That
Woman, a new comedy by John Antrobus. 'I don't go in for familiarity.'
Is this funny? In itself, not particularly. With that superb character
actress Patricia Hayes, however, it is the first great hoot of a memorably
hilarious evening. The character she plays - an old eccentric who keeps
inviting herself into young Jack's flat, and anywhere else, for a cuppa and
biscuits - is the kind of role we seem to have seen Hayes play a hundred
times, and yet there is not a jot of staleness in it. Hayes's voice still
ranges so easily from chest to head tones, from urgency to tremulousness,
and her diction is so good, that by the time she has got to the juicy word
'familiarity', slowly savoured, she has us in the palm of her hand.
That Woman is being presented upstairs in Riverside's Studio 3 as if its
actors were delivering a BBC radio play, scripts in hand: which is a
charming way of ensuring that Hayes herself, who alone seems in need of a
script, need not undergo the old actor's nightmare of forgetting her lines.
Indeed, since That Woman began as a pair of radio plays, How I Met Franz and
Rats, little camouflage is involved.
Antrobus's writing is a perfect vehicle for Hayes's gift for creating
monstrous bizarrerie out of her harmless-old-crone facade. (Would that we
could hear again the tremendous Sarah Gamp she once created in Radio 4's
Martin Chuzzlewit.) Her obsession here is that she has been the sexual
plaything of the medical profession. By the time she has got to 'I don't
know when I last had a stethoscope on my chest,' convulsions are occurring
all round the audience. Yet the role has its pathos ('I want to talk to
someone'), and eventually its bizarrerie goes beyond humour into purest
fantasy.
In the second half, she sets to work on a police inspector. She offers
herself as a material witness, but she wants also (a) tea and biscuits, and
a proper meal if poss. (b) seduction ('Out comes the truncheon' - spoken
with fabulous lasciviousness). And yet her behaviour in the police station
is more normal than the story she has to narrate. She tells of her
passionate affair with her late lamented: 'I was Josephine to his Napoleon,
Emma Thomson to his Kenneth Banner' (sic). The late lamented's wife had
repressed his artistic talent: 'She wouldn't let him express himself in
oils.' But her he painted: ''Let yourself go into a pose of the southern
seas,' he said.' What had she to offer him? 'Unendurable pleasure
indefinitely prolonged.'
I would like to take Hayes's utterance of that last line to a desert island.
But, then, she is uproarious in her myriad different ways of saying 'Yes,
dear,' all of them loaded. And she is perfectly complimented by Brian Murphy
and Peter Woodward. Murphy, a wonderful study in working-class perturbation,
is a fine comic actor who is the more funny for giving every attention to
Hayes and his co-actors; Woodward, with his striking presence, anchors the
first half by playing the innocent deadpan dupe to this aged visitation.
Philip Grout directs. On press night, the cast seemed scarcely able to
suppress their own giggles. And we who watched gave our laughter full vent.
At the Riverside Studios, W6.

<TEXT>
Mr John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, yesterday ordered 28
insurance companies to repay Dollars 1.25bn of premiums between them to
policyholders in the state.
His decision marks the latest stage in the saga of Proposition 103, a voter
initiative in California which won support in 1988. This required insurers
to 'roll back' premium levels and pay rebates to holders of auto and other
insurance policies in 1989.
Mr Garamendi made his first order for rebates in October 1991, when he told
14 insurers to repay Dollars 1.5bn. After protracted court battles Dollars
800m of this has been paid.
The latest rebates include Fireman's Fund, told to repay Dollars 162m;
Hartford Fire &amp; Casualty, Dollars 153m; Chubb, Dollars 139m and Nationwide,
Dollars 93m.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Clinton dismisses latest venomous outburst by Helms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night dismissed the latest assault from Senator
Jesse Helms as 'unwise and inappropriate' and all but issued an invitation
to the Republicans running Congress not to appoint the arch-conservative as
the next chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee.
His remarks came at the end of an extraordinary day which began with a North
Carolina newspaper quoting the local senator as saying that Mr Clinton had
'better have a bodyguard' if he ever visited military bases in the state, so
unpopular was the president with servicemen.
That was enough to get the Secret Service, which investigates all threats
against the president, into the act. It said it wanted to see a transcript
of Mr Helms's remarks, which seemed to go even further than his
controversial weekend comments that Mr Clinton was unfit to be
commander-in-chief.
By mid-afternoon, after party colleagues beyond number had run a mile from
his remarks, Mr Helms had repented somewhat. A statement said: 'I made a
mistake last evening which I shall not repeat.' His 'somewhat informal'
comments had been taken 'too literally' and, of course, Mr Clinton was
welcome to visit North Carolina. But he then went on to list all the reasons
why he thought Mr Clinton was unpopular with the military - his avoidance of
service in the Vietnam War, his ending of discrimination against serving
homosexuals and his defence budget cuts.
Mr Clinton's reaction was magisterially severe. He first dismissed the
senator's attacks and went on: 'The president oversees the foreign policy of
the US,' and 'the GOP (Republicans) will decide in whom they repose their
trust and confidence - that's a decision for them to make, not me.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: 'Progress' in congressional talks on Gatt
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton said yesterday progress had been made in negotiations
with Senator Robert Dole, the Republican Senate leader, whose support is
vital to passage of the Uruguay Round trade deal in the US Congress.
Clearly hoping for bipartisan amity on trade, at the very least, Mr Clinton
praised Senator Dole's 'constructive approach' on 'substantive issues
surrounding the Gatt.' However, he rejected the senator's attempt at the
weekend to link passage of the Round package with a cut in the capital gains
tax.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has been in constant contact with
Senator Dole, who must appease his party's right wing which professes to
fear an encroachment by the proposed World Trade Organisation on US
sovereignty.
Senator Dole has reportedly proposed a panel of retired federal judges who
would review decisions by the WTO dispute settlement panels. If the panels
rule against the US improperly three times, within a certain period of time,
then Congress could vote to withdraw from the WTO.
Time for a deal is running short. The House is due to vote next Tuesday, and
the Senate three days later. The four-day Thanksgiving holiday intervenes,
starting tomorrow. This leaves little time to build momentum in favour of
the Round. Lobbyists say once Senator Dole signs on to a deal, the political
dynamic changes. Unwilling to be seen as a leader who cannot deliver, he
will work hard to bring fellow Republicans with him.
In the House, where the legislation has been expected to pass easily, many
members have become edgy about casting a controversial vote when the
legislation may not make it to the Senate floor. A number of Republicans who
want the Uruguay Round out of the way for their own agenda next year have
opposed its linkage with the capital gains tax cut.
'Dole wants to demonstrate that he is not insensitive to the concerns of the
conservatives,' said one former senior trade official. 'At the end of the
day he will not want to be seen as the one who brought Gatt down.' Questions
that opponents have raised about the WTO impinging on US sovereignty have
already been answered with some safeguards. The deal reached in Geneva would
allow any country to withdraw from the WTO after six months' notice.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Bank plan to sell Tapie's mansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, could
face the loss of his luxurious Paris house in the next few weeks as part of
his legal battle with Credit Lyonnais.
The embattled state-controlled bank said yesterday it intended to sell 'as
quickly as possible' the assets controlled by Mr Tapie secured against its
loans to him and his network of companies if it wins the latest of a series
of court battles against him today.
First to go is likely to be the Hotel de Cavoye, Mr Tapie's mansion in the
fashionable seventh arrondissement, which some experts have valued at
FFr100m-FFr160m (Pounds 12m-Pounds 19m).
This may be followed rapidly by attempted sales of his shares, and the yacht
Phocea in Marseilles. Also up for sale would be his collection of antique
furniture and paintings, many of which he attempted to remove to secure
hiding places earlier this year.
The ability of Credit Lyonnais to sell the assets will depend on a judgment
today in the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, resulting from an appeal
heard last month in which Mr Tapie argued that the bank must stick to the
original terms of an agreement reached in March to repay his debts over five
years.
The bank says he failed to keep his side of the agreement, which included
providing two independent expert valuations of his assets against which the
repayments were to be secured. One estimate has put the total worth at
FFr300m, against loans to him of about FFr1.2bn.
Credit Lyonnais is under considerable pressure to act after widespread
criticism of its losses, which reached FFr4.5bn in the first half of this
year. Its loans to Mr Tapie were one of the principal issues raised by
customers who took advantage of an open evening to voice their concerns.
Mr Tapie is separately suing Credit Lyonnais over a claim that the bank is
partly responsible for the management of the companies he controlled, and
over a series of advertisements which included an unflattering cartoon of
him. A court is also due to decide next month whether his companies are
bankrupt and must be wound up.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (2): New political landscape emerges -
Aftermath of the presidential elections / Mexico's foremost challenge is to
build a workable democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUIS RUBIO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The August presidential election created a radically new political
landscape, one which should allow the country's ills to be faced with the
strength that only a legitimate government can provide.
Even more important, by voting in such huge numbers (almost 78 per cent of
registered voters), Mexicans discredited violent attempts to grab power, of
which there have been many examples in the last few months. The impressive
turnout of voters also indicated that Mexicans want to pursue the change
that has taken place over the last decade, but that they want it to deliver
benefits to all, right now. The question is whether the government can
deliver.
The old, authoritarian political system, established in the late 1920s,
together with a closed, protected and subsidised economy, hindered Mexicans
from attaining higher standards of living, while preventing them from
building a political system that would have provided them with a proper
system of justice as well as influence over the political decisions that
affect their lives.
The old 'certainty' was replaced, since the uprising in the southern state
of Chiapas on January 1, by extreme uncertainty. The traditional rules and
structures had ceased to function and Mexicans suddenly found themselves
lacking institutions that could help resolve the newly-found difficulties.
While the electoral process was hastily restructured to make it possible to
hold proper elections in August  - which were much more successful than
virtually anyone had anticipated  - the environment in which these were held
was conducive neither to clean electoral competition nor economic
development.
The task ahead is clear: by the end of the next administration, Mexico
should have in place a set of institutions  - or at least strong foundations
for them  - which will secure continuous peaceful transfers of power in
government, which allow Mexicans to settle disputes in a non-violent way and
with full regard for the law, and that, in conjunction with an economic
policy that induces rapid economic growth with price stability, make it
possible for Mexicans to get closer to the levels of per capita incomes of
their richer brethren in south-east Asia.
There would be many benchmarks for this process:
First, there would have to be, once and for all, local and state elections
that are undisputable. This would mean not only that rules and realities are
impeccable in terms of the 'level playing field' that they provide, but also
that all political parties cease to make every election a contest, at best,
of non-institutional strength and, at worst, of reckless self-interest.
Second, the government and all political parties would have to come to terms
with the new realities of the economy as well as with the need to work
together in the process of governing. This would mean that the government,
in practice, recognises that the opposition parties represent a significant
portion of the population (after all, close to 50 per cent of the electorate
voted for them) and that, as a result, they should have a say in the process
of government. Up to now, for example, all agencies in the legislature that
are supposed to keep watch on the government have been in the hands of the
government party. Those should unequivocally be held by opposition parties.
As regards the economy, the struggle for power over the last few years has
been extended to this arena, even though the three leading political
parties, at least formally, vow to pursue similar economic policies.
The main case in point is the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The PRD, the left-of-centre political party, launched an extraordinary
campaign in Mexico as well as in the US and Canada, aimed at defeating
Nafta. This was not so much because it opposed the treaty, but because it
wanted to oust PRI from government. If a strong turnabout of the economy is
to be reached, all political groupings would have to be party to efforts
necessary to transform Mexico's productive base.
By the same token, Mexico will probably not experience a long-lasting
recovery  - measured in terms of decades as in south-east Asia  - unless it
faces up to the dual problem of unequal income distribution and dramatically
low levels of education in a manner fully compatible with a market economy.
In other words, until Mexicans break away from their past, they will not
reach the level of development they desire and deserve.
Third, while the dramatic change in the elections was due to the one factor
that nobody predicted  - an extraordinary voter turnout  - none of the
parties cares that much about what happens to the average Mexican.
The absence of re-election at all levels of government means that almost no
politician pays any attention to the people, except in either a general way
or when targeting individual interests they want to tap.
Yet, it is Mexicans at large that will make the difference in the next
several years and that will determine whether the economy can experience a
strong surge of productivity and growth or not. For most Mexicans, the hard
reality of life is that there is no clean and fair judicial system, there
are no means to fight corruption, and the most basic rights are too limited
to be properly called 'rights.' A drastic change at the level of government
and in the negotiations among the political parties should introduce changes
that will improve the people's lot. But that will only take place when
incentives are in place to drive politicians, the government, and the
political parties to cater to popular needs.
Given the situation in Mexico, that would probably require a new
constitutional framework, one that is clean and non-contradictory; in other
words, something that can be turned into reality, as opposed to today's
legal framework, which is neither respected nor realistic. When that
happens, Mexico will have a working democracy.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (12): Drug problem grows - Assassination
links are officially denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the ruling
party, was gunned down six weeks ago, Mexicans began to talk about the
'Colombianisation' of the political system, reports Damian Fraser.
Drug barons and their allies in the ruling party, it was claimed, were
seeking to block political change and police operations against them by
killing reform-minded public figures. Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas of
Guadalajara had been a victim last year; presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio in March; and now Mr Ruiz Massieu, went the conspiracy theory.
'Who's next?' asked Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, in an article in La
Jornada. Columnists pointed to the spate of political killings in Colombia
in the late 1980s - that preceded moves by Colombia to accept extradition of
traffickers to the US - and suggested that Mexico's co-operation with the US
over drug enforcement was provoking a similar reaction.
'President Salinas broke the truce between drug barons and the government.
They are now fighting back,' says Federico Reyes Heroles, editor of Este
Pais, a magazine dedicated to public opinion. Mr Eduardo Valle, a former
senior aide to the attorney-general, until earlier this year, and now in
exile in the US, publicly claimed that drug traffickers and senior members
of the ruling party were in cahoots, and were behind the Colosio killing.
Such a view, although widely held, is rejected by the attorney-general's
office, which says that 'no connection' has been found between the killings.
The official line is that drug traffickers mistook Cardinal Posadas for the
head of a rival gang and killed him by accident; that Mr Colosio was
assassinated by a lone, deranged gunman; and that drug traffickers at most
played a secondary role in planning Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder.
Backing up the official version is the lack of clear motive for recent
killings: there is no evidence that drug traffickers have gained from the
murders. Nor has any evidence emerged that contradicts the government
explanation for the three deaths, or links them in any direct way.
Nevertheless, the conspiracy theories thrive. Many find it difficult to
believe that a Roman Catholic Cardinal could be confused with a 28-year-old
drug dealer; that it was by chance that Mr Colosio was murdered in Tijuana,
home to the powerful cartel of that name; and that is a co-incidence that
one of the alleged conspirators in the Ruiz Massieu killing, is thought to
be related to a top lieutenant of the Gulf cartel.
While the amateur execution of the Ruiz Massieu assassination does not bear
the hallmarks of a drug killing, some have suggested the Gulf cartel killed
Mr Ruiz Massieu to take revenge on his brother, Mario Ruiz Massieu, the
deputy attorney-general who has cracked down on the Gulf cartel.
Others believe that Ruiz Massieu had fallen out with members of the Gulf
cartel when governor of Guerrero, who had him killed before his expected
appointment to the interior ministry. Still others claim that Mr Ruiz
Massieu was killed by old-styled politicians, who feared his supposed
reformist instincts.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (13): Trade balance still largely unchanged
 -North American Free Trade Agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly a year after the North American Free Trade Agreement first came into
effect, there is no giant sucking sound of jobs and factories moving from
the US to Mexico. Overall, trade flows between US and Mexico have increased
substantially, but not to any one country's benefit; the two way balance of
trade has remained largely unchanged.
Nor has integration of North America's economies moved as fast as many once
predicted. Regulations governing trade and investment between Mexico and the
US have, if anything, become more complex since the treaty came into effect.
US companies have complained this year about new Mexican Customs
requirements, delays and red-tape at the border, plus stricter enforcement
of sanitary and labeling standards.
At the same time, though Nafta was intended to reduce uncertainty about
Mexico's political and economic future by indefinitely committing it to
pro-market economic policies, foreign investors remain nervous about the
country's economic and political prospects.
Partly as a result of the peasant rebellion in Chiapas over the New Year,
and the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the then-leading
presidential candidate, Mexico's interest rates in real terms have risen
since the treaty came into effect and the stockmarket has fallen, in dollar
terms.
Heralded by some of its supporters as a mechanism that would transform
Mexico's economy, and attacked by critics in the US as an agreement that
would destroy US jobs, Nafta has so far had a modest economic impact.
While growth of two-way trade and investment has accelerated, and the US and
Canada moved to support Mexico's currency after Mr Colosio's assassination,
the treaty has played a much smaller part in shaping economic and political
events on both sides of the border this year, than, for example, the rise in
US interest rates.
'Trade agreements do not turn trade relationships upside down,' says Mr
Jeffrey Schott, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, DC. 'There are a lot of people whose analysis of the treaty was
'out of the ball park,' on both the positive and negative side.'
While Nafta's supporters and opponents accept that Nafta has not yet lived
up to some of the wilder expectations held for it, they argue that eight
months is too short a time to judge its overall impact. The strongest
effects - in terms of higher economic growth for Mexico, or arguably loss of
US jobs - will, it is contended, be felt over the long-term as the bulk of
tariff and non-tariff barriers between the two countries, and with Canada,
are removed.
In Mexico, the government has downplayed Nafta throughout most of the year,
wary perhaps that the agreement had been given too much attention in
previous years, and partly on the defensive after Zapatista rebels in
Chiapas attacked it as a 'death sentence' for the country's Indian
population. Indeed, the view - never very widely held - that the treaty
would rapidly usher in a period of stability and prosperity has been
dropped.
'It was always a dubious notion that Nafta would make Mexico's political
institutions more solid and the country more stable,' said one leading
ruling party figure earlier this year earlier. 'It merely establishes what
are the boundaries of feasible economic policies.'
Asked to point to benefits of Nafta this year, officials and many
businessmen believe that the agreement has reduced the economic impact of
the political shocks this year. They reckon Nafta gave investors confidence
that economic policy will remain unchanged, irrespective of political
developments. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the president-elect, and the two main
opposition candidates in the August election, all broadly supported the
accord.
'None of the political events this year have changed the fundamentals for
us,' says Urlich Sander, head of corporate communication at Vitro, one of
Mexico's largest industrial companies. 'We are still on the border of the
largest market in the world, and because of Nafta we are still having to
prepare ourselves for full competition.'
Such an argument appears partly supported by economic figures. Despite the
political uncertainty, direct investment into Mexico has increased rapidly
this year. Mexico's non-oil exports to the US have grown by over 20 per
cent.
While Nafta contributed to such flows, most economists caution that it was
of an influence than the raw figures indicate. Trade and investment between
Mexico and the US was growing rapidly before Nafta was in place, reflecting
a long-term trend towards economic integration, independent of the
agreement. With Mexico's economy sluggish, and the US's expanding strongly,
Mexico's exports would have grown strongly even without an accord.
In some cases, Nafta may have made trade more difficult. Many companies
based in Mexico and the US have found it difficult to work what out - if any
 -benefits they are due under the agreement, and how to comply with new
complex regional content rules set out by the treaty. Mexico's decision to
enforce trade regulations such as Spanish-language labelling and sanitary
standards more tightly has led to delays at the US-Mexico border, and
complaints from exporters and importers.
Just as the business climate has been slow to change, critics contend that
there has been no noticeable improvement in Mexico's enforcement of labour
and environmental laws since Nafta came into effect. Indeed, Mr Jose Antonio
Ortega, head of Radian Corporation, a large environmental consulting firm in
Mexico City, says enforcement has relaxed this year, as the Mexican
government no longer has had to worry about US public opinion.
The three secretariats set up under Nafta to enforce the trade, labour and
environment agreements are still not fully operational, with some key
positions to be filled.
So far, US labour unions have filed two complaints alleging that Mexico is
not enforcing labour laws, but as was clear when the side agreements were
made public, the process of reviewing these complaints has been long-winded
and none, up to now, have been successful.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (11): More glitz for shoppers - US/Mexican
retailing alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American Free Trade Agreement has spawned half a dozen
cross-border alliances between Mexican and US retailers which are betting on
the growing purchasing power of 90m Mexicans.
Cifra, Mexico's leading retailer, has formed a jointly owned company with
Wal-Mart of the US to establish supermarkets and discount stores.
A second joint-venture has been signed between Cifra, Wal-Mart and Dillard
Department Stores, which specialises in clothing and wearing-apparel.
Comercial Mexicana, the second-largest retailer, has teamed up with Price
Club of the US to rival the Cifra-Wal-Mart alliance.
Grupo Gigante, Mexico's third-largest retailer, has joined up with Carrefour
of France in one joint-venture and with Fleming Companies in another.
El Puerto de Liverpool, the Mexican department stores, are developing a
combination store chain with KMart Corporation.
The alliances have not only added more glitz to the Mexican shopping
experience - they are injecting more competition into the retailing sector
and reducing margins, prompting companies to pare down costs and look beyond
the Guadalajara-Mexico City-Monterrey axis for new business opportunities.
Expansion of the new joint-ventures is taking place under less than perfect
conditions, as the slow-down in economic growth and high interest rates have
put a break on the consumer credit boom of the early 1990s. As a result,
growth in consumer demand has been lower than expected. Cifra says its
sales, (excluding Wal-mart's share), which totalled Dollars 4.58bn in 1993,
have risen by only 4 per cent so far this year.
Cifra executives say they began preparing for the tougher competitive
environment five years ago - 'we knew the large US chains would come to
Mexico once Nafta was signed, so we took a hard look at how they run their
business. To survive, we had to become as competitive and efficient as the
largest US retailers.'
The first step was to cut operating and administrative costs. In his annual
report, Mr Henry Davis, Cifra's president, outlines some of the cutbacks:
'We no longer supply our executives with cars . . . subscriptions to
magazines have been restricted, and the executive dining rooms have been
closed. All breakfast, luncheon and dinner meetings have been replaced with
working sessions at our offices.'
In addition, Cifra invested Dollars 25m in computer equipment and systems
last year. The new, no-frills company ethos allowed Cifra to cut operating
and administrative costs from 22 per cent to 15 per cent of sales, a figure
which company executives say is comparable to the best-run US chains.
US companies have sought Mexican partners because of the latter's greater
knowledge of the local consumer market and suppliers.
In return, the US chains are contributing their greater experience in
computerised inventory control, wholesale distribution and their vast
network of US suppliers.
'We are greatly benefiting from our joint venture with Wal-Mart, a company
recognised worldwide as a leader in retail applications of information
technology,' says Mr Davis of Cifra.
'The joint-venture has allowed us to install well-proven systems and
programmes which Wal-Mart already has in operation. We are, therefore,
reducing our costs and eliminating the risk of failure.'
Cifra executives say they are also learning from Wal-Mart how to manage the
growth of their operations. They have plans to almost double the number of
stores in some 90 cities by 1997. This will require learning about the
wholesale side of the business and the establishment of distribution centres
equiped with computerised 'just-in-time' technology to reduce inventories
and transport costs.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (8): Business needs new transport systems -
Investment sought for infrastructure and services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few challenges can match the need to modernise Mexico's infrastructure in
roads, ports, railways, sanitation and telecommunications. The success of
Mexican exports and the survival of local manufacturers facing increased
foreign competition will depend in large measure on the improvement of these
services, which businessmen regard as costly, inadequate and inefficient.
Over the next 15 years, Mr Andres Conesa of Grupo ICA, Mexico's largest
construction firm, estimates the country will need to:
Build 60,000km of highways.
Lay 6,600km of railway track and reinforce 5,000 bridges.
Modernise 183 ports and put into operation three industrial ports on the
Pacific coast and three others on the Gulf of Mexico.
Establish an alternative airport system for Mexico City.
Duplicate the number of telephone lines.
Extend irrigation from 6m to 8m hectares.
Revamp 250 important dams and 2,100km of river-bed dikes.
Increase water supply and sewerage networks for 13m people.
'We estimate that Dollars 100bn will need to be invested - just in the next
six years,' Mr Conesa says.
Following the severe spending cuts of the 1980s, the Salinas administration
sought to revive investment in infrastructure in partnership with the
private sector. In addition to the privatisation of Telefonos de Mexico
(Telmex) in 1990, the government has extended private sector participation
to road building, inter-modal transport terminals, railway maintenance,
water treatment plants, ports and power generation projects.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the president-elect, promises to increase investment in
public infrastructure by 25 per cent during his first year of office, and to
set up an investment fund for infrastructure, financed in part from the
income of privatisations. The fund is expected to function as a guarantor
for projects, enabling the private sector to gain access to cheaper,
long-term project finance.
The dearth of affordable credit to match the long recovery costs typical of
infrastructure projects has proved a big disincentive to greater private
sector participation. At present, most Mexican banks draw the line at
10-year loans, while access to the international financial markets has been
restricted due to the lack of an investment grade for Mexican debt.
The financial constraints has been felt most acutely by the private sector
in the construction of toll roads, of which more than 5,800km have been
built since 1989 at a cost of Dollars 10bn. Expensive credit, cost
over-runs, and lower than expected traffic, caused in part by high tolls,
has depressed internal rate of return, with many toll road trusts having to
reschedule debt payments.
Nevertheless, Grupo ICA, which has built 12 toll roads, remains optimistic
about the future. The government has extended the life of concessions to
make up for lower-than-expected traffic, while some loans have been
restructured.
'We are also learning to cost projects more accurately and we are becoming
more sophisticated in tapping the capital markets,' Mr Guerrero concedes.
Mexican businessmen expect the Zedillo administration will extend the system
of private sector concessions to rail transport, even if the state retains
ownership of track. US and Canadian companies are reported to be interested
in joint-venture cargo operations if and when the liberalisation comes
about.
At present, less than two per cent of the government's investment budget is
devoted to this neglected mode of transport, and as a result, and the
state-owned network carries less than 13 per cent of overland cargo.
The World Bank says productivity at FNM remains less than two-thirds of
comparable US railway companies, despite the retrenchment of 30,000 of its
80,000 employees since 1992. Current terminal organisation, scheduling and
dispatch operations are so inadequate that less than 20 per cent of shipment
time is spent on route.
The privatisation of municipal services, such as the provision of drinking
water and the disposal of solid waste, are also opening new business
opportunities. Aguascalientes, Cancun, Ciudad Juarez, among other cities,
have given the private sector concessions to manage their water supplies.
GDM and Grupo ICA are also building Mexico's first private-sector
hydroelectric power plant on the River Fuerte, on the border between the
states of Sinaloa and Sonora. The joint-venture raised Dollars 250m in
12-year Eurobonds to finance the project, backed by leasehold guarantees
issued by the Mexican Electricity Board.
ICA, and its partners, are among those seeking to build a private
electricity plant in the city of Merida. After several false-starts, the
government is expected to give the go-ahead for construction early next
year.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (9): Reducing costs, boosting profits -
Multinational profile: Cementos Mexicanos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past three years, Cementos Mexicanos has gone from being a local
cement producer to becoming arguably Mexico's leading multinational company.
In 1992, it was responsible for Mexico's largest ever international
acquisition - the Dollars 1.85bn purchase in 1992 of Spain's Sanson and
Valenciana - and since then has acquired other significant cement operations
in South America and the US, and has raised more debt in the international
markets than any other Mexican business.
Earlier last month Cemex formally accepted its multinational status by
reorganising its Mexican operations. In what may be the first move of its
kind by a Mexican company, Cemex established a separate Mexico division with
its own chief executive and staff, which, like Cemex divisions in other
parts of the world, will report to company chairman Lorenzo Zambrano.
'This is third stage in the development of the modern Cemex' said Hector
Medina, who will manage Cemex Mexico. The first two stages of development -
acquiring dominant market share in Mexico and buying up cement companies
worldwide - have given Cemex total worldwide cement capacity of over 40m
tonnes, and a market value of about Dollars 8bn.
The new organisation will lead to some cost-cutting as Cemex merges its
three regional Mexican divisions into one headed by Mr Medina. With Mr
Medina taking day-to-day responsibility for the Mexican operations, the
reorganisation will free Mr Zambrano and Mr Gustavo Cabellero, the finance
director, to concentrate on the overall global strategy of the group.
Mr Medina is confident that Cemex Mexico will remain the centre of the
group's activities in coming years. Mexico suffers from an acute shortage of
housing and roads, power stations and other cement-intensive projects, and
demand for cement will grow by at least twice the annual increase in GDP
over the next five years.
Cemex already has about 63 per cent of Mexico's cement market, and plans to
invest in new production mainly to maintain this share, than to increase it
substantially. Such a strategy appears motivated partly by the company's
desire to avoid over-capacity and spark off a price war with Apasco, its
rival which is majority owned by Holderbank, the Swiss cement group.
Cemex's plans of maintaining its dominant market share in Mexico may be
threatened by Grupo Carso, Mexico's large conglomerate controlled by Mr
Carlos Slim.
Carso bought a small regional cement company plant earlier this year,
leading to speculation that it might seek to take on Cemex, either by
building new cement plants or by acquiring existing ones.
Mr Medina dismisses the threat from Mr Slim: 'The industry is in a very
competitive position,' he says. 'He would need a lot of money - of course,
he has it. But there are other investments more profitable and less risky.
Would a logical investor invest his money in such a well-positioned
industry? I doubt it.'
If Cemex can avoid a price war or greater competition in its home market,
then it will be in a strong position to expand internationally. The
company's Mexican operations generate about Dollars 900m a year in cash, of
which about Dollars 700m are taken up by debt-service and Mexican investment
obligations, according to Mr Caballero.
Mr Caballero says Cemex plans to use the spare cash to invest in high growth
areas outside Mexico, especially in Latin America, but not exclusively so.
As part of that strategy the company this year agreed to buy Vencemos,
Venezuela's largest cement company, Cementos Bayano, Panama's largest cement
company, and more cement plans in Texas. Cemex paid Dollars 1.85bn for
Sanson and Valenciana, giving it about 30 per cent of the Spanish cement
market.
Cemex believes that the world cement industry is consolidating around a few
global giants, and that international expansion is the only way it can
survive in the long term. But it also argues that it has been able to reduce
substantially costs and increase profits of the companies it has taken over.
With Cemex executives having worked on four acquisitions in as many years,
they are able to see were costs can be cut, says Mr Caballero.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (10): Puzzle for farmers - National
land-titling programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep in some of Mexico's most isolated and poorest regions a strange sight
can often be observed: a handful of well-qualified government technicians,
equipped with laptop computers, portable satellite dishes, plus prisms on a
tripod, can be seen calculating the precise geographical location of a small
piece of land of no obvious economic value. Surrounding them will be a group
of destitute farmers, trying to work out what they are doing.
The topographers - some 14,200 in total - are working on the world's most
ambitious land-titling programme. Employed by the government statistics,
information and geography institute, they hope to have calculated within the
next few years the exact geographical co-ordinates of the boundaries of some
4.6m individual plots of land - about 102m hectares - and 4.3m houses,
within the nation's 30,000 ejidos or communal farms.
The programme, known as Procede, began after the government changed Article
27 of the constitution over two years ago, giving for the first time members
of ejidos - known as ejidatarios - the legal right under certain conditions
to sell their plots, rent them out, form associations with agro-businesses,
or borrow money using their plots as collateral. The ejidos cover about half
of Mexico's national territory, and the 15m ejidatarios and their families
more than a sixth of the population.
The ejidatarios need land titles if the constitutional changes are to have
the desired impact, since at present it is often unclear who owns what land.
Without legally recognised land titles, they are not able to sell or rent
their land easily, or from associations, or borrow money, as permitted by
the law.
Once Procede is fully implemented, ejidatarios should have for the first
time secure and transferable property rights to their land and homes. While
not enough to transform the ailing fortunes of Mexico's agricultural sector,
the establishment of property rights is expected to encourage investment in
the countryside - uncertainty over ownership rights has make farmers
cautious about spending a lot of money improving their land - and promote
social peace, by reducing conflicts over land ownership.
'Procede is the instrument to make the changes to Article 27 effective,'
says Mr Carlos Jarque, the head of the government statistics institute who
is overseeing the technical implementation of the programme. 'Without the
titling, the constitutional changes will not have the intended impact of
improving the welfare of ejidatarios.'
Procede may, in addition, reduce the power of local political bosses by
making it difficult for them to take away land from farmers with whom they
are in conflict. In the past, local leaders have used the lack of clear
property rights, and the government's legal powers to redistribute land, as
a way of keeping control of farmers in the countryside.
The government technicians move into an ejido to measure land co-ordinates
only when the members decide in a assembly to incorporate into Procede, and
have agreed between themselves - in front of a special government magistrate
 -on where rough boundaries between plots lie.
If there is no such agreement, agrarian courts are called into to settle the
disputes. Since the courts may take years to resolve a case, which delays
the hand-out of titles for everyone, there is a powerful incentive for the
ejidatarios to reach agreement - and, so far, most have.
Under one method of measurement, the topologists calculate the co-ordinates
of the outer boundary of the ejido by standing on several points of it and
sending signals to an overhead satellite, and taking from the satellite a
reading of the boundary's geographical co-ordinates.
A less accurate but faster method involves taking aerial photograph of
ejidos, and then asking ejido members to mark the boundaries between their
own plots, homes, and communal lands. A scanner reads the marked lines
between plots, and records co-ordinates on a computer disk.
Data gathered from both schemes is put into a digital computerised national
agrarian register which will eventually include land boundaries of all
30,000 ejidos, plus 4.6m individual plots and 4.3m homes within them.
Individual titles for plots and homes are printed from the digital agrarian
register, which has information not just on the location of the ejidos, but
what it is grown there.
Mr Jarque says that the programme is unprecedented in its scope and
precision, with no other country having anything as big as this computerised
registration project - 'it's a pioneering programme for its size,
complexity, and for the use of advanced technology,' he says.
Nevertheless, Procede has been criticised by some for being unnecessarily
complex and long-winded, and for taking too long to complete. So far, about
30 per cent of ejidos have had the boundaries of their plots measured, and
members of 15 per cent of ejidos have received their titles - less than the
government had hoped for this stage. The programme may not be completed
until near the end of the decade.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (7): Foreign banking competition
intensifies - Customer service in domestic banks has improved significantly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's richest businessmen may now be regretting the Dollars 12.4bn they
paid for the country's 18 formerly state-owned banks. In the two to three
years since the banks were privatised, the market value of most has fallen
in real terms, with profits and asset quality affected by the lower than
expected economic growth, and higher than expected interest rates.
The economic climate appears to be improving - growth is picking up and
loan-default rates have stabilised - but the banks now face the challenge of
increased foreign and domestic competition.
In October, the government authorised foreigners to open up five financial
groups, 18 banks, 16 brokerages, and 12 insurance companies, to compete
alongside 54 domestic institutions, 36 of which have been set up since the
privatisations.
The recent problems in the financial sector have been caused mainly by the
generous lending in the early 1990s and subsequent deterioration in Mexico's
economy.
Bank lending increased in the early 1990s by more than 20 times the growth
in GDP as the government deregulated the financial sector and interest rates
fell; once the economy deteriorated, and interest rates rose, many companies
which had over-borrowed were unable to meet their interest payments and
defaulted on their loans.
The ratio of past-due loans to total loans has grown from 4.12 per cent in
1991 to 8.3 per cent at the end of September. Banks have been forced to put
aside provisions for the non-performing loans, reducing their profits. The
poor quality of their credit has required them to maintain high margins on
lending to cover for the chance of default, putting further pressure on
Mexican companies.
Moody's, the rating agency, in a recent report, put most of the blame of the
current situation on the banks' poor information systems and weak
management.
'The system's ability to adjust to a liberalised banking environment has
been hindered by a lack of experienced managers, poor borrower disclosure, a
lack of strong credit culture, the paucity of credit bureaux and close links
with concentrated industrial sectors,' concluded the rating agency.
The downturn in the sector has co-incided with two banking scandals that
have highlighted the government's inadequate financial regulation. This year
the finance ministry took over Grupo Financiero Havre - an insurance,
leasing and brokerage company - and Grupo Financiero Cremi-Union, one of
Mexico's largest banks. The top managers of Havre and Union are both accused
of illegally channelling loans to their own business interests.
The finance ministry has subsequently prepared new regulations that will
require auditors and external directors to play a more active role in
scrutinising operations of their companies, and encourage the formation of
institutions to rate the credit worthiness of domestic banks.
New rules forcing banks to assess their exposure to market-risks - such as
interest rates or devaluation - have also been announced. At the same time,
largely in response to increasing competition in the sector, Mexican banks
have sought to improve efficiency and the ability to control credit risks by
shedding workers, and investing in new computer systems. Client service in
domestic banks has also improved significantly, with average waiting lines
at most counters reduced significantly.
GF Bancomer, Mexico's second largest financial institution, has, for
example, employed UK consultants, Proudfoot, to re-engineer the way its
commercial bank goes about its business.
Mr Hector Rangel, deputy chief executive, says the total restructuring of
operations has enabled it to cut personnel - mainly among middle management
 -by 30 per cent without sacrificing customer services. Once redundancy
payments have been made, GF Bancomer expects costs to fall sharply.
Foreign institutions are meanwhile expected to put additional competitive
pressure on domestic financial groups, although given the initial limits on
their capitalisation, the impact of their presence in Mexico will only be
felt over the long-term. Initially, foreigners will account for 6.25 per
cent of the banking sector's market capitalisation  - the legal ceiling for
1994 is 8 per cent - and 10 per cent of the brokerage's market
capitalisation.
Under the opening, foreign brokerages will for the first time be able to
execute orders in the stock market for foreign clients, and thus will no
longer having to pay commissions to Mexican houses. This may eventually
contribute to a lowering of overall commissions, as Mexicans compete harder
to keep foreign business.
In the banking sector, foreigners are expected to concentrate on capital
markets activities, and on corporate finance for blue-chip corporate
companies, where competition is already intense. However, analysts expect
the foreign presence in the blue-chip corporate segment of the banking
market to have a trickle-down effect, as Mexican banks respond by increasing
lending to less well-known medium and small-sized companies, where margins
are higher, and their competitive advantages greater.
'The broadening and deepening of Mexico's domestic money and capital markets
will, over time, lead to a more efficient allocation of credit across the
board and reduction in the cost of capital,' says Roberto Mendoza,
vice-chairman of JP Morgan, one of five foreign institutions to have been
granted approval to set up a financial group.
'As competition grows, participants in the market will be forced to play to
their strengths,' he says.
The large number of foreign institutions - and the tens of millions of
dollars that each will be investing in Mexico - has raised questions about
whether all of them will prosper. Much will depend on the economic growth.
But drawing lessons from the financial institutions that prospered after
London's Big Bang, Mr Mendoza says that those which already do a lot of
business with Mexico will be best-placed to succeed.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (6): The economy is remarkably resilient -
A decade of economic restructuring is bearing fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican economy has shown impressive resilience during a jittery
election year which began with a peasant rebellion in Chiapas, was followed
by the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential
candidate, in March, continued with two damaging banking scandals and a
heightened perception of the menace posed by Mexico's drug barons, who may
have had a hand in the murder of the PRI secretary-general, Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, in September.
It has taken considerable skill to neutralise such sustained blows to
domestic and international confidence in Mexico's economic future.
The most visible cost to the economy has been the depletion of the country's
international reserves, which dropped from Dollars 23.02bn in October 1993
to Dollars 17.24bn last month. Much of the fall took place during the
Central Bank's attempts to defend the peso, following Mr Colosio's death.
Despite political instability, Mexico has been able to generate some
positive economic results. Gross domestic product is expected to grow by
almost three per cent this year, its best performance since 1991.
For the third year in a row there will be no fiscal deficit. Inflation in
1994 is expected to be contained below seven per cent, while an economic
pact signed between government, labour and employers in September has set an
inflation target of four per cent for 1995.
The goal may be too ambitious, but the trend of lower inflation is expected
to be maintained.
By setting such a target, the authorities have committed themselves to
continued fiscal discipline and maintaining a strong peso. Furthermore, wage
growth will be restricted to four per cent, plus productivity bonuses.
The economic restructuring that caused so much pain during the past decade
appears to be finally bearing fruit. Productivity in the manufacturing
sector is rising by about 10 per cent a year, according to government
figures, although the gains have not been uniform. The steel, cement and
capital goods sectors have adapted best to the competitive stress of a more
open trading regime, while many companies in the pulp and paper, textile and
footwear industries have gone under.
'The liberalisation of the economy has attracted much new investment, but it
has also destroyed a great deal of old capital stock,' says Mr Miguel
Mancera, governor of Mexico's newly-independent Central Bank. He believes
the shake-out of inefficient manufacturers has run its course, and that the
worst-affected sectors, such as textiles, are now back on their feet.
All this is contributing to a strong increase in manufacturing exports,
which in the first half of 1994 jumped by 20.9 per cent, and partly explains
the modest recovery in economic growth. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the
president-elect, will inherit a balanced budget, single digit inflation and
a largely deregulated economy which many analysts believe is poised to
return to a period of stable and sustained growth.
As a former central banker and budget minister, Mr Zedillo is unlikely to
change the economic course set by the Salinas administration. But like all
new presidents, he will want to put his personal mark on economic policy.
Over the next six years, he has pledged to boost the country's lacklustre
economic growth, provide around 1m new jobs a year, improve the country's
highly unequal distribution of wealth, while maintaining low inflation and
keeping public finances in order.
Mr Zedillo has also pledged to increase public spending on infrastructure
projects by 25 per cent during his first year in office, in a tacit
admission that inefficiencies in the state-owned railways, electricity and
oil sectors have become big impediments to faster economic growth.
In an accelerating economy, however, many economists worry that imports
could grow faster than exports, widening a current account deficit that is
expected to reach Dollars 27bn in 1994, about seven per cent of GDP.
'The current account deficit is unsustainable,' says an Mr Rogelio Ramirez
de la O at the economic consultancy, Ecanal. 'It is being financed by
largely speculative foreign capital inflows which are both volatile and
sensitive to bad news. And it locks the government into maintaining high
real interest rates, which in turn puts a break on growth.'
At present, Mexico's foreign reserves (backed by a Dollars 6.7bn credit line
from the US and Canada and additional support from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank), plus net capital inflows of some Dollars
23.5bn, are sufficient to cover Mexico's external financing gap and deter
speculation against the peso.
But some economists caution against Mexico's over-dependence on foreign
capital to finance the trade gap - 'Mexico has little control over this kind
of capital inflows,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, a consultant with Macro
Assesoria Economica.
'It depends on exogenous factors, such as US interest rates and how other
world stock markets are performing, rather than the yields on Mexican
treasury bills and the performance of the Mexican bourse.'
If political uncertainty or a widening trade gap led portfolio investors to
bale out of Mexico, the resulting pressure on the peso and interest rates
could disrupt Mr Zedillo's best-laid economic plans.
The overriding goal of the Salinas administration, which Mr Zedillo promises
to follow, has been to curb inflation to levels that approximate those in
the industrialised world. That, and a commitment to a stable exchange rate,
has severely restricted the government's room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic
policy.
The Pacto (agreement) signed in September left the daily slippage of the
peso fluctuation band unchanged, which will place an upper limit of about
five per cent on the peso's depreciation during 1995.
The incoming administration appears to have ruled out a devaluation of the
currency - which some economists consider long overdue - to stimulate
exports.
'The problem of exports will not be solved by devaluing the exchange rate,'
said Mr Zedillo, in a recent interview with El Economista, a Mexican
financial daily.
'A devaluation would not compensate for the lack of productivity,
competitiveness and adequate strategies to penetrate export markets.'
There is also the fear that a devaluation would rekindle inflation. But the
commitment to a strong peso has also kept domestic interest rates high,
leading businessmen to complain that the prohibitive cost of credit is
choking growth. They say they compete with US manufacturers when prime
lending rates are at least eight percentage points higher than those in the
US.
Mr Mancera at the Central Bank appears unwilling to use interest rates as a
policy instrument to stimulate growth.
'Interest rates reflect the price of capital and the general perception that
inflation in Mexico is not yet fully under control,' he says.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (4): Tricky balancing act - Ernesto Zedillo
prepares to name his cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When asked if he ever thought about becoming president of Mexico as a young
man, Mr Ernesto Zedillo breaks into a spontaneous laughter and says only
fools have such plans.
Enormously hard-working and ambitious, Mr Zedillo always sought to avoid the
impression that his sights were set on the presidential office. In his five
years in the cabinet - first as budget minister and then as education
minister - he avoided the limelight, built few alliances inside the ruling
party, and earned a reputation for being a political loner.
He won the ruling party's nomination largely by default. After the
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former presidential candidate
whose electoral campaign he managed, he was practically the only member of
President Salinas's inner circle who was eligible for office - most of the
others were disqualified by a constitutional article which prevents sitting
cabinet ministers from running for presidential office six months before the
election.
Despite his political inexperience, Mr Zedillo proved an effective, if
uninspiring, candidate. He smoothed over divisions in the PRI that followed
by his nomination by appointing key figures from different sectors of the
party to campaign positions. He won some public support by stressing his
poor roots - he is the son of an electrician and a nurse - and his
administrative experience in government.
He also set out in detail the policies he would follow were he elected. He
used to the full advantage - and with no apparent shame - the PRI's huge
electoral machinery, spending many times more money than opposition parties.
Despite the extravagance of his campaign, Mr Zedillo's most striking
electoral pledge was his promise for far-reaching democratic and legal
reform. In a key-note speech, Mr Zedillo committed his government to a
fundamental reform of the PRI, of the country's judicial and legal system,
of the relationship between federal and state government, of the role of
Congress, and of the federal electoral institute.
Mr Zedillo has already set in motion the reform of the PRI and he has agreed
in principle to give the Federal Electoral Institute full independence of
the government. Campaign officials are working on a comprehensive overhaul
of the judiciary and police, to make them more professional, and promote
honesty and independence from the executive.
But the hard part has still to come. Many are sceptical that Mr Zedillo will
be able to push through political and legal reforms on such a sweeping
scale. Others are worried that if he does, there could be fierce resistance
from his own party, and a loss of presidential power and increase in
political instability.
The first test of Mr Zedillo's political abilities will come with the naming
of his cabinet. He will have the difficult task of balancing political
interests in the ruling party, rewarding his closest and most loyal
colleagues, and putting the most capable people in the right slots. The
inner circle of Mr Zedillo's associates destined for senior positions are
all trained economists, reflecting Mr Zedillo's background.
Key figures are said to be Mr Jaime Serra Puche, 43, trade minister and a
colleague from their days at Yale University; Mr Guillermo Ortiz, 46, deputy
finance minister, and another personal friend; Mr Esteban Moctezuma, a
youthful 40-year-old who worked with the president-elect in the education
and budget ministries and was his campaign strategist in the election; Mr
Luis Tellez, 36, former agriculture under-minister and now Mr Zedillo's main
adviser on government policy.
Mr Serra or Mr Ortiz are expected to become finance minister, with the one
losing out going to another senior cabinet position, such as communication.
Mr Moctezuma has little political experience, but is viewed by some as a
candidate for the development ministry, education, or possibly for the
powerful interior ministry. Mr Tellez may become chief of advisers, or go to
trade or agriculture ministries.
The big question mark is over the political positions, especially the
interior ministry. There are few old-style politicians with close ties to Mr
Zedillo, but some will have to be appointed. Apart from Mr Ignacio Pichardo,
head of the PRI, Mr Zedillo may consider giving political slots to Mr
Arsenio Farrell, the former labour minister; and one of the governors of the
states of Mexico, Aguascalientes, and Veracruz.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance ministry and one-time rival of Mr Zedillo, has
made no secret of his desire to spend more time with his family. But he is
likely to be offered a post, and may come under pressure to accept Pemex,
the state oil company, the labour ministry, or perhaps the foreign ministry.
Apart from Mr Pichardo, other PRI officials expected to win cabinet-rank
jobs are Mr Jose Angel Gurria, the multi-lingual former debt negotiator who
is considered a possibility for the foreign ministry or transport ministry;
Mr Oscar Espinosa, former head of the state development bank. Mr Humberto
Mira Lora may be rewarded for doing a good job as PRI's electoral chief.
Mr Zedillo is also close to some relatively unknown mid-level bureaucrats -
Mr Rogelio Gasca Neri, deputy minister of transport; Mr Pascual Garcia,
competition commissioner; Mr Juan Diaz Canedo, a former banker; Antonio
Meza, former private secretary. One or two may make it to the cabinet, and
others will become under-ministers or advisers in the office of the
president.
At least two women are expected to be appointed. Despite run-ins with
Zedillo, the front-runner in this group is Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the
new secretary-general of the PRI. One opposition or no-PRI figure is likely
to be named to the cabinet - perhaps to the attorney-general's office, but
more probably to a lesser position. The nomination of a businessman might
send a positive signal to the private sector - Mr Gilberto Borja of ICA,
Mexico's largest private company, is mentioned as a leading candidate.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (3): An uneven playing field - Elections
were far from fair, claim angry opposition parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It came as a rude shock to the Mexican opposition that despite the cleanest
elections in the country's history and record voter turnout, they were still
far from dislodging the PRI's tenacious grip on power.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the debate following the August 21
contest has focused on the uneven playing field which gave the ruling party
an unbeatable advantage. The PRI's electoral machine far outspent its rivals
thanks to high campaign expenditure ceilings (Dollars 275m per party) set by
the government and the generous contributions of private businessmen to the
PRI's war chest.
Television and radio coverage of the elections was openly biased in favour
of the ruling party, to which private media companies owe their broadcasting
licenses. And in the timeless Mexican tradition, government officials, from
state governors down to the caciques (local bosses) of the smallest village,
continued to help PRI candidates, albeit with more discretion than in the
past.
As a result, both the right-of-centre Partido de Accion Nacional (PAN) and
the leftist Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD) are refusing to
endorse the victory of the PRI presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto Zedillo as
fully legitimate. The PRD is challenging the results of 55 per cent of all
voting booths, claiming massive fraud.
While the PRD's complaints lack credibility - monitoring on election day was
tight - the opposition has nevertheless learned to exploit its underdog
image to maximum advantage. And the emerging consensus, from opposition
parties to civic action groups to the independent councillors who sit on the
Federal Electoral Institute, is that elections in Mexico may now be free,
but they remain far from fair.
Armed with 15m votes, the opposition is pressing for deeper political
reforms. The PRI, they say, must become a genuinely independent party rather
than the state's electoral arm. Realistic limits must be placed on the
expenditure of political parties during election campaigns, and these must
be scrutinised by independent auditors. The media should be more closely
monitored for political bias.
If Mr Zedillo's campaign pledges are to be believed, the government is
willing to listen. The first political reform likely to be negotiated by the
incoming administration would give greater autonomy to the Federal Electoral
Institute, which organises and oversees elections. At present, the institute
is headed by the interior minister. Six independent 'citizen councillors'
have a voting majority on the governing board, but the interior minister is
the only member of the council who can call board meetings, and he sets the
agenda, and appoints all the executive officials.
'If the government is serious about democracy,' says Mr Santiago Creel, one
of the citizen councillors on the governing board, 'it should withdraw from
the Federal Electoral Institute. The institute must become a truly
independent fourth estate.'
Mr Creel says the six citizen councillors will resign if their demands are
not met. He has received death threats for his outspoken views - once at
gun-point outside his house - in an unpleasant reminder of the powerful
vested interest aligned against further political reforms.
The onslaught against government, however, has thus far distracted
opposition parties from taking a hard look at their own failings.
Despite tripling its votes in the 1994 elections, the PAN's presidential
nominee, Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, has been widely criticised for
failing to capitalise on his surge in popularity following Mexico's
first-ever televised debate between presidential candidates in June.
After the debate, his campaign appeared to fizzle out. He was the runner-up
on election night, polling about 27 per cent of the vote.
'We have achieved respectability, but we are not yet regarded as a credible
alternative to the ruling party,' admits Mr Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, the
PAN secretary-general.
More worrying still is the fact that the PAN lost heavily in the three
states were it holds state governorships. The PAN's greatest challenge is
how to grow into a party commensurate with the 9.2m votes it won in August.
The PRD's problems are more serious. The party's internal schisms - between
those who favour a nationwide dialogue to win incremental political reforms
and those who advocate a complete break with the 'system' - have become
deeper and more bitter since being relegated to third place in the 1994
presidential contest. The PRD's defeat came as a particularly heavy blow to
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate who many believe was
robbed of victory during the much-disputed 1988 elections.
Some PRD activists admit they failed to read the cautious mood among the
electorate in a year which saw a peasant rebellion in Chiapas and the
assassination of the PRI's presidential nominee.
Above all, they did not perceive the growing popular support for results of
President Salinas' economic reforms - 'we were fighting yesterday's
battles,' says Congressman Adolfo Aguilar, who was Mr Cardenas' campaign
spokesman during the elections.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (5): A degree of scepticism - A look at
radical reform plans for the PRI - the Institutional Revolutionary Party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'As president of all Mexicans, I am determined not to interfere, in any way
at all, in the process of selection of candidates of the PRI, of all types,
from municipal presidents to presidents of the republic.'
With these words, Mr Ernesto Zedillo proclaimed his intention to push for
the most radical reform of the Institutional Revolutionary Party since its
foundation 65 years ago.
The reform, in theory, would make the PRI independent of the president and
the government of the day. It would remove the president's power to pick PRI
candidates for elective office (the so-called dedazo) and require the PRI to
finance itself independently of the government.
The pressure for change comes from both within and outside the PRI.
Opposition parties and many observers contest that the reform of the PRI is
indispensable for democratic change in the country. Within the PRI, many
officials grudgingly accept that reform is necessary for the legitimisation
of the political system; others, frustrated by presidential control of their
party, want a greater say in shaping government policy and in picking
candidates.
Nevertheless, there is some scepticism that the internal reforms will be
implemented as described. Stiff opposition to financial reform is likely to
come from those who depend on the party for a living, and from those who
fear that the PRI will find it more difficult to win elections when
competing on a level playing field with the opposition.
Mr Zedillo himself may reconsider his pledge not to interfere in the affairs
of the party if the PRI picks candidates opposed to his policies, or if the
party tears itself apart as different factions fight over the best posts.
Many observers recall that President Salinas quickly dropped his commitment
to have internal primaries after his favoured candidate for the governor of
the state of Colima was defeated in a primary by a local notary. But while a
retreat is possible, the timetable for reform has been set, and a reversal
would be politically costly. PRI leaders have agreed to hold a National
Assembly by the middle of next year, which is intended to put into statute
books any reforms agreed on.
Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, the PRI official in charge of internal reform, says
without hesitation that most of the changes will be implemented in time for
the 1997 Congressional elections.
In a sign of its seriousness about reform, the PRI has in fact already
changed the way it selects its candidates. The candidate for governor of
Jalisco was to be chosen in a secret ballot of around 2,000 delegates in a
convention; in preceding weeks, the PRI picked candidates for local
elections in the states of Tlaxcala, San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato through
primaries or conventions. Party officials describe the results so far as a
big success. The danger remains that conventions or primaries will be
dominated by old-style local party bosses, who will (legitimately or not) be
able to ensure the election of their own supporters to important posts.
Officials say they will seek to prevent the manipulation of the selection
process by screening out - at the national level - any undesirable
candidates and by setting up a commission to oversee internal elections, but
even they accept such precautions may not be enough.
Instead, many PRI officials say the process will only work in the long run
if the structure of the party is changed so that grass roots activists are
given more power; and union, peasant and local political leaders, less -
'the way to solve the problem of (dominant local leaders) is to increase the
presence of the territorial sector of the party,' says one official. Such a
process will likely be opposed by traditional corporatist sectors, creating
conditions for a possible showdown.
The reform of the finances of the party may meet even more resistance, with
many faring that a radical reduction in the PRI's financial resources will
threaten its long-term hold on power. Perhaps for this reason, Mr Zedillo
has been much more vague on details of financial reform than on the change
in the way of selecting candidates.
No-one knows for sure what the annual running expenses of the party are  -
but in all 32 states there are scores of PRI offices, and hundreds if not
thousands of PRI employers. Mr Reyes Heroles says the payroll has been cut
by 70 per cent since the election; but he hints that such reductions only
touch the surface of what needs to be done. The opposition has small
fraction of such resources at its disposal.
Mr Santiago Creel, the most prominent citizen magistrate of the Federal
Electoral Institute, suggests that one way to separate the PRI and the
government would be to give the opposition control of the Congressional
Committee that scrutinises public finances, of the office of the
Comptroller-General, and to require continuous auditing of the finances of
all political parties. The PRI has yet to respond to such an initiative; but
if it is serious about reform, these measures and others may be necessary.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (1): Zedillo faces formidable obstacles -
An economist with limited political experience, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's
president-elect, will assume power next month amid a highly volatile
economic and political climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo becomes president of Mexico on December 1 with a daunting
task ahead of him. Before his six-year presidential term is up, he has
promised to deliver strong, sustainable economic growth, provide a million
jobs a year and reduce the country's sharp inequalities in income. On
political issues, he has pledged to overhaul the judicial and legal system,
and implement sweeping reforms to turn Mexico into a modern democratic
state.
In the best of times, such promises would be hard to keep. The proposed
democratic and political changes would undo a political culture of
quasi-authoritarian rule that is still the norm in much of the country, and
has kept the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party - the PRI  - in
power for 65 consecutive years. Even if Mr Zedillo is sincere in his call
for democratic change, he is bound to meet resistance.
In view of the still formidable obstacles to greater industrial
competitiveness, the fulfilment of Mr Zedillo's stated economic goals is
unlikely to be much easier. Mexico's poor educational system, inadequate
infrastructure, lack of an entrepreneurial culture and low savings rate set
it apart from many of the Asian tigers that have grown so rapidly over the
past 20 years.
To make matters tougher, Mr Zedillo assumes power in a highly volatile
economic and political climate. The peasant rebellion in Chiapas over the
New Year, the recent assassinations of leading political figures and the
increasing assertiveness of drug cartels, have worried investors.
Many wonder whether the old corporatist structure that kept Mexico stable
for 65 years is breaking down. In recent months, the exchange rate has come
under pressure, interest rates have been forced up to around 7 per cent in
real terms, and many sectors of the economy have suffered from a credit
crunch.
Despite such worries, there are grounds for guarded optimism. Mr Zedillo's
policy proposals appear to address the right issues. He and the Ivy-league
trained technocrats that surround him seem convinced that the difficulties
Mexico now faces are proof that economic and political reform of the past
decade needs to be speeded up, not slowed down, and that the modernisation
of the state must continue.
For Mr Zedillo and his advisers such modernisation appears to mean reforming
the country's political and social institutions, and strengthening the rule
of the law.
Whereas President Salinas used the PRI as a vehicle to exercise power,
dismissed more than half the country's state governors, and delayed judicial
reform until it was too late, Mr Zedillo has promised to make the PRI
independent of the government, devolve federal powers to state authority,
and give independence to the judiciary.
By opening new channels for political participation, these reforms - if they
are carried out - may in the long run contribute to the stability of the
country. But they will also deprive the president and his allies in the
ruling party of many of the traditional mechanisms of political control.
They could provoke a power battle between different interests groups in the
country, as they simultaneously resist and seek to take advantage of the
changes under way.
Mr Zedillo has already begun one aspect of the reform of the PRI, so far
complying with his promise not to insist on picking the party's candidates
for elective office and to promote a more democratic selection-process. Such
a reform - if stuck to - may strengthen the PRI at a local level, and make
government leaders more responsive to the party rank and file than in the
past.
Internal democracy is expected to curtail presidential power, however, and
make party members less loyal to the sitting president and his policies than
in the past. Once he assumes office, Mr Zedillo is likely to announce a
series of far-reaching constitutional changes to reform the legal and
judicial system.
While the details are still under wraps, Mr Zedillo is expected to change
the make-up of the Supreme Court and give it more independence; create a
civil service for the judiciary to promote efficiency and integrity; and
perhaps enable judicial decisions to apply to laws in general, rather than
just to individual cases as is now the case. Again, presidential power would
be reduced.
The president-elect has further promised an accord with the opposition on
political liberalisation. Given the PRI's convincing win in the August
election, Mr Zedillo is expected to be willing to make the Federal Electoral
Institute fully independent of the executive. But in view of the
extravagance of Mr Zedillo's electoral campaign, there is much greater
uncertainly whether he will push through laws that make competition between
different political parties more fair, and ensure the media play a more
balanced, objective role in the political system.
The president's ability to marshal support for his reforms - and contain the
political consequences - will depend in part on the performance of the
economy.
It is probably no accident that President Salinas's control of the political
situation began to slip when the economy was facing its greatest
difficulties: gross domestic product shrank in the final two quarters of
last year, and expanded by a modest 0.5 per cent in the first quarter this
year.
Fortunately for Mr Zedillo, a strong economic recovery already appears under
way, with growth in the second half of this year predicted at 4 per cent.
At the same time, inflation is likely to fall below 6 per cent this year;
the budget will probably be in balance; and net debt is a less than a
quarter of GDP. More importantly, productivity has grown rapidly in recent
years, as companies have restructured and invested heavily in new machinery.
Nevertheless, the large current account deficit - expected to be about
Dollars 28bn - makes continued economic recovery heavily dependent on
capital inflows, which partly depends on the international context.
Mr Zedillo will have to balance the demands of foreign investors for an
austere budget and orthodox economic policy and pressures within Mexico to
tackle mounting social problems and improve infrastructure through greater
spending. If the political situation does not improve, he may have to choose
between maintaining high real interest rates or adjusting exchange rate
policy.
With Mexican businesses expected to come under increasing competitive
pressure as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Zedillo
will certainly have to speed up the pace of micro economic reform.
Deregulation is likely to be intensified at the state level and sectors such
as railways will be opened up to greater private investment. Mr Zedillo will
increase spending on training and education and probably introduce some
fiscal incentives to encourage savings.
Such reforms will help boost productivity and competitiveness - and raise
real wages. But they are unlikely to do much in the short term to help the
plight of the 14m Mexicans under the official poverty line. Most of these
live in the countryside, have little education, and will find it hard to
integrate into the modern economy Mexico hopes to attain.
If economic reform continues to accentuate regional and social income
disparities - between 1989 and 1992 the share of income of the poorest 40
per cent of Mexicans fell from 12.9 per cent to 12.7 per cent, while the
share of richest 30 per cent increased from 65 per cent to 65.6 per cent -
political sustainability of the reform programme could be in doubt.
Mr Zedillo is a professional economist with limited political experience.
There are some questions whether he will be able to manage this complex
economic and political environment. The success of his efforts will
determine in large part whether Mexico can make the jump from the developing
to developed world before the end of the decade.

FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey tussle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Abbey National was buffeted by two-way trade following an upbeat
presentation on current trading.
The one-time building society said its share of the national mortgage market
was back up to 10 per cent and it had widened its retail margins. Mr Mark
Eady of NatWest Securities put the positive view that 'the gain in market
share has not been achieved at the expense of margins'.
However, bearish Credit Lyonnais Laing drew clients' attention to the
imminent figures from Royal Bank of Scotland and its Direct Line insurance
subsidiary. The house said Direct Line had flagged its move into the
mortgage arena, where it was offering loans of 7.1 per cent against Abbey's
8.1 per cent, and into the banking market. Abbey shares were steady at 412p,
while RBoS's were also firm, at 452p.
Mobile communications group Vodafone lost 2 at 204p following interim
results on the right side of brokers' estimates. But it was the near 20 per
cent jump to 1.64p in the interim dividend that provided the shares with
most underpinning. Most houses had been expecting a payout of 1.5p.
Interim results from glassmaker Pilkington were modestly better than
expected but the company's message for the full year was mixed. The shares
dipped 2 to 183p.
Not all securities houses edged up their profit estimates for 1994-95. Some
houses see Pilkington's premium p/e as a sell factor, others are more
confident of the longer term.
Concern over margins in the music division at Thorn EMI hit the group's
shares as it reported favourable interim figures. The stock dropped 24 to
973p. Sentiment was hit further by unconfirmed reports that UBS had
downgraded but the general tone was positive. Hoare Govett raised its
full-year forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 411m.
Granada relinquished 10 to 516p after it emerged that its television
subsidiary may face a fine for repeated violations of independent television
rules on products in programmes.
The unexpected break-down of merger talks between metals groups Johnson
Matthey and Cookson Group left Johnson 9 lower at 565p but added 2 to the
Cookson share price at 247p.
Fears that Northern Foods will have to make provisions of around Pounds 40m
at the end of the second half for restructuring and news of disappointing
interim figures sent the shares down 8 to 204p.
The meeting with analysts was also particularly gloomy. Brokers downgraded
full-year expectations by about Pounds 15m to around Pounds 120m.
Nervous trading in Tate &amp; Lyle, which reports first-half figures today, left
the shares 8 lighter at 439p.
Computer software group ACT shed a penny to 102 1/2 p following news of a
heavy share buy-back programme. It purchased almost 5 per cent of its equity
 -9m shares - at 103p. Turnover was 15m.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome gained as analysts became increasingly
enthusiastic following last weekend's positive Aids conference.
Securities house Robert Fleming was said to have issued a buy recommendation
and Japanese investment house Nikko Securities took investors to the
company's research centre. The shares moved ahead 6 to 681p.
Paper group Bowater rose 7 to 470p as Hoare Govett held a meeting with the
company.
Tightly traded merchant bank Schroders climbed 13 to 1428p as one house
crossed a block of shares at above the prevailing market price.
Stockbroker Brewin Dolphin weakened 13 to 110p. Interim figures from stock
dealer ShareLink expected today are forecast to disappoint. The latter fell
4 to 183p.
Chemicals leader Courtaulds shed 5 to 440p ahead of interim figures due
today. The forecast range is between Pounds 75m and Pounds 87m and analysts
expect a squeeze on margins but hope for some rays of hope in current
trading.
McLeod Russell moved forward 10 to 117p on well received final figures and
an encouraging statement.
A clutch of recent brokers' recommendations continued to boost MFI
Furniture. The shares gained a further 3 1/2 at 141 1/2 p. Also in demand
was high street retailing group Lloyds Chemists, ahead of tomorrow's annual
meeting. The shares put on 5 at 313p.
The poor market trend halted the recent advance in Yorkshire Water, which
reports interim figures today.
The shares finished 9 lower at 540p. NatWest Securities remains positive on
the stock and recommended that investors add to current holdings as 'these
results should underline how management is continuing to unravel the cost
base'. But it also warned that 'dividend policy is unlikely to be headline
grabbing'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television and video company Carlton Communications maintained its strong
market outperformance as some analysts took a close look at the latest data
for video sales.
Statistics in the trade press reveal that fourth-quarter sales of
pre-recorded films and programmes in the US rocketed from Dollars 177m in
1988 to Dollars 520.5m last year.
Carlton has the manufacturing and distribution rights for Disney and Warner
which last year accounted for 40 per cent of sales and will this year take
in sales of Snow White.
The forecast for this year's pre-Christmas sales is Dollars 934m, almost
double the 1993 figure. Carlton's slice of the cake might be reduced because
of competition from Jurassic Park, distributed by Rank, but it is a larger
cake.
Carlton shares have outperformed the broad market by 16 per cent over the
past year and 4 per cent over the past month. Yesterday the shares were
relatively strong against the market, closing only 5 off at 891p. Rank shed
5 to 412p.

FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong debut for TeleWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable television operator TeleWest made a storming stock market debut,
closing 3 1/2 ahead of the 182p flotation price in levels of activity that
came close to heart stopping for an offering of just 216m shares.
Turnover of 59m was nearly six times the level of volume in BTR, the most
actively traded Footsie stock. Kleinwort Benson Securities, joint broker to
the issue, was said to be responsible for around half of yesterday's trade.
The driving force behind the bumper trading was thought to be interaction
between the London and New York tranches of the issue, plus a certain amount
of switching with BT, which fell 9 to 379p.

FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie dips below 3,100 after Wall
Street slide - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market, like its European counterparts, could not ignore the
impact of Monday night's 46-point retreat by Wall Street and once again
dropped through the 3,100 level on the FT-SE 100 scale.
Sentiment across Europe took another hard knock in the afternoon, when the
US stock market started under renewed pressure which saw the Dow Average
slide more than 20 points shortly after the opening. The Dow later rallied
to show a fall of only some 10 points, before embarking on a fresh retreat
an hour after London closed.
There was no real respite for the FT-SE 100 Index which, in spite of
numerous attempts to rally, finished a net 42.3 off at 3,078.7, only a
whisker above the day's low of 3,078.6. Over the past two sessions the index
has fallen 52.3 points, or 1.7 per cent.
There was evidence of some good support for the second-liners, but this was
quickly overwhelmed, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ending the session 24.2
lower at 3,545.3.
There were, however, some encouraging features in London. The gilt-edged
sector was never anything but a firm market and closed at the day's best
levels, mirroring similarly strong performances by bonds and bunds across
the globe.
The market debut of TeleWest, the UK's first cable television flotation, was
an unqualified success, with the shares, seen as tightly priced by telecoms
specialists, opening at a 5 per cent premium and attracting sufficient
international demand to close comfortably above the issue price. Turnover in
Tele-West reached a short 59m shares, accounting for around 9 per cent of
overall market turnover.
This came out at 664.8m shares, compared with Monday's 487.4m. Non-Footsie
stocks accounted for 65 per cent of the total. The Stock Exchange revealed
that customer business transacted on Monday was worth Pounds 1.44bn.
Dealers in London were surprised at the extent of Wall Street's fall on
Monday evening, which was said to have occurred in the wake of a big shift
by Morgan Stanley, the influential US investment bank, in the cash
allocation of its US-only port-folio from 3 per cent to 15 per cent.
A dealer at one of the big international banks said much of the weakness in
Wall Street could be attributed to a series of options and futures expiries
last Friday which carried over into Monday.
There were also stories circulating in London of a substantial switch from
UK equities to gilts, a move which was borne out by the performance of both
markets but not by trading volumes.
US markets were also said to have been weakened by rumours of imminent
resignations in the Clinton administration after the recent polling disaster
in the mid-term elections.
London opened sharply lower, with the FT-SE 100 down almost 30 points, as
marketmakers chopped their initial quotations to head off any large selling
pressure. After a couple of half-hearted rallies, the market began to wilt
and eventually settled just above the day's low.
Traders said the market was delicately poised at the close, with the FT-SE
100 future at a discount to the cash market and resting at a major chart
point.
Senior marketmakers, although nursing losses over the past couple of
sessions, remained stoic, pointing to the continued strength of bond markets
in the face of the weakness in equities, and quick to emphasise that it was
the weakness in bonds that drove markets lower in the early part of the
year.
Laird, the engineering group, gave ground after announcing a Pounds 68m
rights issue, awakening market worries about cash calls. Vodafone continued
the recent flow of excellent dividend news, hoisting the interim payment by
a much higher than expected 19 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures ended sharply lower after another session of below
average trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,079 when pit trading came to an
end, down 51 points. It ended broadly in line with the cash market and seven
points under fair value.
Activity was much higher than Monday's severely depressed level, but it was
again below average and, at 11,220 lots, only just into the area where
traders reckon the futures market starts to become profitable.
December has tumbled 61 points in two days, falling into what traders
describe as a major support area. Wall Street continues to dictate immediate
direction but some dealers were speculating on an early rebound for stock
futures.
Activity was said to be strictly anomoly business: mostly book hedging and
marketmaker to marketmaker deals. Although premiums to cash equities were
minimal throughout the session, there was no real weight of selling, with
dealing lots small.
Business in traded options rose to 35,402 lots from Monday's 21,653. There
was heavy turnover in a number of individual stock options. FT-SE and Euro
FT-SE trades accounted for less than 16,000 contracts. Tesco was the busiest
stock option at 4,135 lots, followed by BTR and Shell Transport.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil turns firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo rebounded from losses to end 0.25 per cent up on the day after
very volatile trade, on hopes that the central bank could ease severe
reserve requirements to lend a hand to troubled small financial
institutions. The Bovespa index gained 113 points at 44,948, recovering from
a 3 per cent fall seen at midday which followed a drop of nearly 5 per cent
on Monday, its steepest decline since the currency was overhauled in the
summer.
Hopes that the government would help small banks emerged after the president
of Brazil's Bank Association (Febraban), Alcides Tapias, met president
Itamar Franco earlier yesterday and agreed to meet central bank head Pedro
Malan later in the day.
On Monday the central bank liquidated Banco Atlantis, the third bank shut
down in the last 10 days, because the institution failed to comply with
reserve requirements and to settle previously set positions.
Bear Stearns' Latin American research team commented that it did not expect
a large-scale crisis to develop. 'Most banks will adjust to the loss of
their inflationary 'float' income very quickly, due to the agility and high
quality of the leading Brazilian private banks.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges 91 points on rate
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices plummeted late yesterday afternoon to finish at their lowest
since early July amid fears that further interest rate increases would begin
to slow economic growth, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator was down
91.52 at 3,677.99. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 8.21
to 450.09, while the American Stock Exchange composite surrendered 5.14 at
436.14 and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 16.53 to 741.21. Trading volume on
the New York SE amounted to 385m shares.
Yesterday was the worst day for the Dow since February 4, the day the
Federal Reserve embarked on the current course of monetary tightening that
has driven interest rates from 3 per cent in January to today's 5.5 per
cent. On that day the Dow plunged more than 96 points.
The decline adds to Monday's loss of nearly 46 points, which took the Dow
down to its lowest level since August 22. NYSE volume yesterday was the
highest day's total of the year in the wake of investor fears that rising
interest rates would draw money from equities and into interest-bearing
instruments such as bonds.
On Monday, Morgan Stanley reduced the stock portion of its equity model
portfolio to 85 from 97 per cent and increased the cash holdings to 15 per
cent from 3 per cent.
For one of the first times this year, equity prices did not follow the trend
in bonds, which posted gains after an afternoon auction showed moderately
strong demand for five-year notes. Some analysts believe the uncoupling may
be a signal that the markets finally believe that the Fed is willing to
continue lifting interest rates until the economy slows down. Until now,
said some, many market actors were not convinced that the Fed was willing to
sacrifice some growth in order to rein in inflation.
Major cyclicals were off sharply. Caterpillar fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars
51 5/8 , DuPont Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 3/4 , International Paper Dollars 2
7/8 to Dollars 68 1/8 , General Electric Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 ,
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 5/8 and United
Technologies Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 7/8 .
One gainer in the Dow was Walt Disney, which rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 43
after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share, against
analysts' expectations of 39 cents.
PaineWebber shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 13 after the SEC launched an
investigation into whether the broking house had improperly sold shares in
several limited partnerships to investors.
Greyhound Lines was unchanged at Dollars 2 after reporting that it would
take a net loss of Dollars 3.5m over about four years because of three
cancelled interest rate swaps.
Canada
Toronto stocks posted only moderate losses in spite of the carnage in New
York which was seen late in the Wall Street session amid active program
selling.
The TSE 300 index ended 16.16 lower at 4,058.15, while falls led rises by
557 to 240 after volume of 68.7m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-group indices were down, led by transportation, metals,
industrial products and gold stocks. The golds group shed a further 0.7 per
cent, failing to benefit from a 70-cent gain in the New York spot bullion
price to USDollars 388.25 an ounce.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial shares led a recovery in early afternoon trade as buying interest
continued in spite of weaker world markets. A slight rise in the price of
gold bullion was also a contributing factor.
Analysts said the undertone in industrials was firm and prospects in coming
weeks remained steady.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan tumbles as magistrates
warn Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness on Wall Street was the main driving force yesterday, but Italy had
its own domestic troubles.
MILAN tumbled 2.1 per cent after magistrates confirmed that Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi had been issued an investigation warning in connection
with corruption allegations.
The Comit index fell 13.37 to 635.27 as the day's developments raised
worries that the fast moving political situation could distract attention
from the passage of the 1995 budget through the Senate by its year-end
deadline.
Losses were seen in all sectors, with the blue chips particularly hard hit.
Fiat lost L167 or 2.7 per cent at L6,119 and Parmalat, the milk and food
group, was L74 or 4.4 per cent down at L1,605.
Among the telecommunications stocks, Stet fell L205 to L4,768 and Telecom
Italia was L155 or 3.5 per cent weaker at L4,224.
ZURICH's attention was firmly fixed on a live television broadcast of the
UBS shareholders meeting. The SMI index dipped 35.2 or 1.4 per cent to
2,571.8, depressed by the weaker dollar and the malaise elsewhere in Europe.
UBS bearers fell SFr26 to SFr1,159, with the bank said to be a seller, and
the registered stock shed SFr11 to SFr268 as the market awaited the news
that the shareholders had approved the creation of a single class of share,
which came after the market had closed.
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision fell SFr25 to SFr1,345 as it emerged that the
investment trust had already lodged a provisional appeal at Zurich's company
registration office two week's ago.
Mr Ian McEwan at Merrill Lynch commented that the shares now faced a
confused passage in the short term, although in the longer term, he
reiterated his view that they had been driven substantially over fundamental
value.
Chemical and pharmaceutical blue chips were lower, with Ciba down another
SFr3 at SFr766.
Dealers said they expected only short-term weakness in Ciba following
Monday's announcement that it was to acquire 49.9 per cent of Chiron, the US
biotechnology company, for a price above market expectations.
Goldman Sachs, however, commented that the deal made excellent strategic
sense. It raised its longer term rating on the stock, forecasting that the
price could reach SFr900 over the next year.
Nestle, which is to report 10-month sales today, lost SFr25 at SFr1,205,
with analysts forecasting flat sales growth, depressed by negative currency
factors.
The main industrial issues were also lower. Sulzer declined SFr9 to SFr905
as James Capel downgraded the stock, noting that its order levels were
rising, but not by enough to suggest that earnings from the cyclical
businesses were set to explode.
PARIS regained the 1,900 level by the close, with the CAC-40 index down
16.42 at 1,911.41. Turnover amounted to FFr3.6bn.
Alcatel Alsthom remained under pressure, the shares down FFr7.90 to
FFr415.00, on news that the chairman of a subsidiary had been detained for
questioning in connection with an investigation into alleged false billing
and overcharging of France Telecom.
However, the stock came off a low for the year of FFr410.10 as the main
board of the group declined a resignation offer from the executive.
There was no let-off in demand for Renault, with turnover approaching
FFr365m as the shares slipped 80 centimes to finish at FFr180.20.
FRANKFURT was pulled down by technical weakness. The Dax index was off 30.51
at 2,074.77, recovering some of the losses in post-bourse trading to
2,072.49. Turnover totalled DM5.5bn.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday advised market
watchers not to expect a change in monetary policy at tomorrow's regular
meeting of the council.
The market is now awaiting results from the chemical and bank sectors, which
are due to start later this week. On the banks, Merrill Lynch in a recent
note suggested that the 10-month results should be broadly neutral and
summarised that the sector was likely to 'outperform mildly over the
intermediate term in the context of an unspectacular market'.
Among chemicals, BASF, which launches the results season tomorrow, is widely
expected to show a substantial improvement in nine-month profits. The stock
closed yesterday at DM305.80, down DM8.00.
Volkswagen, off DM5.70 at DM461.80, has been attracting reasonably bullish
comments from analysts. Mr Keith Hayes at Merrill Lynch said that he had
raised his opinion on the basis of the recent share price pullback, but over
the long term he remained 'severely sceptical'.
AMSTERDAM finished sharply down in a session that was pressured by events
largely outside the market. The AEX index fell 4.75 to 406.44.
In the absence of corporate news the trend was one way, assisted also by
dollar weakness - Philips declined Fl 1.30 to Fl 51.70, Royal Dutch Fl 2.60
to Fl 187.80 and Unilever Fl 2.20 to Fl 194.30.
Elsewhere, NedLloyd dipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 53.20, affected mainly by retail
selling.
MADRID's direction was dictated by falls elsewhere and the General index
finished 2.00 lower at 302.37.
Turnover of Pta16bn was well below the levels of recent days as industrials
suffered profit-taking after the sharp gains in previous sessions.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
19,000 as Hong Kong drops 3.8%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp decline on Wall Street overnight and further weakness in consumer
electronics shares depressed investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average
fell below the 19,000 level for the first time since February 18, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 158.73 at 18,962.99 on arbitrage unwinding prompted by lower
futures prices, and profit-taking by foreigners and individuals. It opened
at the day's high of 19,052.01 and hit a low of 18,905.48 as selling
overwhelmed small-lot buying by financial institutions and investment
trusts. Individual investors who had bought shares on margin were also
forced to unload their holdings.
Volume rose to 315m shares from 176.6m. Traders said public funds bought
around 20m shares in the afternoon session. The Topix index of all first
section stocks dipped 9.46 to 1,502.92 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.83 to
275.82. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.14 to 1,228.56.
Sony, the consumer electronics company, continued its decline on selling by
overseas investors and the issue ended Y120 lower at Y5,110, falling for the
third consecutive day. Other high-technology shares were also weaker, with
Matsushita Electric Industrial off Y10 at Y1,520 and TDK down Y120 at
Y4,570.
Brokerage issues declined on fears of lower earnings due to the prolonged
weakness of the stock market: Nomura Securities was down Y20 to Y1,910 and
Nikko Securities Y10 to Y1,020. Smaller brokers, which depend heavily on
stock market commissions, were also hit - Sanyo Securities fell Y12 to Y477
and New Japan Securities Y15 to Y645.
Banks, which rely on unrealised share holdings as capital, lost ground,
Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y10 to Y2,720 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y10
to Y1,680.
Telecommunication stocks were lower. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
reported that its interim recurring profits plunged 66 per cent, receded
Y13,000 to Y843,000 and Japan Telecom Y7,000 to Y983,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 228.26 to 21,103.78 in volume of 24.7m
shares.
Roundup
The reverberations from Wall Street's overnight setback were felt throughout
the region.
HONG KONG dropped 3.8 per cent on heavy foreign selling, particularly by US
investors clearing their books ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend
and, to a lesser extent, by Japanese investors ahead of today's holiday in
Tokyo.
The Hang Seng index lost 354.81 at 8,948.43, the biggest one-day fall since
a 465-point drop on March 21, as local investors joined the sellers during
the afternoon. Provisional turnover rose to HKDollars 4.7bn after Monday's
HKDollars 2.4bn.
An analyst said the market slide came amid rumours of changes in Morgan
Stanley portfolio weightings. Mr Byron Wien, Morgan Stanley's US strategist,
confirmed yesterday that he had raised the cash element of his US equity
only portfolio from 3 per cent to 15 per cent on Monday. He added that his
contribution to the volatility in Hong Kong was 'another example of the law
of unintended consequences'.
Property issues were sold as investors discounted the effect of further
interest rate rises on the property market. Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 3.75
or 6.9 per cent to HKDollars 51, Henderson Land HKDollars 2.80 or 5.8 per
cent to HK45.80 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1.60 to HKDollars 34.40.
The H-share index of mainland China stocks listed in Hong Kong retreated
79.46 or 6.2 per cent to 1,206.23.
SINGAPORE was bruised by relentless selling by institutional funds, in
response to weak regional markets, the Dow's overnight fall and rises in
prime rates by major local banks. The Straits Times Industrial index dropped
51.94 or 2.2 per cent to 2,270.05.
The index, which at one stage fell through the psychological support level
of 2,250, recovered on bargain hunting towards the close of trading.
Large losses sustained by shipbuilders weighed on the broader market. Keppel
fell 70 cents to SDollars 12.00 and Sembawang Corp 40 cents to SDollars
10.70.
BANGKOK just avoided closing below the 1,400 support level, bouncing to
1,402.38 in the last minutes of trading, down a net 37.78 or 2.6 per cent.
Turnover swelled to Bt9.5bn. The most active stock was Bangkok Bank, off Bt6
at Bt200 after foreign selling.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses, the composite index finishing 19.20 or 1.8
per cent down at 1,026.18. Volume was 109.9m shares, with Amalgamated
Industrial Steel accounting for 15 per cent of them. AIS, which on Monday
announced the acquisition of three integrated timber companies for MDollars
1.1bn, fell 65 cents to MDollars 5.05.
TAIPEI saw early gains reversed by mid-morning selling, but paper and cement
shares posted slight rises. The weighted index lost 59.35 at 6,345.27, off a
low of 6,332.69. Turnover was a thin TDollars 30.9bn.
Brokers said some industries, including paper, textile and steel, were
expected to recover in 1995 and had already been the focus recently of
bargain hunting by trust funds and long-term investors.
An easier cement issue was Lucky Cement, whose TDollars 5bn investment plans
in Vietnam were made public yesterday. It dipped 20 cents to TDollars 30.30.
SEOUL finished lower for the fourth straight session after aggressive
institutional selling of primary blue chips wiped out minor early gains. The
composite index lost 10.38 at 1,106.70, having pulled back from a high of
1,120.64.
Brokers said the market was pressured by concerns about tight liquidity and
they thought it unlikely that a 2 percentage-point expansion for foreign
share ownership next month would have much impact on prices.
Korea Mobile Telecom went limit down for the sixth session in a row,
declining Won12,000 to Won571,000.
MANILA fell 1.5 per cent in line with the regional trend. The composite
index saw a low of 2,850 before closing 44.84 off at 2,854.95. Analysts
remarked that foreign fund managers had diverted money to other markets
since equities in Manila were now thought to be too expensive.
The drop in PLDT in New York by almost Dollars 1.50 signalled a weak
opening, and caused its domestic shares to lose 25 pesos at 1,320 pesos.
The commercial and industrial sector tumbled 80.15 to 4,212.35, the property
group shed 2.57 to 109.95 and mining fell 155.78 to 5,115.03.
SYDNEY closed sharply lower, hit by a firmer Australian dollar. The All
Ordinaries index dipped 31.8 or 1.7 per cent to 1,877.7 and turnover was
ADollars 491m. Brokers said the higher currency helped to underpin the bond
market.
Among the actives, BHP shed 38 cents to ADollars 18.54, CRA 16 cents to
ADollars 17.02 and WMC 17 cents to ADollars 7.18.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Lira takes knock from Berlusconi
investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira dropped to a record low against the D-Mark after
magistrates formally warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, that
he is under investigation, writes Philip Coggan.
The lira fell to L1,033/DM at the London close, from L1,025 on Monday.
According to Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Capital Markets:
'The weaker that Berlusconi becomes, the less likely it is that the budget
deficit will be sorted out in the near term. The lira is suffering from the
lack of firm government.'
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, thinks that while the
latest political crisis may have been discounted by the market, the lira
could still fall to L1,045/1,048 to the D-Mark.
While Mr Berlusconi said he was 'absolutely sure' he had not committed any
offence and would not resign, the news also hit Italian bond and equity
markets. The Mibtel stock market index fell 2.8 per cent on the day.
The US dollar weakened in London trading against both the D-Mark and the
yen. Chemical Bank's Mr Cocker said profit-taking had made the dollar
weaker. 'Basically, it was a market which had got a little bit long of
dollars,' he added.
Mr Thomas said the dollar had recently hit a technical resistance point
around DM1.56 and had backtracked. On the fundamentals, he added: 'People
are also beginning to realise that December might be a bit early for the Fed
to raise rates again.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the 75
basis-point rise in US interest rates was 'not enough to convince the bond
market that the Fed was ahead of the inflation game'.
He also pointed to the recent weakness on Wall Street - the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is down 200 points since October - as one factor behind
the dollar's difficulties. 'The currency market thinks the Fed will find it
hard to raise interest rates with Wall Street going down,' he said. 'The
dilemma for the Fed is that if they do not raise rates, long bonds will
suffer, and if they do raise rates, Wall Street will come under pressure.'
However, the Citibank economist is cautiously optimistic about the dollar's
prospects in 1995. Citibank's research shows there is increasing interest in
the dollar among medium and long term fund managers and this, according to
Mr MacKinnon, should give the currency some support.
The D-Mark also received support from Bundesbank president Mr Hans
Tietmeyer. He was quoted as saying that German monetary policy will reflect
the central bank's interest in a strong D-Mark.
Mr Tietmeyer also appeared to rule out a move to a variable rate repo when
the decision-making central council meets tomorrow.
The dollar fell to DM1.5536 by the London close, from Monday's DM1.5594, and
against the yen it slipped to Y98.075 from Y98.375. Trading continued to be
fairly quiet, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The New York
session ended with the dollar at DM1.5534 and Y98.305.
Sterling had a fairly quiet day on the currency markets, with attention
focused elsewhere. However, expectations of an early interest rate rise
appeared to subside.
The markets have apparently decided that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor, will attempt to shift the focus in next week's Budget to the
tightening of fiscal policy and away from monetary policy.
The March short sterling futures contract recovered half of Monday's loss,
gaining 3 basis points at 92.98. But that still implies base rates of 7 per
cent, compared with the current level of 5.75 per cent.
Against the D-Mark, the pound declined to DM2.4402 from Monday's close of
DM2.4452. It firmed slightly against the weaker dollar to finish at Dollars
1.5707, from Dollars 1.5681. Trade-weighted, it slipped to 79.8, from 79.9
on Monday.
The Australian dollar had another good day, edging up to 76.3 cents against
the US dollar, from just under 76.2 cents on Monday. The Australian currency
continues to benefit from rising commodity prices and high real interest
rates.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England gave help of Pounds 400m at
established rates to alleviate a Pounds 500m forecast shortage. Overnight
rates moved between 5.5 per cent and 4 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Sugar prices hit fresh highs -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London white SUGAR futures rallied to fresh contract highs yesterday as
bullish fundamentals, including talk of fresh buying from China and
estimates for a higher 1994-95 deficit, prompted mixed buying, dealers said.
COFFEE futures also bounced to close sharply firmer on mixed buying,
short-covering and New York's bullish trend, after sliding to over four-week
lows in early trading.
A quieter day at the London Metal Exchange prompted holders of long
positions to lighten their load a little, which put some downward pressure
on prices.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis take the heat out of
Opec talks - A look at a meeting driven by 'economic self-interest'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Suharto of Indonesia may have been right when he told Monday's
meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that the
peaceful atmosphere of Bali would pervade their usually troubled and
acrimonious deliberations on oil prices.
Or maybe it was just Bali's energy-sapping heat, as delegates from even the
hottest Middle Eastern countries struggled to cope with temperatures in the
high nineties fahrenheit and humidity to match.
Whatever the reason, oil ministers yesterday succumbed easily when Saudi
Arabia, Opec's largest producer, made it clear that it wanted quick
agreement on its surprise plan to roll over Opec's existing production
ceiling for the whole of 1995.
Kuwait, Libya and Gabon expressed last minute reservations. But all
resistance crumbled before the united front presented by the other eight
members, including Iran, so often a dissenting voice within Opec.
It was, however, 'economic self-interest' which drove the delegations to an
early agreement, according to a Gulf Arab official.
All the countries share a 'common goal' of lifting oil prices higher than
the present level of about Dollars 17 for the benchmark Brent Blend. The
differences at this week's talks were only about how to achieve it.
The option of a three month roll-over was never seriously considered because
delegates feared that it would merely set off renewed market speculation
about Opec's next move.
A cut was also not a serious option. 'I can't see any country willing to go
below the ceiling,' said one delegate last night.
Saudi Arabia dropped its widely-signalled support for the six-month
roll-over option in the days leading up to the meeting. A Gulf Arab official
said the six-month option could only have been justified 'if you believed'
forecasts for 1995 which assumed that non-Opec would not be able to capture
any of the 800,000-1m barrel a day increase in demand expected during the
year.
Saudi Arabia clearly did not, although the kingdom did not inform any of its
colleagues about its change in position until Saturday, when Mr Hisham
Nazer, its oil minister, arrived in Bali.
The one year plan meets a number of Saudi aims, according to analysts. It
sends a signal to the markets that the kingdom is prepared to forego volume
increases in favour of firmer prices. It also largely eliminates market
uncertainty associated with frequent Opec meetings. And, more importantly,
it confirms that the Saudis want to shift the burden of maintaining stocks
on to oil companies and refiners.
A Gulf Arab official said he expected that the international oil industry
would have to hold more stocks and compete more fiercely with each other for
available crude oil supplies as a result of the agreement.
The one-year roll-over also reflects a Saudi preference for Opec to focus on
longer term goals, rather than trying to set short-term prices. 'Technical
factors are more important than Opec' in the short term, said one delegate.
But a Saudi official said the one-year roll-over did not necessarily
represent a sea change in an oil policy that has tended to emphasise market
share.
'We're not rigid in terms of market shares,' he said. 'We like a good share
and a good price.'
So will the Saudi plan succeed in achieving that aim? Opinions vary widely,
with few delegates forecasting any big jump in prices. Many expect the
benefits of the roll-over to be relatively modest, with little likelihood
that the cartel will soon achieve its reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel
for the Opec basket, an index of seven international crude oils.
A big uncertainty remains the upward trend in non-Opec production. One Arab
delegate yesterday admitted that North Sea operators 'out-manoeuvred us with
their increased production this year'.
There is also uncertainty about possible quota cheating by Opec states
should prices rise. That was said to be Kuwait's biggest reservation about
the plan.
Mr Nazer declared yesterday: 'Over-production is a problem. We're very keen
to have everyone abide by quotas'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Funds sought for diamond
projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashton Mining of Australia has two exciting diamond projects that, if all
goes well, might be mined in 1997, according to Mr John Robinson, the chief
executive.
The race is between Ashton's Merlin prospect in the Batten area of
Australia's Northern Territory, where the company has been exploring for 15
years, and its new diamond province in Finland.
Ashton has been exploring in Finland for eight years but kept its operations
there secret until September this year because Finnish laws do not provide
for large and long-life exploration licences. The company is still not
revealing the precise locations of some of the prospective areas in Finland
where it has found 'commercially significant concentrations' of diamonds.
Mr Robinson, speaking to analysts in London this week, said that Ashton was
looking at options for substantial further funding if the projects lived up
to their present promise. The least attractive option would be to bring in a
partner for joint ventures. He preferred the idea of floating projects so as
to bring in public money.
Ashton is Australia's biggest diamond mining company via its 40 per cent
holding in the Argyle mine in Western Australia, the world's largest
producer in volume terms. Argyle's present reserves guarantee its open pit
operations through to 2004 but Mr Robinson said there was a good chance that
moving to underground mining could extend the mine's life considerably.
He was 'very optimistic' about diamond market prospects for the next 10
years. Demand would grow strongly as new markets, such as China, India and
Mexico, developed from a small base. On the supply side, apart from Ashton's
two projects, only the discovery by another Australian group, Broken Hill
Proprietary, in Canada's North West Territories, seemed to offer much
promise. He admitted, however, that there were unanswered questions about
the size of Russia's diamond stockpiles and what it might do with those
gems.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise in commodities prices
dismissed as short-term rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior World Bank economist yesterday dismissed the view that commodities,
which have seen huge price increases this year, could prove to be a
long-term investment on a par with equities.
Mr Donald Mitchell, senior economist at the bank's commodities unit, told a
conference in London that the rally was a short-term reaction to a plunge in
prices over the past decade and not the start of a 'major uptrend'.
'Commodities are not a buy-and-hold type of investment,' he said. 'You can
make huge amounts of money by speculating. But you have to have a view and
understand the markets.
'Commodities primarily belong to the hedgers and speculators, not to the
investors.'
Commodities are strongly in favour this year as a way of diversifying
investment portfolios out of poorly performing equities and bonds. Funds
specialising in commodities have been launched on the back of increases such
as a tripling in coffee prices and a rise of more than 50 per cent in
aluminium, copper and cotton.
But Mr Mitchell pointed out that if commodities turned out to be an asset
class in their own right, worth holding for the long-term, 'it would defy
100 years of history'.
A sustained increase in prices over more than two or three years would
require a shift in wealth to the developing world, and a consequent surge in
demand for commodities, similar to the oil price boom of the 1970s, he
argued.
But circumstances had changed. The Soviet Union, a large importer of
commodities in the 1970s, no longer existed; Opec countries had financial
problems preventing them from expanding imports; and China had shifted from
being a major importer of grain to being a net exporter. Rapid growth in
some developing countries was no longer accompanied by an equivalent
increase in imports.
He said, however, that commodity price movements appeared to offer investors
a negative correlation with interest rates, which 'may be useful'. He also
felt that metal and mineral prices had some way to rise, while agricultural
commodities had 'by and large had their boom.'
Other speakers were more upbeat about the potential for commodities at the
conference, which was organised by Futures and Options World, a publishing
company, and Rostron Perry, a public relations company focusing on
derivatives, and sponsored by Reuters.
Mr Neil Bresolin, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, said commodity investors were at, or close to, the middle of a bull
market. Metals in particular should benefit from rapid growth in industrial
production still to come in the US and Europe.
'There's a high positive correlation between commodity prices and industrial
expansion,' he said. 'You can get direct exposure and participation in
global growth (by investing in commodities). It's also an insurance against
unexpected events.'
Mr Roy Leighton, chairman of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, the French banking
group's commodity derivatives arm, argued that over-the-counter instruments
such as swaps and index warrants offered advantages to 'fundamental'
portfolio managers.
They provided opportunities to invest in commodities such as jet fuel, which
could be highly sensitive to events in the Gulf but was not yet quoted on a
futures exchange. They were flexible and allowed trade to take place further
forward than in futures markets.
'Provided you have a reliable counter-party, these markets can be quite
safe,' he said.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market 'could absorb' IMF
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international gold market could easily absorb sales from the
International Monetary Fund of the order recently proposed by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor, a leading gold banker said yesterday.
Mr Robert Guy, a director of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, said Mr Clarke's plan
for the IMF to sell up to 10 per cent of its gold stocks to create a fund to
ease the debt burdens of poor developing countries was practical.
'The gold market could easily absorb an additional supply of 320 tonnes from
the IMF provided the sales are spread over a reasonable period,' Mr Guy
said.
He told the third City of London Central Banking Conference, that the
chancellor's proposed sales would be easier for the market to manage than
the last IMF gold sales in the 1970s.
The last IMF gold sale programme was larger, totalling more than 700 tonnes,
and the Fund was competing as a seller with the US Treasury and some other
IMF members who had gold returned to them by the Fund.
This time 'there would be no parallel sales either by the US Treasury or as
a consequence of restitution', Mr Guy said.
Moreover, the gold market has since become much larger, coping last year
with total supply of 3,257 tonnes, compared with 1,765 tonnes in 1979, and
more sophisticated, with a greater number of professional dealers able to
handle an auction process, he added.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credible coffee data base
called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Establishing a credible data base on world coffee output must be a priority
for producers, according to the secretary-general of the Association of
Coffee Producing Countries.
Mr Roberio Oliveira Silva told a meeting of the Interafrican Coffee
Organisation in Lome that uncertainty over the true levels of supply was
contributing to the highly volatile behaviour of the coffee market.
'No organisation exists which has the conditions to assess the world level
of production and the conditions in each producing country, including the
difficult question of production costs,' he said.
'I am convinced this is one of the most important tasks the ACPC has to
undertake: to organise a data base on world coffee production with
sufficient credibility to be able to make a difference to the situation in
the market today.'
The ACPC was established last year when producers introduced a successful
export retention scheme. Mr Silva said the organisation also had to work
with the International Coffee Organisation to achieve higher long-term
consumption.
The International Sugar Organisation yesterday predicted a bigger deficit
for the coming year of 1.9m tonnes, compared with 1.3m tonnes forecast in
September.
Production in Europe alone, hit by poor weather in June and July, was
expected to be 1.63m tonnes lower in 1994-95.
The ISO said a second year of deficit provided strong support for prices at
current levels, but warned that big buyers such as China, India or Russia
were extremely price sensitive.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Italian sector tumbles on renewed
political worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
While activity in most European government bond markets was muted, Italian
bonds and the lira tumbled sharply yesterday amid renewed political worries
surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister.
Bonds fell by as much as a point on news that Mr Berlusconi had received
formal notice that he is under investigation for allegedly paying bribes to
Italian tax authorities in connection with his media empire, Fininvest.
Although the corruption probe has been rumoured for months, its confirmation
threw the market into disarray, raising fears that political upheaval would
delay the passage of the 1995 budget. Parliament has to pass the package,
which includes measures to cut some L48,000bn from next year's public sector
deficit, before the end of the year.
However, after dropping steeply on the initial news, prices soon stabilised
as traders decided the news merely confirmed market worries. 'Considering
the seriousness of the matter, the drop wasn't as bad as it could have been
 -a lot was already discounted,' said a dealer.
'The key questions now are: will Berlusconi be forced to resign, and will it
throw the budget process into disarray?' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. Although he thought the budget was
likely to be passed by year-end, he said the market would remain nervous
over prospects of political upheavals - possible coalition realignments or
even new elections - in the new year.
The December BTP future on Liffe fell as low as 99.75 but recovered slightly
to end at 100.11, down 0.78 point on the day. The Italian 10-year yield
spread over German bonds widened to 476 basis points, from 455 on Monday,
and some traders said it could move towards 500 in coming days.
German bunds ended a trendless day slightly higher, buoyed by short-covering
in the futures markets and a firmer tone in the US Treasury market.
Participants are awaiting the release of October M3 data, expected some time
this week. The December bund future on Liffe ended at 90.41, up 0.33 point.
UK gilts continued their pre-Budget slumber, tracking bunds slightly higher
in the absence of domestic impulses.
The Bank of England announced that a Pounds 200m tap issue of 7 per cent
Treasury stock due 2001 had sold out, having been supplied at 92.02. The
issue was part of a total Pounds 750m package of tap stocks of existing
gilts set on Monday.
US Treasury prices benefited from a weakening stock market as fears of
future interest rate increases caused investors to favour putting assets in
bonds.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 93
5/16 yielding 8.091 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 99 29/32 , yielding 7.284 per cent.
Adding to the gain was relatively strong demand for five-year notes, which
were auctioned early in the afternoon. In the early morning prices dipped
slightly as traders sold bonds to make way for the new issue.
Prevailing sentiment in the market has been pessimism and uncertainty since
the Federal Reserve boosted its Federal funds target interest rate last week
without closing the door on a further tightening in the near term. Although
the Fed raised rates by a stronger-than-expected 75 basis points to 5 1/2
per cent, the move was insufficient to calm the market's fears of inflation.
Almost immediately after the interest rate increase traders began expecting
rates to go up again soon. Such interest rate instability causes investor
unease and undermines bond prices.
Even yesterday's boost in prices is not expected to last as most investment
strategists are not advocating moving from stocks to bonds, but rather from
stocks to cash. Also, the dollar declined from late Monday levels, which
hurts the bond market by deterring foreign investors from buying US
instruments such as bonds.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Activity slows in run-up to holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issuance activity in the eurobond market slowed yesterday ahead of
holidays in Japan and the US today and tomorrow.
The short-dated dollar sector, which witnessed a flurry of activity after
last week's rise in US short-term interest rates, nevertheless managed to
attract three borrowers in the two and three-year area.
Bayerische Landesbank launched a Dollars 300m offering of three-year bonds.
Traders criticised the launch spread - 15 basis points over US government
bonds - as too expensive and described selling as 'slow'. The spread widened
to around 19 basis points after the bonds were freed to trade.
'A spread of 20 basis points would have been a fairer price,' said one
trader.
However, joint lead manager Lehman Brothers said the spread was in line with
similar existing bonds trading in the secondary market and that virtually no
bonds had been bought back through the brokers.
The bonds were launched into Asia in the hope of attracting some interest
there, traders said. But they suspected that most would be placed with
European retail investors.
In the sterling sector, National &amp; Provincial Building Society launched a
Pounds 100m offering of bonds due December 1997, priced to yield 45 basis
points over UK gilts.
Traders cast doubt on the decision to launch a three-year offering. 'This
area of the sterling yield curve is only going to retail accounts and
National &amp; Provincial is not a retail name,' said one dealer. 'The spread is
not going to attract institutional interest,' he said.
Challenge Bank launched a Dollars 200m offering of three-year floating rate
notes, priced to yield 35 basis points over three-month Libor, which joint
lead manager CSFB said found strong European demand.
Ireland is planning to tap the euroyen market for around Y30bn within the
next few weeks, the Irish National Treasury Management Agency said.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England may make
novel gilt issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is exploring the issue of zero-coupon UK government
bonds and ways of aiding investors to separate the income stream from
gilt-edged stock, as part of its programme of making UK government bonds
more attractive to international investors.
Mr Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's executive director for monetary policy
operations, said it was also considering new types of security to meet the
needs of pension funds.
'We continue to seek views from market participants on the scale of possible
interest in zero-coupon instruments and in coupon-stripping facilities,' Mr
Plenderleith told the Third City of London Central Banking Conference
yesterday. 'Changes in the pension industry may generate demand for new
forms of government security,' he added.
Although Mr Plenderleith gave no further details, it is thought that the
Bank could be considering the issue of gilts with very long maturities for
pension funds.
The issue of zero-coupon bonds, which reward investors through capital gains
rather than interest payments, will have to overcome Inland Revenue rules
that have so far prevented their sale, and the sale of deep discount UK
bonds.
Mr Plenderleith said the UK government bond and money markets were 'in the
midst of a significant process of continuing change'.
But officials said the ideas floated yesterday constituted a 'wish list'
rather than specific plans.
However, the Bank is expected to discuss possible rule changes with the
Treasury and UK tax authorities.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Heatwave warms electricity
earnings - Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Interim profits at Japan's electric power companies were supported by the
surge in electricity demand due to the heatwave which hit the country in the
summer and the economic recovery.
A rise in electricity demand for air conditioning helped the nine leading
electric utilities, excluding Shikoku Electric Power, to post strong
increases in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax. The
companies were hit last year by an unusually cold summer and cuts in
electricity charges.
Lower fuel costs due to the yen's appreciation compensated for depreciation
charges and lost income from further electricity rate cuts. Lower interest
rates helped cut debt service payments.
Tokyo Electric Power said record temperatures led to a 10.3 per cent rise in
the company's total electricity sales volume.
The further cut in charges squeezed the company's earnings by Y46.4bn
(Dollars 471m), but an increased sales volume covered the loss.
For the second half, the company expects the cut in electricity fees to
affect its sales by Y44bn, but forecasts full-year sales to rise 4.8 per
cent to Y4,950bn on a 15.7 per cent increase in recurring profits.
Kansai Electric Power saw its first increase in industrial demand in three
years. Total electricity sales volume rose 10.2 per cent, the first
double-digit increase since 1973.
For the full year to March, the company forecasts a 17.8 per cent increase
in recurring profits to Y130bn on a 5.4 per cent rise in sales to Y2,500bn.
Chubu Electric Power said household demand for electricity rose 14.2 per
cent and industrial demand increased by 2.9 per cent. The company revised
upwards its initial full-year forecast. It now sees recurring profits rising
11 per cent to Y90bn on a 3.3 per cent increase in sales to Y2,020bn.
Electricity sales volume at Tohoku Electric Power grew 9.1 per cent. The
company posted a rise in both sales and profit for the first time in three
years.
For the full year, the company forecasts sales up 4.2 per cent to Y1,400bn
on a recurring profit increase of 8 per cent to Y85bn.

<TEXT>
Titan Wheel International, the Illinois-based company which is the world's
largest producer of wheels for agricultural and construction equipment, has
announced its first significant acquisition in Europe, writes Andrew Baxter
in London. Titan, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange last
year, paid L15bn (Dollars 9.4m) for 50 per cent of the Italian wheel
companies Sima, Sirmac and AGM. Titan has an option to buy the remaining
shares for at least another L15bn.
Mr Maurice Taylor, Titan president and chief executive, said the deal was
likely to be followed by further strategic acquisitions, which ultimately
would create a specialist European wheel and tyre group with sales of about
Dollars 300m.
The Milan-based Sirmac/Sima group has been badly hit by the recession in
European farm and construction equipment markets, and has been losing money,
but according to Titan has one of the best wheel factories in the world.
Mr Taylor says the deal would allow Titan to offer a better service to its
international customers.
The Italian companies would probably be combined initially with Titan's UK
manufacturing and distribution centre, based in Merseyside.
The deal comes four months after Titan bought the Pirelli Armstrong factory
at Des Moines, Iowa, which claims 70 per cent of North American farm tyre
sales.

Woolworth, Australia's second largest retailer, said yesterday that sales
and profits in the current year were slightly ahead of budget, and that the
outlook for the full year's profits was 'encouraging', writes Nikki Tait.
It said that the 10.2 per cent same-store sales increase for the first
quarter, to end-September, had continued in ensuing weeks.
However, Mr Paul Simon, chairman, warned at the company's annual meeting
that Australia's current drought could partly offset the benefits of
continuing economic growth, both in terms of the supply and price of
products. He stressed that the company had no plans to make a big
acquisition or move into Asia as a retail force. However, he said Woolworth
hoped to build links with Asian retailers via a consultancy role, and as a
supplier of fresh food and vegetables.

Accor Asia Pacific, in which the French Accor hotels group is a shareholder
but which is quoted separately on the Australian stock market, yesterday put
plans to float a 'tourism trust' on hold, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Accor Asia Pacific, which operates more than 60 hotels in the Asia-Pacific
region, blamed poor stock market conditions for the move. The Australian
All-Ordinaries Index yesterday closed 31.8 points lower at 1,877.7, a
15-month low.
The 'tourism trust' plan was unveiled in September, when Accor said it would
issue units to institutional investors, with a view to listing the trust -
likely to be valued at around ADollars 200m (USDollars 151.5m) - on the
stock market shortly afterwards.
The trust was to have held three- and four-star properties in Australia and
New Zealand, and would have been managed by a group including AAPC.
Initially, the trust was expected to include about 21 properties, mainly
operating under the Ibis and Novotel brand names.
Units in the trust were to be marketed to institutions in Europe, Australia
and the US.

<TEXT>
TDK of Japan, the world's largest maker of magnetic tapes and a leading
producer of floppy discs, yesterday signalled that it was pulling out of a
three-year profits decline, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. A revival in
demand for electronic components from US and Asian computer industry
customers more than offset the continuing weakness in Japanese demand, to
fuel a rise in current profits - before tax and extraordinary items - of
39.8 per cent to Y12.19bn (Dollars 124m) in the six months to September.
The computer products improvement has continued in the current six months,
due to stronger-than-expected demand for magnetic heads for hard disc drives
because of the expansion in personal computer sales. As a result, TDK
forecast full-year profits would rise by 41.2 per cent to Y20bn, above
analysts' expectations.
Overall sales, however, rose only a fraction in the first half, to Y172.65bn
from Y172bn a year earlier, hampered by cost reductions. TDK expects
full-year sales to rise to Y343bn from Y334.61bn last year.
Turnover was also held back by weak demand for recording tapes, which
represent more than a third of TDK's business.
Sales of recording media fell by 4.9 per cent to Y64.5bn in the first half,
while turnover in electronic materials and parts rose by 3.1 per cent.
TDK's main cost-cutting technique, likemany other Japanese producers of
low-margin goods, has been to shift production to cheaper locations in Asia
and Europe.

<TEXT>
Advance Agro, the pulp and paper subsidiary of the Soon Hua Seng group of
Thailand, is seeking to raise more than Dollars 80m through an initial
public offering next month to help finance a Dollars 650m pulp and paper
mill on Thailand's eastern seaboard.
Executives from Advance Agro and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the international
lead manager for the offering, are currently on an international roadshow to
publicise the IPO.
SHS, a leading agro-industrial group which trades rice, tapioca and other
products, is offering one-tenth of the enlarged capital of Advance Agro, or
36m shares, to the public at an estimated Bt55 to Bt60 a share, depending on
the outcome of the book-building process.
About 30 per cent of the new shares will be allocated to foreign investors.
A further 19m shares have been sold to the project's main financial backers
 -Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers' Bank, Krung Thai Bank, and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation - at Bt40 a share.
The new pulp and paper mill is expected to begin production in early 1996
and is designed to meet the growing demand for paper in Thailand and the
region.
Advance Agro intends to focus on the domestic market but could export up to
one-fifth of its output to China, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Mr Yothin Dumnernchanvanit, managing director, said: 'Demand for paper in
Thailand and throughout the Asia Pacific region is increasing by more than
10 per cent a year.
'Per capita consumption of paper in Thailand is only about 30kg per year,
compared to more than 200kg per year in Singapore, Japan and the US,
indicating huge future growth potential for the market.'
The new plant will generate its own electricity and produce up to 175,000
tonnes a year of bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp. It will supply its own
paper mill, with a capacity of 217,200 tonnes of coated and uncoated
printing and writing paper, and that of its existing wholly-owned subsidiary
Hi-Tech Paper, which operates a 41,000-tonnes a year paper mill.

Shares in Pacific BBA, which was spun off on the Australian stockmarket by
the UK's BBA group in 1993, fell 13 cents to ADollars 3.35 yesterday, after
the company said that profits for the year to end-1993 and the half-year to
June 1994 had been overstated because of accounting irregularities in one of
the plastics businesses, writes Nikki Tait.
It said the overstatement amounted to just under ADollars 3m (USDollars
2.3m) in after-tax profits, 'resulting from a number of accounting entries
apparently designed to hide losses on some contracts in the Viscount tool
room and inflate profits in the plastics operation'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Jitters on the Japanese stock
market - Investors fear the Nikkei index may drop even further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Nikkei index slid below 19,000 to a nine-month low yesterday, there
were renewed fears that further weakness in the Tokyo stock market would
harm the fragile recovery in Japan's ecomony currently being revealed by
companies' interim earnings.
The immediate cause of the decline has been the recent sharp fall in Wall
Street and Sony's announcement last week that it was writing Y265bn (Dollars
2.7bn) off the value of its US movie subsidiary. The consumer electronics
company's share price has fallen by 11.7 per cent in the past three days,
dragging down the whole market.
There have also been lingering fears over the health of the country's banks.
Worries about the stability of Japan's financial system hit the stock market
this time last year following the banks' poor half-year results, and some
investors, expecting another set of poor results, are taking profits ahead
of the banks' earnings announcements over the next two days.
The market's current decline started back in June when the Nikkei index
stood at around 21,000 and when overseas fund managers, who had been
aggressive buyers early in the year, called a halt.
Many of the overseas investors had initially hoped that aggressive
deregulation of many Japanese industries, rigorous restructuring by some
companies, and hopes of an easing of short-term interest rates by the Bank
of Japan, would boost the economy and lead to a general rise in share
prices. But, says Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo,
'these reasons for owning stocks did not materialise'.
Domestic institutional investors have been constrained from sharply
increasing their share holdings. Banks, which need to offset their losses on
bad loan write-offs, have been selling their long-term holdings.
Retail investors have been virtually absent from the stock market since the
Nikkei average started its tumble in 1990, soon after reaching an all-time
high of nearly 39,000 in December 1989.
Although some analysts have hoped that a rally led by retail investors
similar to that of the UK and US a few years ago would pluck the stock
market from its current slump, the small private investors have, in fact,
looked for safety with bank deposits.
Some analysts believe that share prices will not rebound without a 'selling
climax', allowing prices to fall to a point where investors regard the
shares as fair value; others, however, are worried that further selling
could push the market into free-fall.

NTT profits
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, suffered a 66 per cent fall
in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
in the first half, largely as a result of price cuts.
NTT, which was listed in New York and London this year, said sales dropped 2
per cent to Y2,856.7bn from a previous Y2,911.6bn mainly because of
significant price cuts on long-distance calls, where NTT faces growing
competition from recently established telecoms companies. Recurring profits
fell to Y35.5bn (Dollars 360m) from Y103.9bn.
A maximum price cut of 10 per cent was introduced on the longest routes,
depressing first-half revenues by Y95bn. This was an improvement, however,
on the Y135bn impact the company had forecast.
Sales of equipment, such as phones for business and home users, were also
lower because of tough competition, although sales of facsimile machines
increased.
NTT saw its cost base rise in its telecommunications business as it spun off
various businesses which had been conducted in-house, and depreciated fixed
assets such as digitalised switches and fibre-optic cables being introduced
in preparation for advanced communications services.
NTT expects increased competition in the long-distance sector will continue
to affect results in the second half. The company is planning to apply to
the ministry of posts and telecommunications for a rise in basic telephone
charges.
Revenues for the full year are expected to rise to Y5,826bn from a previous
Y5,809bn, helped by revenues from pre-paid telephone cards which are
expected to total Y72.4bn.
Costs, however, are forecast to rise by about Y5bn in the second half as a
result of a voluntary retirement programme and higher depreciation costs,
taking recurring profits down to Y104bn from a previous Y109.5bn. Net
profits are forecast at Y45bn against Y41.4bn.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Slack fuel demand hits Japan's
gas companies - Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's gas utilities were hit by sluggish demand for fuel during the
exceptionally hot summer and a cut in charges in order to pass on the
benefits of the strong yen to consumers.
The companies reported sharp falls in household demand as families refrained
from cooking hot meals due to the record temperatures, and overall use of
hot water fell.
Tokyo Gas, Japan's largest city gas supplier, fell into the red, posting a
half-year recurring loss - before extraordinary items and tax - of Y4bn
(Dollars 40m), on a 5.7 per cent decline in sales to Y347bn. The company
reported after-tax losses of Y4bn. Gas sales to households plunged 10.2 per
cent while the rate cut hit sales by Y9.3bn.
For the full year to next March, the company, which has more than 7.5m
customers mainly in Tokyo and five prefectures, expects a 25.9 per cent fall
in recurring profits to Y27bn on a 2.9 per cent decline in sales to Y802bn.
Interim recurring profits at Osaka Gas dropped 88.5 per cent to Y1.3bn while
sales fell 4.2 per cent to Y274.3bn. After-tax profits plunged 83.6 per cent
to Y948m. Sales of gas to households fell 10.8 per cent, while industrial
demand rose 8.7 per cent due to an increase in usage of gas-fuelled air
conditioning.
For the full year to next March the company expects an 18.1 per cent decline
in recurring profits to Y31bn on a 2.9 per cent fall in sales to Y621bn.
Osaka Gas is Japan's second largest city gas supplier, servicing more than
5.5m customers mainly in Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe.

spite of what it says is a shortage of entrepreneurs in the region able to
take on franchises.
The company says it will spend up to Dollars 650m in increasing the number
of outlets from 60 to 500 by the year 2000. Most of the new restaurants will
be in central Europe, with about 20 per cent in the former Soviet republics.
Mr Andreas Hacker, managing director of McDonald's Central Europe, said
yesterday the company was still relatively unknown in central and eastern
Europe. He added it was having difficulty finding franchise partners because
'we are looking for a type of entrepreneur that is basically non-existent in
these countries'.
He said potential franchisees must be familiar with products, quality
control, staff management, and 'how to give a TV interview'.
Only 25 per cent of the 60 outlets in the region are owned by franchisees,
compared with 80 per cent worldwide. Mr Hacker said the ratio of franchised
to company-owned outlets in the region would fall as the brand name became
more familiar and more suitable entrepreneurs emerged.
McDonald's yesterday announced an agreement, initially worth Dollars
500,000, with ICL, the UK computer company, to supply computer services to
link newly-opened outlets to its regional headquarters in Vienna.
McDonald's has invested about Dollars 100m in central and eastern Europe to
date.
It has 23 outlets in Hungary, 12 in the Czech Republic, 18 in Poland and one
in Slovenia.
It also has three restaurants in Serbia, and another three that have been
closed because of the UN embargo on the country will be re-opened when the
blockade is lifted, Mr Hacker said.

Montgomery Asset Management, the San Francisco-based investment manager, and
Barings Securities, part of the UK investment banking group, yesterday
announced a Dollars 100m investment fund which will focus on communications
and services in the emerging markets. The Montgomery Emerging Communications
Fund will place up to 10m shares.
Mr Oscar Castro, who currently manages the Montgomery Global Communications
Fund, will act as principal portfolio manager for the fund, which will be
registered as a closed end investment company in Bermuda.
Baring Brothers is sponsor to the issue and Baring Securities is the placing
agent. The placing is not underwritten.
'New technologies can offer emerging markets countries cheaper and faster
solutions to their communications needs,' said Barings. 'For example, in
some parts of Thailand and the Philippines, cellular telephone networks are
being installed instead of standard land lines.'
Montgomery will also target opportunities in broadcasting, media and cable
TV.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: SEC investigation at PaineWebber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber, the US securities firm, is being investigated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission as part of what is believed to be a broader inquiry
into the sale of limited investment partnerships.
PaineWebber said yesterday that it was co-operating with the SEC and said it
believed the vast majority of the partnerships were properly sold. However,
the firm qualified its assertion by saying that wherever the firm has
discovered that the partnerships were sold improperly to clients unsuited to
that form of investment, it has taken prompt action to resolve clients'
claims, and would continue to do so.
The investigation is similar to inquiries at Prudential Securities, which
found that Prudential brokers had sold clients high-risk energy and property
limited partnerships as low-risk, secure investments. Prudential ultimately
agreed to pay more than Dollars 700m in fines and restitution, and the firm
was put on probation for three years by federal prosecutors.
Although the PaineWebber investigation is not as large as the Prudential
case, it is believed to focus on at least Dollars 2bn of limited
partnerships sold by the firm.
The SEC is reported to be seeking to determine whether brokers
systematically misled clients about the risks involved in investing in
energy and aircraft-leasing partnerships.
The agency is said to be pursuing similar inquiries at other firms, but an
SEC spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any
investigations.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Czech utility to issue eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEZ, the Czech electric utility, will become the first east European
corporation to launch a eurobond next week, marking the region's growing
access to international debt markets.
J. P. Morgan, the lead manager, is marketing the Dollars 150m five-year
issue on a roadshow and is expected to begin selling next Monday or Tuesday.
A rating of BBB-minus from Standard &amp; Poors and CEZ's status as the only
investment-grade east European borrower point to aggressive pricing at about
100 basis points above treasuries.
CEZ is a special case in being the largest quoted company in central eastern
Europe, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.95bn.
While market commentators do not expect CEZ to start a rush of east European
companies to the bond markets, the issue does indicate a trend.
Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank of Hungary, the first bank - rather than
corporation - to tap the euromarkets, this week launched its second
eurobond. The DM150m seven-year issue was run by Bayerische Landesbank of
Germany, the Hungarian bank's minority shareholder.
On the syndicated loan markets, Ceskoslovenska Obchodn Banka and Komercn
Banka of the Czech Republic set new benchmarks for east European borrowers
by achieving pricing of 70 and 65 basis points respectively above Libor.
A benchmark for both the CEZ issue and to some extent the landmark
syndicated loans was the City of Prague's Eurobond issued earlier this year,
which trades at 85 basis points above treasuries.
Investment bankers expect other utilities to follow CEZ's lead. The two
banks which have dipped into syndicated loans are also understood to be
considering borrowing on the public market.
Poland's recent agreement with its creditors clears the way for its
companies to borrow long-term and internationally. First, however, the
Republic of Poland has to make its return to the debt markets with a planned
five-year eurobond deal.
CS First Boston, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, all US investment banks, are on the shortlist to manage the
transaction and a decision is believed to be imminent.

Santa Fe Pacific, the US railway company at the centre of competing bids,
yesterday advised its shareholders to turn down the latest Union Pacific
offer in favour of an agreed merger with Burlington Northern.
Burlington's Dollars 3.1bn offer would not be payable until the deal had
been approved by federal rail regulators. Union Pacific is offering Dollars
3.3bn and says it will acquire Santa Fe immediately, putting its shares into
a voting trust pending regulatory approval.
Santa Fe's board said that Union Pacific's bid was 'too uncertain' because
it was not clear that the regulators would allow it.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Review of Microsoft's Intuit
purchase extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department anti-trust division has extended its review of
Microsoft's Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Intuit, a leading publisher of
personal finance software, potentially delaying the deal.
The acquisition plan was submitted to the Justice Department last month for
a routine 30-day review. Microsoft acknowledged yesterday, however, that it
had received a 'second request' for information from the Justice Department,
extending the review beyond the normal deadline.
'We believe this is an indication of the commitment of the Department to
thoroughly review (the transaction),' Microsoft said. 'We remain confident
it will be approved.'
Microsoft declined to comment, however, on what aspects of its plan were
being questioned.
Competitors fear the deal could allow Microsoft, the world's largest
software company, to achieve a dominant position in the emerging market for
on-line financial services. Microsoft already leads in several other PC
software segments. It holds an estimated 80 per cent share of the market for
operating system programs that control the basic functions of a PC.
Intuit is one of the few companies to have competed directly with Microsoft
and won. Intuit's Quicken program is used by about 6m PC owners, or 75 per
cent of all 'active personal finance users', according to Intuit.
Microsoft's competing Money program has captured only a tiny share of the
market since it was introduced two years ago.
In an attempt to avoid anti-trust problems, Microsoft has agreed to divest
its Money program to Novell, another software company, for undisclosed
terms.
A broad anti-trust investigation this year of Microsoft's business practices
was concluded when the company agreed to change the way it licenses software
to PC manufacturers. As part of that agreement, Microsoft was placed under
the scrutiny of US and European competition authorities for six-and-a-half
years.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Nasdaq strengthens its defences
 -Allegations of collusion have prompted action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nasdaq stock market has been under fire this year over allegations that
its dealers colluded to fix their prices so they could profit at the expense
of investors. Yet, until recently, the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which operates the market, was slow to defend itself and its
members, much to the unhappiness of some Nasdaq dealers.
Now, however, the NASD has brought out some big guns. Last week, the
association named a seven-strong select committee, headed by former US
senator Mr Warren Rudman, to conduct a review of the Nasdaq market, the
second largest in the US after the New York Stock Exchange.
The NASD hopes that the appointment of the blue-ribbon panel - which
includes well-known figures from the world of investing and market
regulation such as Mr Peter Lynch, the prominent fund manager, and Mr Irving
Pollack, a former head of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange
Commission - will appease those who say the association has not been taking
allegations of price fixing seriously enough.
Some critics, however, are still unhappy. They say the committee is packed
with too many industry insiders (one of the seven is a former NASD chairman
and two are former NASD governors) and are surprised that the panel has been
asked to review everything about the Nasdaq market except the allegations
that dealers broke anti-trust laws by fixing prices to maximise profits.
As one former top NASD official put it: 'Since they aren't allowed to look
at the trees, looking at the forest is going to be kind of hard.'
The NASD, however, says it would have been improper to ask the committee to
review matters which are the subject of more than two dozen class-action
lawsuits, as well as separate investigations by the Justice Department and
the SEC.
However, Mr Richard Ketchum, NASD chief operating officer, says the
committee will be free to examine the wider issue of how prices are
determined and how trades are executed on Nasdaq, and whether there is
genuine competition among the dealers.
Although Mr Rudman said this week that his committee did not want to get in
the way of the Justice Department's investigation, he gave an assurance that
they would 'look where we have to look', and that the panel would talk to
the two finance professors whose study of Nasdaq spreads sparked the
inquiries and lawsuits in the first place.
The study, by Mr William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Mr Paul
Schultz of Ohio State University, found that spreads between the buy and
sell prices quoted by Nasdaq dealers on stocks of many big companies were
unnecessarily wide. It concluded the only explanation was that dealers had
agreed to keep spreads wide to maximise their profits - even though it meant
denying investors the best possible price on each trade.
The study, and a second report by the professors which later appeared to
back up their initial findings, prompted scores of investors to file
lawsuits against Nasdaq dealers - including some of the biggest Wall Street
firms - claiming they had violated anti-trust laws by illegally fixing
prices.
Ever since the first study's findings were published, the NASD has
consistently denied that its dealers colluded to fix prices (the dealers
have remained quiet, pending the lawsuits). This week Mr Ketchum reiterated
the NASD's view on the matter. 'If there is anti-competitive activity going
on in the market . . . we would welcome anyone identifying it.' But, he
said, 'we don't believe the economic data in the two studies give any clear
evidence that there was anti-competitive activity going on in the
marketplace.'
Mr Ketchum points out that that the study focused only on price quotations,
rather than actual trades. The NASD claims that many trades are executed at
prices that are better than those advertised by dealers on the screens, and
they also say that wide spreads are necessary in some stocks to ensure there
is sufficient liquidity in the market to accommodate investor orders.
Amid the various investigations, inquiries, lawsuits and select committees,
the controversy over Nasdaq prices has raised broader questions about US
equity markets, and whether investors are best served by the current
structure of competing marketplaces offering investors the opportunity to
trade via different, and in most cases unconnected, trading systems.
Mr Junius Peake, professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorado
and an expert on the structure of US markets, says the problem of pricing on
Nasdaq is just one of many faults within the market infrastructure. 'The
iceberg has stuck its peak above the surface of the water.'
Mr Peake believes the controversy over price fixing highlights the
weaknesses inherent in a system that allows markets (not just the NASD, but
the NYSE and other exchanges) to regulate themselves. 'The incident
demonstrates the folly of combining self-regulation with the operation of a
commercial enterprise like a market.'
These are the sort of issues he believes will be addressed next year by
Congress, which in the wake of the price-fixing charges is likely to want to
take a close look not just at Nasdaq, but at all US markets. The central
problem, says Mr Peake, is relatively straightforward: 'The market
structures are not as protective of customers' interests as they ought to
be.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp fall in provisions boosts
Bank of Montreal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in loan-loss provisions helped Bank of Montreal post its fifth
consecutive year of record earnings, with fourth-quarter income jumping by
one-third.
The bank, which is the first of Canada's 'Big Six' banks to report 1994
results, lifted earnings to CDollars 825m (USDollars 603.8m), or CDollars
3.01 a share, for the year to October 31, from CDollars 709m, or CDollars
2.59, a year earlier.
Return on equity climbed to 14.9 per cent from 14.1 per cent, and return on
assets to 0.68 per cent from 0.63 per cent. Assets have risen by 18 per cent
in the past year, to CDollars 138.2bn.
Fourth-quarter earnings far exceeded analysts' estimates, jumping to
CDollars 268m, or 99 cents a share, from CDollars 201m, or 74 cents, a year
earlier. Return on equity for the latest period was 18.7 per cent.
The bank is widely expected to raise its dividend.
Loan losses for the year fell to CDollars 510m from CDollars 675m, in spite
of a doubling in general provisions to CDollars 200m, which the bank said
was a prudent move during the business upswing.
The bulk of the drop in loan-loss provisions took place in the fourth
quarter, when write-downs almost halved to CDollars 99m from CDollars 175m.
The bank said the improvement took place across its entire portfolio of
individual, commercial and corporate loans, but especially in the property
sector.
Non-performing loans dropped by 40 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn.
One of the few setbacks was a 12 per cent slide in earnings from foreign
exchange operations.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: US heads Europe M&amp;A league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investment banks dominate a new league table of advisers on mergers and
acquisitions into Europe announced so far this year. CS First Boston leads
the list, having been involved in Dollars 11.6bn worth of deals, double the
activity of its nearest competitor.
Altogether, six of the top 10 advisers are of US origin compared with three
last year. The highest placed UK-based house is SG Warburg, in eighth place.
While some executives at US investment banks were quick to attribute their
success to superior skills and resources, others saw it as a sign of the
recent surge of US investment into Europe.
'It's a reflection of high transatlantic activity,' said Mr Klaus
Diederichs, co-head of European M&amp;A for J. P. Morgan, which came second in
the table.
Warburg said it too had enjoyed a series of transatlantic deals, but in the
other direction. Securities Data, which compiled the table, showed the it as
a leading adviser to European acquirers.
Competitors were surprised by CS First Boston's strength, and the firm
conceded that in any single period there was an element of luck and that the
extent of its lead was artificial.
The house has nevertheless, among other roles, advised Boots of the UK on
the sale announced last week of its pharmaceutical business to BASF of
Germany, and Swiss Re on the disposal of its non-insurance businesses.
CSFB has had a reputation as a bond house and it suffered a traumatic
reorganisation after the departure of its long-time London head, Mr
Hans-Jorg Rudloff.
It credited its improved position to a doubling of resources in corporate
finance between 1989 and 1991, and the European flavour given by its link
with Credit Suisse of Switzerland.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Film sales surge helps Disney to
record term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King,
more than offset a downturn in its theme parks to produce record earnings of
Dollars 226m in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 78m last
time.
Group operating profits, before losses at Euro Disney, the theme park near
Paris, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m.
For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full
year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m compared with
Dollars 684m.
In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to Dollars
189m, on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn.
Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) were down 18 per
cent for the quarter at Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher.
International tourist traffic was lower, the company said, and costs had
been written off for the proposed Civil War theme park in Virginia, which
Disney abandoned in the face of widespread opposition.
Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters
and books from the films, were up 33 per cent at Dollars 95m on sales up 36
per cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The
Lion King, Disney said.
The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, compared with
Dollars 415m for the quarter and Dollars 110m, down from Dollars 515m, for
the year.
Earnings per share for the quarter were 42 cents against a loss of 15 cents,
and for the full year, Dollars 2.04 compared with 55 cents. Full-year net
income was Dollars 1.11bn, up from Dollars 300m.
Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with
Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has authorised
the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still authorised
under the existing programme.
At yesterday's closing share price of Dollars 43, this would cost the
company about Dollars 4.4bn.

Trygg-Hansa has a thorn in its US side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When Mr Lars Thunell took over as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, the
Swedish insurer, three weeks ago, he knew his priority would be sorting out
the group's troubled relationship with its loss-making US associate, Home
Holdings.
What he did not know was how quickly those problems were to intensify.
Home's share price more than halved between November 4 and November 17, and
last week the group's senior debt was downgraded by Moody's. Trygg's own
share price fell 8 per cent last week.
Trygg-Hansa bought into Home, a company more than twice its size, in 1991 to
help it become one of the world's leading industrial and commercial
insurance groups. The Swedish group holds 64.5 per cent of Home's capital
and 47.2 per cent of its votes.
Home is one of the largest US property and casualty insurers, with 1993
gross premiums of Dollars 2.42bn. Professional liability is a particular
speciality, and the group ranks as the market leader in insurance for
lawyers.
The US group has run into deep problems, the chief of which has been its
exposure to long-tail environmental and professional liability claims. These
have forced it to strengthen its reserves by Dollars 465m over the past two
years. Its difficulties this year have been compounded by high leverage,
rising US interest rates, intensifying competitive pressures, and earthquake
and cold-weather losses.
Nine-month figures from Home and Trygg reflect the impact. Home suffered a
Dollars 131m loss for the period, after reserve-strengthening of Dollars
175m, and Trygg was hit by SKr1.4bn (Dollars 190.9m) in Home-related losses,
dragging it to an overall deficit of SKr1.76bn.
Ideally, Trygg would like to be rid of Home, or at the very least,
substantially reduce its ownership. Mr Thunell says Trygg should concentrate
on what it does best - that is, its successful life and non-life business in
Sweden. This differs from the internationalist approach of his predecessor,
Mr Bjorn Sprangare, who was forced to quit the company during the summer,
partly because of the problems at Home.
However, untangling itself from Home is not proving easy. Last December,
Home launched an initial public offering aimed at reducing its leverage and
cutting Trygg's ownership sharply.
The offer, however, raised less than half the Dollars 355m originally sought
and Trygg was left with a far higher stake in the company than it wanted.
Since then, it has tried to find a partner willing to take some of Home off
its hands, but the search has proved fruitless.
The problems have been crystallised by Home's need to strengthen its balance
sheet following its latest reserve-strengthening. It wants to raise Dollars
250m in new capital through an equity or debt issue, or a bank credit. Trygg
has also said it is willing to convert some or all of a Dollars 170m loan to
Home to equity.
The trouble is that the collapse in Home's share price - down to Dollars
4.25 early yesterday from a listing price last December of Dollars 17 - and
the Moody's downgrading have made the refinancing task more difficult.
Moody's said its decision to cut Home's senior debt rating to Ba2 from Baa3
reflected 'continued adverse loss development in Home's long-tail lines of
business, such as professional liability, and from environmental, asbestos,
and breast implant litigation'. It also warned that Home might have to
strengthen its reserves still further.
This leaves Trygg with a dilemma. If Home cannot refinance itself any other
way, does it bail out its US associate in the hope that the group's
performance picks up and it can sell out at an acceptable price in the long
term? Or does it reduce its commitment and leave the Home to sort out its
own affairs? There are other possible solutions, including a sale by Home of
some of its operations.
Trygg executives say the worst-case scenario would be for Trygg to write off
its entire investment in Home, a move which would reduce Trygg's solvency
ratio to around 60 per cent from 132 per cent.
'We have no more obligations apart from some minor reinsurance commitments,'
said Trygg. The current value of Home's equity in Trygg's books is SKr2.16bn
and the debt SKr1.33bn.
Analysts, however, warn that if Trygg does try to walk away, it could face
lawsuits from disgruntled policyholders and shareholders.
The situation is going to require all of Mr Thunell's expertise in crisis
management - expertise gleaned while he was president of Securum, the asset
management group set up last year to handle the failed loans of Nordbanken,
the biggest casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis.
Mr Thunell knows Trygg can ill-afford another blow to its reputation after
the huge losses it suffered following the collapse of Gota AB and Svenska
Kredit in 1992.
He also knows Trygg cannot afford the distraction of Home when it needs to
concentrate on the Swedish domestic market, where competition is
intensifying.

<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, reported a
Sch123m (Dollars 11.2m) pre-tax profit in the third quarter, as its recovery
from two years of losses continued, driven mainly by cost-cutting. The
company recorded losses of Sch190m for the same period last year.
Sales at the partially-privatised group rose 8.6 per cent to Sch21.07bn,
reflecting 'slightly improved' overall market conditions. However, the
exploration and production sector remained in loss due to low crude oil
prices and a weak dollar.
The directors said they remained confident the group would achieve a profit
in the full year.
The gas division was once again the largest contributor to earnings, with
third-quarter pre-tax profit almost unchanged at Sch320m. Turnover was up 10
per cent to Sch1.74bn.
The refining division saw its lowest margins since 1989, with sales down 1.5
per cent to Sch11.7bn, mainly because of lower prices for oil products. The
division posted profit of Sch70m profit, 12.5 per cent lower than in the
third quarter of 1993.
Profit in the marketing division was down nearly 20 per cent to Sch130m.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: La Corporacion revamps zinc unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
La Corporacion Banesto, the Spanish industrial group, is planning to
recapitalise Asturiana de Zinc, the world's fourth-largest producer of zinc
metal.
Analysts believe this is a preliminary step towards La Corporacion reducing
its majority stake in the company.
La Corporacion, owned by Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), has told the
Madrid stock exchange commission it intends to re-adjust Astu-riana's
balance sheet, by first reducing the company's capital by Pta15.4bn (Dollars
119m). It will then, through a debt-to-equity conversion, inject fresh funds
of Pta15bn in a rights issue which will be wholly-subscribed by La
Corporacion.
La Corporacion will pay above market price for Asturiana's new shares: in
any event, it will not pay less than Pta1,600, compared with the current
trading price of just over Pta1,500. The deal will raise its holding in the
company from 51 per cent to around 55 per cent.
Analysts said the financial engineering would significantly strengthen the
zinc company's balance sheet by reducing its debt from Pta31bn to Pta16bn.
Also, an upturn in zinc prices indicates Asturiana is set to increase
profitability. It is expected to turn forecast losses this year of Pta3.2bn
into profits of Pta2.5bn next year, and of Pta7.9bn in 1996.
La Corporacion realised Pta1.6bn in September when it sold 23 per cent of
its shareholding in Asturiana.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Saab-Scania lifts Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investor, the central holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg
empire, saw pre-tax profits surge to SKr2.28bn (Dollars 311m) in the first
nine months, after a strong performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned
vehicle and aerospace unit.
The result, which compares with a SKr156m profit in the same 1993 period,
came after Saab-Scania rebounded to a profit of SKr2.18bn after financial
items, from a SKr362m loss.
Saab-Scania's performance has been driven by higher sales and earnings from
its Scania truck and bus division. These offset falling sales and increased
losses at Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence.
Investor, which apart from Saab-Scania has strategic holdings in leading
Swedish companies such as Astra, Ericsson, Stora and Electrolux, said the
value of its investment portfolio on September 30 was SKr28.9bn, down 1 per
cent from the start of the year after adjusting for net changes.
The group expanded its portfolio through the purchase of its Export-Invest
stablemate earlier this year.
Investor's result included SKr710m in capital gains and SKr477m in dividend
receipts. Shares were sold for a net SKr852m.
Saab-Scania saw sales climb to SKr22.2bn from SKr17.6bn, while operating
income after depreciation soared to SKr2.32bn from SKr108m. The star
performer was Scania, where sales jumped 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn and
operating income after depreciation rose to SKr2.45bn from SKr311m. Sales of
trucks and buses rose 28 per cent to 23,500 units.

FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cometa-SRM takes lead in Spanish
telecoms race

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cometa-SRM, a consortium led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Vodafone, the
UK telecommunications operator, has taken the lead in the battle to obtain a
mobile telephony licence in Spain with a cash bid of Pta89bn (Dollars
689.9m).
The consortium entered a higher bid than its rival Airtel-ASR, which has the
US telecoms company AirTouch as its main foreign partner. Airtel-ASR bid
Pta85bn.
The offers were well above the minimum Pta50bn established by the tender's
rules, and sufficiently close to keep the result of the contest open. The
winner will be announced before the year-end.
Under the rules of the tender, the competing consortia are also required to
make undertakings covering industrial investment, job creation and research
and development.
The prize is a GSM (global system of mobile communications) licence to be
the second operator in the Spanish mobile telephony market, forecast to have
turnover of Pta210bn and 2m subscribers by 1998. The other GSM licence has
been reserved for Telefonica, the government-controlled group which now
faces the first significant incursion into its domestic telecommunications
monopoly.
BBV, a big Spanish retail bank, has a 30 per cent shareholding in Cometa-SRM
and Vodafone, 23 per cent. Both companies sharply increased their initial
stakes.
DeTeMobil, a unit of Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, has 10 per cent of
Cometa-SRM's equity. Smaller shareholdings in the consortium are held by the
domestic utilities Endesa, Sevillana and Iberdrola, and by La Caixa, the
Catalan savings bank.
AirTouch has 16 per cent of the rival Airtel-ASR group, and British
Telecommunications, the second technological backer in the consortium, has 7
per cent stake. The main financial partners are the domestic banks Banco
Santander and Banco Central Hispano, which share 27 per cent of the
consortium's equity, and five regional savings banks which jointly own a
16.7 per cent stake.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Readicut declines to Pounds 5.4m after
contract problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Readicut International fell 20 per cent at the interim
stage as the household textiles, carpeting and yarn company suffered
production difficulties on a military contract.
The Yorkshire-based group lost Pounds 1.2m on a contract at its textile
bonding division, which had to take over the manufacture of ballistic
products from a sub-contractor.
Analysts cut full-year profit forecasts from about Pounds 18m to Pounds
14.5m. The shares closed down 4 1/2 p at 67 1/2 p.
The pre-tax profits decline, from Pounds 6.73m to Pounds 5.41m, in the six
months to September 30, was on lower turnover of Pounds 100.7m (Pounds
113.4m). Last year's figures included the discontinued operations of Firth
Furnishings, the car carpets producer, and Readicut Wool, the handicrafts
distributor.
Operating profits on continuing operations also declined, to Pounds 5.72m
(Pounds 6.67m), as margins were squeezed by raw material price rises.
Polymer prices rose by 80 per cent in the six months, with UK wool costs
increasing by 20-30 per cent.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said: 'Conditions in the UK are still not
ideal and continental Europe is still difficult.'
The core carpet division reported operating profits of Pounds 2.68m (Pounds
2.07m) on turnover of Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 41m) as its US activities enjoyed
better trading conditions. The UK operation, Firth Carpets, replaced a 10
per cent drop in domestic sales with a similar rise in contracts.
Yarns and fibres lifted operating profit to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.79m) on
turnover of Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 23.6m) as the company succeeded in passing
on the higher raw material costs.
However, furnishings and household textiles dipped into the red with
operating losses of Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 801,000 profits) on turnover up 11
per cent to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.3m).
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 665,000) and gearing fell
from 18 to 5 per cent.
Earnings per share declined to 1.83p (2.36p) and the interim dividend is
held at 0.63p.
On the revised profit forecasts the prospective p/e is 14 at yesterday's
closing price. Analysts said they were surprised by the textile bonding
losses and the speed with which raw material costs had affected Readicut's
profits.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole Technology falls Pounds 1.3m into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based manufacturer and market leader in
high powered notebook computers, lost money last year as anticipated, as it
continued to invest heavily in manufacturing infrastructure, research and
development.
Revenues grew strongly, however, and there was an operating profit of Pounds
671,000 in the second half of the year. The share price, which has been
climbing steadily over the past few months, slipped 11p to 402p.
The loss before tax amounted to Pounds 1.3m, compared with profits of Pounds
749,000. Revenues grew 42 per cent to Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 22.9m) while
losses per share came out at 5.4p (3.5p earnings). No dividend is
recommended.
Tadpole's principal products are high performance note-book computers, where
it reckons to have a six to 12 months lead over other manu - facturers - and
electronic circuit boards which it designs and builds for other companies.
Its growth in revenues this year, 79 per cent of which derive from the
notebook workstation business, result from the success of its 'Sparcbook'
line, designed around chips from Sun Microsystems. It is also designing
notebook computers for International Business Machines and Digital
Equipment.
This year it announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.1m) order for Sparcbooks to
be used by the US Air Force. It has also taken a Dollars 20m order for the
development and manufacture over four years of customised printed circuit
boards for an as yet unnamed customer.
Tadpole's principal development this year has been the launch of the world's
most powerful notebook personal computer based on Intel's Pentium chip.
Tadpole claims that its machine is at least twice as fast as competing
products. Analysts believe it could sell between 5,000 and 25,000 of the
machines next year at prices in excess of Pounds 7,000 each.
Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the company might have to raise new
money for manufacturing infrastructure if the machines proved more
successful than expected. There might be problems with a shortage of chips
and colour monitor screens. He said the current year showed excellent
prospects for revenue and earnings growth, biased towards the second half.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Molins makes Pounds 28m buy and Pounds
12.2m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Molins, the tobacco and packaging machinery group, is acquiring a
Nottingham-based maker of specialist packaging machinery for a maximum
Pounds 28m and is placing 2.46m shares at 498p a share to help pay for it.
Sandiacre is being acquired for an initial Pounds 27m plus a profit-related
Pounds 1m. The initial consideration is being met by the issue of 521,236
new shares and Pounds 12.2m in cash plus the Pounds 12.2m proceeds of the
placing.
Yesterday the shares closed at 515p, down 3p.
Sandiacre, with net assets of Pounds 3.5m, makes machinery which forms bags
from rolls of plastic material, fills them, and seals them. Typical goods
packaged using the machinery are coffee, sugar, powder detergent, and crisps
and snacks.
Molins has long sought an acquisition outside cigarette making, which
accounts for most of its profits. 'We have been very picky,' said Mr Peter
Greenwood, managing director. 'We were looking for a specialist machinery
maker with world potential.'
He believes Sandiacre, which made operating profits of Pounds 3.8m on sales
of Pounds 9.7m in the year to the end of July, is 'almost an ideal fit' with
Molins' strategy of concentrating on machinery that handles delicate
materials at high speed.
Sandiacre would benefit from Molins' engineering experience, but more
importantly Molins' worldwide sales network would take it into new markets.
'We expect to provide service and support in markets where Sandiacre has
barely scratched the surface,' said Mr Greenwood.
Half of Sandiacre's sales are in the UK, with most of the rest going to
Europe. Molins expects to sell the machinery in the US, South America and
south-east Asia.
The company is at present 100 per cent owned by the founding Davison family
and their interests. Mr Clive Davison will stay on as managing director.

On turnover up 12 per cent from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 3.39m pre-tax losses
were Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 60,000) after taking a share of Pounds 125,000
(Pounds 71,000) of the joint venture loss. Losses per share came out at 1.4p
(0.29p).
The USM-quoted company, which supplies holographic film, hoped the deferred
business would benefit the second half. The joint venture arrangement had
been reorganised so the US partner would be fully responsible for funding
and bear any losses after October 1 1994.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Laird plans Pounds 68m rights issue -
Pounds 80m programme of investment and acquisitions lined up for 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laird Group, the manufacturer of automotive components and building
products, has launched a surprise Pounds 68m rights issue to fund a heavy
programme of capital expenditure and acquisitions amounting to some Pounds
80m by the end of 1995.
The move was unexpected, given that the group's gearing is estimated at
around 24 per cent, and that Laird is not looking at any substantial
purchases.
However, Mr Ian Arnott, chief executive, said: 'We've always had
conservative long-term financing policies. We are setting up a strong
financial framework for the future.'
The announcement was accompanied by a pre-tax profits forecast of at least
Pounds 46m for 1994, at the upper end of City forecasts.
Mr Arnott said there were positive signs of a pick-up in automotive sales in
Europe, after a bleak 1993. Further benefits were being reaped from
acquisitions outside the automotive industry, he added.
Laird's 1-for-5 rights issue is priced at 295p, representing a 17 per cent
discount to Monday's closing price of 356p. The shares fell 6p yesterday.
The company had rights issues in 1989 and 1992, both primarily to fund
capital expenditure. One analyst said: 'I would like to see the company
demonstrating that it can fund internal expansion from its working capital.'
However, Laird is partly reacting to strong demand, leading it to invest in
extra capacity at Fullarton, its US subsidiary supplying the personal
computer industry, and its car body seals operation in Spain.
In the past two years, Laird has pushed ahead with diversification outside
automotive products, making acquisitions in printing and packaging, window
security and plastics.
Mr Arnott said Laird would like to build up 50 per cent of its profits from
non-automotive products, and this would absorb substantial capital
expenditure.
At the end of October, the group had net borrowings of Pounds 53.8m, and
these would have started to increase sharply.
Laird's forecast of a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was
accompanied by a forecast final dividend of 6.9p (6.5p), putting the shares
 -at yesterday's close - on a p/e of close to 14 and a yield of 3.2 per cent
for 1994.
COMMENT
Rights issues with no immediate justification are always hard to sell, but
Laird Group's offering is at least in keeping with the conservative
character of the group. The offer will dilute earnings per share in 1995,
since Laird is investing in projects with a long-term pay back. Analysts
pushed up profit forecasts to around Pounds 57m for 1995, giving a
prospective p/e of 13.4. However, despite economic recovery in the US and
UK, profit margins remain under pressure and the shares look fully valued.

Hammerson has made its second French property acquisition inside a week,
paying Pounds 32.6m for the controlling interest in a property subsidiary of
Axa, the French insurer.
Hammerson is buying 66 per cent of Compagnie des immeubles de la Plaine
(CIPM), which owns 55 boulevard Haussmann in central Paris.
The property comprises 114,000 sq ft of retail and office space. The annual
rental income attributable to Hammerson under the deal is about FFr19m,
suggesting a yield of 6.8 per cent at the purchase price.
Last week, Hammerson paid Pounds 55m for a shopping centre located just
outside Paris. The company raised Pounds 250m last month from the sale of
its Australian property assets.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Anglo Irish Bank turns in 57% advance to
IPounds 14.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo Irish Bank Corporation, which is listed on the Dublin stock exchange,
reported a 57 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 14.5m (Pounds
14.3m) for the year to September 30, despite sluggish loan demand in the
first half.
The bank's UK operation reported a return to profit with IPounds 1.3m
compared with a loss in 1993 of IPounds 333,000.
The bank, with its core lending to small and medium sized business,
increased earnings per of share from the 1993 level of 4.98p, as adjusted
for a rights issue, to 5.02p.
The rise was achieved despite additional personnel costs as the company
expanded its UK managerial staff and a share capital increase following the
rights issue in January.
Net interest income was slightly ahead at IPounds 27.9m (IPounds 26.8m).
Fee income more than doubled to IPounds 5.38m (IPounds 2.1m).
Treasury profits were also substantially ahead at IPounds 3.1m. However,
overheads were also higher, at IPounds 13.6m (IPounds 12.4m).
.There were bad debt write-offs of IPounds 6m.
Non performing loans stood at IPounds 30m. The bank maintains a conservative
policy, with 86 per cent of non performing loans provisioned for.
The deposit base improved, with deposits up 23 per cent to IPounds 1.18m.
The bulk of new deposits came from smaller retail customers.
The bank reported slack loan demand in the first nine months, but a marked
improvement in the last quarter, which has continued through the first 6
weeks of the new year.
Leasing business has been virtually static, although 1994 saw a strong
advance in total assets, which grew 31 per cent to IPounds 1.4bn.
A final of 2p is recommended, for a 3.36p total.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional lifts Whitecroft to Pounds 8.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based lighting, textiles, building products and
medical cotton fibres group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 8.74m for the six months to September
30.
However, Pounds 5.91m of this came from the disposal last April of
Whitecroft's option to renew its lease on a Stockport office block.
Stripping this out gives a fairer picture of Whitecroft's success at
restructuring, after its near-collapse in the recession. Operating profits
were 55 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.83m, on turnover only 10 per cent up at
Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 60.8m).
Earnings per share were boosted to 16.7p (3.6p) as a result of the
exceptional item, which accounted for 11.7p. The remaining 5p, however, has
encouraged Whitecroft to pay its first interim dividend - 1.5p - since the
recession caught the company badly exposed in property markets.
By stressing the exceptional nature of the results, Whitecroft is dampening
expectations that however successful it is in its normal markets, the
company may not be able to match this financial performance next year.
It has given its investors a roller-coaster ride for the last four years,
but is stressing that future profit fluctuations should be temporary or
technical.
Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, said disposals and sales from
Whitecroft's written-down property portfolio have reduced borrowings to
under Pounds 10m and gearing to 29 per cent. A year ago, gearing was 119 per
cent and borrowings Pounds 30m.
All divisions made operating profits, with lighting the star performer at
Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.89m). Medical cotton fibre - used in tampons and
medical products - made only Pounds 567,000 (Pounds 1.06m) because of a 50
per cent rise in world cotton prices. Passing some of this on to customers
saw sales volume drop by 7 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northern Foods declines 26% - Threat of
second-half restructuring charges to cover closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Foods warned that plant closures and job losses would force it to
take a restructuring charge in the second-half as it reported a 26 per cent
drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 53.7m.
The dairy and foods manufacturer blamed the setback on rising milk costs and
intense pressure on its selling prices from retailers.
Milk costs were up 10 per cent or Pounds 50m after price increases by the
Milk Marketing Board and Milk Marque, its successor. Mr Christopher Haskins,
Northern's chairman, attacked Milk Marque for 'its abuse of monopoly power'.
Northern's profits are expected to fall by about Pounds 15m this year but
longer term the group hoped to recover about half the increased costs
through higher prices. The rest will come from closures and other
cost-savings.
Analysts, who estimate the restructuring charge could be about Pounds
30m-Pounds 35m, were disappointed that it would also cover non-dairy areas
such as cutting van distribution to small retailers and rationalisation of
meat production. The shares closed down 8p at 204p.
Operating profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 72.6m in the six months ending
September 30. Interest charges were Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 9.3m) and there was
a Pounds 11.5m loss on disposals.
Dairy operating profits fell 14 per cent to Pounds 34.5m on unchanged sales
of Pounds 476.4m. Doorstep milk sales fell by 12 per cent while supermarket
sales rose. Home milk sales were likely to fall from 45 per cent of
Northern's total milk sales to 30 per cent.
Convenience foods fell 18 per cent to Pounds 18.2m on sales down 2 per cent
at Pounds 262.3m. Factors included lower bread sales, start up problems at a
Manchester plant and reduced sales from its delivery vans to small shops.
However sales volumes to Marks &amp; Spencer rose 5 per cent and sales to it and
three other large chains, J Sainsbury, Tesco and Asda, now accounted for 35
per cent of group sales.
Meat products fell 16 per cent to Pounds 8.2m on sales down 2.6 per cent to
Pounds 125m. Progress with large chains offset declining sales to small
shops and caterers.
Grocery profits rose 25 per cent to Pounds 11.9m on sales up slightly to
Pounds 106.6m. Fox's biscuits, the bulk of the division, increased its
market share by half a percentage point to 6.5 per cent.
The interim dividend was unchanged at 3.5p from earnings per share of 6.37p
(9.37p) or 8.37p before exceptionals.
COMMENT
These disappointing results show that Northern has a lot of remedial work to
do across the group. Moreover, it is revisiting long standing problems such
as doorstep milk delivery and van sales. Pre-tax profits this year of about
Pounds 130m, before provisions, are possible for earnings of 17p and a
sector typical prospective p/e of 12. With no prospect of earnings growth
for 12-18 months, the shares will live on their 5 1/2 per cent yield.

<TEXT>
Cathay International, the China-oriented investment group, yesterday
announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.57m in the six months ended September
30, against a Pounds 515,000 loss.
The company is involved in two substantial China investment projects that
have been held up by Beijing bureaucracy. Operating profits however, rose
from Pounds 168,000 to Pounds 2.03m on revenues from its two hotels.
The Landmark Hotel, in the Southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, contributed
only 3 months of revenues, following its official opening on June 21.
Mr Stephen Hunt, deputy chairman, said the hotel experienced 75 per cent
occupancy in October, with room rates gradually being raised, and revenues
starting to come through strongly from its food and beverage operations.
The Xiyuan hotel remained profitable, but progress with the proposed 500,000
sq metre redevelopment on an adjoining site has been slow.
The company has received formal approval for its Dollars 143m (Pounds 87.1m)
investment in a 60 per cent stake in a franchise to operate four toll
bridges and a tunnel within the city of Guangzhou (Canton).
Earnings per share amounted to 0.025p (0.267p loss), but there will be no
dividend.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Utd Breweries refinances and buys Inn
Business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Breweries, the financially troubled public house operator controlled
by Mr Vijay Mallya which has had its shares suspended since September, has
finally come to an agreement with its bankers about a refinancing.
Following support by Mr Mallya's UB Group of India and an unnamed
institutional shareholder, a refinancing has been agreed which will be
accompanied by a capital reorganisation, a placing and an open offer to
shareholders.
The USM-quoted company, which had debts of Pounds 9m in September, is not
disclosing the sum it hopes to raise, but the shares will be offered at
substantially below the current suspended market price of 6 3/4 p.
UB is also to acquire Inn Business, a privately-owned public house operator
with 70 houses. The deal - for an undisclosed consideration - will more than
double the number of public houses operated by the group.
The group originally breached its banking covenants last April after a
Pounds 7.2m write-down in the value of its public houses.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery reflects cost cutting at
Pilkington - The glass maker has finally found favour with the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City has found little good to say about Pilkington's management since it
fought off BTR's Pounds 1.2bn bid way back in 1987. However, the tune has
finally changed. Yesterday analysts were full of praise, particularly for Mr
Roger Leverton who was brought in as chief executive in July 1992.
'They deserve a lot of applause for what they have done. For Pilkington, the
recession has been a good experience,' said Mr Robert Donald, of NatWest
Securities.
The recovery in half-year profits owed much to an improvement in
Pilkington's main markets. But management action also deserves credit.
Criticised for being slow to cut costs at the onset of the recession, the
company has since set about the task with a will. Almost Pounds 300m has
been taken out of costs over the past four years with Pounds 42m, or 4 per
cent, going in the six months to September. About 600 jobs went in the first
half and another 1,000 are set to go before the end of the year.
The brisker than expected cuts and a strong performance in Brazil pushed
Pilkington's profits comfortably above analysts' estimates. As a result,
NatWest increased its full-year forecast from Pounds 119m to Pounds 140m,
before disposal gains, and from Pounds 200m to Pounds 220m in 1995-96. For
the following year it predicts profits not far short of the 1989 peak of
Pounds 330m.
That will require a continuation in the price recovery being shown in most
of Pilkington's main markets.
The main weak spot is Germany where prices for double glazing units are
still sliding despite strong demand. Although the German float glass price
is still 40 per cent below its 1989 level, two price rises have pushed it up
by about 10 per cent this year. But this has not arrested the decline in
downstream prices. 'We have just put in another 5 per cent increase in float
to try to force manufacturers to increase their prices. There is a limit to
how much cost increases they can absorb,' said Mr Leverton.
He points out that the capacity situation can change quickly. 'In the US
there was a lot of surplus capacity 18 months ago. Now we are running at 100
per cent, with shortages in certain areas.'
This has followed rapid growth in demand for value-added products, such as
Galaxsee, Pilkington's 'privacy' glass for cars. Currently all the rage
among fashion-conscious US car buyers, Galaxsee takes up more capacity and
commands a premium price.
Despite recent disposals Pilkington's balance sheet remains stretched.
Gearing, which reached 86 per cent following the purchase of Heywood
Williams, was cut to 66 per cent at the end of the first half. But the
company will fail to hit the year-end target of 50 per cent, partly because
of the postponement of the partial flotation in Australia. Pilkington has
also restated its balance sheet to take account of revised accounting
standards relating to US retirement benefits. This has reduced shareholders'
funds by Pounds 100m, adding 7 percentage points to gearing.
However, interest cover widened to more than two times in the the first half
and Pilkington remains determined to work out its debts without resort to a
rights issue.
Its capital expenditure is running well below depreciation following the
huge investment in new capacity in the late 1980s. Pilkington's main current
projects are in South America, where it is building a float glass plant in
Chile and a third line in Brazil. But there are some slightly ominous moves
by its rivals elsewhere.
At least two new float plants are planned in the US, where car production is
about to peak, and two large European distributors are planning to move
upstream with a float plant in Alsace.
There is a long way to go yet, but when Pilkington's business peaks again,
that will be the real test of its management.

Moran Holdings, the USM-quoted provider of management, financial and tea

June 30 against losses of Pounds 274,000.
The results reflected the group's reorganisation, said Mr Peter Theobald,

Mr Theobald added that the directors were negotiating an acquisition that
would make a 'significant contribution' to the surface forwarding division's
prospects.
Turnover of continuing operations rose to Pounds 49m (Pounds 45.9m).
Earnings per share emerged at 6.74p (16.64p loss) and steps were being taken
to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account, Mr Theobald said,
so that dividend payments could be resumed.
The shares closed 8p higher at 62p.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe attacks GEC's export record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace, which is fighting GEC for control of VSEL, the submarine
maker, yesterday attacked its competitor's record as a military exporter.
In a document sent to shareholders alongside its revised offer for VSEL, BAe
points out that its export sales have grown from an annual Pounds 1bn to
about Pounds 3bn over the past decade, while GEC's military exports have
only grown from Pounds 400m to Pounds 700m.
The document also highlights that GEC has only won one export order for two
warships to Malaysia in the past 10 years while Vosper Thornycroft, a
competitor in small warships, has increased its export business from Pounds
40m a year to Pounds 140m in the same period.
The UK lags behind French and German warship yards for exports to countries
such as Australia, Greece, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Turkey,
according to the document.
As well as attacking GEC's export record, BAe continues to argue that GEC's
bid for VSEL unnecessarily eliminates competition between warship makers,
and runs counter to the Ministry of Defence's competition policy. It quotes
the ministry as saying that 'competition is the cornerstone of our
procurement policy'.
The Office of Fair Trading is considering the competition merits of both
bids. It is not thought that the MoD has raised significant objections to
GEC's bid with the OFT. GEC has argued that little real competition will
exist in UK shipbuilding whoever owns VSEL.
GEC declined to comment on the allegations made in the document. However,
the MoD is thought to be disturbed by the prospect of a full-scale war of
words breaking out between Britain's two largest defence contractors.
BAe also claims that GEC's abilities as a prime contractor are unproven
while it has a strong track record, and attacks GEC's record on the Nimrod
radar contract. However, GEC was not the prime contractor on this contract
which was run by the MoD.
The formal document also confirmed that BAe's cash offer had been increased
to match GEC's at Pounds 14, and is offering 3.3 BAe shares for one VSEL
share, up from 2.747 shares in its original offer.
VSEL's articles of association have been amended to allow BAe to buy the
company provided it wins the support of a majority of shareholders. A
similar meeting of VSEL shareholders to allow GEC's bid to go through is
scheduled for tomorrow.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Lowndes Lambert lifted to Pounds 6m by rise
in new business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite increased competition in its sector, Lowndes Lambert, the
London-based insurance broker, increased first half pre-tax profits by more
than 15 per cent to Pounds 6m.
The group attributed the rise to growth in new business. Profits were also
boosted by a first contribution from Whiteley Henshaw Hindle, a UK insurance
broker, acquired for an initial Pounds 4.65m in June.
Excluding acquisitions, pre-tax profits for the six months to end September
increased from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 5.8m. Total turnover rose from Pounds
37.2m to Pounds 43m.
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, said conditions in the group's main markets
remained difficult, but he expected 'further steady progress' in the second
half. The group announced a reorganisation to remove overlaps between
businesses and to focus UK activity into three divisions: UK non-marine,
marine and international.
Mr Shaw said Lowndes would be well placed to take advantage of any shake-out
in the insurance broking sector resulting from increased competitive
pressures and the trend by many large companies towards buying fee-based,
rather than commission based, services.
Lowndes' growth was largely based on 'middle-tier' companies which continued
to benefit from the broking services the group offered, he said.
The group announced a 10 per cent increase in its interim dividend to 2.75p
(2.5p).
Earnings per share rose to 6.9p against 6.1p last time.
The shares closed 9p higher at 168p, with analysts impressed at the group's
performance in tough conditions.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hydraulics side lifts Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boosted by 'strong growth' in the hydraulics division, pre-tax profits at
Sterling Industries, the engineering group, leaped from Pounds 1.69m to
Pounds 3.37m in the six months to September 30.
Cayzer Trust Company and Caledonia Investments own 48.8 per cent and 21.1
per cent holdings respectively in the group, while Sterling has a
cross-holding of 9.7 per cent in Caledonia.
Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the hydraulics side had experienced 'good
growth in sales', which had led to imp-roved margins. The group had been
developing a new range of valves - solenoid, in particular - and some of the
increase was attributable to new products coming on stream.
The thermal process division, accounting for about two-thirds of group
sales, also lifted profits substantially, though while the increase in the
US was good news, the difficult trading in Germany and the UK was bad.
However, Far Eastern contracts, derived from the Australian operation and
achieved through 'effective marketing of our fibreglass know-how', gave a
boost to the division's figures.
Group turnover grew sharply to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 18.3m) and operating
profits swelled to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 422,000). Investment income,
including dividends from Caledonia, and minus interest payable was Pounds
1.11m (Pounds 1.01m).
Earnings rose to 8.81p (4.62p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p
(1.8p), though some 0.4p of the rise is to establish a better balance
between the interim and final pay-outs.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Royalty loss hits Kewill shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Kewill Systems fell 32p to 244p on the news that the USM-quoted
software group stands to lose Pounds 500,000 in royalty income in the second
half, following the collapse of Microway, its main distributor in Germany.
The company, which distributed Kewill's CAD-CAM building services systems,
was put into receivership last week.
However, Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said he was confident that 'any sales
shortfall will only be short term'.
Mr Overstall also admitted that the group's marketing link with IBM was not
yet generating the big orders originally anticipated, with lead times longer
'and maybe a year or so out'.
Meanwhile, pre-tax profits at Kewill Systems advanced 23 per cent, from
Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.17m, for the half year to September 30. Turnover
edged ahead from Pounds 16m to Pounds 16.4m.
UK operating profits improved 25 per cent to Pounds 1.49m. Profits in the US
were 60 per cent ahead at Pounds 720,000, assisted by the 'strong
performance of the US economy', said Mr Overstall.
Group operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 2.44m (Pounds 1.97m).
Net cash stood at Pounds 600,000 at the period end. A maiden interim
dividend of 2.5p is declared on earnings per share of 12.16p (10.15p).

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher chairman receives Pounds
514,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food processing and
distribution group, was paid a total of Pounds 514,000 in the year to August
31 - a rise of 44 per cent.
The Pounds 156,000 increase, revealed yesterday in the company's annual
report and accounts, has angered some fund managers.
One described the rise as 'totally inappropriate considering the size and
state of the company'.
Albert Fisher's share price has underperformed the FT All-Share Index by 30
per cent since the beginning of this year, and the company is currently
capitalised at approximately Pounds 300m.
Pre-tax profits for the year to August 31 were Pounds 34.8m compared with
Pounds 26.9m.
The increase in Mr Walls' total emoluments was due to the payment of a
Pounds 48,000 bonus and a Pounds 150,000 pension contribution. The amount he
received as 'salary, fees and other benefits' actually fell by 12 per cent
from Pounds 358,000 to Pounds 316,000.
The report states that Mr Walls' bonus was 'based on the achievement of
stated personal objectives'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Revival of US airline boosts GPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company rescued from collapse last year,
returned to profit forthe six months ended September 30. The turnround was
because of settlements received from the revived US airline America West,
which recently emerged from bankruptcy.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Dollars 5.3m (Pounds 3.23m), compared with a
Dollars 39m loss, after the payment of Dollars 171m interest on its Dollars
5.13bn debt mountain. The figure was boosted by a Dollars 32m exceptional
credit. A Dollars 57m loan to America West has been repaid, and the Dollars
32m credit related to the settlement of additional claims against aircraft
leases to the airline.
GPA's turnover rose from Dollars 800m to Dollars 1.07bn and the company had
Dollars 832m positive cash flow from its operating activities. This included
Dollars 525m from the sale of aircraft, partly through a previously agreed
sales programme to GE Capital.
Borrowings fell by Dollars 358m to Dollars 5.13bn; however, this compares
with shareholders' funds of Dollars 192m.
The company recently took on Morgan Stanley as adviser and is hoping to
negotiate delayed repayment of Dollars 1.8bn of debt due in September 1996.
GPA is aiming for an 11-month extension.
Mr John Tierney, finance director, said: 'We believe the company has now
stabilised in terms of trading. We are beginning to see improvements in the
industry. We are now in a position to address the next major hurdle: the
1996 repayment.'
He emphasised that with recent disposals GPA's liquidity was the strongest
it had been for more than two years, and therefore the company would be able
to negotiate 'without our backs to the wall'.
Cash balances are Dollars 313m and available banking facilities are more
than Dollars 100m. However, GPA admitted that the aircraft leasing market
has not yet reflected the generally improved demand for air travel.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hartons director agrees to resign and sell
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A non-executive director of Hartons Group yesterday resigned from the board
of the semi-finished plastics distributor, one day after the board called an
EGM to unseat her.
Mrs Monica Maimann agreed to step down and sell her family's holding of
24.3m shares, representing 33 per cent of ordinary shares.
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the company's financial adviser, said it would attempt
to place the shares at no less than 8p before December 22, when Mrs Maimann
would be free to sell her shares independently.
Two weeks ago, Hartons said negotiations between two main shareholders and a
third party could result in a full offer for the group. The deal was thought
to involve a price of 8p per ordinary share.
The ordinary shares closed unchanged at 7p yesterday.
Hartons, which has incurred losses for the last four years, reported a
Pounds 325,000 pre-tax deficit on Pounds 25.7m turnover in the six months to
June 30.
Two non-executive directors have been appointed: Mr Julian Bell,
non-executive director of Ipeco Holdings, and Mr Barry Skipper,
non-executive director of Warburtons.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National retail banking margins widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A widening of margins in its retail banking business during the third
quarter of this year was reported by Abbey National, the home loans and
banking group.
In the three months to September 30 Abbey said it had increased its share of
net lending to the UK mortgage market to about 10 per cent. Its share of the
liquid savings market was, at more than 10 per cent, higher than its more
usual 8.5 per cent.
Mr Ian Harley, finance director, said that the wider margins partly
reflected the fact that Abbey had eased its pricing of loans in the third
quarter after a particularly successful first half of the year.
The mix between fixed rate mortgages, which accounted for fewer than 5 per
cent of loan applications, and variable rate lending had also had an effect,
he said.
Mr Harley said the changes were not unique to Abbey and would apply to
others in the retail savings and mortgage business, 'though I like to think
we've been ahead of the game'.
A further widening of margins could be expected for mortgage lenders in
general over the fourth quarter, which would take account of the opportunity
provided by the 0.5 percentage point interest rate rise in September.
Competition for personal savings had also eased, since the lack of vigorous
demand for home loans meant there was less pressure to attract large amounts
of retail funds.
Abbey's wider margins on the retail side have more than made up for the
tightening of the spreads earned on its treasury investment portfolio,
because of competition for high quality assets.
It also said that as the continuing downward trend of mortgage arrears and
repossessions slowed, the level of provisions against bad and doubtful debts
was approaching the bottom of the cycle.
This suggests that mortgage lenders in general will find falling provisions
will decrease in importance on the headline increases in pre-tax profits.
This is likely to intensify pressure to find income growth.
Abbey said that new business premium income from Scottish Mutual, one of its
life insurance subsidiaries, was 15 per cent higher in the first nine months
of this year, against the trend of the life sector. Within this increase
there had been a small drop in regular premium business.
Over the same period Abbey National Life, the other life offshoot, saw new
business premium income more than double, although this partly reflected the
fact that the operation was launched in February last year.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: NSM backs Budge's assumptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's largest independent coal companies yesterday backed the
assumptions used by Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, in his
controversial Pounds 914m bid for British Coal's English regions.
Mr John Jermine, executive chairman of NSM, which failed in its own bid for
the South Wales region, implied doubts behind RJB's bid could be
exaggerated. 'I do not think it is beyond reason that Budge's assumptions
will work out,' he said.
Mr Jermine said he was optimistic about the outlook for coal in spite of two
widely publicised threats to the UK industry - imports and the potential
shift from coal to gas-fired power stations.
Mr Jermine said coal was the cheapest fuel for power stations. The
generators 'still make more money from coal than from any other source of
energy,' he said.
Secondly, Mr Jermine maintains that imports are expected to become
increasingly expensive as transportation costs rise. 'Our prices in the UK
are already broadly competitive with imports on a secured stream of coal,'
he said.
However, he attacked the delay by the Coal Authority to reduce the royalties
it receives from independent coal miners. These have over the last 18 months
fallen from Pounds 5 to Pounds 2 per tonne for open cast coal. However, a
further expected reduction to 50p, which would make UK coal more competitive
with imports, had not yet been implemented.
Mr Jermine's comments on the British Coal bidding process almost
overshadowed his own company's buoyant performance in the first half and its
promise to pay the first dividend since 1990. Pre-tax profits for the six
months to September 30 rose by Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.7m, on sales 9 per cent
ahead to Pounds 62m.
NSM said it expected to pay a final dividend, in light of the continuing
improvement in the trading performance.
Profits in the first half were helped by a record year in the plant hire
business, and by lower interest charges of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.94m) after
the Pounds 40m rights issue in July.
The US mining division almost trebled pre-tax profits from Pounds 959,000 to
Pounds 2.3m largely due to reducing costs. Prices in the US remained under
pressure, and were not expected to improve until industrial activity picked
up.
In the UK, mining profits rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 4.4m. About
three-quarters of NSM's UK mining turnover comes from low margin contracts
with British Coal. However the bulk of profit came from NSM's own mines
which supply UK utilities on fixed contracts which run to 1998.
Earnings per share almost doubled from 3.5p to 6.9p. There was no interim
payout.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Music and rentals help Thorn EMI rise 27%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong performances by its main music and rentals divisions helped Thorn EMI
to lift interim pre-tax profits by 27 per cent from Pounds 99m to Pounds
125.8m.
The popularity of the latest releases by the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd
helped push up operating profits at EMI Music from Pounds 89.9m to Pounds
101.3m on sales of Pounds 877m (Pounds 778.3m) for the six months to the end
of September. Next week's release of a double album of recordings made by
the Beatles in the early 1960s for the BBC is expected to contribute to a
strong second half.
Thorn Group lifted operating profits from Pounds 52.6m to Pounds 57.9m on
the back of increased cost efficiencies and new products. Turnover rose from
Pounds 714.5m to Pounds 760.6m. In the UK, revenues from the rental base
were ahead for the first time in recent years, mainly because of the
Option-2-Own concept.
HMV, the music retailer, cut its interim losses to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 6.5m)
after a 17 per cent sales rise to Pounds 192.3m (Pounds 164.9m).
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, described the results as 'tremendously
positive' and a pointer to a good outcome for the year as a whole. 'We could
not have asked for anything better,' he said, expressing surprise at the
market reaction: the shares closed down 24p at 973p.
Total group sales fell to Pounds 1.94bn (Pounds 2.06bn), including sales
from discontinued operations. Sales from continuing operations increased
from Pounds 1.85bn to Pounds 1.93bn.
The operating loss at TSE, the remaining technology businesses including
Thorn EMI Electronics, fell to Pounds 4m, against Pounds 14.7m when there
were significant restructuring costs.
The group is in talks about the sale of its defence sensors business to
Racal Electronics, and its other defence business to Thomson-CSF of France.
The two divisions account for 80 per cent of Thorn EMI Electronics sales.
It expects to complete the sale to Thomson by the end of the financial year
in March. Yesterday Sir Colin said he hoped the sale to Racal would also be
completed by then.
Capital spending rose by Pounds 50.2m to Pounds 308m. Sir Colin said the
group was expanding in Europe, America, Australia and the UK, and was
investing in new rental products and new shops, as well as in information
technology and manufacturing in the music side.
Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 17.1p. After adjusting for exceptional
charges of Pounds 13.1m, mainly related to the sale of Thorn Security in
May, earnings were 21p, up from 16.4p when exceptional charges were Pounds
10m.
The interim dividend is 9.75p (9p).

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BTR condemns offshoot's window dressing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday condemned the year-end balance
sheet 'window-dressing' activities of Pilkington's Tiles, one of its
subsidiaries.
The move followed revelations that the financial controller at Pilkington's
Tiles had sent suppliers letters asking them to wait for invoice payments
due at the end of November until after the group's December 31 year-end. In
return Pilkington's suggested it would be willing to reciprocate for
suppliers.
Such an arrangement would typically enable the participants to show stronger
year-end balance sheets.
Yesterday BTR said: 'We neither authorise nor recommend letters of this
sort. Optimising cash flow and managing working capital are normal
commercial practices for most efficient companies and BTR is no exception.
'The BTR group as a whole is doing no more this year than it usually does.
We are not concerned about our cash flow or gearing. The group has
progressively reduced its gearing from 95 per cent at December 31, to 46 per
cent at end of June this year.'
Asked what action, if any, BTR intended to take against its subsidiary, the
company added: 'We are currently examining the circumstances in which the
letters were issued.' Analysts suggested yesterday that it was common
practice for big companies to attempt to improve their cash flow and reduce
their working capital.
The Pilkington's Tiles' proposal, however, is embarrassing for BTR since it
appears to go beyond the normal bounds of prudent balance sheet management.
It also flies in the face of government and Confederation of British
Industry's exhortations to big companies to reduce the length of time taken
to settle bills from small and medium-sized businesses.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Trimmed McLeod rises 23% to Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in McLeod Russel rose 10p to 117p yesterday as the group reported
increases in operating and pre-tax profits of 57 per cent and 23 per cent
respectively for the year to September 30.
Profits for the group, which has interests in surface coatings, air
filtration, environmental engineering and property investment, grew to
Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 5.16m) pre-tax and Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 5.17m) at the
operating level. Turnover expanded 24 per cent to Pounds 109.7m (Pounds
88.4m).
The year was one of integrating and returning to profit the Wheway
businesses, which it acquired in March 1993. Mr Paul Humphreys, finance
director, said: 'We have done a reasonable job, though there is still some
upside to come before we get a full return.'
While there had been no huge hidden problems within the lossmaking
environmental engineering company, he said the aggregate problems had been
greater than expected. He added that McLeod had been accurate on the cash
position, but that the profit side had been more difficult.
With the aim of reducing the group's overdraft from last time's Pounds
17.8m, McLeod sold most of the non-core businesses. Various 'sundry
businesses' had been retained because they took little management time and
generated cash and a decent return on capital employed, Mr Humphreys said.
However, Blakes Marine Paints had been sold because it was small, in a
different market sector, and a trade buyer had made an approach.
Losses on disposals were Pounds 490,000, but borrowings were reduced to
Pounds 10.5m for gearing of 31 per cent. Mr Humphreys said the pressure was
now off that area. Interest payable, however, rose steeply to Pounds 1.31m
(Pounds 490,000), reining in the pre-tax advance.
Earnings grew by 1p to 8.54p and the final dividend is lifted to 3.45p
(3.35p) for a total of 6.2p (6.1p).

FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Putting Pounds 1bn down the mines - A look
at RJB's controversial bid for British Coal's assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal may have faced a serious decline in its markets for most of its
47 years of existence, but there is no chance of that happening to RJB
Mining, the company chosen as preferred bidder to take over its English
mining assets.
That at least is the view of RJB and Mr Richard Budge, its chief executive,
and explains why it offered the government so much more than its rivals.
Even after 1998, when contracts inherited from British Coal run out, the
company assumes it will be able to keep sales steady at about 34m tonnes a
year from the three regions it is buying, much the same as the 35m tonnes
next year.
The problem is that RJB is thought by some analysts to have overestimated
the size of the post-1998 market by about 40 per cent and compounded the
error by assuming prices will be 20 per cent higher than they are likely to
be.
Even some coal and electricity industry executives who regard themselves as
optimists think the 'conservative' estimates that underpin the bid are at
the high end of the likely outcome.
An assessment of the post-1998 market is central to RJB's efforts to raise
up to Pounds 1.05bn to finance its Pounds 914m bid (the price is subject to
negotiation).
RJB can with relative ease persuade banks to lend some Pounds 628m.
The inherited coal contracts with electricity generators provide a
reasonable likelihood that the bulk of the debts can be paid back within
three years.
However, RJB's success in raising up to Pounds 425m through a share issue
depends to a large extent on expectations of the company's prospects after
1998.
The company, worth less than Pounds 160m at its suspended stock market
price, says it can offer potential shareholders dividend yields of about 4.5
per cent in the early years. That is unlikely to draw in many investors,
however, since it is only around the stock market average.
An investment in coal is perceived as risky.
RJB's big bait, therefore, is the policy, outlined to institutional
investors in a series of presentations, of 'rapid dividend growth after
reduction of debt' - mainly after 1998.
If the pessimists are right, the company will fail to produce the Pounds
220m a year pre-tax profits it believes are achievable by the end of the
decade. This would jeopardise dividend growth, with a consequent impact on
the share price.
It is not just investors who would suffer, however. Parts of Britain's coal
base could be lost for ever, according to pessimists, as RJB struggled to
make enough money to invest in pits.
The government's reputation on privatisation, already under fire from
opposition parties, would suffer a further knock.
But isn't this all too apocalyptic? Surely RJB and its adviser Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, not to mention the government's adviser, NM Rothschild, cannot
all have got it wrong?
In the past, Rothschild has been viewed as pessimistic about the coal
market: its predictions three years ago on the size of the pre-privatisation
market and the subsequent need for closures have proved to be accurate.
Mr Keith Palmer, a Rothschild managing director, is thought to be in broad
agreement with RJB's view of the post-1998 market.
In its City presentations, RJB uses figures supplied by Caminus, the
consultancy which advised the government in the coal review, for the worst
and best scenarios for the English electricity supply market after 1998. The
favourable case, for 54.6m tonnes including imports, will set shareholders'
pulses racing since it could provide the base for pre-tax profits even
higher than the Pounds 220m RJB is projecting in 1999-2000.
For sake of prudence they will also need to examine the 'conservative'
figure of 27.6m tonnes. According to some industry analysts, including
McCloskey Coal Information, which provides editorial for FT newsletters,
even this is too high. McCloskey says RJB's 'cautious' estimate for annual
capacity available to English suppliers is about 6m tonnes too optimistic.
It believes RJB has under-estimated the market share of nuclear power and
import links from Scotland and France in the late 1990s, as well as the
penetration of imports in 1999-2000. It also considers RJB's estimates for
the domestic and industrial markets to be high.
Industry executives adopt varying attitudes. According to one power company
executive the overall impression of RJB's conservative case is that it does
not allow for the worst possibilities for coal. But nor does he see the
projections as 'way off beam'. This is supported by figures in the
seven-year plan at the National Grid, power transmission company, which
suggest coal burn in the year 2000 will be between 25m and 33m tonnes.
Assuming RJB is right, the total market for coal in its conservative case is
35.5m tonnes. To achieve its aim of making Pounds 220m in 2000, RJB believes
it can sell 33.8m tonnes. That leaves little room for rival companies, such
as Coal Investments and Ryan Group, which will be fighting hard for market
share and may drop their prices to get it. Yet RJB's projections for prices
are also at the high end of expectations.
Mr Budge believes an average selling price of Pounds 1.32 is reasonable and
has been telling institutional investors that he believes the average price
for power station coal will be about Pounds 1.25 at today's prices.
Generator executives believe that is too optimistic, since coal can be
imported at prices of less than Pounds 1 a gigajoule. Coal Investments based
its failed bid for the two central England regions on prices of Pounds 1.10
or less and British Coal executives believe that is nearer the mark.
Another rival bidder for some of the five regions, whose tender also failed,
says RJB may be able to sell coal for an average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule
in 2000 and it may be able to sell 33.8m tonnes. 'But I can't see how he can
do both. If he wants to sell high volumes then he must keep prices low.
'The worst thing is that he will discover all of this around 1997 and if he
decides to go for high prices, he will have to cut volume. Coal mine
closures will be expensive.'
Mr Budge thinks otherwise. In his institutional presentations, he points to
rising prices on the international market and the expense of getting
imported coal to the inland power stations - the bulk of them.
He adds that if the worst came to the worst and the company did have to
reduce capacity, it would not be a disaster. There would be little need for
closures because opencast production, rather than that from deep mines,
could be varied. Nor would redundancy costs be high since the industry
employs several thousand contract workers.
With so much adverse publicity, Mr Budge and his advisers still have to do
some persuasive talking to be sure of raising the money they need. But Mr
Budge is impressing investors and there are signs that institutions are
believing his projections rather than those of his critics. Supportive
comments, like those made yesterday by Mr John Jermine, executive chairman
of NSM, another coal company, will add to the Budge bandwagon.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Vodafone's UK growth offset by start-up costs abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone, the UK market leader in cellular phones, returned better than
expected interim profits in spite of the impact of fraud and international
losses.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September were Pounds
186.4m, against forecasts between Pounds 175m to Pounds 185m and 7 per cent
ahead of the Pounds 174.5m in the same period last year.
Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 560.7m against Pounds 389.8m this time
last year. Earnings per share were 3.92p (3.90p in 1993 after adjustment for
the July 1994 capitalisation issue).
The interim dividend was raised 20 per cent to 1.64p, reflecting the
underlying growth of the business, according to Mr Ken Hydon, financial
director.
He said the company had continued to develop its operations overseas. Strong
growth in the UK had been substantially offset by increased start-up costs
overseas, amounting to Pounds 40m in 1993 against Pounds 19m a year ago.
In the UK, the number of subscribers rose by 263,000, an increase of 140 per
cent over the growth in the same period last year.
Vodafone has more than 1.45m subscribers connected to the network, but the
'churn' rate - a measure of the proportion of subscribers who leave the
network - rose from 21.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent.
The company said much of the churn was the result of fraud which had cost
the company some 1 per cent of UK turnover in addition to ordinary bad
debts, also about 1 per cent of turnover.
It blamed sub-dealers, acting between clients and retailers, who secured
commissions on the connection of phantom customers to the network. Others
causes included cloning or re-chipping of cellular phones, which is still
legal in UK law.
Of Vodafone's overseas operations, only those in Hong Kong and Malta are
profitable. Depending on how successful the company proves in bidding for
further overseas licences, there could be further large start-up costs in
the second half.
Capital expenditure and investments in the period amounted to Pounds 179m,
of which Pounds 115m was spent on overseas start-up operations. The group
has no net debt.

FT  23 NOV 94 / UBS wins test of strength on proxies: Showdown at meeting
attracts record attendance as Ebner loses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday narrowly won the first
proxy battle to be fought over a major Swiss company when it defeated Mr
Martin Ebner, the maverick Zurich bond fund manager, at an extraordinary
meeting which attracted a record 6,700 UBS shareholders.
The board needed to win a two-thirds majority of all votes and won 66.8 per
cent of those cast by both the company's registered and bearer shareholders.
The vote was over the board's proposal to convert registered shares into
bearer shares.
Sentiment in the packed sports stadium in Zurich during the two-and-a-half
hour debate was clearly behind the board, partly reflecting the presence of
many employees who feared for their jobs if Mr Ebner took control.
Mr Ebner, whose BK Vision is UBS's largest shareholder, immediately filed an
application for an injunction to prevent the bank from proceeding with its
plan to convert its registered shares.
BK Vision claims the registered shareholders should have been allowed to
vote separately on a plan that would strip them of their extra voting rights
without compensation. 'No one can leave this meeting with a good feeling,'
Mr Ebner said after the vote. 'There are no winners today.'
The board hastily put forward the share conversion proposal because it
feared Mr Ebner and his allies were trying to win control of the bank
through the accumulation of registered shares, which have a par value one
fifth that of the bearers.
The proxy battle, which was really over the board's strategy and
performance, attracted huge interest in Swiss financial circles.
The number of shareholders who attended yesterday's meeting was double that
of the last AGM in April. More than 88 per cent of the 35.9m shares with
voting rights were represented, compared with 58.2 per cent in April.
Even before the vote, the event was something of a moral victory for Mr
Ebner who has been pressuring the UBS board for three years to become more
sensitive to shareholder interests.
Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, said in an opening speech that raising the
group's earning power and exercising strict control over risk were the main
goals for the 1990s.
But Mr Ebner won applause for his complaints about the strong pressure put
on employees and customers to vote their shares in favour of the board.
BK Vision now has a week to produce evidence supporting its demand that UBS
be prevented by injunction from converting the registered shares into bearer
shares until an appeal is made.
If the injunction is granted, BK Vision will have two months to prepare its
appeal to the commercial court. This would almost certainly mean that the
registered shares, with their extra voting power, would still be in
existence for the next meeting in April.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Strong demand for TeleWest places Pounds 1.8bn value on
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the flotation of TeleWest Communications were six times subscribed
and have been priced at 182p, valuing the UK cable television company at
Pounds 1.8bn.
During preliminary trading in London and New York yesterday, ahead of the
issue of shares, there was strong institutional interest and deals were done
at a modest premium with the price going up to 195p at one point before
easing.
Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive, said he was pleased at the price
and 'real pleased that demand was equal between the UK and the States'.
TeleWest, a 50-50 joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US cable
operator, and US West, the regional telephone company, will be the first UK
cable company to join the London Stock Exchange. Dealing is expected to
begin in London and the Nasdaq exchange in New York on November 30.
The 182p pricing, or Dollars 28.50 per American Depositary Share, equals 10
ordinary shares. Of the Pounds 1.8bn valuation on TeleWest's equity, Pounds
1.5bn is ordinary share capital.
The pathfinder prospectus suggested a price range of 165p and 190p with a
total value for the company of between Pounds 1.61bn and Pounds 1.86bn. At
the offer price the net proceeds are around Pounds 360m.
Commenting on the response, Mr Michels said: 'The institutions now have a
much better understanding of the cable commercial model. They know they are
not going to get any income this year but I think we are building a very
valuable business.'
It is not clear what impact the TeleWest float will have on the much larger
flotation of British Sky Broadcasting. The satellite venture, in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake, has more
subscribers than cable and a larger revenue stream but less scope for
offering services other than entertainment.
TeleWest has to spend a further Pounds 1bn to complete its UK networks and
is unlikely to be profitable before 1998.
The company owns and operates 16 cable franchises while affiliated companies
own a further seven.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Waking up to the pension scheme threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a warning to European finance directors: beware of representatives
of AMP Asset Management offering you a computer disc to check the prospects
for your company pension scheme. The results could upset you. The
self-testing disc comes with a report called The Threats to Company
Sponsored Pension Provisions in Europe* which is equally careless of its
readers' peace of mind. Probably the threats are overdone, but it is clear
that many European companies have grown complacent about their pension
costs.
Only a few European countries have large numbers of funded company schemes.
The UK and the Netherlands feature separate corporate funds invested mainly
in securities, while Germany maintains a book reserve system in which the
liabilities are usually financed through the balance sheet. Schemes also
exist in Switzerland and Ireland.
Elsewhere in Europe unfunded state schemes predominate. These are coming
under immense pressure from social and demographic changes; the big French
industry-wide repartition schemes are in heavy deficit, and unaffordable
pensions promises are at the centre of the Italian budget crisis.
How will the pressures which are undermining state systems affect company
schemes? The report focuses on 15 company schemes in the UK, the Netherlands
and Germany, plus a Dutch industry-wide fund.
Raising the costs of company schemes are demographic factors, including
longer life expectancy and fewer younger employees, together with pressures
for early retirement.
Second, there is the likelihood that governments will try to offload state
pensions liabilities on to employers - for instance, through compulsory
contributions - while at the same time corporate taxes may be increased to
help solve budget problems. The UK government has already made one raid on
pension funds by modifying their dividend tax exemptions last year.
Finally, there are the investment risks. Returns were unsustainably high in
the 1980s and have tailed off. This might even be the start of an offsetting
period of poor returns. If inflation stays low, pension funds can live with
low nominal investment returns. But the great days of big surpluses and
contribution holidays will have to end.
In the US companies have been distancing themselves from these threats by
switching from defined benefit to defined contribution structures (which now
account for almost 60 per cent of corporate pension plan assets). Not only
is the investment risk transferred to employees but it is much harder for
companies to be forced through retrospective legislation to pay for upgraded
benefits (such as pensions for unmarried partners).
Why is AMP adopting scare tactics? It would like to break into the pension
fund management business in Europe, and it no doubt has an interest in
upsetting the the status quo. But as a subsidiary of the antipodean
insurance giant Australian Mutual Provident it also has an actuarial input
on the impending pensions crisis.
Australia has implemented a Superannuation Guarantee Charge, a compulsory
employer pension fund contribution that will rise from 3 per cent to 9 per
cent of pay (12 per cent including employee contributions) by 2002. In the
UK, the Labour Party's Social Justice Commission has just proposed
compulsory payments into second-tier funded schemes, and the National
Association of Pension Funds has warmed to the same theme.
In these circumstances companies running their own pension plans would face
a progressive loss of control of the funding costs and benefit structures of
the schemes. According to AMP, they should watch developments very closely
and consider switching to defined contribution funding or to external
providers.
There is an element of special pleading in this report. Insurance companies
are, after all, keen to recapture some of the company pensions business they
have lost over the past 40 years. But AMP is right to argue that now is the
time for companies to stop being complacent about their pension costs and
start to worry.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Cookson merger talks collapse on terms of deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merger talks between Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and
Cookson, the specialist industrialist materials concern, collapsed yesterday
after a failure to reach agreement on the terms.
Following the surprise news, Johnson Matthey shares fell by 9p to 565p - the
price they held before the companies confirmed negotiations were being held.
Cookson's shares ended 2p up at 247p, compared with 251p before talks were
announced.
If successful the deal would have been the largest agreed merger in UK
corporate history, creating a company with a market value of about Pounds
2.5bn and placing it in the FT-SE 100 Index.
A banker involved in the discussions said: 'Both companies had a clear idea
of their own worth and the gap between them was simply too wide. When it was
obvious no deal could be done, we all went out for a friendly drink.'
A joint statement stressed that relationships remained 'excellent'. Johnson
Matthey and Cookson have a new joint venture, Cookson Matthey Ceramics, the
world's second-largest ceramics business and an important element in the
operations of both groups. They said they would 'co-operate fully in the
development' of CMC.
The statement from Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson chairman, Mr Richard Oster, its
chief executive, and Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive of
Johnson Matthey, added: 'We looked fully into the ways in which a merger
might fairly have rewarded shareholders on each side. Sadly, we were not
able to agree a recommendation to our respective shareholders and so our
discussions have now ceased.'
Bankers insist that newspaper 'leaks' about the talks played no part in the
eventual breakdown in negotiations.
Mr Richard Malthouse, Cookson's company secretary, said his company would
probably send a note to its shareholders today which would include some
indication about present trading conditions. Johnson Matthey is scheduled to
announce its half-year results tomorrow.
Cookson took a hostile 8 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey in the late 1980s
but this was sold when Cookson itself ran into financial problems. Under Mr
Oster, a friendlier relationship has been fostered and there were widespread
rumours last year of merger talks.

FT  23 NOV 94 / US threatens Serbs with tougher bombing action: Attacks on
Bihac continue despite Nato raid on airfield
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A war of nerves intensified between the United Nations and the Serb forces
in Croatia and Bosnia yesterday as Mr William Perry, US defence secretary,
threatened to follow up this week's multinational bombing raid with much
tougher action.
Bosnian Serb leaders vowed to exact 'painful' retribution for Monday's Nato
action, which disabled the airfield at Udbina in a Serb-held part of
Croatia.
The exchange of threats came amid reports of fresh Serb gains in the north
Bosnian enclave of Bihac, where several villages were seized from Moslem-led
government troops and set ablaze. Government forces said hand-to-hand
fighting had broken out in a suburb of Bihac town, a UN-protected area which
occupies a small part of the enclave.
In a separate incident yesterday, two British Sea Harrier aircraft were
fired on by missiles over Serb-held territory during a routine patrol.
Neither was hit.
Mr Perry said any future operations against the rebel Serbs in Croatia would
include the destruction of aircraft as well as ground installations.
'If they go in tomorrow or the next day with another bombing attack, then
we'll go back and blow up their airplanes,' he said.
However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said air raids
against the Serbs should not be carried out too often. He said Moscow would
withdraw its own peacekeepers from Bosnia if 'massive air strikes' were
launched.
Monday's raid, by more than 30 aircraft from the US, the UK, France and the
Netherlands, disabled the Udbina airfield, targeted ground-to-air missile
systems, but deliberately avoided destroying aircraft.
Bosnian Serb leaders, in close alliance with the Serbs of Croatia, yesterday
warned of retaliation against the UN and Nato. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb state, said: 'We are
considering the possibility of retaliating. We will determine the time and
the targets, doing our best to make it very painful.'
General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, told the head of the UN
forces in former Yugoslavia that there was no further reason for
peacekeepers to be deployed in Bosnia and he could not guarantee their
safety.
Relief workers warned of an impending humanitarian disaster in Bihac, where
180,000 civilians cannot get emergency supplies. UN officials said the Serbs
seemed bent on preventing further convoys of food reaching the area as long
as the Bosnian government army went on fighting.
The Serbs, in alliance with the maverick Moslem leader Mr Fikret Abdic, have
subjected Bihac to a devastating counter-attack since losing ground in a
government offensive last month.
The UN office in Zagreb, in an unusually specific warning to the Serbs, said
there could be further punitive air raids if UN peacekeepers or the town of
Bihac came under fire. Any further use of ground-to-air missiles against
civilian targets could also incur punitive action, it said.
Reuter adds from Copenhagen: A Danish court yesterday sentenced Refic Saric,
a Bosnian Moslem, to eight years in jail for torturing prisoners of war to
death in a Croat-run prison camp in Bosnia last year.

Merger talks between Cookson and Johnson Matthey may have broken down
because the two sides could not agree on valuation. But the failure would
seem to confirm that there was little industrial logic in a combination. Had
there been, it would have been easier for one or other to give a little
ground on valuation. Instead, talks became bogged down as each side fought
for slightly greater shares of the merged company than implied by their
respective market capitalisations. The main driving forces behind the merger
talks were the ambitions of Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, and
Mr David Davies, JM's chairman, to run larger companies. Just because this
deal has failed, those ambitions are unlikely to have faded.

<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland's board is still on probation. The narrowness of
its proxy battle victory suggests that arguments put forward by Mr Martin
Ebner, UBS's largest shareholder, struck a chord with some other investors.
Mr Ebner may not have produced a compelling blueprint for how the bank
should be run. But he was right to prod it to improve its returns. Now that
the distinction between registered and bearer shares is to be abolished, the
effective premium enjoyed by the former should shrink - unless Mr Ebner's
legal challenge proves successful, that is. The bearer shares may also
tumble. By most yardsticks, UBS is expensive relative to other Swiss and
European banks. Unless the board is provoked by the narrowness of its
victory to sweat its capital harder, the premium rating will be unjustified.

FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 2 per cent drop in Thorn EMI's share price was an exaggerated
response to a solid set of interim figures. There were some modest
disappointments - for example continuing problems at Rumbelows and evidence
of intensifying competition in the US rentals market - but these were slight
in the context of the robust 15 per cent growth in core operating profits
and the 8.3 per cent increase in the interim dividend.
The higher than expected payout is an expression of the group's confidence
in the future. Investors should share this. The management will soon be able
to take the strategic tidying-up exercise a stage further with Thorn EMI's
expected withdrawal from its defence interests. Meanwhile the margin
enhancement targets it has set for both music and rentals seem achievable.
Even if return on sales in the music division did not improve in the first
half, the full-year figures should show progress towards the medium-term aim
of 16 per cent. As for rentals, the improvement in margins in the first six
months was impressive given difficult market conditions.
Assuming pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 400m for the full year, the
shares are on a deserved, if not generous, premium to the market. The near 5
per cent prospective yield provides support. But sustained outperformance is
likely only when and if the management revives the demerger plans, now
shelved, which so delighted the market earlier this year.

FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heady growth in the UK mobile market is finally exacting a price from
Vodafone. In the dash to sign on record numbers of customers in the six
months to end-September, administrative procedures became overstretched with
the result that fraud and bad debts shot up. The sums involved - roughly 1
per cent of turnover - are not huge. But the episode rams home the point
that the quality of Vodafone's customer base is deteriorating as the market
expands. This is also seen in the sharp increase in the company's annual
'churn' rate - the proportion of customers who leave - from 21.5 per cent to
26.5 per cent. Churn will now fall as procedures for signing up new
customers are tightened but, in return, Vodafone will have to sacrifice some
market share. In future, much of group growth will come from investment
overseas. But, as yesterday's Pta89bn bid by Vodafone's consortium for a
Spanish cellular licence shows, such expansion will not come cheap.
Meanwhile, the UK business remains vulnerable in the medium term to price
cutting. So far, Vodafone has managed to maintain prices despite the arrival
of new entrants offering large discounts. But once the new networks achieve
nationwide coverage, Vodafone will be under pressure to match their offers.
Even if a value of Pounds 1bn is put on the group's international operations
and its overseas losses are stripped out, Vodafone's shares still trade at a
healthy premium to market. That looks unjustified.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Opec to maintain ceiling on oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday took the
unprecedented step of deciding to keep its present production ceiling for a
full year in a bid to boost weak oil prices.
Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer, overcame objections from Kuwait,
Libya and Gabon to persuade oil ministers to maintain the 24.52m barrel a
day ceiling 'without reservation' for the whole of 1995.
That means there will be no formal commitment to review the ceiling at
Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June 1995.
But Iran, Opec's most persistent price hawk, said it would seek a lower
ceiling if prices failed to rise by June.
Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, was optimistic that the plan would
work. 'If you balance supply and demand, ultimately you get higher prices,'
he said.
Mr Gholemreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said he would also demand a
review if the Opec basket price rose above the organisation's target of
Dollars 21 a barrel. In October, the basket price averaged Dollars 15.36.
But a Gulf Arab delegate later said that 'any changes would take place only
as a result of special circumstances'.
Analysts and oil company executives believe yesterday's move will be a
positive factor for oil prices, which in real terms are at the same level as
1974.
The price of the benchmark Brent blend (January) closed unchanged yesterday
at Dollars 16.95 in spite of news of the agreement. But there were differing
opinions as to how high prices might go.
Some observers believe an Opec production freeze at a time of rising oil
demand will push prices above Dollars 25 a barrel towards the end of 1995,
if UN sanctions preventing Iraq from exporting remain.
Others are more cautious. Mr Joe Stanislaw of Paris-based Cambridge Energy
Research Associates said the agreement might add only 50-75 cents to the
average price in 1995.
Most of the growth in demand in the past year has been met by a surge in
production by non-Opec countries.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Government offers telecoms groups wider superhighway role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has challenged British Telecommunications and the UK's
growing band of public telecoms operators to play a full part in developing
the country's information superhighway.
In a Command Paper* published yesterday, it urged the operators to gain
experience by applying for local franchises to deliver a full range of
services, including broadcast entertainment, to homes within the franchise
area.
The paper confirmed, however, that the government does not plan to let BT
broadcast entertainment to homes nationally before 2001 at the earliest.
The issue is bitterly contested by BT, which has been banned from offering
broadcast entertainment over its network so that cable television can
establish itself. Cable television companies are, however, not barred from
offering telecoms services.
The Independent Television Commission, regulatory body for commercial
television, has advertised nine new local delivery licences - as cable
franchises are called - the latest in the past few days.
They are for four separate franchises in the Midlands, covering 248,000
homes.
The commission emphasised yesterday that BT could have applied for cable
television franchises like any other company.
BT said that the government decision meant 'the great leap in broadband
communication we were hoping to provide has been postponed for several
years'.
It is clear that BT does not intend to apply for large cable franchises,
such as that currently on offer which covers Northern Ireland. Instead it
wants the freedom to spend Pounds 15bn to create its own modern network to
compete against the cable companies.
Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said he had appointed a group
of senior industrialists to advise him on multimedia and the information
superhighway.
They includes Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, the industry
watchdog, and Mr Peter Job, chief executive of Reuters. BT is permitted to
offer services including video-on-demand and home shopping over its national
network, contrary to an FT report earlier this week. Creating the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission complains it is often accused unjustly of
unnecessary and intrusive meddling. However, proposals for EU audio-visual
policy currently being drafted in Brussels appear designed to prove its
critics right. They also raise questions about the commitment of the
Commission - and notably of Mr Jacques Delors, its president - to putting EU
interests above those of individual members.
The proposals would modify the EU's five-year-old broadcasting directive,
which calls on broadcasters to ensure that half their programming is of
European origin. As well as toughening this rule by removing a provision
that it be applied only 'where practicable', the draft modifications would
narrow the definition of programmes which could be counted as part of the
quotas and require half of independently-produced programmes to be recent
material. They would also set guidelines for investment in film channels and
ban advertising on home shopping services.
By any measure, these changes would traduce the Commission's purpose in
drafting the original directive. This was to harmonise national rules just
enough to remove obstacles to cross-frontier broadcasting. The provision for
quotas was inserted at the insistence of France, which threatened otherwise
to oppose the idea.
How far the directive has promoted a single market in television is unknown.
However, the aim of the proposed revisions seems clear: it is to protect
production houses and broadcasters from non-European competition, notably
from Hollywood.
The implied restrictions on free choice are intrinsically objectionable. By
seeking to impose a straitjacket on a sector which is exploding under the
impact of rapid technological change, the proposals also defy logic. At
best, they would be absurdly cumbersome to administer. At worst, they would
lock Europe's entertainment industries into the structure of the past and
deter innovation and commercial investment in emerging multi-media services.
Most damaging of all, the proposals would do nothing to advance the single
market. On the contrary, they could further undermine it by legitimising
continued protection of national industries. This seems to have been the
effect of the existing directive in France, its keenest proponent. Local
content quotas have been established by law and freely interpreted as
favouring French programming.
It is disturbing that much of the drive behind the proposed revisions is
from some of Mr Delors' closest advisers in Brussels. That inevitably raises
doubts about how far they are intended to benefit the EU, and how far to
serve French national interests. Mr Delors' fellow commissioners would do
well to remove any such suspicions by voting the proposals down. That would
also be the best outcome for Europe's media industry and its customers.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Opec dangers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday took the
unprecedented step of extending its production ceiling for a year in an
attempt to coax oil prices upwards. The move, urged on the cartel by Saudi
Arabia, its largest and most influential producer, suggests Opec's capacity
to influence the direction and stability of oil prices survives.
Whether prices rise in the next six months, as Opec hopes, depends partly on
whether the production ceiling holds, partly on what happens to the output
of non-OPEC suppliers and partly on whether world demand rises.
Unfortunately for Opec, the weather in many northern countries has been warm
so far this autumn. Nonetheless, the expansion in demand from rapidly
growing non-OECD countries is now large enough to compensate for recessions
in industrialised countries, in sharp contrast to the pattern in 1973 and
1982. As a result, world demand for oil, which hovered between 55m and 65m
barrels per day between 1973 and 1990, has broken out of that range to some
68m b/d this year.
On the evidence of this week's meeting, Opec should be able to deliver the
broadly predictable oil prices oil-importing countries desire, particularly
if the cartel continues to operate against the more comfortable background
of steadily rising world demand.
Over time, Opec's share of the world's production is also likely to creep
upwards, at least so long as investment in production outside Opec remains
restrained by moderate price levels.
But the result is also likely to be a growing concentration of output inside
Opec, since only Saudi Arabia looks capable of supplying much of any
longer-term increase in demand.
The markets have been more pre-occupied with the possibility that Iraq will,
at some point, resume exporting oil, once it has complied with enough of the
conditions imposed by the United Nations after the Gulf war. But its return
would probably add only about 1m b/d to world production, a third of its
pre-war levels.
The question about Iraq obscures the far greater importance of Saudi Arabia,
which accounts for a third of Opec production and a seventh of the whole
world's.
Provided that it has adequate resources to invest in more production, which
it should, even in its current cash-strapped state, it is well placed to
increase its share of Opec's output as world demand grows.
Saudi Arabia's ability to adjust its production to demand, in both
directions, can secure the price stability so much desired by the rest of
the world. It would do no harm if that stability were to be about a gently
rising trend. For the moment at least, the kingdom also feels it has a
strong interest in providing what is needed. The problem, however, is that
the stability of the world's oil market and so of the global economy is
correspondingly vulnerable to any Saudi political turmoil, or radical change
in objectives.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Chinese roads paved with gold: A look at a market that
western carmakers are eager to enter, in spite of the risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an invitation the world's carmakers could hardly refuse. When China's
Ministry for Machinery Building asked for ideas for a 'people's car' to be
submitted in conjunction with a small-car exhibition in Beijing, most large
international car manufacturers obliged.
As a representative of General Motors, which was displaying its
Opel/Vauxhall Corsa among other models in Beijing, said: 'When they say jump
 -people jump.'
China, which last year produced 234,000 cars from its own plants, currently
has fewer than 2m cars in use, of which fewer than 5 per cent are privately
owned. The ministry's 'Strategic Development Research Team of China's Family
Car' forecasts a steep rise to 22m by 2010. It predicts that by the year
2010, China will be producing 3.5m cars a year, two-thirds sold privately.
It is this prospect of an ever-widening circle of car owners in the world's
most populous country that is proving such a magnet. China's urban
population alone is 300m, which compares to continental Europe and exceeds
that of the US.
'Who can ignore an opportunity in a market that could be the world's largest
in 20 years?' asked Mr Toshiaki Yasuda, Nissan's chief representative in
China.
Under a new car industry policy unveiled earlier this year, China plans to
raise production by 2000 to between 1m and 1.5m, based on output from 'three
or four' large conglomerates that will be developed over the next few years.
This production would account for 90 per cent of demand from the Chinese
market by 2000-2003.
The foreign participation being sought by the government will help to
rationalise a motor industry that is highly fragmented.
'Consolidation is badly needed, if the sector is to benefit from economies
of scale,' according to a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
'The government's blueprint is to accelerate the natural process of
rationalisation in the industry over the next few years, in order to create
a few large and strong producers.'
China has set its sights on mass-producing a 'people's car' designed
specifically for the Chinese market. The question for Beijing - no less than
for foreign carmakers - is whether existing models that have been tried and
tested would fit China's requirements best, or whether a completely new car
is required.
At last week's motor show for small cars in Beijing, most of the world's
leading producers displayed cars from their existing ranges: Ford showed its
Fiesta, General Motors the Corsa, Nissan the Micra, Toyota the Tercel and
PSA Peugeot Citroen the Citroen ZX, which is already being produced in
China.
But it was the concept cars, specially designed for the Chinese market, that
captured most attention (see below). These included Porsche's C88 prototype,
a 1.1 litre five-seater that hogged the limelight, the Mercedes-Benz FCC
(Family Car China), and Mitsubishi's X-concept study derived from its
Chariot/Space Wagon small multipurpose vehicle.
At stake is the right to build a low-cost, fuel-efficient car for the
standard Chinese family, that could have sales running into the millions and
would provide a solid platform for growth in a market with enormous growth
potential.
With market growth sluggish in Europe and North America, the world's leading
carmakers are fighting to establish a presence in the world's emerging
markets.
According to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the
world's second largest vehicle maker, about 80 per cent of the world's
population live outside the traditional automotive markets of west Europe,
North America and Japan, but the number of cars and trucks sold in these
regions represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total.
The motor industry believes that the Asia/Pacific region holds the brightest
prospects, with sales in Asia (excluding Japan) expected to triple during
the next 15 years.
Japanese carmakers already have a stranglehold on most of Asia with as much
as 90 per cent of car markets such as the Philippines, Indonesia and
Thailand. In China, however, the Japanese producers have been held at bay,
and it is the European industry that has taken the early lead - its one
success story in the region.
Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, was a pioneer among western carmakers
in entering China, having signed its first joint venture in 1984. It claims
that by 2000 it will have a capacity to produce 660,000 cars and 830,000
engines a year - 300,000 cars a year at Shanghai Volkswagen and 360,000 a
year at FAW-Volkswagen, its joint venture with First Automobile Works in
north-east China.
VW claims that it has made 'huge strides' in developing the supplier
industry in China. Local content at the Shanghai plant now exceeds 80 per
cent, and it estimates that about 40 joint venture contracts and
approximately 100 production and knowhow licences have been agreed between
foreign - predominantly German - suppliers and local Chinese partners. An
additional 30 joint ventures are under negotiation.
'With our commitments in China, we are pursuing a strategic objective of
capturing a long-term leading market position in the region,' said Mr Martin
Posth, VW director for Asia/Pacific. 'China is envisaged as the main
production site with smaller satellite operations elsewhere in Asia.'
Ford is setting up a series of components joint ventures in China in the
hope that this will open the way for it to begin assembling vehicles in the
near future. 'We are eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China
at the earliest opportunity,' said Mr Frank Macher, Ford vice-president and
general manager of its automotive components division.
Chinese officials responsible for deciding which foreign manufacturer will
build the family car expect a decision by 1996, but are not committing
themselves as to whether one or more carmakers will be chosen. Mr Zhang
Xiaoyu, director of the Department of Automotive Industry in the Ministry of
Machinery Building, said that China would be guided in its decisions by
which of the companies 'provided the best terms for us'.
Mr Zhang said one issue that would influence the Chinese decision would be
whether the applicants' proposals complied with automotive policy, including
technology transfer and the development of the local components industry.
Foreign car producers say that even if a decision is made on the family car
proposal by 1996, production would not start before 1998-99 at the earliest.
This timetable suggests that China will have difficulty meeting its
production target of at least 1m cars by 2000.
The prospect of participating in the birth of a Chinese small car has
appeared too daunting for some companies in the world motor industry. BMW,
for example, considered participation through Rover, the UK carmaker it
acquired early this year, but held back.
'We have investigated it but we think one would lose a lot of money,' said
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board. 'Whoever does
this people's car project will not be successful financially.'
Mr Posth of VW acknowledges that two contradictory arguments confront all
industrial investors. The first says: 'You will certainly lose at the start,
if not in the long run as well. The initial phase will last much longer than
you ever thought it would.
'It will take far longer than you ever imagined to learn the rules in China.
You will be constantly hindered by your Chinese partner from doing the right
thing - they profess to know everything better, even though they had invited
you because of your technical superiority and managerial knowhow . . . And
where are those billions of consumers?'
On the other hand, said Mr Posth, 'by not being in China, you are perhaps
missing out on the chance of a lifetime. If your competitors are investing
in China and exporting from there, they will be able to beat you wherever
they like anywhere in the world.
'It may or may not be the end of the Deng Xiaoping era . . . but then where
can you invest without incurring some sort of risk? And don't forget what
people said in the 1950s about getting involved in Japan.'
The stampede by the world's carmakers into Beijing last week suggests that
few are prepared to be absent, however great the risks.

Dash, there goes another clever marketing gimmick. Sir Bryan Carsberg,
Office of Fair Trading supremo, has just ticked off Connell Residential,
Scottish Widows's chain of estate agents in southern England, for erecting
'SOLD' signs outside houses which had not been sold and indeed were not for
sale.
Sir Bryan said that he was concerned that the boards might mislead
consumers. That seems to be one of the OFT's understatements of the year.

Lewis Preston is wasting little time filling the large shoes of Ernie Stern,
who announced last Friday that he was leaving the World Bank vice-presidency
for JP Morgan. The hot tip in Washington is that his successor will be
Richard Frank, another American and currently vice-president at the
International Finance Corporation, generally known as the bank's private
sector, hard money sister.
The Preston logic, which has the full support of the US administration, is
that the bank is going to have to be ever more inventive in raising capital,
especially now that Senator Jesse Helms is threatening to take the axe to
anything smelling of foreign assistance and 'world governments'
unaccountable personally to him.
Frank, described as low-keyed and modest, certainly has the credentials. An
old World Bank hand who moved to the IFC in the 1980s when Sir William Ryrie
ran it, his principal responsibility has been raising funds through
innovative syndicated and co-financing schemes. Though not a novice in the
capital markets, the bank, according to its critics, and the countries which
it helps, could use more imaginative approaches in the capital markets as
official money becomes in shorter supply.
He will also be seen very much as Preston's man, which could never entirely
be said of Stern - the organisation's institutional memory and the man not
even World Bank presidents could circumvent with impunity. An announcement
is expected within days when the bank board next meets.

Nice touch. Harry Oppenheimer, the elder statesman of South African
business, has handed in his notice and plans to retire as a director of
world diamond giant De Beers on December 27 - the diamond anniversary of his
joining the board - in 1934.
Oppenheimer, 86, succeeded his father, Ernest, as chairman of De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd in 1957 and held the chair until a decade ago.
Oppenheimer said yesterday that he realised that 'many people will think -
and not without reason - that I became a director when I was far too young
and continued as a director until I was far too old'. Maybe so. But it will
be a long time before South Africa produces another industrial leader to
match his contribution.

Must try harder. Japan has just released documents which show that there had
indeed been an inexplicable delay in the transmission of the declaration of
war on the US before the bombing of Pearl Harbour in December 1941.
Yesterday the Foreign Ministry acknowledged that the delay in the delivery
of the declaration to the US government was due to mishandling on the part
of . . . the Foreign Ministry. It added that it 'accepts this as an
unforgettable lesson which should not be repeated again, and has been trying
to improve its working system'.
Fifty-three years after the event, and it is still not fixed?

Is it mere coincidence that the British Veterinary Association's president,
CP DeVile, is the namesake of Cruella, villain of the tearjerking tale of
101 Dalmatians? Pet-owners bereft of their furry friends might not think so.
Christopher Paul DeVile, giving evidence to the House of Commons agriculture
committee, said that the distress pets can suffer in quarantine kennels was
nothing compared with the welfare consequences of an outbreak of rabies in
Britain.
Predictably, DeVile sank his teeth into the committee's call for an
immediate lifting of quarantine restrictions.

Oh dear. Looks like someone may have been drinking something a little
stronger than tap water at last week's National Water Day conference in
Paris. Whatever the tipple, Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French conglomerate,
seems to feeling a bit off-colour.
The daily paper Liberation had been cross-examining Jerome Monod, the
company's chairman, on his company's efforts to win a contract for
reconstruction in the Gaza Strip from Yassir Arafat.
'I waited 15 hours, then was driven at 150km an hour through the streets of
Tunis to be brought before a sick and drugged man who took me in his arms
and kissed me on the mouth,' Monod is reported to have said.
Whether it was the reporter's pen or the executive's tongue that slipped,
Arafat did not find it very funny. Gabriel Banon, his economic adviser, told
Agence France Presse yesterday that six contracts negotiated with French
companies would be cancelled as a result of the comments, including one for
FFr30m with a Lyonnaise des Eaux subsidiary.
Monod was clearly also not amused. His company issued a statement last night
saying the report of his comments was 'taken out of context', 'erroneous'
and did not reflect the nature of his meeting in Tunis.
But more trouble may yet be in the pipeline. Monod also reportedly told
Liberation: 'In China, where we have more than 14 water concessions, I had
to drink the blood of a serpent cut open in front of my eyes.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Hope in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Angola's ceasefire calls to mind the axiom that second marriages are a
triumph of hope over experience. But this shotgun marriage could succeed.
Much has changed since 1991, when President Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas
Savimbi, the Unita leader, agreed a ceasefire, only for it to collapse the
following year. For the first time in three decades, southern Africa is
within reach of a comprehensive peace, built on democratic governance,
market economics and the aim of co-operative regional development.
Blame for the collapse of the last peace pact, which followed Mr Savimbi's
refusal to accept defeat in the 1992 elections, rests primarily on his
shoulders. But the collapse might have been averted had the settlement
provided explicitly for a government of national unity, and had the United
Nations received more support for its role in monitoring the disengagement
and subsequent creation of an integrated army. Instead, it was inadequately
resourced.
Both issues have been addressed at the Lusaka ceasefire talks. Unita has an
assured role in government, and the UN force will number 6,000-7,000 - 10
times the size of the 1991-92 contingent.
Among the most heartening elements has been the part played by African
leaders, particularly of the 'front-line' states. Once preoccupied with the
battle against white minority rule, the group is seeking to act as a
facilitator of democracy and promoter of regional economic co-operation.
Mediation in Lesotho and Mozambique, where it helped persuade Mr Afonso
Dhlakama to end his election boycott, has already brought results. If the
frontline states can maintain pressure on Unita and urge restraint on the
MPLA, the settlement may yet succeed.
At the same time, the world's leading powers must help fund and man the UN
initiative. They should also be prepared to help Angola's economic recovery.
The country has lost more than lives since this futile conflict resumed.
Since then, South Africa has not only captured the world's attention but
probably drained much of the world's aid purse. Had Angola been able to
appeal for international assistance in 1992, it would probably have received
a better response than is likely today.
Fortunately, the country has substantial resources. At least half the oil
export earnings went towards the government's war effort, while the diamond
fields helped sustain Mr Savimbi. Oil production, currently more than
500,000 barrels per day, could exceed 700,000 barrels before the end of the
decade. Given peace and good management, the country can also develop its
hydro-electric potential and exploit its agricultural and marine resources
Nevertheless, Angola needs help. Generous international assistance is more
than a worthy humanitarian cause. It would also relaunch a region whose
success is central to recovery in Africa as a whole.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Designers stress their proletarian credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Music blared, pretty girls provided decoration, and the covering was slowly
removed from a vehicle on an elevated stage. Porsche was unveiling its
prototype of the family car its designers hope will capture the hearts of
Chinese bureaucrats and consumers, writes Tony Walker.
The German sports carmaker could not be accused of under-selling its wares
in the competition to participate in China's 'people's car' project. It has
developed the prototype C88 (Concept 88 car) especially for the Chinese
market, with styling that embraces such features as headlights with oriental
characteristics.
Porsche - which makes fewer than 20,000 cars a year - was very much the
outsider among the world's car giants exhibiting at last week's small-car
show in Beijing. The company wants to supply basic design and engineering
assistance to a Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on
models produced. Its representatives emphasised that Ferdinand Porsche
designed and built the first Volkswagen in the mid-1930s - Germany's
'people's car' and the prototype for 21m 'Beetles'.
Also trying to persuade the Chinese of the importance of a long track record
was Ford Motor Company. It invoked Henry's name and that of the Model-T -
the world's first mass-produced vehicle.
'All great endeavours begin with a vision,' said Mr Wayne Booker, Ford's
executive vice-president for international operations. 'Ninety-one years
ago, Henry Ford had a vision of providing the greatest good for the greatest
number of people . . . From that beginning Ford has adhered to the vision of
serving working people.'
It was not clear whether this appeal to the proletarian instincts of Chinese
officialdom made much impact. But the announcement by Mercedes-Benz that it
was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Pounds 800m) in a new plant producing
250,000 FCC (Family Car China) concept cars a year would have been welcome.
Mercedes-Benz's squat, snub-nosed prototype was not the most elegant vehicle
on display. But it attracted attention from both Chinese consumers and
international competitors, who were curious about the German luxury car
producer's ideas of what might sell in a mass market.
Mercedes-Benz executives were proud of the FCC's innovative design, which
incorporates alternative propulsion options, such as electric or hydrogen
drive. They also claimed outstanding fuel efficiency, with the 1.3 litre
petrol engine capable of 800km on a single tank.
Participants in the show admired the Chinese for enticing the world's top
carmakers to Beijing. But there was a hint of exasperation that, because of
the huge potential of the China market, the Chinese clearly had the 'upper
hand', as one Japanese representative said.
'They are very good merchants,' he said. 'They are taking full advantage of
the situation to let us know they are the masters, and that they are calling
the shots.'
Chinese visitors to the exhibition were mostly 'window-shoppers'. Economic
reforms are bringing the possibility of purchasing cars within range of many
Chinese, but the price tag on a 'people's car' at this stage would be beyond
the means of most.
'You have to be rich to buy a car,' said Miss Shen, who was viewing the
Mercedes prototype. 'I'm dreaming of owning a car, but I'll have to wait . .
. till next century, perhaps.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHIL KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kevin Brown made a number of valuable points about lobbying the Labour
party ('A word in Tony's ear', November 18).
He is wrong, though, to suggest that Labour does not take lobbying companies
seriously. We in the profession were pleased that Labour's head office
organised two briefings for lobbyists, before and after this year's party
conference. We had a fruitful dialogue about what our clients expected from
and got out of the conference, and how they should be approaching the Labour
party on policy matters in future.
Clients do not always know where they should go to get their message across.
Charles Clarke, a political insider, should be aware just how closed and
forbidding the world of politics looks to people who are very good at
running their own companies and organisations but don't know an early day
motion from an oral question.
Labour seems to appreciate that lobbyists help companies to sharpen their
case and target it correctly. We help both clients and political parties to
avoid a great deal of wasted time and effort.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Important support for small and
medium-sized enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID R GRAYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As chairman of the independent Assessment Panel appointed by ministers
to vet local applications to become a Business Link, I welcome your
editorial, 'Small business management' (November 9).
Independent market research was a key element in the rationale for
supporting the establishment of a national network of Business Links.
All proposals for individual Business Links must he backed up by separate
market research into their target market companies, and they are required to
undertake regular customer surveys which evaluate effectiveness of services
provided.
The target is that at least 85 per cent of Business Link customers should be
satisfied or very satisfied with the services they use.
A key innovation of the Business Links is the personal business adviser who
will develop a long-term relationship with a portfolio of small firms,
analogous to the account manager in an advertising agency. I believe that
these personal business advisers are an important guard against your fear
that Business Links 'may be keener to meet their targets . . . than they are
to evaluate the benefits their customers derive'.
Your overall message is, however, well-taken. In an increasingly competitive
and fast-changing global marketplace, we need up-to-date information on the
most effective ways of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. We
could usefully start by ensuring government-funded research into the small
and medium-sized enterprise sector is better focused to give the programme
implications back to policymakers and business support agencies.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Welfare sent out to work: How the UK chancellor might use
the Budget to encourage employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The lowest inflation in a generation, rising exports and productivity,
falling public borrowing - Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, must be
feeling pleased at the UK economy's recent performance as he prepares his
second Budget speech.
Despite all the good news, however, there is a group that is being left
behind: a hardcore of long-term unemployed individuals and families without
earners. Falls in headline unemployment have not been accompanied by similar
falls in either long-term unemployment or the number of families dependent
on welfare.
'Unemployment,' said Mr Clarke earlier this year, 'must be the main
pre-occupation of economic policymakers in the 1990s. We must look more
closely at how those on the fringes of mainstream society can be brought
back in . . . ensuring that they do not get trapped in a web of dependency
and exclusion.'
With a tenth of the population dependent on state benefits, trade unions,
employers and pressure groups are arguing that Mr Clarke's priority of last
year - improving public finances - would best be served this year if he
introduced Budget reforms to bring greater numbers into work.
As far as these groups are concerned, the challenge is clear. 'Stable
economic conditions may not be sufficient in themselves to tackle the
structural problem of long-term unemployment,' says Mr Howard Davies,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He argues that
the government should take the lead in creating more jobs for more families.
In 1993, nearly 15 per cent of non-pensioner households in the UK were
without a working member, compared with less than 5 per cent in the 1970s.
Officially, unemployment in the UK has fallen by 455,100 since its peak of
nearly 3m at the end of 1992. But the number of people unemployed for over a
year remains as high as it was two years ago, at a little under 1m, while
the number out of work for over two years has risen sharply.
In fact these figures understate the problem because many of the long-term
unemployed have been so discouraged , that they have left the workforce
altogether. Researchers have found the main factor determining whether a man
will be unemployed is not his education or previous job but whether he was
unemployed the previous year.
'When someone has been out of work for over a year, the chances of him or
her finding work within three months are currently less than 5 per cent,'
says Dr Madsen Pirie of the free-market Adam Smith Institute in London.
There are two main reasons why the long-term unemployed find it difficult to
get work. Being 'out of the loop', they are less likely to hear about
openings, and lack of recent experience makes them unattractive to
employers.
The second is being in the benefit system. The structure of benefits can
make it unattractive for a household member to be the only one to find a
job, as benefits for the whole family will be withdrawn.
'Jobless men are generally accompanied by jobless women,' says Dr Jonathan
Wadsworth, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research in London. He says only 20 per cent of unemployed men live with a
working partner, against 60 per cent of employed men.
Social security provision, by its nature, always implies a disincentive to
work. When people are poor and unemployed, they qualify for support. The
fact that benefits are withdrawn when they start earning means their new
earnings are effectively taxed at a much higher rate than the rest of the
population.
This problem has been exacerbated, in recent years, by changes in the kind
of jobs available. Only 20 per cent of jobs filled by the unemployed are
full-time, permanent positions. Half are part-time and many are low-paid.
This means they have less chance of earning enough to take them beyond the
high marginal tax rates on the first pounds earned.
In the 1980s, reducing the relative value of benefits was expected to lessen
the disincentive to work. But benefit cuts did little to stem the rise in
the number of individuals and families dependent on benefits.
US-style 'workfare' proposals raise the stakes further, by forcing people to
'work off' their benefits after a set period. But these are highly
controversial, and would imply large and costly public jobs programmes which
a Conservative government might object to.
Many in both the Conservative and Labour parties believe that a better, and
cheaper, approach to the problem is to give private employers more of an
incentive to offer jobs to the long-term unemployed, and to update the
benefits system so that they have more incentive to take work.
Dr Pirie argues that the government should give all people out of work for
over a year a 'green card' entitling them to two years' exemption from
national insurance and income tax payments. In addition, cardholders'
benefits would be phased out over the first two years of employment, rather
than withdrawn immediately.
Such a scheme would create jobs as well as encourage employers to select the
long-term unemployed over others, says Dr Pirie. 'There are whole categories
of work which are uneconomic at present, but which would become worthwhile
if labour costs were significantly lowered.'
The cost in lost tax and NI contributions and continued benefits would be
considerable. But so, too, are the costs of supporting the more or less
permanently unemployed, says Dr Pirie.
Budgetary worries are still likely to deter Mr Clarke from entirely
exempting the long-term unemployed from NI and income tax. But he is said to
be considering more modest tax changes along these lines. There might be an
NI 'holiday' for the long-term jobless, and a lowering of the tax burden for
all of the low-paid, through either an increased personal tax allowance or a
wider lowest income tax band.
Tax measures would encourage employers to take on workers, but, critics
argue, Mr Clarke needs to tackle the benefits system as well, if he wishes
to reduce disincentives on the employee side.
'It is simply wrong to say that a lower-rate band of income tax, or lower NI
contributions, help people escape very high marginal withdrawal rates at the
lower end of the income distribution,' argues Mr Paul Johnson of the
Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'They are primarily a feature of the benefit
system, not the tax system.'
Some people, especially those without children, can still earn enough to
move out of means-tested benefits, believes Mr Johnson. 'But lone parents
and many couples with children can be trapped on benefit, because of the way
their limited job opportunities interact with the benefit system.'
Family credit - introduced by the government in 1988 - was one response to
the expenses of raising a family that made it hard to accept low-paid jobs
without being made worse off. Another was the additional childcare credit
introduced in last year's budget. Both effectively restore lost benefits
once people are working 16 hours a week, although after that the credit is
withdrawn at a 70 per cent marginal rate.
At least for the 60 per cent of eligible families who receive it, family
credit has taken the welfare system a step towards fitting the new world of
work to the new world of non-work. But more credits - to take account of
housing expenses, perhaps, or give a specific incentive for a second member
of the family to work - would further smooth the transition from welfare to
work. Improving the take-up of family credit would smooth it further.
If this is the stuff of Mr Clarke's budget, he will not be able to declare
an end to long-term unemployment. Every country in Europe is facing high
structural unemployment. Budget changes alone will not eliminate the
problem. His challenge next week will be to find ways to stop the tax and
benefit system from making it worse.
