Sir, Since the market rate for a chief executive of multinational calibre is
Pounds 475,000, I hope British Gas will go to the market and find such a
person, instead of retaining its present chief executive who, according to
market forces, is worth only Pounds 270,000.

Sir, The Cadbury Committee must be very pleased with itself: remuneration
committees throughout the land have been unflinching in their quest to award
executive directors the going rate for their job, however high it may be.
Struggling employees and shareholders can sleep easily in their beds at

ever to deal with the harsh commercial problems facing their companies.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Elderly should not have to worry
about financial decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is suggested (Personal View: 'Better deal for personal pensions',
November 16) that in order to have dignity and independence in their old
age, the elderly ought not to be required to buy annuities with their tax
sheltered pension scheme moneys but to have continuing control over their
capital.
Surely recent experience of encouraging greater freedom for employees, on
the advice of independent financial advisers, to frame their own future
pensions as they choose should be warning enough.
We should be moving in the opposite direction. When we are elderly we do not
wish to continue to take part in the financial decisions on which our
welfare depends; in fact, we and our spouses are frequently not competent to
do so. Far better would be a collectivist approach whereby all pension money
or entitlements, at least up to some substantial pension level, could easily
be put into one pot on retirement - 70 at the latest.
Already, more and more of our pension money comes in bits and pieces, which
can be very confusing. So a simple indexed monthly payment from a single
source would be an enormous improvement. This would indeed be a valuable
service, particularly to the very elderly and the very many who are ailing.
We do not retain our dignity by dithering over financial niceties or legal
complexities. Only a financial adviser could believe that.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Bigger and better?: Nato should be enlarged in step with the
EU and WEU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago, when the Clinton administration still hoped to
discover a unifying theme for its foreign policy, Anthony Lake, the
president's national security adviser, came up with 'enlargement'. Soviet
expansionism had been successfully contained. Now was the time to 'enlarge'
the circle of free-market, liberal democracies.
That sounds good, but it gets trickier when applied to specific
institutions. The thought that Poles or Ukrainians are enjoying freedom of
speech is heart-warming. What is not so easy is to sign a treaty giving them
the right to export cheap steel to western Europe, or to expect automatic
military support in a war with Russia.
The US is all in favour of enlarging the European Union, except that it is
not a candidate for membership. It is more ambivalent about enlarging Nato,
which would require the US Congress to approve military guarantees to
central and east European countries. As for the Western European Union, few
people in the US have heard of it. But then, few Europeans have heard of it
either.
WEU is a subject only for the cognoscenti, because until now its function as
a military alliance has been subsumed in Nato. All full members of WEU are
also members of Nato, which includes the US and has a military organisation
to implement its guarantees. The question of what WEU would do if one of its
members were attacked has therefore been academic. The Nato guarantee would
be invoked first.
But since the Maastricht treaty came into force a year ago, WEU has had
another role as a 'defence component' of the European Union. Any member of
the EU has, on paper, the right to full membership of WEU. It is not
specified that the country in question must also be a member of Nato. So far
that has not mattered because Ireland, the only present EU member not in
Nato, has contented itself with observer status in WEU. But in six weeks
three more non-Nato members - Austria, Finland and Sweden - will join the
EU. They too will settle for observer status in WEU in the first instance,
but are likely to take a keen interest in the EU's security role in central
Europe and the Baltics. If WEU becomes a 'fourth pillar' of the EU in 1996,
charged with implementing a common defence policy, some or all of these
countries will want to be involved.
That will be even more true of the central European countries in the next
wave of EU enlargement, and of the Baltic states whose right to join that
wave will be championed by Sweden and Finland. That means that, perhaps as
soon as the end of this decade, west Europeans will be asked to guarantee
the security of countries that were formerly Warsaw Pact members; perhaps
even countries that were within the Soviet Union. It is no secret that these
countries' interest in such guarantees arises from their experience of
Soviet rule, and their fear that a Russian threat might reappear. In the
case of the Baltics that fear is not far-fetched.
Russian sensitivity about Nato enlargement is well-known. It was restated
with vigour on Monday by Russian speakers at a Paris symposium on the
proposed 'stability pact' between the EU and its would-be members in central
and east Europe, better known as the Balladur plan.
The idea of the plan is to use the central and east Europeans' eagerness for
EU membership as a lever to get them to resolve their bilateral problems.
That means recognising each others' frontiers as permanent, and undertaking
to treat national minorities properly - something they are all prepared to
do on paper, though getting some of them to implement their commitments may
not be so easy.
What is interesting is that the leverage appears to have worked in reverse.
Edouard Balladur, the plan's author, declared in opening the symposium that
'everyone can see this (EU) enlargement is for us an imperative'. Not
everyone would have seen that as an imperative of French policy before the
plan was launched. Such statements make the prospect of eastward EU
enlargement much more real.
At the same time Mr Balladur warned against being over-hasty in enlarging
'security institutions, such as Nato or WEU'. The 'brutal inclusion of new
countries in these alliances,' he suggested, 'could provoke more instability
than stability on our continent.' Music to the Russians' ears.
Eventually, though, the problem will have to be faced. The further east the
EU expands, the more important its security dimension will become. To deny
its easternmost members the right to participate in common security
arrangements will prove an untenable position; and it would be dangerously
incoherent to have a European defence union with some members allied to the
US and others not. If Nato is to retain any credibility, it should be
enlarged in step with the EU and WEU.
One Russian speaker on Monday, Sergei Karaganov of Moscow's Europe
Institute, seemed fairly relaxed about this prospect. He argued against
expanding Nato now, on the grounds that an excluded Russia would cut off
co-operation with the west and adopt a wrecking attitude to European
security arrangements. But he was happy to let EU expansion take its course,
even if it brought WEU and Nato expansion in its wake. Why? Because it will
take time. By the time the terms and extent of EU enlargement are worked
out, he implied, the struggle between westernisers and nationalists in
Russia will have been decided one way or the other.
I wonder. That struggle has been going on for three centuries at least. Can
we really expect it to be decided within the next five years?

FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A dangerous vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOHDAN SKROBACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Ukrainian virtue' (November 18), states that the
Ukrainian parliament made the world a safer place. But has it also made an
'independent' Ukraine safer?
Ukraine cannot survive as an independent state without creating economic
prosperity. Poland has understood this very well. But Poland also knows that
economics does not guarantee security. This is why it is strongly seeking
Nato membership and integration with western Europe.
Ukraine begins an attempt at radical reform with no offer to become part of
Nato. The possibility of becoming part of European Union is measured in
decades.
An independent Ukraine today exists in a vacuum. Because of its size and
location, this is a dangerous state to be in. Ukraine's history attests to
this.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: Iron man wins the Turner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antony Gormley is this year's winner of the Turner Prize. He received his
Pounds 20,000 cheque at the Tate last night, a safe, unexceptional choice
from a rather lack-lustre vintage. Gormley was the favourite, an established
artist whose work already sells for Pounds 30,000-plus thanks to the astute
handling of his dealer, the fashionable Jay Jopling.
Gormley is the subject and the object of his own work, plastering his body
to make moulds which are then converted into lead, or iron, or concrete
shapes. His main contribution to the Tate's display of the shortlisted
artists was 'Testing a World View', four contorted figures of Gormley cast
in iron left lying around a large empty space. As in most contemporary art
the viewer was left to decide what it was all about, but perhaps it evoked
remnants of the body left like driftwood after a natural disaster, a
Hiroshima or a Pompeii.
His most famous creation is 'Field for the British Isles', over 40,000
hand-sized clay figurines made by the people of St Helen's and, in contrast
to his Tate exhibit, displayed in packed intensity to show how man crowds
out the universe.
Among the other shortlisted artists was Iranian born Shirazeh Houshiary, who
takes a suitably mystic view of art with 'The Enclosure of Sanctity': five
lead cubes, austere from the outside but containing a kaleidoscopic display
of brilliant colours inside - silver foil, gold leaf, and more.
Representing another powerful contemporary tradition was Willie Doherty from
Derry in Northern Ireland, whose exhibit consists of a darkened room in
which two videos evoke the horrors of the Troubles, with the killer and the
victim sharing a last car ride and commenting impartially on an unsure
denouement. Doherty's thesis that there is no such thing as an innocent
victim may be specious, but the work conveys the unreality of the place.
The fourth finalist, Peter Doig, was a real outsider, being a painter whose
work is almost figurative. He paints buildings threatened by nature,
postcard scenes attacked by disjointed colours, art that both reassures
traditionalists but gives modernists enough speculative challenge to chew
on.
As is customary now, this annual award for the best British artist under 50
itself became performance art, with hundreds of wannabe artists mobbing
guests outside the Tate, many displaying their own creative ideas. Their
efforts were not in vain.
The Tate is happy that the Prize generates controversy, for this brings
visitors to the gallery to see the work of the shortlisted artists. It also
gives contemporary art a lively, combative, embattled feeling, despite the
fact that the winners tend to belong to a small, inward looking, coterie and
the event is sponsored, by Channel Four.
Although it did not produce the high jinks of 1993, when the winner, Rachel
Whiteread, was also forced to accept Pounds 40,000 from the K Foundation for
being the worst short-listed artist, the 1994 Turner was remarkable in its
own way. The prize was handed over by Charles Saatchi, the UK's biggest
buyer of contemporary art by far, but, until last night, a confirmed
recluse. Only for the Turner would he materialise and praise to the skies
the current crop of young British artists.

<TEXT>
Midweek's television, like the midweek joint, coming round again as
rissoles, has a dull, marking-time feel to it. Regulars include Between the
Lines (9.30pm BBC1), which has lost its bite since its principal coppers
were booted out of the force. The old setting - police investigating
complaints against the police - had a frighteningly contagious tendency to
paranoia and conspiracy theories. The new format is still watchable but
disappointingly conventional.
A big night for sport, with Oo-ah Cantona, an entente cordiale on his own,
returning to Manchester United in The Champions League (7.20pm, ITV), while
boxing features prominently in BBC 1's Sportsnight (10.20pm). Those who do
not find Baldrick in Blackadder the most uningratiatingly unfunny stooge in
the history of comedy will like Tony Robinson's trip to the Caribbean in
this week's Great Journeys (9.25pm, BBC2). Or try Syrup, a Cannes
prizewinner in the Short and Curlies series (9.45pm, Channel 4), the
engaging mini-fable of poor little Baldy George, who finds fulfilment one
lunch-hour with the acquisition of a head of thatch.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: John Surman's Brass Project - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saxophonist John Surman tells a story about touring in Norway. Arriving at a
club in a town near the arctic circle he found his audience amounted to one
solitary figure, sitting at a table in the corner. 'Look,' said Surman,
'There is really no point in me playing. Why don't we just have drink
together and a chat?'. 'Suits me,' said the Norwegian, 'I was meant to be
your pianist tonight.'
The story, typical of Surman's self-deprecating humour, belies the huge
following the multi-instrumentalist has across Europe. At 50, Somerset born
Surman finds himself one of a few great saxophonists who can run nimbly with
a baritone. A protean improvisor, he also moves gracefully between soprano
sax and bass clarinet within a single composition and works as much magic in
an arranged orchestral setting as he does unaccompanied.
Described in the 1960s as one of the common market jazz musicians, Surman's
playing and writing owes as much to European choral music and Scottish jigs
as it does Chicago blues. The young Surman reached his late teens without
ever hearing a note of jazz and instead sung soprano in the choir for fun.
It was not until his voice broke that he picked up a clarinet and
subsequently tuned into syncopation. Later he listened to folk music and
made a conscious decision to be absorbed in what he describes as 'a
different kind of blues'.
The result is a distinctively Euro-centric composer and improvisor whose
playing has as much resonance for fans of Vaughan Williams as devotees of
'Trane.
This 50th birthday concert tour captures Surman solo, in sublimely pastoral
duet with pianist John Taylor and also in quartet with the addition of old
friends Chris Laurence (bass) and John Marshall (drums). But the real draw
on this tour is Surman's ten piece labour of love, The Brass Project. The
conspicuously piano-less brass choir is robustly arranged (and directed) by
John Warren. Opening at the Norwich Arts Centre of Friday the ensemble
surrounded Warren with a great, rich panorama of sound. Surging trombones
gave deep colour background to sheets of sound from Surman's bass clarinet;
vivid trumpets pierced their chattering choruses. The momentum from
Laurence's bass was dizzying.
Surman is an inveterate tourer but without funding it is hard to put a big
band like this on the road often. Hear it while you can.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: 'My Night with Reg' goes West - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alas, poor Reg. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite bonkability . . .
knew him in the Biblical sense.
Horatio, in this case, is Guy, a confirmed bachelor who is nearing 40 and
who does a lot of listening. My Night with Reg - one of the several success
stories of 1994, now reaching the West End after its acclaimed opening in
March at the Royal Court's little Theatre Upstairs  - is a wistful comedy by
Kevin Elyot about six gay Englishmen during the last ten years. Reg, whom we
never see and who dies before the second of the play's three scenes, was a
right little goer; but only Guy begins to discover how much so, as each of
the other men start to confide in him.
Not that Reg was unique. Daniel (his official lover) and John (his most
smitten secret lover) used to get around no end until he entered their
lives. Once he leaves their lives, they pick up the old promiscuity where
they left off. All of this they tell to Guy, who is still languishing, 15
years after Oxford days, with a love for John that he never confesses.
Guy knits ('a cover for my door-sausage, actually') and has bestial 'phone
sex with Brad, whom he has never met ('a lorry driver, he says. I suspect
he's a florist, but what's it matter?') and listens and frets. Yet cruel
fate has it that it is poor, neurotic, spinsterish Guy who, to our surprise,
departs, of Aids, before the third scene.
My Night with Reg switches from farce to pathos and back again throughout;
it is studded with lines so funny that the audience guffaws for the next
half-minute; it rings so many bells for me that I wonder if Elyot and I have
friends in common; and it has brilliant effects of suspense. William Dudley
has designed a gorgeous interior set that fills the large Criterion stage.
And Roger Michell's direction negotiates the trickiest moments - men in
tears or starting to make love with each other - with extraordinary
persuasiveness.
I wish, however, that the play did not come garlanded with press quotations
that speak in superlatives and about genius; and I wish, for its sake, that
it did not reach the West End towards the end of a year which has already
brought a billion plays about homosexuality to British stages. (How many
plays are there around to take one's aunts to, for heaven's sake?)
Most of the Reg characters are too close for me to caricature or for me to
care much about them. Sure, I experienced a succession of various tiny pangs
on their behalf. John Sessions brings immense braggadocio panache to Daniel
 -but about half his role consists of comic set pieces, and he delivers them
as such. David Bamber overdoes the knock-kneed neurosis of Guy, a role that
surely could stand more dignity; I could not believe that the other
characters could bear the respect for him they claimed.
Only the pathos of John - the most physically attractive and the most
spiritually doomed - is seriously affecting, and unusual. And Anthony Calf's
interpretation of this dear unhappy beauty, utterly absorbed in his own
pointless and charming life, is astonishing - a study in golden
hopelessness.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: Nothing succeeds like excess - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have formed an independent production company with the intention of
breaking into television. Should you go for costume drama? Serious
investigative journalism? Opera? Certainly not, they are all expensive and
difficult. What you need is a new age inter-active programme, presented in
studio, by someone from children's programmes, preferably with very odd
mannerisms, aided by a transvestite, backed by a team of researchers on
telephones, concentrating on spiritual healing, lost relations, and money
prizes.
One of the biggest changes for years in British television is currently
proceeding almost unremarked, largely because it is rather difficult to
define. It has been mentioned previously in this column as an increase in
tabloid television, but that phrase is really too glib, and consequently
misleading, because very few of the programmes in question are concerned
with news in the way that the Daily Mirror is. The analogy does hold up if
by 'tabloid' you imply such obsolete publications as Reveille, Weekend and
Tit Bits which were devoted chiefly to providing entertainment via matters
of fact.
One of the difficulties is that we are not simply seeing one easily defined
type of programme replacing another; it is not like detective series taking
over from Westerns. Rather it is a question of one compendium of attitudes,
approaches and subjects declining while another set rapidly rises. Variety -
in the sense of programmes which incorporate singing, dancing, conjuring and
so on - is not dead, but its long term decline has accelerated. The chat
show is not dead - The Danny Baker Show with its familiar rock stars, soccer
personalities and musical interludes may look like something from the 1970s,
yet BBC1 has only just launched it - but it, too, is in long-term decline.
'Light entertainment', in virtually all the forms originally borrowed by
television from other places, is declining.
Taking its place is material which in some cases would once have been
regarded as journalism but which is beginning to evolve into something else:
book or travel programmes are now presented by comedians (Griff Rhys Jones
with The Bookworm on BBC1, Tony Robinson, best known as Baldrick from
Blackadder, on tonight's Great Journeys on BBC2). In other cases the process
is further advanced and we are getting material which is neither borrowed
nor adapted from elsewhere but is television entertainment sui generis. The
Full Wax is a good example, incorporating some elements of the chat show and
bits of stand up comedy but relying chiefly on the sort of flight of fantasy
in which Ruby Wax managed to get Felicity Kendall, of all people, to appear
on Sunday as a sado-masochist madam in full patent leather regalia complete
with chains, whip, and stilettos, ostensibly in her own home.
At 7.00 on BBC2 tonight is Lifeswaps, based on the interesting idea of
getting people to change places (homes, jobs, everything) for a week but
introduced by the drag artist Lily Savage, a choice which would have seemed
startling only a couple of years ago but which now passes virtually without
comment. The result last week was that the 'presenter' in theatrical high
heels, stage frock and wig was required to totter around a Welsh cottage
and, indeed, Welsh fields.
Outrageousness in presenters is now so commonplace that it is becoming
unremarkable. From the absurd accents of Lloyd Grossman and Antoine de
Caunes to the hyper-activity of Kriss Akabusi and Chris Evans (Don't Forget
Your Toothbrush returns on Saturday) it becomes increasingly clear that in
television presentation these days nothing succeeds like excess.
If you are not a comedian, drag artist or hysteric (Noel Edmonds, towards
the end of presenting the first National Lottery, with eyes bulging,
screamed 'And now for the countdown to the activation of the balls]') it is
best to be a former presenter of children's programmes. Though it is the
older section of society that is expanding, broadcasting chiefs are still
obsessed with yoof, and anyone who has worked on Blue Peter or anything like
it is in great demand. Anthea Turner, ex Blue Peter and now on the ITV
breakfast show, was one of the outside reporters on the first lottery
programme and will be co-presenting from this week, now that Edmonds has
done his stuff. Andi Peters, former continuity presenter for BBC children's
television, is co-presenting Good Fortune], the new BBC1 series which hunts
down unclaimed prizes and bequests and presents them - and often long lost
acquaintances in the style of This Is Your Life - in front of a studio
audience.
Phillip Schofield, another presenter from BBC children's television, has
just begun Schofield's Quest on ITV on Sunday evenings. This describes
itself as a 'mystery solving show' though this week's edition had no
solutions to the mystery of UFOs on Ilkley Moor, the mystery of a government
security garage in Streatham, or the mystery of double-exposure negatives.
Like Good Fortune] and so many of the tabloid shows going back to
Crimewatch, this one is 'inter-active' or, even more trendy, 'pro-active',
meaning that rows of researchers sit at one end of the studio talking on
telephones. While Schofield's Quest could not be described as a 'new age'
series, it is perfectly happy to deal with spiritual healing, ghosts and the
like, the very subjects on which ITV's new Friday evening series Strange But
True? concentrates.
The more of them you watch, the more these new television programmes seem to
have in common with those old weekly tabloids. Every item is designed to
make the onlooker say either 'Just fancy that]', or 'Ahhh', or possibly
'Oo-er'. Everything is 'people oriented', meaning that even when it could be
called journalism there is a distinct lack of issues or ideas and a
perpetual concentration on the minutiae of individual lives. At every turn
the customer is urged to 'interact' with the programmes by phone, as they
once did with the papers by letter. Everything is 'personality' driven,
meaning that a small group of people who are famous for being well known
keep on turning up over and over again.
The distressing thing is that, although we are still getting Martin
Chuzzlewit, rugby internationals, and (last night) the odd and rather
frightening Clint Eastwood movie The Beguiled - in other words, material for
which television acts as a 'medium' in the sense that it originates
elsewhere - there is a strong feeling that Good Fortune], Lifeswaps and The
Full Wax are 'real' television. After all, these are the programmes that
television invents and makes for itself. Be in no doubt, we shall be seeing
a great many more like them.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Alternative waste treatment -
Brazil is enthusiastic about plasma-based disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pilot project to dispose of hazardous waste is planned to start at a
hospital in the densely-populated city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, using
technology developed by Nasa scientists.
Brazilian researchers will use plasma - super-heated gases - at the
University of Sao Paulo hospital to provide cheaper and safer disposal to
traditional incinerators or landfills.
Hospitals in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city with a population of
15m, produce 115 tonnes of waste a day which contains blood, syringes and
body parts.
Because of the risk of disease this waste must be incinerated, an expensive
process as its humidity content is 40 per cent to 60 per cent. There are
additional health risks from normal gas or oil-fired incineration, in
particular the release of carcinogenic dioxins and toxic ashes.
Roberto Szente, head of plasma research at the Sao Paulo state-funded
Technology Research Institute, says: 'Because gas is a relatively poor
conductor the plasma can heat up to 10,000`C'
The technology was developed by Nasa, the US space agency, to simulate the
heating experienced by rockets re-entering the atmosphere. Plasma forms at
extremely high temperatures, when atoms of gas split into a mixture of
positive ions and electrons. It can be made by transferring energy from an
electric arc to a gas such as air or nitrogen.
It is only with the growth in environmental awareness that the IPT, along
with other research centres around the world, started applying it to
hazardous waste.
'With plasma, the temperature is so high that everything, including metals,
melts and becomes a liquid pool,' says Szente.
This pool solidifies as slabs of residues, basically blocks of glass and
iron, that can be used in construction or disposed of in landfill. Because
the result is a molten state which later solidifies, there is less risk of
dioxins being dispersed than with
ashes.
Erasmo Tolosa, hospital superintendent, says the city council contracts out
collection and treatment of waste. 'We don't have a great deal of confidence
in the current system and we know that in some parts of Brazil the waste is
just dumped,' he says, referring to news reports of human limbs being found
on rubbish dumps in the poor north-east of Brazil.
The IPT is applying plasma technology to another pilot project to deal with
the galvanised waste produced by companies in the metal-coating industry, a
spin-off from Sao Paulo's booming car industry.
Companies used to discharge the liquid residues from galvanisation straight
into the Tiete River, one of the most polluted in the world. But with the
introduction of pollution controls to clean the river, the companies are
left with a mud - the by-product of galvanisation - containing heavy metals
such as iron, silica, calcium and zinc, as well as cyanide.
IPT tests show that when plasma is applied to the mud it destroys the
cyanide and the end result is non-toxic slabs of metal, 96 per cent iron,
says Szente.
Marco Antonio Barbieri, director of a chrome company and spokesman for
around 100 small galvanisation companies involved in the project, says
plasma treatment is likely to cost Dollars 40-Dollars 70 a tonne compared
with about Dollars 200 for landfill, Dollars 400-Dollars 800 for cement
kilns and Dollars 1,500 for use of private incinerators.
Despite all its apparent advantages, plasma's progress so far in waste
disposal has been piecemeal. Szente says this is partly because it is still
a relatively unknown technology, and also because companies are unwilling to
decommission expensive incinerators to spend more money building plasma
units.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Cities take the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A business-funded international congress on the impact of cities on the
environment held in Hong Kong earlier this month has highlighted the
contri-bution that the private sector can make in finding solutions to
environmental problems, writes Peter Knight.
More than half the world's people are expected to live in towns and cities
by the turn of the century.
The population of Mexico City, for example, is already 15m and growing,
creating significant water and air pollution problems.
The congress brought together 47 speakers from different parts of the world,
including a senior managing director of Mitsubishi Electric, the chief
executive of the UK's nuclear power stations and a Manila nun campaigning
for squatters' rights. The Prince of Wales gave the opening address.
Funding for the week-long event came from 20 companies, including the John
Swire group and World-Wide Shipping of Hong Kong, Mitsubishi Electric and
Marubeni Corporation of Japan, and Anglian Water, Friends Provident Life
Office and Nuclear Electric of the UK.
'Business has a role to play, and indeed a duty, in helping to find
solutions. Conferences such as these help to focus the mind on what needs to
be done and how best to achieve it,' says Bob Hawley, chief executive of
Nuclear Elec-tric.
The congress, which included a large contingent from China, discussed a
range of issues on the environmental and human problems created by cities.
The closing statement acknowledged the source of sponsorship but called on
the private sector to be more active in seeking solutions. A first step
would be to accept a greater civic responsib-ility.
'As a strictly private-sector initiative we could adopt a more holistic
approach, which gave equal consideration to the human, scientific,
technological and legislative aspects of environmental protection,' says
congress organiser John Calabrini.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Management: How to hire an incompetent - It's harder than
you think. John Wareham offers tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WAREHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people enjoy hiring incompetent underlings. After all, an incompetent
subordinate can make a near-incompetent boss seem, by comparison, a
near-genius. And, uncertain of tenure, the incompetent is likely to take
special precautions to please the boss.
He or she will want to do exactly as told in any circumstance. The
incompetent will usually be more than delighted to follow foolish
instructions and, when problems arise, to screen the boss from all fallout.
A good living is thus to be commanded by the canny incompetent's well-honed
fawning and grovelling skills.
Given that an incompetent underling can offer many satisfactions to the
boss, how should a recruiter go about finding one? The knack of appointing
such individuals is a talent shared by many senior executives. But it is
largely unconscious - although the would-be recruiter constantly hires
incompetents, he is likely to be unaware of the precise techniques
exploited.
Indeed, unless properly instructed, the recruiter may actually wind up
accidentally recruiting a competent subordinate. This is likely to cause
untold heartache, for such a subordinate is likely to prove a troublemaker
for the boss, always querying instructions, refusing to carry out orders
that do not seem to make sense, maybe even indulging in 'whistle blowing'.
So how can the intelligent executive assure himself that the person he hires
will be a genuine incompetent, and not one of those emotionally mature,
stable, savvy achievers who always turn out to be troublemakers? The answer
lies in heeding the following eight commandments.
Never conduct a real search for qualified candidates. Instead, restrict
yourself to hiring other people's rejects and make all your appointments
from the unsolicited CVs that cross your desk. These, for the most part, are
going to be directed to you by out-placement firms that specialise in
finding new employment for people whose present employers do not want them
around anymore. This is a rich pool which, if carefully fished, can be
relied upon to produce out-and-out incompetents over and over again.
Place great emphasis on appearance and presentation. Take to your bosom the
advice of Oscar Wilde that: 'It is only shallow people who do not judge by
first appearances.'
Favour the kind of candidate who most fits your own notion of what an
executive ought to look like. Pay close attention to the candidate's
clothes. Work upon the assumption that a Brooks Brothers suit denotes
stability, and that silver hair bespeaks wisdom.
Never hire an executive who wears unseemly hose, or who sports scuffed
shoes. Hire the best-looking candidate, the individual who bears the
strongest physical resemblance to your own attractive personage. By all
means feel free to hire your own offspring and siblings.
Talk to candidates but never interview them. It is naturally very important
to impress upon those in your organisation that you are serious about hiring
'good people'. Thus, you will probably want to spend a lot of time talking
to candidates about your job, sharing your values and philosophies.
Tell them at length about your company and yourself, your upbringing, your
view on everything. If the would-be recruit's attention flags at any point,
then throw the ingrate out, for the candidate who cannot at least seem to be
paying attention for hours on end to incoherent ramblings from a prospective
boss is unlikely to be a proper incompetent.
Don't bother to ask for too much material on the candidate. Simply assume
that it is all on the CV. Or adopt an avant garde attitude and work to the
assumption that you must not invade anyone's privacy by inquiring about any
possible 'employment gaps'.
Hire from your own social circle. Explain to your colleagues that 'the
chemistry has to be right' before you will hire. This way you can restrict
your hiring to people who not only look and dress like you, but who also
share your opinions on pretty well everything. Put a great deal of emphasis
on 'name' colleges and clubs.
By so doing, you will more or less exclude the kind of independent-minded
person likely to prove a troublemaker. With any luck at all, you will wind
up recruiting a first-rate non-threatening incompetent with whom you can
harmoniously co-exist.
Reject generalists in favour of technicians. A wonderful way to by-pass
competent people is to make technical - as opposed to emotional -
qualification your key selection criterion. This is a much-favoured
technique, because spotting and quantifying technical education and exposure
is infinitely easier than spotting and hiring the emotional qualities that
go to make a truly competent person.
Place great reliance on references from past employers. A good way to hire
an incompetent is to solicit bland comments - about the only comments
offered these days - from previous employers. It is vital to take such
comments at face value, and to ignore or overlook cagey endorsements. So,
when someone says: 'In my opinion you'll be fortunate to get this candidate
to work for you,' tune out the sub-text and delve no further.
Never get a psychological evaluation on the candidate. The vital thing in
hiring incompetents is for everyone to believe or pretend to believe that
the incompetent is a great prize. Unfortunately, a psychological evaluation
may let the cat out of the bag.
So, when the company chairman - having suddenly noticed what can no longer
be hidden, that your staff never seem to get anything done - suggests that
it might be smart to have your future candidates screened by a professional
before any hiring, proclaim loud and long that you simply do not believe in
all that mumbo-jumbo. And, never let yourself be evaluated. That could be
the end of everything.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Management: An efficiency that runs in the blood - Public
services management / Alan Pike visits Europe's biggest transfusion centre,
where lives depend on a high-quality service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Belinda Phipps, the term lifeblood is more than a familiar metaphor used
throughout business to describe the customers, capital and staff that are
essential to success. Lifeblood really has been her business for the last
three years.
As managing director of South Thames Blood Transfusion Service - she is now
a consultant to the London Ambulance Service - lives have depended on the
quality of service she provides.
Since Phipps and a new management team took over three years ago at the once
poorly-regarded South Thames, efficiency has been lifted to levels that are
widely admired elsewhere in the National Health Service.
The reception area of the service's headquarters at Tooting, south London,
gives visitors an accurate introduction to the organisation. Good lighting
and plants make the best of an unexciting public-sector environment and
generate an impression of calm and efficiency; yet all is done on a modest
scale, avoiding any suggestion of excess or waste of money.
On the wall, visible to staff and visitors, is the service's purpose
statement: 'To help save and improve the lives of patients, with services
and products provided through the generosity of donors.' While this might
appear self-evident, it represents the outcome of a significant exercise in
mind-clearing and is central to the recent efficiency improvements.
When Phipps arrived from Glaxo, where she had worked for 10 years, to take
up her first public-sector post she discovered staff were confused over
whether the service's customers were the donors who provided the blood or
the patients who received it. The purpose statement puts the patient at the
centre of the exercise - the service's core job is to ensure that hospitals
can always be supplied with whatever blood products are required.
Britain relies entirely on volunteer blood donors, so it is essential for
their confidence and co-operation to be maintained. But the practice of
regarding donors as customers had led to some transfusion services,
including South Thames when Phipps arrived, allowing volunteers to choose
when to donate blood regardless of whether it was needed - even though, as
some blood products have a short shelf life, it was sometimes never used.
Phipps ordered a stop to this, setting out to ensure that amounts and types
of blood collected at transfusion sessions were brought more closely into
line with the requirements of hospitals.
She tackled the potential problem of offending donors by approaching them
individually and offering more information than they had been given in the
past. The exercise has resulted in a reduction in wastage from red cells
outdating to around 1 per cent, compared with a national average of 5-6 per
cent.
Phipps discovered that late afternoon and early evening were the most
popular times for donor sessions; yet nine to five tended to be the working
hours in transfusion centres, meaning much blood was not processed until a
day after collection. Working arrangements of the South Thames staff were
renegotiated and blood is now processed at night as well as day.
Phipps, the first head of an NHS blood transfusion service to come from a
non-medical background, describes the job as a combination of running a
charity and a factory. This is perhaps an understatement - in addition to
handling volunteers and processing their blood efficiently, the service must
operate a just-in-time delivery service 365 days a year.
Peter Garwood, the service's scientific director, admits that when Phipps
arrived morale was low. 'She tackled this by consulting, involving and
empowering all the staff with a campaign entitled '560 brains are better
than one'. Now we have an organisation where change is accepted rather than
feared.'
The future may, however, hold more change than the innovative managers at
South Thames will welcome. Under a government restructuring of blood
transfusion arrangements, a new National Blood Authority has been
established and the number of transfusion centres around the country is to
be reduced. There are concerns in the transfusion service that this may lead
to less autonomy for local managements to introduce the sort of changes that
have lifted efficiency at South Thames.

FT  23 NOV 94 / People: Morton and Foley aim to build up Baris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Morton and John Foley have emerged at the controls of Baris Holdings,
the troubled loss-making building materials group which specialises in fire
protection and dry lining.
Morton, a Midlands financier with a taste for buying into sick companies and
nursing them back to health, has become non-executive chairman of the
Nottinghamshire group and called in Foley to be chief executive.
Foley had been biding his time for a new job since September when he came to
an amiable parting of the ways with Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands
engineer.
Morton fireproofed Baris's ailing finances by buying into a rights issue,
persuading National Westminster Bank to convert debt into equity and, with
Foley, trawling round the London institutions to persuade them to support a
share placing.
Foley's first job is to overcome the Pounds 3.1m pretax loss in the year to
last February. His second is expansion. With 300 employees, Baris is down to
the core business after unhappy excursions in Germany, Spain and a lengthy
dispute with Wimpey about a contract for the Little Britain development in
the City of London. 'It was quite a good business,' says Foley.
Robert Smith, the former chairman and chief executive, remains on the board
as an executive director.

Renato Riverso (above), former chairman and managing director of IBM Europe,
is joining the board of Baring Investment Banking, the newly formed
investment banking arm of London's oldest merchant bank group.
Riverso, 61, who will retain his role as chairman of Alitalia, the Italian
flag-carrier, is the first non-executive director to join the board of
Baring Investment Banking, formed earlier this year when Barings combined
the management of its Baring Brothers &amp; Co merchant banking business with
Baring Securities. Riverso has also been appointed chairman of Baring
Brothers (Italia).
Riverso is the latest big name to be recruited by Barings. Earlier this year
Jean Peyrelevade, president of Credit Lyonnais, and Yoshihiko Miyauchi,
president of Japan's largest leasing company Orix, joined the board of
Barings plc, the parent of the group's activities.

FT  23 NOV 94 / People: Metrotect: new finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metrotect Industries, the newly-floated company which makes protective
coatings for pipelines, is changing its finance director less than a
fortnight after it warned that its profits would be sharply lower in the
current year.
Guy Thomas, 31, a senior audit manager with Ernst &amp; Young, the company's
auditors, joins the company as finance director on January 1. He replaces
Jim Ball who will remain on the board as company secretary.
Metrotect, which was floated on the stock market at 108p a share in the
summer of 1993, has failed to live up to expectations. In the year before
its flotation, it more than trebled its profits and doubled its turnover to
Pounds 22.6m. But in its first full year as a public company its profits
rose by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 2.36m and turnover fell slightly.
Earlier this month Metrotect reported a jump in interim pre-tax profits but
warned that its full year profits were likely to be below last year's
figure. Yesterday, Metrotect said it is now carrying out a review of all
contracts being undertaken or anticipated and had instructed Ernst &amp; Young
to review the company's budgeting and management information system. This
review will include the budget for the year ending March 31 1995.
Metrotect, which was created from a 1990 management buy-out from BPB
Industries, said that it is clear that the result for the second six months
is likely to be no better than the result for the first six months.
As a result of this statement analysts have downgraded their forecasts from
Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.6m and the shares fell by 9p to 60p yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allen Halliwell, 58, the former technical director of Porvair, one of the
world's leading producers of microporous materials, is retiring after 25
years with the group. Halliwell was one of the three directors who helped
organise the management buy-out from United Technologies in 1982. The other
two are Doug Berwick, a former finance director, who retired nearly ten
years ago, and John Morgan, 55, the chairman.
Halliwell, who steps down at the end of November, is currently managing
director of the group's Middlesex-based Porvair Filtronics, a medical
diagnostics subsidiary and the smallest of Porvair's businesses. Ken
Symonds, Porvair's finance director, said that the group was sad to lose
Halliwell and wished him a long and happy retirement. However, Symonds
stressed that his departure would not damage Porvair's technological lead in
microporous materials. Porvair spends 5 per cent of its turnover on research
and development and has 40 technologists on its 370 staff.

<TEXT>
Simon Engineering has brought in two outside executives, John Mottram and
Frank Cunliffe, to run Simon Access (UK), a new company which integrates all
its powered access activities in the UK. Mottram, most recently deputy md at
Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, becomes managing director of Simon Access
(UK). Cunliffe, previously the engineering director at Massey Ferguson
Tractors, is appointed to the new post of operations director. The new
company combines the former Simon Gloster Saro, Simon-Dudley and Simon
Access Sales and Service, and will begin trading on January 1. It follows
the restructuring of the Simon Access UK manufacturing operations into one
plant at Gloucester. The access business is one of three on which Simon
Engineering is concentrating, as part of its restructuring. The managing
director of Simon Access is Ron Wheeler, who took over from John Barker
early this year.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Cutting the head count and cashing in - Longer
term performance-related share bonus schemes are a stiffer test of
management ability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By US standards the Pounds 205,000 rise in basic annual salary awarded to
Cedric Brown, the chief executive of British Gas, is nothing to write home
about. In the UK, however, a 75 per cent rise for the head of a former
public utility could hardly go unnoticed on the weekend of the first
national lottery draw when a large proportion of the country's adult
population was dreaming of sudden riches.
Postal chiefs, in particular, must have been weeping over what might have
been theirs but for a few recalcitrant Conservative MPs bent on keeping the
Royal Mail in public hands.
Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, appeared to defend the rise when
he said that the former state-run utility had been transformed into a 'world
class company, winning in the market places of the world.' By 1998, after
its reorganisation is complete, the company will have shed some 40,000 jobs
out of its UK gas business.
The British Gas remuneration committee concluded that its directors were
underpaid compared with other UK-based international companies of a similar
size. While retention would not be expected to be an issue with Brown, who
at 59 has a 39-year career in the industry behind him, the company pointed
out that were he to fall under a bus tomorrow it would need to have a
competitive salary and bonus package in place to attract potential
successors.
Gordon Brown, Labour's industry spokesman, has responded by assuring us that
he will remove the tax benefits for executive share options which have
bumped up directors' pay for so long. It seems that the Conservative Party
is working on similar lines.
As pointed out here previously, however, removing the income tax exemption
is unlikely to make much difference to the popularity of such schemes for
the simple reason that the top marginal rate of income tax from which the
realised options are exempt is the same as that of Capital Gains Tax from
which they are not.
The biggest loss in any change would be the annual Pounds 5,800 tax free
allowance for CGT and the ability to delay the tax liability to the point at
which the shares are sold. The differences made by such a change in tax
treatment could not be expected to deter companies from running executive
share option schemes.
David Tuch, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, argues against removing the
income tax exemption if options are to be used as a way of keeping a
director's financial interest in the company. Income tax could force their
sale, in part, to pay the tax that would become due at the point the option
was exercised, he says, thus reducing the financial interest which
remuneration committees are seeking to retain.
In a new survey into executive share option schemes, KPMG has found that
some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 10.5bn in publicly quoted shares allocated to
executive option schemes in the UK are without reference to the performance
of the company.
While the situation is changing, says Tuch, slightly more than half the
companies introducing schemes since 1988 have provided performance targets
for their schemes.
Tuch is unimpressed by the various targets linked to earnings per share
which he says have not proved very demanding in most cases. He suggests that
regulations could be introduced, imposing restrictions extending the period
that executives need to hold onto their options after they have been
granted. This would reduce the temptation to cut and run. Such restrictions
already exist in the US and France.
At least British Gas is making its executive pay more visible and replacing
its existing executive directors' share option scheme with a long-term
incentive arrangement similar to that operated by Reuters. This will align
the interests of the executives more closely to those of the shareholders.
A suggestion by the MSF technical union this week that chief executives
should have part of their pay related to their performance was timely, if
also mischievous, particularly when the union added that it could be
apportioned on the basis of an appraisal by subordinates.
The point that the MSF seemed to be making was that if you are going to
introduce certain types of human resource medicines such as
performance-related pay you should be prepared to take them yourself.
For some reason big companies seem to treat their directors on a different
basis than their other employees. General pay rises to the mass of the
workforce seem to be awarded using the principle that asks: what is the
least we need to pay them while keeping them motivated and in post? In
contrast the approach to the board and other higher management often seems
to be: if you cut costs and maximise profits you will reap handsome returns
for yourself.
This has led to what CK Prahalad and Gary Hamel described in their book,
Competing for the Future, as an obsession among US and British management
with improving their return on investment by reducing each or all of four
elements: investment, net assets, capital employed and head count. As
Prahalad and Hamel observe, US and British managers can downsize, declutter,
de-layer and divest better than any others.
The result in Britain during the mid 1980s, they point out, was
manufacturing productivity increasing faster than that of any other large
industrialised country except Japan. While they cut their workforces,
however, British companies did little to create new markets either at home
or abroad, according to Prahalad and Hamel. In effect, they say, British
companies surrendered global market share.
'One almost expected to pick up the Financial Times and find that Britain
had finally matched Japan's manufacturing productivity - and that the last
remaining person at work in British manufacturing was the most productive
son of a gun on the planet,' they wrote.
So who has reaped the financial benefit for this profitability at the
expense of jobs? Is it the managers who made it happen? Is that what
executive share options have done - awarded big bonuses to people who have
learned how to get more out of fewer people?
These are the people who have employed equations similar to that quoted,
somewhat cynically, by Charles Handy, the business writer - 1/2 x 2 x 3:
half as many people in the core of the business, paid twice as much,
producing three times as much.
Prahalad and Hamel, however, warn against too vicious downsizing. They
write: 'What employees hear from such companies is 'people are our most
important assets'. What they see is that people are the most expendable
asset.'
Restructuring seldom results in fundamental business improvements, they
write. At best it buys time. What it may have also bought is time for
smaller competitors benefitting from growth fed partly by the expertise of
those employees cleared out in the recession.
In the meantime consultants continue to wrestle with the most appropriate
ways of rewarding and retaining higher management. If the British Gas pay
package had been structured to encourage its top managers to come into the
company, restructure, then take the money and run, the criticism of Brown's
pay rise might have had more validity.
Unlike many other companies - as the KPMG report revealed - British Gas has
tried to link pay and performance in a meaningful and transparent way.
In so doing it appears to have overcome the iniquities of simple bolt-on
share options where performance is related more to the level of the market.
The real performance test now will be whether managements of slimmer,
restructured companies can produce the growth to match productivity gains.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Cabinet probes 'smart cards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cabinet has set up a sub-committee to investigate the potential use of
'smart cards' by government departments.
The sub-committee, chaired by Mr David Hunt, the prime minister's chief
cabinet troubleshooter, includes ministers representing most of the big
government departments.
Several departments are reviewing the potential uses of smart cards, with
which individuals could carry personal details such as health records and
benefit entitlements.
The terms of reference require the sub-committee to ensure a co-ordinated
approach to the developing technology of card systems, which allow
information to be stored electronically on cards about the same size as a
credit card.
It is also required to take account of 'the impact on the individual
citizen', reflecting cabinet sensitivity about opposition to smart cards by
civil liberties groups.
The most widespread use of such cards in other countries is to operate
electronic 'road-pricing' systems, under which drivers pay for access to
restricted areas.

FT  23 NOV 94 / MPs seek end to quarantine policy: Health 'passports'
proposed for pets from EU and rabies-free countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons agriculture committee will today recommend a wholesale change in
government policy on quarantine for pets, saying it should be replaced
immediately with a cheaper system of vaccinations and blood-testing.
The proposed change, under which pets would require health 'passports',
would apply to dogs and cats entering the UK from other European Union
countries and countries free of rabies. The six-month quarantine would
continue for pets from other destinations.
The committee says: 'We consider that a system such as we propose would
effectively decrease the likelihood (of rabies entering the UK) not least
because the costs of the new procedure, a small fraction of the expense of
quarantine, would no longer provide an incentive for many to smuggle their
animals into this country.'
The cost of quarantine for a 'sizeable dog' can vary between Pounds 600 and
Pounds 1,500, the committee says. The MPs are calling for compensation for
owners of quarantine kennels wishing to leave the industry or convert their
businesses.
But the British Veterinary Association yesterday opposed the immediate
ending of quarantine, saying the EU should first be free of rabies.
The MPs point out that the incidence of animal rabies in the EU has fallen
sharply from 8,506 in 1989 to 1,207 last year, and that the European
Commission believes it will be eradicated within two or three years.
The agriculture committee admits it may have difficulty persuading the
government of its case. 'Neither reform nor replacement of the quarantine
system is under active consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture, which
is adopting a position of Olympian detachment on the issue.'
Under their proposed changes, modelled on measures adopted by Sweden in May,
dogs and cats due to be imported into the UK from approved countries would
be identified by a unique number carried in an implanted microchip or
tattoo.
The animals would have to be vaccinated at the age of three months or above,
undergo a blood test four months later to establish their immunity, and
spend at least six months in the approved country before entering the UK.
Pets would be allowed in for up to 12 months after the initial vaccination,
with frequent travellers requiring annual boosters. Vaccination records and
other health certificates would be carried in a passport relating to the
animal.
However, Mr Paul DeVile, president of the British Veterinary Association,
said yesterday that tattooing was difficult and microchip technology
insufficiently advanced, while standards of health certification differed
across the EU.
The committee also considered health controls on imported farm animals. It
concluded that the European single market had not resulted in the 'disease
time-bomb' some experts predicted.

FT  23 NOV 94 / West of Shetland fields promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday put development of oil and gas fields in the deep
Atlantic waters west of Shetland on the 'fast track'.
More than 60 of the 164 blocks being offered for oil and gas exploration
under the 16th offshore licensing round are in this region. Mr Charles
Wardle, junior energy minister, said he hoped the fast-track process would
see further development west of Shetland start as early as next summer.
He also called for nominations from oil companies for the 17th licensing
round which would 'stretch out to new horizons to the west of the UK'.
Preliminary drilling results suggest that the west of Shetland region has
the potential to produce up to a third of Britain's present North Sea output
of 2.5m barrels a day. Earlier this month the government gave approval for
Foinaven, the first oilfield in the region. British Petroleum and Shell will
spend Pounds 550m to develop it.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Dealers move into electronic motor trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An electronic auction system allowing 'live' trading of used cars between
manufacturers, leasing companies and dealer networks throughout the country
has been launched as a joint venture between the Midlands-based CMA auctions
group and Mitac, the Motor Industry Training and Consultancy group.
Citroen UK, Peugeot Talbot, Volkswagen/Audi and Honda are among
manufacturers which have used the system to dispose of vehicles or are
considering it.
CMA Remarketing, the joint venture company, is planning to expand the
'remarketing' concept - of which the electronic auction system forms a part
 -throughout Europe.
Mr George Inch, CMA Group's chief executive, said yesterday that dealers in
South Africa - like the UK, a right-hand-drive market - were buying through
the system.
The venture opens a potentially wider market to carmakers, importers and
leasing and fleet operators in which to dispose of their vehicles.
It is designed to help dealers locate a particular car being sought by a
customer anywhere in the country, irrespective of make, or to help a
dealership find alternative buyers for stock which is difficult to sell in
its area.
The number of used vehicles traded in the UK industry in recent years,
before being put on sale on dealer forecourts, has swollen to several
hundred thousand as a result of growth in the fleet car market, increasing
turnover of rental fleets and the rapid rise in popularity among private
buyers of 'personal contract' schemes, such as Ford's 'Options'.
Traditionally, such vehicles are disposed of either through 'dealer-only'
auctions or through individual manufacturers' dealer networks. But their
numbers are now so great that they are no longer easily absorbed.
The electronic auction - which uses satellite links - is the key element of
a system which includes electronic stock location, sealed bid sales and
telemarketing.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Executive share option schemes 'lack performance targets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some two-thirds of UK-listed companies are operating executive share option
schemes without any performance targets, KPMG Peat Marwick said.
A survey by the accountancy firm of 374 companies listed on the London Stock
Exchange with executive share option schemes found that some Pounds 7bn of
the Pounds 10.5bn of publicly quoted shares allocated to executive option
schemes do not refer to performance.
Mr David Tuch, a KPMG tax partner, said: 'It is clear from our survey that
in the vast majority of the original schemes, there was no attempt to link
the company's performance in any way to the rewards via share options . . .
a senior executive could expect.'
While this was now changing, he said, only slightly more than half the
companies introducing schemes since 1988 had performance targets.
Mr Tuch said the report highlighted a need for schemes to be more closely
related to performance:
'Executive share options should be powerful performance motivators for
directors, linking their rewards to those of shareholders.'
The government is under pressure to end the income tax exemption for Inland
Revenue-approved schemes. This was introduced in 1984 and led to a
proliferation of schemes giving executives the right to acquire shares in
the future, usually at a price based on the share price at the time the
option was granted.
The schemes were initially popular because they were financed by equity
rather than profits, but companies have been under pressure from
institutions to introduce option performance targets.
The survey found some 74 per cent of schemes with performance targets used
formulae linked to earnings per share, although this was losing its
popularity.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Business sets out its case to Clarke - How
industry is arguing for efforts to stimulate investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke knows more than most previous chancellors of the exchequer
about the benefits of investment in business. He is a son of the industrial
east Midlands - and the grandson of an engineering pattern maker.
He may recall, as he waits on the front bench on Tuesday to deliver his
Budget, that his early years were spent in a pit village. His father
progressed from colliery electrician to owner of a watch repair shop.
This background of solid commercial endeavour suits the chancellor's image
down to the ground.
But will his Budget reflect the pressure from employers for practical help
to encourage investment? The need to bolster investment in manufacturing was
made plain by the news at the weekend that capital spending by industry was
Pounds 2.74bn in the third quarter of this year - 1 per cent lower than the
second quarter and unchanged from the same period a year ago.
Investment has lagged behind the economic recovery although industry groups
had predicted that it would be catching up fast. The disappointing figures
may be revised upwards, but they serve as a warning.
Earlier this year radical reform seemed to be on the agenda. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, then financial secretary to the Treasury, appeared to question in
public the high level of dividend payments by companies.
The Institute of Fiscal Studies sees the tax treatment of dividends as an
incentive for companies to pay profits to shareholders, rather than keeping
them to invest in the expansion and development of the business.
But the reaction to Mr Dorrell's intervention on taxation and dividends was
swift. Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, accused
him of 'sounding like a socialist'. Dividends, he said, were for the
shareholders and the company to decide.
The prime minister appeared to close the door on reform in his response.
'There's no question of dividend control from a Conservative government.
Dividend control is socialism. I'm a Tory - dividend control is a
non-starter,' said Mr John Major.
With Mr Dorrell now at National Heritage, the IFS acknowledges that a move
on dividend taxation is unlikely. But the chancellor is still under pressure
to do something about corporate investment and his penchant for eye-catching
policy, exhibited in the last Budget, promises innovation at least.
Mr Ian Thompson, head of economics at the Engineering Employers Federation,
is certain action is needed. He said: 'There is a long-term discrepancy in
the British economy in that there is too much consumption spending relative
to investment.'
Last month the federation joined six other industry associations to petition
the chancellor to stimulate investment. They called for the introduction of
full first-year capital allowances for at least the initial Pounds 200,000
of plant and machinery, and they wanted capital allowances index-linked.
They asked the chancellor to reform capital gains tax on corporate equity
holdings to encourage continued investment, with the rate reduced according
to the period for which the investment has been held.
The CBI joined the federation in signing the open letter. Mr Andrew Buxton,
chairman of its economic affairs committee, said that while the chancellor's
options were limited, he should seek to boost investment and support smaller
companies.
The CBI is urging the expansion of venture capital trusts, which fill the
'equity gap' for small businesses, and improvements to enterprise investment
schemes so they are tailored more for small companies.
Mr Richard Brown, the deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, can see no room for changes in corporation tax rates but thinks
the chancellor might raise the threshold under which companies pay a basic
rate of 25 per cent from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000.
Employers' National Insurance contributions might be cut by the chancellor -
but only to balance an increase in employees' National Insurance which would
be charged on all income in order to bring it into line with PAYE.
Dr Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors,
said: 'Capitalism needs capital and we are saying to the chancellor that he
needs to take a long-term look at the tax system.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Call for change in societies' regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society, the country's second biggest, yesterday called
for a single qualifying period before society members become eligible for
rights and benefits of membership.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said in evidence to the Commons
Treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that there was a case
for a single statutory test of membership - such as having been an investor
or a borrower for two years - which would apply for voting and ownership.
While such a change would reduce the number of members eligible to vote at a
time when there was increased emphasis on societies' accountability, it
would remove some of the anomalies of the current arrangements.
For example, In the case of the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society only C&amp;G investing members of more
than two years' standing could can receive a cash share of the price,
although a larger number of members - including borrowers - could can vote
on whether to accept the offer.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Rethink on plans for County Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tortuous history of County Hall, the prominent Thames-side building
which once housed the Greater London Council, took another twist yesterday
when plans to turn part of the site into a hotel were abandoned.
Shirayama, the Japanese developer which paid Pounds 60m for County Hall last
year, now plans to turn the building into offices and exhibition space.
Mr Mac Toyota, Shirayama's representative in London, said yesterday: 'We had
a better idea. We are not saying that the hotel business is not profitable.'
Plans for the rest of the 1.5m sq ft site - including conference facilities,
a leisure centre, and Europe's biggest aquarium - remained unchanged.
Luxury hotels in London have recovered from the recession and are now
enjoying occupancies well above 90 per cent.
The hotel was expected to cost Pounds 25m out of a total construction budget
of more than Pounds 100m. Shirayama has spent Pounds 10m on the site so far,
although work on the planned hotel had not started.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which had agreed to run the 600-bedroom
hotel and to help operate the leisure centre, reacted angrily.
The group, which hopes to meet Shirayama officials today, said: 'We came
into the deal on the basis that together we were going to create one of the
best hotels in London and the country's most exciting leisure complex. We
still believe in that project and are very keen to go ahead. We have a
legally binding contract which we expect them to honour and we have
contacted Shirayama to say so.'
Virgin said Shirayama's pledge to go ahead with the entertainment and
leisure centre was inadequate. It said it regarded the hotel as the
project's centrepiece.
Mr Toyota said it was not clear whether the revised scheme would require
planning permission because existing consents covered business and
residential use.
Cambridge Seven Associates, the US architect, has been appointed to design
the new scheme, which will be known as the Pacific Asia Centre.
Lambeth Council said: 'Our principal concerns are for the preservation and
beneficial use of this building, which is an important part of London's
heritage, and to ensure that any development benefits the local economy. We
will be looking carefully at any proposals which are put to us.'
Shirayama bought the site after a fierce battle with the London School of
Economics.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Shake-up of accounting rules urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 90 per cent of companies could be released from having to follow
accounting standards under a radical plan published yesterday.
The accountancy profession's working party on standards, commissioned by the
Accounting Standards Board, said small companies should be exempt from most
rules.
The working party suggests in a consultative document that future accounting
standards should not apply to small companies unless a specific reason is
given by the regulators.
If the document wins wide approval it will be submitted to the standards
board.
Exemption for small companies would represent the most radical reform of the
scope of accounting standards for half a century.
While the proposal may be popular with small companies and their auditors,
the response from other interested parties, such as bankers, regulators, and
the Inland Revenue, may not be as supportive.
Mr Ken Wild, chairman of the working party set up under the auspices of the
six professional bodies, said: 'The working party is suggesting that the
methods of reporting that have been developed as wholly appropriate to large
companies may sometimes be inappropriate for small companies.
'We hope that if we relieve such companies of the need to follow some
standards we will improve the way in which they communicate what has
happened to their businesses.'
Mr Wild said many accounting standards were now incorporated in the
Companies Act. More complex standards were a burden which often prevented
small companies from communicating clearly through their accounts.
The working party's research identified costs carried by small companies as
a result of standards, including audit fees and the loss of competitive
advantage due to the need to disclose information not already public.
The consultative document suggests that small companies should be as defined
under the Companies Act - a business should not exceed two or more of three
criteria: a turnover of Pounds 2.8m, a balance sheet total (assets) of
Pounds 1.4m, or an average of 50 employees.
The document suggests that small companies should comply with five standards
 -as opposed to four suggested in an earlier leaked version of the report:
those covering government grants, stock and long-term contracts, research
and development, post balance-sheet events, and contingencies.
The consultation period will run to the end of February next year.

Mr John Thompson, manager of Lloyd's hardship scheme, said yesterday that

FT  23 NOV 94 / Law firms' growth beats economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Solicitors' turnover grew faster than the economy as a whole during the
recession, the Law Society said yesterday.
In total, the turnover of law firms increased 25 per cent between 1989-90
and 1992-93 while the monetary value of GDP rose 22 per cent.
In the 1992-93 financial year, however, turnover failed to keep pace with
inflation. Total turnover of solicitors' firms in England and Wales was
Pounds 6.42bn, an increase of only 3.3 per cent on the previous year.
The society said conveyancing, the traditional barometer of the profession,
has shown some increase in volume this year but the recovery in the early
part of the year has not been maintained.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Gas pay rises 'outstrip others'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff in the gas industry have experienced pay increases above the average
for the whole economy, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy says today, Motoko Rich writes.
Following attacks on British Gas for giving Mr Cedric Brown, its chief
executive, a 75 per cent pay rise, a study by the institute found that gas
industry earnings have risen 42.8 per cent since 1990 as opposed to 23.8 per
cent in the whole economy.
The study also found that among all the privatised utilities - gas,
telecommunications, electricity, and water - employees have received
increases above the average rate in all industries.
When looking at weekly earnings, the study also found that in the economy as
a whole 30 per cent of full-time adult workers earn less than Pounds 220 per
week. But in the regulated industries under 10 per cent of employees earn
less than that.

FT  23 NOV 94 / ScottishPower launches telecoms subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ScottishPower yesterday launched a telecommunications subsidiary to compete
with British Telecommunications and Mercury for the provision of business
services in Scotland.
ScottishTelecom will use an optical fibre network which is being installed
at a cost of Pounds 35m alongside ScottishPower's overhead and underground
cables in central Scotland.
The company claims customers making a mixture of local and long-distance
calls via an exchange will achieve savings on call charges compared with BT
and Mercury of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.
ScottishTelecom will introduce a standard Scottish rate for calls, other
than local calls, to anywhere in Scotland. It believes BT and Mercury, which
charge a long-distance rate for calls between cities will find it hard to
respond to its Scottish rate.
ScottishTelecom is the latest development in ScottishPower's strategy of
diversifying from its core electricity business. It already has a gas
subsidiary, CaledonianGas, and has expanded in retailing by buying many of
the Clydesdale Group's electrical goods stores from the receiver.
Mr Rod Matthews, ScottishTelecom chief executive, said all the current
telecommunications operators had tariffs 'biased towards the large
metropolitan areas, with London enjoying a number of special advantages on
top of that'.
ScottishTelecom has a partnership agreement with Energis, the
telecommunications network owned by the National Grid company, which began
operating this year. ScottishTelecom will use Energis's network south of the
border. It will use Colt's network in the City of London.
ScottishTelecom has not established connections to Aberdeen, Dundee and
other places in Scottish Hydro-Electric's electricity franchise area, but is
discussing using Hydro-Electric's telecommunications system or installing
its own.
ScottishTelecom has already begun providing services to a small number of
large users such as the BBC and will offer its full range of services from
next March. Full scale marketing began yesterday.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Nuclear group to seek more freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned company which generates nearly half of
Scotland's electricity, said yesterday it would be seeking greater
commercial freedom regardless of whether ministers agreed to its request for
privatisation.
It also said it would have to write off about Pounds 20m of development
costs if it was refused permission to open 'dry store' facilities which it
wants as an alternative to sending spent fuel, at greater expense, to BNFL,
the state-owned reprocessing company.
Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive, made the warning as he revealed details
of the company's improved performance in the first half of the year.
While declining to disclose the company's profitability, Mr Jeffrey said
output had risen by 16 per cent in the first half of last year to 7.7
terawatt (million million watt) hours.
Provided the company received the government's permission to open dry stores
at its two power stations, it was on course to meet its target of cutting
costs from 3.2p per kilowatt hour three years ago to 2.5p this year.
It has set a new target of 2p to be achieved by 1998. Mr Jeffrey said this
could be achieved by increasing output from about 16.8 terawatt hours this
year to 19TWh by 1998 through improved overall efficiency and a cut in
inspections, when plants have to be closed, from every two years to every
three.
The company said staff numbers were below 1,900, compared with 2,200 two
years ago. By the end of the year it expects to employ about 1,750 people.
Mr Jeffrey said the company's discussions with government advisers over the
nuclear review had been positive. 'I hope our plans for the future will
convince the government that they can unshackle us and give us the freedom
to develop and diversify.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Lib Dems flesh out Bank reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, is to put
forward detailed plans for a reform of the Bank of England, giving it
greater independence from the government and the institutions of the City of
London.
Mr Bruce is to flesh out his party's commitment to giving the Bank greater
control over the setting of interest rates.
Presenting his party's alternative Budget tomorrow, Mr Bruce will call for
the Bank's role to be modelled along the lines of the New Zealand Central
Bank, with the government setting a broad inflation target and the Bank
having total control over the setting of monetary policy.
He will also call for the Bank to appoint executive directors from the
regions to play a crucial role in the setting of monetary policy. These
representatives will vote on monetary policy changes, enjoying powers
similar to those of the regional governors of the US Federal Reserve and
Germany's Bundesbank.
The Liberal Democrats will make clear that they are committed to widening
the inflation target within which the UK monetary authorities are operating.
The Bank implied in a recent Inflation Report that it was using a target
range for inflation of 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent up to the next general
election.
Mr Bruce believes this target will require the government to raise interest
rates too sharply. He is proposing a broader band of zero to 3 per cent for
the coming years.
The Liberal Democrats remain the only party committed to creating a
completely independent central bank for the UK.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has given the Bank greater power in the
setting of interest rates by publishing the minutes of the monthly meeting
between himself and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England's governor.
The Liberal Democrats say that the government can only pursue a credible
counter-inflationary policy by abandoning political constraints and giving
the Bank full control over monetary policy. They plan to publish a detailed
policy document on the issue early next year.
The party would want to ensure that local variations in inflation, wages and
growth were taken into account when setting policy by appointing regional
directors to the Bank.
The Liberal Democrats say that the style of the Bank is too heavily
influenced by movements in financial markets, especially bonds and
currencies.
They would create a 'policymaking executive', modelled on the Bundesbank
council, in which central and regional directors would vote on policy
changes.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Ministers study BAe's RAF offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An offer by British Aerospace to maintain the Royal Air Force's existing
fleet of Hercules transport aircraft at a fixed price, with a set number of
aircraft available at any one time, is to be discussed by a cabinet
committee tomorrow.
The proposal, which was sent to Mr Roger Freeman, the UK defence procurement
minister, will be discussed with recommendations by a Ministry of Defence
procurement committee to buy a number of C-130J Lockheed aircraft as an
alternative to refurbishment.
BAe has made the offer because it wants the MoD to buy the European Future
Large Aircraft, for which BAe will build the wings. However, the FLA will
not become available until 2002, while the RAF argues that its Hercules
fleet will need replacement from 1996.
Thus far many MoD insiders have strongly backed replacement of half of the
60-strong ageing Lockheed Hercules with the same company's C-130J rather
than opting for refurbishment, which it had considered uneconomic.
However, the Treasury is thought to be interested in BAe's proposals, which
would not require the MoD to buy new aircraft or refurbish the existing
Hercules fleet. Both departments will be represented at the committee
meeting on Thursday, as will the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Scottish Office.
BAe has offered to maintain a fleet of 50 Hercules aircraft, 70 per cent of
which would be available at any time, at a fixed cost 20 per cent lower than
the RAF's current maintenance costs.
The company is also undertaking to complete any refurbishment work which is
needed at no cost to the RAF. BAe puts the cost of maintaining the Hercules
fleet at Pounds 52m a year.
In a separate note BAe has also suggested that the MoD sells its Hercules
fleet to BAe and leases it back to further improve the department's
finances.
The RAF is thought to have only half of its 60 Hercules available for use at
any time. It is also thought to be intending to reduce the size of the fleet
to 50 in 1996 even if its opts for replacement rather than refurbishment.
BAe's document claims that its offer would thus mean an increase in the
number of aircraft available at a lower cost.
The MoD confirmed that it had received an unsolicited approach from BAe
which it was considering. However, it could not confirm how quickly any
decision would be made. The MoD has said it intends to make a decision about
the Hercules fleet before Christmas.
In its document BAe says that its proposal will 'deliver real value for
money to the MoD and RAF while transferring risk to the private sector'.

The publication of the figures comes as the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
embarks on radical changes in the way economic statistics are presented and
marketed to business.
The CSO and Taylor Nelson AG, the market research group, will launch the new
business series in London today. The data will include a range of new
import, export and manufacturing figures in almost 5,000 categories ranging
from steel to sawdust and truffles.
Although information on most industrial sectors will be published on an
annual basis, figures will be provided on a quarterly basis for industries
which have been requesting this, such as the chemicals sector and the
pump-making industry.
The publication of official import penetration figures marks a significant
improvement in the statistical base. The Department of Trade and Industry
used to publish data showing approximate levels of import penetration. This
was stopped in 1987 under the government of Mrs Margaret (now Baroness)
Thatcher.
Many observers suspect this decision reflected official unease with the
growth in the trade deficit. Government officials insist in public, however,
that the decision was made to save resources and cut red tape.
The new publication was yesterday welcomed by industry groups. The Chemicals
Industry Association, which earlier this year criticised official data for
being too limited, said yesterday that it had been collaborating with the
CSO and Taylor Nelson to produce the series.
Mr Nick Sturgeon, economist at the association, said: 'We welcome this,
particularly because the UK statistical base had gone through a period of
erosion. This information is the lifeblood for companies who are trying to
market their production and plan for the future.'
Some groups yesterday expressed unease that the development might add to the
statistical load on companies. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of
the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This is a good initiative. Our main
worry is that it is going to be an additional burden on business.'
The pricing policy for the new series may also generate controversy. The
total purchase cost for all the information for a year is expected to be
almost Pounds 5,000. The separate sectoral annual reports will average
slightly less than Pounds 100.
This will be significantly more than the previous, more limited, business
publications printed by Her Majesty's Stationery Office and subsidised by
the government.
The initiative to upgrade the business publications follows the decision
earlier this year by the CSO to award the contract for the marketing of this
data to Taylor Nelson.
This was the first contract for handling statistics to be awarded to the
private sector and comes as the CSO embarks on a controversial market
testing programme and seeks to establish a greater business focus and
stronger commercial footing.
Although the initiative has been broadly welcomed in the City, it has
stirred controversy in the CSO itself, with some officials saying that
selling statutory data may contravene principles of freedom of information.
According to Taylor Nelson the contract for the new business series will be
worth up to Pounds 3m a year.
The series will be based on the statutory business data collected under the
European Community directive known as Prodcom. This requires all member
states to collect data on a harmonised basis which can be easily compared to
official trade statistics.
Although Britain expressed reluctance over the directive, it has become the
first EU country to publish the data.
The data will cover some information that has been published by the HMSO in
the Business Monitor series. But the number of sectors covered in the new
series will be raised from 3,500 products to almost 5,000, and by
harmonising the product classification with EU trade figures the data will
allow detailed import penetration figures to be published for the first
time.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Aitken and Portillo hit out at EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the cabinet's leading Eurosceptics last night attacked the economic
performance of the European Union as the government fought to contain a
threatened backbench rebellion over an increase in UK contributions.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, giving the Nicholas Ridley
memorial lecture in London, said that Europe was 'trailing badly in the slow
lane' of world economic growth.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, said in a speech to the
Institute of Directors that Europe was underperforming because of
'interventionist and centralising' policies.
Both ministers distanced themselves from opponents of membership of the EU,
saying that job creation and trade prospects could be improved by
deregulatory policies.
But their comments risk increasing antipathy to the European Communities
finance bill, which rightwing backbenchers have vowed to oppose in spite of
Mr John Major's threat to call a general election if the bill is defeated.
Mr Aitken, while warning against EU complacency, was careful to endorse
Britain's continued membership of the EU as a means of developing
Continental trade. He rebuked rightwing Conservative backbenchers by calling
for an end to time wasting 'infighting' about EU institutions.
Mr Aitken said there was too much introspective debating about 'theoretical
political concepts' such as 'variable geometry', the idea of a multispeed EU
developed by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, as a means of mollifying
the Tory party's pro and anti-European wings.
But he said the union was responding sluggishly to the challenge of a
historical shift in economic power to the Asia Pacific region. 'The reality
of what we have to face is not a two-speed Europe but a two-speed world, in
which Europe is trailing badly in the slow lane,' he said.
Mr Portillo said that too many people in Brussels sought to protect those
already in work rather than tackling unemployment. He called for a
deregulatory 'jobs agenda for Europe'.
Echoing his Eurosceptic speech at last month's Conservative party
conference, he said: 'I cannot accept that a Europe which excludes 20m
people from sharing in its prosperity is a Europe which is working.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Labour on attack over Tory leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will today attempt to add to the government's discomfort at
the leak of a Conservative campaign document by proposing legislation based
on the draft paper's policy recommendations.
Much of the draft paper, written for the prime minister by Mr John Maples,
the party's deputy chairman, is supported by Conservative backbenchers
though its policy recommendations have not been adopted.
The paper urged postponing the implementation of the second instalment of
value added tax on fuel, increasing tax on executive share options and
slowing the pace of reform of the National Health Service.
Very similar proposals will be made today by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, in his amendment to the Queen's speech. His proposed amendment
also draws liberally on criticisms of the government's performance contained
in the paper, which is based on a survey of disenchanted Conservative
voters.
The paper, obtained by the Financial Times, also says: 'Press coverage of
good stories (about the economy) is crucial . . . Can we have a network for
gathering these stories? I am sure the unions give the broadcasters many of
the job loss stories. Through the DTI and Invest in Britain Bureau we could
capture most of the big foreign investments.'
Mr Brown said last night that this was a proposal 'to use public bodies as
outposts of the Conservative party's public relations department'.
The paper is particularly critical of the government's economic policy. It
says: 'It is no use pursuing fiscal and monetary rectitude if there are no
rising living standards and job opportunities until too late.'
It says, however, that the government's image will be improved if it can
find outsiders to make public statements of support: 'Third party endorsers
are infinitely more believable than ministers.' Another suggestion is that
'we must avoid antagonising our friends in the police, CBI etc if we can
possibly help it'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Channel One gears up for 24-hour London cable service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, described himself
yesterday as the nanny 'arriving before the birth and staying for a few
weeks after'.
The birth is that of Channel One, a 24-hour television news channel for
London, and Sir David is overseeing the November 30 launch from the former
headquarters of Channel 4 television in central London.
The channel, which will be exclusive to the 39 cable television franchises
in the London area, will have 29 one-person camera units - or video
journalists - covering the capital.
Channel One, which is expected to cost Associated up to Pounds 40m before
break-even, is important for both the newspaper group and for the cable
television industry.
For Associated it is a way of trying to sidestep cross-media ownership rules
that severely limit newspaper groups' involvement in conventional
television.
For the cable industry Channel One is part of plans to develop cable-only
programming to differentiate cable from satellite television and reduce the
dependence on channels provided by British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
stake.
Mr Julian Aston, managing director of Channel One, believes the channel will
be available in about 285,000 cable homes at launch - all the London cable
franchises except Westminster, which is owned by British Telecommunications.
Channel One said it has been unable to reach a deal with BT so far.
At the outset the audience will be tiny but the channel's business plan
assumes break-even by 1998. By then it hopes cable will have expanded to
such an extent that it will be available in 1.3m homes in London and 11.5m
in the rest of the country.
Mr Aston said: 'By this time next year we hope to be in the Midlands.' He
noted with satisfaction that one of the first brands to inquire about
advertising was Porsche, the upmarket car manufacturer.
Associated has a 10-year agreement with the cable industry. It is believed
the operators will pay Associated 25p a month for each subscriber.
Mr Aston said yesterday: 'Ultimately we want to be a Sky for cable with four
or five cable channels.'
More than 3,000 people applied for the video journalist jobs and most of
those chosen came from radio or weekly journalism. They had eight weeks'
training from Mr Michael Rosenblum, who trained the journalists on New York
I, the successful US news channel that helped inspire Channel One.
Mr Nick Pollard, Channel One's director of programmes and a former editor of
ITN's News at Ten, said he was thrilled by the progress.
He said the channel's crime correspondent had already produced a programme
suitable for a 15-minute slot on national television.
Channel One will cover everything from news and sport to fashion and finance
with an emphasis on travel news and weather updates in the morning.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Labour reveals Railtrack sale plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to privatise Railtrack, which owns railway track,
signalling and stations, with a stock market flotation early in 1996,
according to leaked ministerial memos obtained by Labour, Charles Batchelor
writes.
The plan is expected to be announced tomorrow by Mr Brian Mawhinney,
transport secretary. One City estimate says Railtrack's privatisation would
raise between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn.
Mr Mawhinney, in a letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, says: 'We
have agreed that, for internal planning purposes, our target date for
flotation should be the first quarter of 1996, but that our public stance
should be only that Railtrack will be floated during the life of this
parliament.'
In a separate letter, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, supports the target
date.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'Railtrack's
privatisation will produce the money for the tax-cut bribes in the first
quarter of 1996 in time for the next general election.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Patrician makes play for the centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Sir Marcus Fox, a Yorkshire grammar school boy, has the common touch, Sir
Nicholas Bonsor, his challenger for the chairmanship of the 1922 committee
of Tory MPs, is unmistakably patrician.
A descendant of Horatio Nelson and a former captain of boats at Eton, Sir
Nicholas, 51, is married to the daughter of the second Lord Killearn.
He is a former member of the council of the Lloyd's of London insurance
market. This year's register of MPs' interests lists more than 70 syndicates
of which he is a member.
Sir Nicholas's monied background does not appear to equip him for
advancement in Mr John Major's classless society. But he has both the
gravitas and the independence of mind required for a post in which he would
play an important role in conveying backbench views to the prime minister.
The MP since 1983 for Upminster - at the easternmost extreme of London's
District Line - he can claim to represent the centre of the party and will
hope to attract support from colleagues on the left and right in tomorrow's
contest.
He is distinctly 'wet' on social issues and was a founding member of Francis
(now Lord) Pym's Conservative Centre Forward grouping in 1985. But as
chairman of the Commons defence committee since 1992 he has waged a vocal
and effective campaign against cuts in the armed forces.
He is sufficiently Eurosceptic to have contributed to the government's first
defeat on the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty in March 1993. He was
among 22 Tories who did not vote on a Labour amendment on the European
Committee of the Regions. This was one of several occasions on which he has
demonstrated his independent streak.
Nearly seven years ago he rebelled against a three-line whip to support an
unsuccessful backbench attempt to reform the Official Secrets Act. In July
1985 he was among 48 Conservatives who voted against the authorisation of
big pay rises for top civil servants, senior service officers and judges.
In April 1988 he was the sole Tory to voice sympathy for Mr Ron Brown, his
long-time 'pair' in Commons voting arrangements, before MPs voted to suspend
the hard-left Labour MP for Edinburgh Leith for a month for failing to
apologise fully for damaging the mace.
Sir Nicholas entered parliament as MP for Nantwich in 1979 and is therefore
one of the growing band of Conservative MPs who have never served in
opposition.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Hotels key to PPI's Cyprus assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrators to Polly Peck International said yesterday that the seizure
of two hotels still controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman
and former PPI chairman, took them closer to gaining access to PPI's assets
in northern Cyprus.
Mr Chris Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator, said
he believed northern Cyprus government sequestrators had been appointed to
the Jasmine Court and Palm Beach hotels to recover funds that could be used
to pay an estimated Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 910,000) of taxes and social
security payments owed by Voyager Kibris, a PPI subsidiary.
He understood that the hotels would continue to trade and be returned to the
lawful directors of Voyager Kibris once the debts had been paid. Mr Barlow
said: 'I view this latest action as a step towards gaining access to Polly
Peck assets in northern Cyprus.'
Since 1990 the administrators have been prevented by a series of injunctions
and court orders initiated by Mr Nadir, from gaining access to the group's
assets in north Cyprus. According to its 1989 accounts about two-thirds of
PPI's profits came from its Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot businesses.
Mr Barlow said the seizure of the hotels would allow their revenues to be
used to 'discharge legitimate liabilities of Voyager Kibris'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Tables on schools to grow next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said yesterday that the
government wanted to publish extra data about schools next year.
She said that this year's league tables of schools' exam performance,
published yesterday, were 'never intended to provide a complete picture of
everything that schools do', and they would be 'flawed if they had been
presented as giving a comprehensive picture'.
Her comments followed criticism from teachers' associations, who said the
tables did not take account of schools' intakes, and so could not measure
the improvement of individual pupils.
The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the quango chaired by Sir
Ron Dearing, is expected to publish next week recommendations for measuring
progress at school.
Mrs Shephard said that next year's planned introduction of national
curriculum tests for 11-year-olds 'will give secondary schools the chance to
demonstrate what they have achieved in that five years of secondary
education'.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, had already pledged that a
future Labour government would publish value-added tables.
Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, was more critical.
He said: 'The current school league tables are fundamentally flawed and
should be abolished. They are crude and simplistic and don't compare like
with like.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union,
described the tables as 'worse than useless', and 'a cruel con-trick'. But
he added: 'The league tables will be worth serious consideration when
everyone agrees what should be added to the raw information to take account
of the many factors affecting results.'

<TEXT>
The prosecution case against Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based
businessman and former head of the Elders IXL group, in relation to an
alleged ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 32m) sham foreign exchange transaction, was
described yesterday as 'not a strong one' by the magistrate overseeing the
committal hearing. Mr Graham Hicks, the magistrate, adjourned the hearing
until next week, when the prosecution is due to make a final submission. He
is due to rule on whether Mr Elliott, a prominent figure in Australian
business circles in the 1980s and former president of the Liberal party, and
other former Elders IXL executives should stand trial over the matter early
next month. They are facing charges of theft and conspiracy.
Yesterday, Mr Hicks said he was outlining his tentative view on the case. He
said that there appeared to be an 'abundance of evidence' to indicate that
there was a sham foreign exchange deal, but that the key question was what
involvement Mr Elliott and Mr Peter Scanlon, another key Elders executive,
had in this.

The World Bank is to co-sponsor a foreign investors conference in Paris to
try to get capital flowing into Kyrgyzstan, whose market reforms, western
economists say, have in many ways been a model for the Commonwealth of
Independent States. The bank and the Kyrgyz government have invited 343
foreign investors from 27 nations to Paris on December 7-8. The conference
is meant to allow the Central Asian republic to take an additional step to
reviving its economy. Already, the republic, which has been following an
International Monetary Fund-directed programme, has stabilised its currency,
the som, and appears about to bring inflation below 1 per cent a month,
according to western estimates. In addition, three years after the Soviet
collapse, Kyrgyzstan appears set to become the first CIS republic to achieve
economic growth. Western economists are predicting that its economy will
expand by 1-2 per cent in the second half next year.
While its wealth pales in comparison to neighbouring Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan, the IMF and World Bank have put the spotlight on Kyrgyzstan
because of its monetary stability and liberal investment laws.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Angola ceasefire due to start

A ceasefire ending Angola's 19-year civil war, due to end at midday
yesterday, got off to an uncertain start yesterday when the Luanda
government accused Unita rebels of attacking the northern town of Uige.
Representatives of the warring parties had agreed in Lusaka yesterday on
final details of the implementation of the ceasefire, due to come in effect
48 hours after the Angolan government and the Unita rebel movement signed a
peace pact in the city on Sunday. African diplomats expressed relief that
yesterday's meeting, which put the final touches to arrangements for
disengagement of the two armies and the monitoring of the exercise, had
ended successfully. Some had feared that had Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita
leader, intended to hold up the settlement, yesterday's talks would have run
into difficulties.
The outcome also allayed concern that hardliners in the MPLA government of
President Eduardo dos Santos (pictured above) might wish to press ahead with
an offensive against Unita positions. But leaders of southern African
states, led by the Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, had made clear to Mr
dos Santos that they regarded the recent intensification of fighting as a
breach of the negotiating process. African officials expressed confidence
that the ceasefire would come into effect, but warned that there were likely
to be breaches as a result of communications difficulties and indiscipline.

Japan has a moral and legal obligation to compensate the Asian women who
were forced to provide sexual intercourse for its troops during the second
world war, the International Commission of Jurists said yesterday. It urges
the Japanese government to pay each former 'comfort woman' an immediate
Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 25,500) in compensation, pending steps to provide
'full rehabilitation and restitution'.
The commission's report is likely to embarrass Tokyo at a time when the
Japanese government believes it is on the point of resolving an issue which
has bedevilled diplomatic relations with its neighbours. At the end of
August Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, announced a Dollars 1bn
fund to be used over the next 10 years for exchange programmes and
vocational training centres for women as a token of apology for war
atrocities. But the planned fund does not represent compensation for the
women involved.
The ICJ, which groups some 45 eminent jurists from around the world, is
critical of the handling of the issue by Japan which, it says, appears to be
aimed at placating sentiments rather than finding a solution. In thinly
veiled language the ICJ accuses Tokyo of dragging its heels and covering up
documentary evidence. The Japanese imperial army abducted 100,000 to 200,000
women and girls, often as young as 13, to serve a vast network of 'comfort
stations', it notes.
If Japan does not take action, the matter should be pursued by an
international tribunal or by the United Nations, the ICJ says, adding that
the allied governments also bear a responsibility for ensuring the 'comfort
women' receive justice. Japan argues that war reparations to individuals and
their families were formally settled by the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty.
Many governments, including South Korea and Malaysia, have said they would
not seek additional state-to-state reparations for comfort women. The acts
should have been part of the war crimes trials after the war ended but were
not, because the trials focused on acts committed against nationals of the
allied powers, the ICJ argues.
The ICJ monitors and promotes the rule of law and human rights worldwide. As
an non-governmental organisation it has no formal sanctions it can impose.
Its reports do, however, carry weight with the UN and by publishing them it
hopes the international community will put pressure on governments to
correct human rights abuses.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Armscor finds a place in new South Africa: The close
relationship has surprised most defence analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela, one of the world's most respected statesmen,
yesterday officially opened South Africa's first international defence show,
a display of armour from an industry once aimed at thwarting the political
movement he leads.
The show is the first the country has held since the ending of the UN arms
embargo in May. As air force aircraft and helicopters thundered overhead in
honour of their Commander in Chief, Mr Johan Moolman, chairman of
state-owned South African arms procurer Armscor, praised the government for
its 'supportive role' in helping promote the domestic industry's aim of
boosting its 0.4 per cent of the global arms market, worth about R800m
(Pounds 144m), to 1-2 per cent.
Mr Mandela was equally enthusiastic. Armscor, he said, had developed a
strategic, home-grown technological base that would use its weapons sales to
'serve peace and security' rather than 'death and destruction'.
The close relationship between the industry and Mr Mandela's African
National Congress government has surprised most defence analysts, who had
predicted the political movement would seek to dismantle or at least cut an
industry that seems both incongruous and unnecessary in a post-apartheid
South Africa.
But Armscor has waged a successful public relations battle to win over the
new administration, in part using a national advertising blitz that portrays
it as a mainstay of South African industrial technology and an important
foreign-exchange earner for the South African economy.
'A bee has a sting for its protection,' reads one typical ad caption,
superimposed on a painting of a cuddly bee gathering pollen from a green and
sunny hillside, 'South Africa has one too: Armscor'. Even the company's new
slogan - 'Creating wealth, Protecting the Nation' - is adroitly designed to
highlight both the industry's financial solvency and its strategic role.
Mr Moolman claimed the industry, South Africa's largest manufacturing
exporter, contributed R3bn a year to the economy and employed 70,000 people.
Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, has long been a supporter of domestic arms
manufacturers, but the government has until recently remained uncertain
about backing them wholeheartedly. Mr Joe Slovo, housing minister, has
reportedly urging they be scaled down. Now with Mr Mandela's official
backing, Mr Modise appears to have won the day.
Helping persuade the president is the fact that the industry has some
genuinely competitive products to sell. Armscor was only formally created in
1977, just six months before the UN imposed its embargo, but has developed
the successful G-5 and G-6 artillery pieces, generally regarded as among the
world's best, as well as a range of sophisticated smaller arms and armoured
vehicles.
Responding to the changing political climate, in 1992 it was divided into
two companies, with the rump Armscor becoming primarily a procurement agency
and its manufacturing arm spun off as Denel.
A Denel subsidiary, Atlas Aviation, has recently garnered much international
interest with its Rooivalk attack helicopter.
In line with South Africa's new international image as a model global
citizen, the new Armscor has published a set of ethical principles under
which its arms trade will be conducted. At the same time it has undertaken
to make the trade more transparent by drawing up a list of all approved
countries to which the South African industry will be permitted to sell.
But even with official government support, it is not yet plain sailing.
Already implicated in having sold arms to Iraq, Rwanda and the rebel Unita
movement in Angola, Armscor is the subject of a judicial commission of
inquiry following claims in September that it had sold 15,000 AK-47 rifles
to a Lebanese arms dealer allegedly trans-shipping them to Yemen, a
proscribed country because of its civil war.
At the same time, officials in the defence and foreign ministries are
unwilling to testify to the commission in open court about Armscor's past
military relationships for fear disclosures about its secret dealings during
the apartheid era will alienate many of South Africa's new allies.
More important, because of an indictment served on Armscor and several other
South African defence companies in 1991 by a Philadelphia grand jury on
charges of illegal purchase of American defence technology during the 1980s,
Denel is legally barred from doing any business with the US government or
any American defence companies.
This is a constraint proving costly in the European market where equipment
compatibility with American norms is frequently a requirement in new weapons
acquisition. But while the industry may not become the guarantor of peace Mr
Mandela hopes, optimism is widespread that the exposition will boost the
industry's international profile, and ethical controversies notwithstanding,
Armscor's financial goals at least may prove achievable.

FT  23 NOV 94 / China debts row hits plans for investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's rash of troubles with Western creditors over unpaid debts is casting
a pall over plans by foreign companies to invest heavily in Chinese
infrastructure, and the power sector in particular.
Western bankers are also reporting signs of nervousness in international
debt markets over China exposure. Loan syndications for state-owned
companies are meeting resistance,
Mr Paul Schulte, China analyst at CS First Boston in Hong Kong, yesterday
described the debt-repayment issue as 'critical' to perceptions of China as
a safe destination for equity investment. 'Everyone wants to do business
with China,' he says, 'but from a macro-economic point of view the central
authorities must be seen to be managing debt prudently.'
International power companies have been locked in difficult discussions with
the Chinese authorities over returns on billions of dollars of proposed
equity investment.
Beijing's attempt to 'cap' rates of return at 12-15 per cent had not found
favour with nervous investors worried about repayment risks.
But the Chinese now appear prepared to tolerate higher returns commensurate
with the risks involved, although there has not as yet been public
indication of a change of heart.
Mr Schulte's comments followed reports in the past week of Chinese
institutions failing to honour commitments. These included an announcement
by Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, that it was suing several of
China's most prominent state companies for alleged non-payment of debts
arising from foreign exchange trading.
Foreign banks, including 24 Japanese institutions, last month petitioned Mr
Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, for the recovery
of Dollars 600m in loans that had gone sour, mostly from leasing deals.
European banks are also among those exerting pressure on the Chinese
authorities over the non-payment of debts by state enterprises from leasing
arrangements that date back to the early 1980s.
China's foreign debt reached Dollars 83.5bn at the end of 1993. It is
expected to rise to Dollars 100bn this year.
China's agency responsible for monitoring foreign debt has urged restraint.
An official of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control under
the People's Bank, said recently foreign debt had 'expanded a bit too fast'.
The representative in Beijing of a large European bank said it was 'getting
harder' for China to borrow. There had been a 'knock-on effect' from recent
adverse publicity.
The banker said he was advising clients to tighten up in their dealings with
China. 'If a corporate client asked whether to do business with China on a
collection basis or by way of a letter of credit, I would advise a letter of
credit.'
China's reputation for meeting its commitments has also not been helped by a
dispute between the China International Trust and Investment Corporation
(Citic) and the London Metals Exchange.
The dispute involved an alleged default over payments of Dollars 30m-Dollars
50m lost in futures trading.
Citic said initially the losses were incurred as a result of unauthorised
trading by its Shanghai branch. But it has subsequently softened its stand
and put the matter in the hands of Price Waterhouse, the international
accountants.

<TEXT>
Most of Japan's main economic indicators are continuing to improve,
according to the latest monthly performance index from the Economic Planning
Agency, William Dawkins reports from Tokyo. Its leading index, a basket of
economic indicators pointing to conditions a few months ahead, stood a 54.5
in September, the ninth month for which it has stayed above 50, the dividing
line between growth and decline. EPA officials expects the leading indicator
to continue to point to growth in October, on the back of rising industrial
output. Manufacturing output increased by 1.6 per cent in the three months
to September, achieving the third quarterly rise running, according to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Production continued to grow
in October and November, said a separate Bank of Japan report yesterday.

<TEXT>
China and Vietnam agreed yesterday to work peacefully to resolve their
disputes over territorial and maritime boundaries, and are to set up a group
of experts to discuss their rival claims to the Spratly atolls and the
waters of the South China Sea.
A joint communique released at the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by
China's President Jiang Zemin said the two governments agreed to 'refrain
from all acts that make things more complicated or broaden conflicts'.
The dispute over the South China Sea is especially sensitive, because each
country is seeking to exploit oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the
sea bed. Both countries have awarded oil exploration contracts to US oil
companies in disputed waters.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said in the Vietnamese capital
Hanoi the two sides could shelve disputes and start 'joint development' if
problems could not be resolved in talks immediately.
Joint development of possible oil and gas fields in disputed maritime areas
is a proven method of overcoming conflicts between two countries, but might
not succeed in all areas of the sea because there are four other claimants
to some or all of the islands: Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in the past few years. But
Vietnamese officials say China has recently encroached on their territory
near the border, refused to open a railway link to allow normal trade across
the land frontier, and let Chinese traders smuggle cheap Chinese goods into
Vietnam.
Mr Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese president, may not have brought
much in the way of concrete achievements, but suggests the two governments
want to set aside their differences and concentrate on the similar
challenges each faces: keeping their one-party communist political systems
intact while liberalising the economy.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Japanese bank lottery becomes a fight for business freedom:
The struggle is on to loosen iron controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It started as a simple but ingenious marketing wheeze designed to lure
customers in Japan's newly-liberalised market for bank deposits. But Johnan
Shinkin's 'Super Dream' account has become a national cause celebre, a
struggle by an independent-minded business to break free from the iron grip
of regulatory controls.
The account was launched two weeks ago by the nation's largest credit bank,
with the novel attraction of a lottery for savers. The standard interest
rate on a one-year deposit would be 2.1 per cent, in line with similar
one-year rates, but Johnan announced that every six months its customers
would be entered in a lottery, with dozens of prizes to a maximum of Y50,000
(Pounds 324). Savers would have a one in 30 chance of winning a prize.
The new account was a spectacular success with savers who queued outside
Johnan Shinkin's branches and poured a total of Y10bn (Pounds 64m) into
'Super Dream' deposits on the first day alone.
But if it was a predictable hit with the public, it got an equally
unsurprising thumbs-down from Johnan's banking competitors. They immediately
cried foul, claiming the account broke a self-imposed rule by banks that
they would not offer cash bonuses of more than a few hundred yen as
incentives to depositors to open accounts.
The cuddly toy has long been a staple of Japanese banks' marketing
techniques, but offering customers money is considered strictly out of
bounds. The National Association of Shinkin Banks (small savings
co-operatives) to which Johnan belongs, responded to its members' complaints
by condemning the bank's scheme, upholding their objection that it broke the
voluntary rule, and warning other members not to follow suit.
In the public outcry that followed, the country's Fair Trade Commission
announced that it would investigate the NASB itself to determine whether its
actions represented a violation of Japan's anti-trust legislation.
The row has raised questions about the real extent of the freedom banks are
supposed to enjoy as a result of financial liberalisation, and has aroused
suspicions that the much-vaunted deregulation is not really much of a reform
at all.
Last month, the final restrictions on bank deposit interest rates were
lifted by the finance ministry. Since then banks have been free to offer
depositors any rate they choose. But, as Johnan's president, Mr Minoru
Makabe, points out, the advantages have somehow not been felt by the
depositor.
'We have had many customers saying they appreciate the cash prizes because
even though the financial sector has supposedly been deregulated, banks
still offer similar interest rates.'
Mr Makabe argues that his rivals' objections are actually based on a
conspiracy to deprive the public of the fruits of deregulation.
His lottery account represents, in effect, an extra 0.2 per cent on the
average deposit rate, a fact he claims is the real cause of the other banks'
discomfiture.
But in an ominous move, the finance ministry, which regulates the banking
sector, last week announced the formation of a panel to investigate the
account and to recommend what kinds of financial products might be
considered 'appropriate'.
Mr Jiro Saito, the top official at the ministry, acknowledged the probable
legality of Johnan's action but said: 'The law is not everything'.
Critics see the ministry's move as an attempt to consolidate its tight
control even after the apparent liberalisation.
'This committee should recommend how the ministry should play a proper
administrative role in the era of market liberalisation,' said Mr Makabe.
'It should conduct a drastic review of self-imposed rules that restrict
competition.'
It may prove difficult for the ministry to put the genie back in the bottle.
The account has won widespread support, and has come to be regarded as a
symbol of the entrepreneur's fight on behalf of the consumer against big
government and big business.
Any attempt to rein it in would be regarded with hostility by the Japanese
public.
The latest agency implicitly to declare its hand has been the National Tax
Administration Agency, which said on Monday it would treat winnings in the
lottery as non-taxable.
But the most significant threat to the regulators' plans could be the very
phenomenon they were supposed to be encouraging: competition. At the weekend
four banks announced they were breaking ranks with their association and
launching similar lotteries.
Mr Toshio Taga, senior executive manager at Shonan Shinkin bank, one of the
institutions planning to follow suit, said: 'There is no other product which
can collect tens of billions of yen in several days. This means users want
it. It is a depositors' rebellion.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Interest rates edge up in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of borrowing in Japan has started to rise again after three years
of easier monetary conditions.
The government's Housing Loan Corporation said yesterday it would raise its
mortgage rates by up to 0.25 per cent next month. The decision, which
follows recent increases in other public sector loan rates, comes as
commercial banks struggle to avoid a rise in lending rates that would
further reduce demand for loans.
The upward pressure on lending costs stems from the gradual rise in money
market interest rates since the summer. Having fallen steadily since late
1991 as the economy plunged into recession, the overnight call rate - the
principal very short-term money market figure - touched bottom in July,
reaching 2 per cent. Since then it has edged up to nearly 2.3 per cent this
week. This rise has been reflected in an increase in bank deposit rates -
three-month certificate of deposits have moved in line with the overnight
rate.
The higher cost of funds has further trimmed banks' razor-thin lending
margins - the short-term prime lending rate has been unchanged at 3 per cent
for more than a year.
The upward drift in banks' borrowing costs has been caused by a shift in
sentiment in financial markets that the economic recovery, which has so far
been sluggish, is set to strengthen. The Bank of Japan, which has adopted a
bullish stance on economic prospects has allowed rates to rise in line with
its own expectations of improving growth prospects.
As bond prices have fallen in line with global bond markets, long-term
lending rates have risen and that has added to the pressure on short-term
rates.
Banks, however, are caught in a vice between increases in their borrowing
costs, and limited demand for lending. They have been reluctant to raise
their prime rates in a stagnant loan market.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Samper renews drive for peace in Colombia: President tries
to end guerrilla war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Ernesto Samper of Colombia marked his first 100 days in office
last week with a push to get the country's guerrilla groups to the
negotiating table and by announcing a set of conservative economic targets
that placated some of his critics.
The administration has not insisted on a ceasefire before starting talks
with guerrilla groups. Instead, it is demanding 'humanisation' of the war to
protect civilians and wounded combatants.
Since 1989, most of the M-19 and the Popular Liberation Army movements have
exchanged their weapons for electoral politics, but the two biggest
guerrilla armies have been growing in numbers and military strength. The
former Soviet-line Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the
once Castroite National Liberation Army (ELN) between them control extensive
rural territory in the northeast, northwest, centre and south of Colombia.
The FARC alone has over 50 fronts and guerrilla combatants may total 10,000
or more.
According to police figures, there were more than 1,200 terrorist incidents
and over 1,000 kidnaps in the first 10 months of this year, most attributed
to guerrilla groups, which use extortion, robbery and drug trafficking to
finance their activities. Guerrilla actions in the last decade have led to
the spilling of 1.2m barrels of oil as a result of pipeline bombings, the
loss of considerable foreign investment and the displacement of 150,000
people.
By opening the door for peace negotiations and imposing neither deadlines
nor obstacles, the government has made it difficult for the guerrillas to
refuse to talk. Political, business and church leaders have all given
qualified approval to Mr Samper's proposals, and guerrillas have also
commented in positive terms.
Given their increasing regional power - evidenced in last month's local
government elections - and their economic strength, it is not obvious why
the main guerrilla movements should want peace.
During his first 100 days, Mr Samper announced a series of employment and
social programmes, which he tied together last week in a four-year national
development plan he called the 'social leap forward.' In the plan, the
government blames the persistence of 'alarming poverty levels' and the
growing income gap between rural and urban areas on continuing violence.
Central bank and other economists, dismayed by the administration's somewhat
incoherent initial proposals to cut inflation, speed devaluation and raise
public spending at the same time, have welcomed Mr Samper's commitment to
generating a budget surplus of at least 0.7 per cent of GDP, or more if
necessary. The inflation target for 1995 is 18 per cent, compared with this
year's 22-23 per cent rate.
'This is down to earth, they're recognising that they need to cut back on
planned spending and they're also going to improve tax collection. It's a
big step in the right direction for macroeconomic stability,' said Mr
Salomon Kalmanovitz, a director of Colombia's central bank.
The development plan includes large investments in transport, oil and other
infrastructure with a strong import component, which will help use up
foreign exchange.
The emphasis, however, is on social welfare. This is not only inflationary,
say economic critics but the money would be better spent on remedying the
structural problems underlying poverty, rather than on handouts.
On drug trafficking, there have been minimal successes and discouraging
trends: the area planted with coca, marijuana and opium poppies has doubled
to over 50,000 hectares and Colombia's cocaine production is up to about
1,000 tonnes a year.
Several major Medelln traffickers who surrendered under the last government
are due to go free next year, while Cali cocaine chiefs want even more
generous terms if they are to hand themselves in. Although President Samper
has promised to keep fighting drugs, most Colombians clearly place far
greater importance on ending violence and solving economic problems than
confronting drug barons.

<TEXT>
Argentina's proposal to establish a United Nations force to be deployed
during natural disasters will be debated in the General Assembly today and
should be 'unanimously approved,' according to Mr James Cheek, US ambassador
in Buenos Aires.
Mr Cheek, speaking after talks between Mr William Perry, US defence
secretary, and Mr Oscar Camilion, his Argentine counterpart, said the
resolution, strongly supported by the US, already enjoyed the backing of 50
national co-sponsors.
Argentina's proposal would direct the General Assembly to study the
establishment of a force, to be recognised by its 'white helmets,' and
dedicated to alleviating the effects of natural disasters such as famine and
floods and to come forward with concrete proposals in the next few months.
Mr Perry, on a visit to Brazil and Argentina, said he had discussed the
resolution with President Carlos Menem, including a proposal to establish a
centre in Argentina to train the force.
Acceptance of the initiative would be a public-relations coup for Mr Menem
whose administration has done much to re-establish its international
credentials and has allied itself more closely with US foreign policy than
almost any other Latin American state.
Argentina is virtually alone, for example, in supporting the US embargo
against Cuba. It also backed the invasion of Haiti and, said Mr Camilion,
was willing to send a battalion of 300 peacekeepers to the island in the
next few months.
Mr Perry praised Argentina for its new approach, which contrasts strongly
with its history of non-alignment, especially for its deployment of troops
in UN peacekeeping missions in such regions as Cyprus, Mozambique and
Croatia.
Argentina's immediate reward will be the signing next month of a contract
with Lockheed to run the state-owned Aerea Material Cordoba aircraft factory
where 18 of the 36 A-4M Skyhawks purchased by Argentina from the US earlier
this year will be upgraded.
Argentina is expected to pay Dollars 250m-Dollars 400m for the aircraft,
including the cost of renovation. Mr Camilion said he hoped that the input
of US expertise could transform the Cordoba plant into a regional repair
centre for civil and military aircraft.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Attack on business tax breaks: US labour secretary queries
an estimated Dollars 111bn of subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Reich, the secretary of labour, yesterday called on the new
conservative political majority in Congress to attack tax breaks for
business and end 'corporate welfare as we know it'.
Mr Reich suggested the savings from cutting direct assistance to companies
could be used to help the economy create more high-wage American jobs.
In a speech on economic and social policy which he stressed represented his
personal perspective, Mr Reich ascribed Democratic losses in the mid-term
elections to 'the revolt of the anxious middle class'. Other factors might
have been in play, but 'never underestimate the political potency of a
declining paycheck.'
'Better fiscal management,' he said, 'cannot reverse the long-term decline
of America's middle class,' a comment which could be viewed as a criticism
of the Clinton administration's emphasis to date on reducing the federal
budget deficit.
But Mr Reich was more the loyalist in his dissection of the current
Republican agenda of deep tax cuts and the evisceration of the social safety
nets. Noting that the deficits accumulated under the two previous Republican
presidents now ate up 28 cents of every tax dollar, he urged: 'Let's not
whip up another toxic economic potion - a pinch of Laffer, a dash of Darman,
the eye of a Newt - that all of us will pay for in the morning.'
Mr Reich argued that the administration's policies had moved in the right
direction in the last 22 months but still only constituted 'a bare
beginning.' Instead of incrementalism, 'let's accelerate the agenda of
reform; streamline and consolidate the current clutter of adult education
and job retraining programmes and pull the plug on those that don't work.'
Warming to one of his familiar themes, but incorporating some Republican
adages, Mr Reich said 'instead of feeding bureaucracies - federal and state
 -let's channel resources directly into the pockets of ordinary Americans.'
The Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate Democratic think-tank, had
recently identified special tax breaks for particular industries and
agriculture currently worth in excess of Dollars 111bn over a five-year
period. He invited conservative institutions to provide 'their own examples
of business subsidies that don't make sense.'
'Since we are committed to moving the disadvantaged from welfare to work,
why not target corporate welfare as well and use the savings to help all
Americans get better work?'
Meanwhile more details of Republican proposals sharply to reduce individual
welfare entitlements continue to leak out. One version, likely to be
introduced in the House in January, would end automatic eligibility for
welfare, set an annual limit on all federal welfare spending and would
replace longstanding food stamps, child-nutrition and school lunch
programmes with block grants for states to administer as they wished.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Asian oilmen's troublesome pipedreams -
New routes are the key to exploiting the region's big reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to find politically acceptable export routes is impeding the flow of
oil and natural gas from central Asia to western markets. Three deals depend
wholly or largely on pipeline routes out of the Caspian for their viability.
First, the US oil company Chevron's project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan - in
which over Dollars 600m has been invested and around Dollars 20bn is
scheduled to be put in during the project's 40-year life - still awaits
agreement on financing a new export pipeline. Only 60,000 barrels a day are
allowed through the existing pipelines.
Secondly, the Dollars 8bn deal between a group of 10 foreign oil companies
led by BP and the Azerbaijan government to exploit reserves off Baku was
ratified by the Azerbaijani parliament last week - but no route out for the
oil is agreed.
Thirdly, a deal should be closed by November 30 to allow development of the
massive Karachaganak gas field in Kazakhstan by British Gas and Agip of
France - but it lacks transportation.
In each case,the companies have sought or agreed Russian participation to
satisfy Moscow's demands that it benefits from the deals. But so far the
result has been deadlock: 'Russia does not seem so interested in making
money as in keeping all of these countries under its thumb,' says one
frustrated oil company executive in Alma Ata.
The contrasting view is that the blockages are temporary and that the sheer
energy wealth of the area will sooner rather than later produce agreements.
Mr Steve Remp, chairman of the British oil services company Ramco, a member
of the Azerbaijani consortium, says that 'what you will see in due course is
that the issue will turn from being a liability to being a very positive
generator of income for the area'.
The key player in these increasingly grand geopolitical manoeuvres is
Russia. Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, made clear last week
that Russia must have a major stake in all energy projects. This policy
which has meant that the Lukoil oil company and the Gasprom gas corporation
have substantial stakes in the Azerbaijani and Karachaganak fields, and that
Russian pressure has been able to block any pipeline deal.
A host of different schemes are now being discussed by the states and
companies involved - all of which would require multi-billion dollar
financing.
Upgrading the existing pipeline which carries Russian and some Chevron oil
to Novorossisk, Russia's main oil exporting port on the Black Sea.
One plan being considered by the Baku consortium is to reverse the pipeline
which used to carry crude from the Russian province of Tyumen to the Baku
refinery, so that it carried Azerbaijani oil out to join an existing
pipeline to Novorossisk. This line could also carry oil from Kazakhstan. The
largest problem comes after Novorossisk. Turkey, pressing for a line through
its territory, has said the Bosphorous straits through which ships from
Novorossisk must pass, cannot take any more tankers: the Russians have
responded by proposing that the oil is transhipped to Burgas, on the coast
of Bulgaria, then piped to the Greek port of Alexandroupolis.
A line through Iran or Georgia to meet an existing line which had carried
Iraqi crude to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The problem with
this line is that it goes through Kurdish areas but avoids the Bosphorous.
Further, Azerbaijan announced last week that the Iranian Oil Company had
joined the consortium - prompting speculation that this route, or another
through Iranian territory, could now be in prospect.
A line through Georgia to the port of Batumi on the Black Sea - to be again
transhipped to Burgas, piped to Alexandroupolis and out through the
Mediterranean. Georgia would benefit from this - but the government is in no
state to guarantee the security of the line.
The most radical proposal, under study by Mitsubishi, is to construct a
pipeline from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan 1500km through western China where
it could link up with an existing pipeline from China's Tarim Basin to the
coast.
Turkmenistan, the region's main gas producer, needs a new exit most since
Russia controls its gas lines beyond its borders and has put a block on much
of the expected Dollars 1bn annual proceeds from gas sales. Three weeks ago
a Dollars 7bn gas pipeline project to take the gas to the Mediterranean was
inaugurated - though no one believes the work will begin soon and many
believe the project is more symbolic than real. The only sure thing is that
the manoeuvres will continue.

Alcatel Kabel Norge, the Norwegian subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, has signed
a Dollars 70m contract with the power ministries of Egypt and Jordan to
supply and install submarine cables to link their two electricity grids by
1997. The company will supply four cables to run 13km under the Gulf of
Aqaba from the Egyptian resort of Taba to Aqaba on the Jordanian coast. The
Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development is providing full
financing for the deal.
The deal is the first phase of an eventual plan to link the power grids of
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey and possibly also Israel, at a
later stage in the present Middle East peace process.
The Egypt-Jordan cable contract was agreed as a submarine link when it was
signed in August, before the recent peace agreement between Israel and
Jordan. Egyptian electricity ministry officials have left open the
possibility that Israel could join the shared grid later.

Tarmac, one of Britain's biggest construction groups, is to take the lead
role in a Dollars 250m contract to build a 1,000MW Malaysian power station
which the British group says will be the largest in the country. The
contract has been awarded to General Electric of the US but Tarmac is
expected to be responsible for about three-quarters of the work.
The ban by the Malaysian government on awarding public sector contracts to
British companies, only recently lifted, meant that the successful bid
involving Tarmac, Black and Veatch, the US power station designers, and GE
only remained in the running if the contract was to be awarded to a
non-British company. TBV Power, a joint venture between Tarmac and Black and
Veatch, will design, construct and supply equipment for phase three of a
power station complex at Kepar in Selangor state. GE is to supply the
turbines.
The power station is for the state power utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad and
will supply electricity to Kuala Lumpur and the industrial Kelang Valley. Mr
Neville Simms, Tarmac chief executive, said the contract formed 'part of the
group's new strategy to concentrate our efforts towards the growing markets
in the Far East and Pacific rim'.

France has won a FFr19bn (Dollars 3.7bn) contract to supply Saudi Arabia
with two 'stealth' frigates of its latest La Fayette class. Thomson-CSF, the
electronics group, will be the prime contractor for the Saudi frigates. This
reflects the degree to which the La Fayette ships, with their box-shaped
superstructures designed to minimise radar echos, contain the latest
electronics. The main French subcontractors to Thomson-CSF - whose own
contract is worth 30 per cent of the total - are DCN, the state navy yard
which will build the hulls, and Aerospatiale which will provide Exocet
missiles.
The French defence industry has been complaining about the recent commercial
offensive mounted by its US competitors in export markets. But, strongly
backed by the French government, it has pulled off successes this year by
selling Mirages to Qatar and frigates to Pakistan. The latest sale to Saudi
Arabia is known as 'Sawari 2', following the 'Sawari 1' sale in 1980 of four
French frigates. Earlier this year Thomson won the order to re-equip these
four ships and to supply new land-based Crotale and Shahine missiles in a
deal also worth around FFr6bn to the French company.

<TEXT>
The US yesterday agreed to release for sale Australian beef exported after
October 25 but said it required further testing of beef exported before that
date because of possible contamination from a chemical used in the growing
of cotton.
Recent decisions by the US and Japan to ban temporarily the sale of
Australian beef have clouded the industry, which earns around ADollars 3bn
of overseas revenue annually, making it the nation's third largest export
sector.
The Cattle Council of Australia, representing Australian cattle farmers,
expressed relief that the US had agreed to accept the testing procedures
which Australia now has in place. Samples of beef exported to the US before
October 25 and still in the export pipeline are due to be returned to
Australia where the tests will be conducted later this week.
Despite progress on the US front, Australia has yet to allay Japanese
concerns. Moreover, a number of smaller buyers of Australian beef -
including Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico - are understood to have
joined the temporary ban. According to federal officials, more than 12,000
tonnes of Australian beef is being held at storage or customs facilities in
these countries, while around 30,000 tonnes is in the Japanese pipeline.

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Canada criticised for high tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada has made considerable strides in liberalising trade and industrial
policies but lingering high trade barriers remain an obstacle to growth and
job creation, according to the Gatt secretariat in a report published
yesterday.
The report, the third on Canada's trade policies and practices by the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, singles out for criticism high
tariffs on imports of farm produce, barriers to trade between the provinces
and the proliferation of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits over the last
two years.
It also expresses concern over Canada's rapidly expanding trade with the US,
noting the fears of trading partners that they may be the losers in
diversion of trade to the US and Mexico, Canada's partners in the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Gatt points out that rising exports have helped fuel Canada's economic
recovery since 1992 but this has been largely due to higher deliveries to
the US.
The US share in Canada's exports has risen from around 75 per cent in 1990
and 1991 to more than 80 per cent in 1993. Exports to other countries
stagnated over this period.
Worries that Nafta, which came into force at the beginning of this year,
could spur trade diversion featured prominently in yesterday's discussion of
the report by Gatt's governing council.
In reply, Canada said it was trying to diversify its trade, especially
towards Asia.
Under the Uruguay Round global trade accords, Canada will reduce industrial
tariffs by 40 per cent, a little above the average for developed nations.
But its farm trade barriers will remain relatively high.
In the short to medium term, the dairy, poultry and eggs sectors will be
effectively closed to imports, Gatt notes. Over 100 agricultural import
quotas will be replaced by tariffs averaging 205 per cent in 1995 and 174
per cent in 2000.
The report says the estimated 500 or so inter-provincial trade barriers have
become a major problem for Canadian business, hampering the free internal
flow of goods and services.
It also points out that the number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty
actions has increased markedly since the last report in 1992, largely
concentrated on steel.
With over 80 anti-dumping measures covering 23 products currently in place,
Canada is the third largest user among Gatt members, the report says.

Tokyo Seimitsu, the maker of semiconductor manufacturing systems, has tied
up with Carl-Zeiss, the German optical instruments manufacturer, to supply
and market precision measuring instruments. The two companies will
co-operate in the supply of parts and open their marketing channels to each
other. Tokyo Seimitsu will concentrate on developing instruments for
measuring cylinders and Carl-Zeiss will focus on three-dimensional measuring
instruments. The tie-up will provide Tokyo Seimitsu with a marketing route
in Europe, where it has very little experience, and allow Carl-Zeiss to

FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US agrees to accept Australian beef tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday agreed to release for sale Australian beef exported after
October 25 but said it required further testing of beef exported before that
date because of possible contamination from a chemical used in the growing
of cotton.
Recent decisions by the US and Japan to temporarily ban the sale of
Australian beef have clouded the industry, which earns around ADollars 3bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) of overseas revenue annually, making it the nation's third
largest export sector. The US and Japan account for about three-quarters of
those sales.
The Cattle Council of Australia, representing Australian cattle farmers,
expressed relief that the US had agreed to accept the testing procedures
which Australia now has in place. Samples of beef exported to the US before
October 25 and still in the export pipeline are due to be returned to
Australia where the tests will be conducted later this week.
Despite progress on the US front, Australia has yet to allay Japanese
concerns. Moreover, a number of smaller buyers of Australian beef -
including Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico - are understood to have
joined the temporary ban. According to federal officials, more than 12,000
tonnes of Australian beef is being held at storage or customs facilities in
these countries, while around 30,000 tonnes is in the Japanese pipeline.
Senator Bob Collins, federal primary industries minister, yesterday
acknowledged that the problem was not over 'by a long shot', although he
added that Australia was 'hopeful' that other countries would follow the US
lead. Beef shipments made before October 25 and still in the export process
are estimated to be worth between ADollars 200m and ADollars 250m.
The problem occured when some farmers fed cotton waste to cattle after
normal grain supplies were affected by a severe drought on the east coast.
The CCA has said that the chemical is non-toxic and that only a very small
proportion of Australian cattle - those fed cotton waste from irrigated
cotton - have any chance of being affected. All livestock from affected
areas, predominantly in New South Wales, were being tested.
However, the beef industry has acknowledged that the adverse publicity from
the contamination issue could be damaging in the longer term.

<TEXT>
Germany is having second thoughts about inviting central and eastern
European leaders to next month's European Union summit in Essen, despite
pledges to make the meeting a cornerstone of the strategy to build a 'wider
Europe'.
German doubts appear to stem from sensitivities toward France, which earlier
this year expressed reservations about Germany's championing of the cause of
enlargement of the Union to the north and east. But Bonn is also concerned
about slow progress in talks on a more generous EU market access package for
the former Communist countries. Without such a deal - and a clear EU
consensus on how to proceed with enlargement to the east - German officials
fear that the Essen summit could be branded as a failure.
Mr Jan Kulakowski, Poland's ambassador to the EU, said yesterday that his
government had been told that Chancellor Helmut Kohl intended to invite the
central and east Europeans to Essen. However, some member states remained
reluctant, with France holding out to delay the invitation until the next
European summit in Cannes next June. 'An invitation is still possible,' he
said, 'but it is getting late.'
German officials confirmed this account, saying that France was anxious to
host an important event at the end of the EU presidency which it takes over
from Germany on January 1. French interest had grown after Spain, the
successor EU presidency, won support for hosting a conference on the
Mediterranean.
'It is very important to balance the regions,' said one German official who
pointed out that it might make more sense for France - rather than Germany -
to take the credit for a successful summit on strategy toward the east.
Behind the diplomatic manoeuvring lies a debate within the Union about how -
and whether - to speed up the integration of eastern Europe, starting with
the six EU associate members: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the Baltic states and Slovenia.
Germany, worried about instability on its eastern borders, is pressing for
early enlargement, possibly around the turn of the century.
The UK shares this goal, but is worried that more members may trigger
pressure for faster political integration. France, backed by the
Mediterranean bloc, wants to ensure that enlargement does not dilute the EU
into a free-trade area.
All member states are worried about the cost: on present EU farm and
regional aid policies, the budget for an enlarged Union would rise from
Ecu30bn (Pounds 24bn) to Ecu45bn, and from Ecu25bn to Ecu60bn respectively,
according to a European Commission official.
Paris and Bonn have co-operated with the Commission in developing a
'pre-accession' strategy, the centrepiece of which is a consultation paper
which next spring will set out a list of measures for the central and
eastern Europeans to adopt to become fit for EU membership.
Chrystia Freeland adds: Hungary has proposed a firm timetable to negotiate
its accession to the EU, calling for talks to begin as soon as the member
states conclude their 1996 inter-governmental conference, leading to full
membership by the year 2000.
Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, called on the Commission
to draw up its own formal opinion on his country's application for
membership before the 1996 conference begins, in order to speed up the
process.
'We want it to be done country by country,' he said in an interview in
London. 'We are very much against the convoy principle.'

FT  23 NOV 94 / Threat of Brussels split on TV quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to tighten European broadcasting quotas and separately to ban
advertising on new electronic information services are threatening to divide
the European Commission.
The outgoing audiovisual commissioner, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, believed to
have strong backing from Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, will next
week present plans that will force European television channels to ensure
that at least half of the documentaries, cartoons and drama programmes that
they screen are European-made.
Further, in a move that industry says will threaten the development of
interactive consumer services in Europe, Mr Pinheiro is proposing to extend
the scope of existing broadcasting rules to ban advertising on new
screen-based services such as 'tele-shopping' channels.
Mr Pinheiro's proposals amount to revision of of the EU's 1989 Television
without Frontiers directive to interactive services.
The directive sets limits on the amount of time television channels can
carry advertisements and the new effort is an attempt to protect the
existing advertising revenues of national radio and television broadcasters.
Opponents of the plans within the Commission and industry say the moves send
a bad political message to the rest of the world, and make Brussels'
approach to the information society look confused.
One official said yesterday: 'On the one hand it is saying it wants to
liberalise the communications sector as much as possible, and on the other
it is cutting off the possibilities for these new services to come on
stream.'
Much of the momentum behind Mr Pinheiro's changes comes from those within
the Commission who believe European culture and language need to be
protected from Hollywood. Some observers - in Brussels and in the industry -
believe Mr Delors may be trying to use more protectionist media laws to the
benefit of a bid for the French presidency next year, should he decide to
mount one.
'Mr Delors wants to get this through because it will enhance his status in
France,' said an industry source yesterday. 'The move is highly political
and it is being led by the Delors cabinet.'
The 1989 directive already requires EU television channels to reserve at
least 50 per cent of their output for European-made programmes, but only
'where practicable'. This 'loophole' has allowed some channels to ignore the
quota.
Officials in directorate general 10 - headed by Mr Pinheiro - argue that
they want to scrap 'where practicable' because of the legal ambiguity it
creates.
More worrying for industry, however, is the extension of the directive's
scope to cover new services, a move which will prevent teleshopping channels
from carrying advertising.
'Advertising is expected to play a key role in helping to make these
services affordable, and thus open them to a mass market,' said a Commission
official yesterday.

FT  23 NOV 94 / French aim for a 'revolution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France intends to use its forthcoming European Union presidency to start
pushing for institutional reform in the 1996 constitutional conference, and
to give Europe a stronger cultural identity.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, EU affairs minister, yesterday told a Paris seminar
that expansion of the Union to include three, and maybe four, new countries
next year, and the perspective of future enlargement to the east, required
'an institutional revolution', particularly in foreign policy
decision-making.
The minister suggested that one way of speeding Council of Ministers'
decisions would be to hive off its lawmaking function into public sessions,
with open debate and votes. Its executive role of managing the Union would
remain confidential. In this latter role, the Council 'must move further and
faster in foreign policy and defence', as illustrated by its shortcomings in
Bosnia.
Mr Lamassoure reiterated a previous suggestion that the EU had to have some
kind of body to define, propose and implement its planned common foreign
policy, just as the European Commission did for internal Union policies.
However, he stressed that while the government had decided on the broad
outlines of its presidency programme - which Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
is expected to unveil in early December - its plans had yet to receive the
green light from President Francois Mitterrand. At last week's Anglo-French
summit at Chartres, the president said the 1996 conference should first
consolidate commitments of the Maastricht treaty before embarking on new
initiatives.
Separately, Mr Jacques Toubon, culture minister, said in an interview that
France would pursue three priorities during its presidency. First, it would
seek revision of the satellite broadcasting directive to place more control
with countries such as France receiving English-language broadcasts and less
with those countries, such as the UK, from which transmission took place.
Secondly, France would try to interest its partners in committing themselves
to an intergovernmental convention requiring the teaching of at least two
foreign languages. 'The first foreign language taught would almost always be
English, but the second might be French, Spanish or German,' he said.
Lastly, Paris would urge the EU to increase funding for its 'Media
Programme' to help the distribution and promotion of European films.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer rails at Emu criteria: Budget deficits twice what
they should be, says Bundesbank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After highlighting for months the inadequacies of the convergence criteria
intended to underpin Europe's proposed monetary union, Germany's most
eminent and garrulous spokesman on Emu yesterday came out with a
comparatively clear counter-proposal.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, whose other job is president of the Bundesbank, said
maximum permissible budget deficits for would-be Emu members under the
Maastricht treaties were at least double what they should be.
For a country such as Germany, he said, 1 to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic
product was nearer the mark than the 'unambitious' 3 per cent written in the
treaties.
Addressing a seminar in Bonn, where, as Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged, there is
a strong feeling that Bundesbank technocrats should run monetary policy and
leave elected politicians to run the country and tend European affairs, he
was careful not to present the formula as his own idea or one generated
within the central bank.
He used a routine trick to protect himself and the bank from charges of
interfering in the political process, and presented his proposal in the form
of a public endorsement of suggestions made by others. In this case, the
deficit parameters were put forward last week by the so-called 'five wise
men', a group of independent advisers to the finance ministry.
Another increasingly familiar ploy was put to work in the same speech
yesterday. 'Of course, the Bundesbank is no more responsible for social
policy than it is for finance policy ..' he said, prefacing a catalogue of
characteristically uncomfortable suggestions for the government.
But as the increasingly prescriptive tone of Mr Tietmeyer's speeches and
media interviews indicates, the convention that central bank officials
should avoid political interference is one which chafes sorely.
As a one-time state secretary in the finance ministry, and responsible for
the Bundesbank's foreign relations before his elevation to the presidency a
year ago, Mr Tietmeyer is well known internationally and well accustomed to
agenda-setting. Partly as a result he is also proving to be far more
confident than his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schlesinger - not to mention his
current colleagues on the permanent directorate - at manoeuvring on the
knife-edge between managing monetary policy and overt politicking.
But his apparent command of the broad horizons is also due in part to the
fact that he, with the occasional exception of Mr Otmar Issing, chief
economist for the Bundesbank's directorate, has granted himself almost
exclusive rights as public spokesman for the Bundesbank.
Mr Tietmeyer took a firm hold of the Bundesbank's external communications
after loose talk by some of his colleagues led to confusion about the
directorate's policy aims early this year, and when confused explanations of
rampant money supply growth brought the bank's prized credibility into
question.
He has not let up since. In the first 12 months of his presidency he has
made more than twice as many speeches as Mr Schlesinger in his last year of
office. Mr Helmut Scheiber, his own successor as Bundesbank 'foreign
minister', has hardly been heard at all above the noise of the president's
constant protests that the Maastricht criteria are too sloppy and that the
EU is ill-prepared politically for the great leap into monetary union.
Mr Tietmeyer's close personal knowledge of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
hitherto helped him judge how forcefully he can press for his rigorous
European policy prescriptions without overstepping the mark. Now, with the
weakened coalition government still unsure of its capacity to act
decisively, he may feel even more confident of speaking his mind and issuing
his prescriptions.
He will certainly be encouraged to speak out further by the prospect of the
looming EU summit in Essen on December 9 and 10 to seal Germany's six-month
presidency. Whatever Mr Kohl's ambitions for the grand occasion, Germany's
most listened-to Emu spokesman is unlikely to allow any of the leaders to
return home burdened with any misunderstandings.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Brussels gets tough on public contracts: Commission has
launched raft of court actions in move to outlaw unfair practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has begun to bare its teeth as it tries to outlaw
unfair practices preventing companies from winning public sector contracts
in other EU countries. It is threatening to seek a court injunction to halt
work on a DM400m (Pounds 164m) German power station contract
Recent figures showing the huge amount of work still required to incorporate
EU public procurement directives into member states' laws underline the
scale of the task.
Eight public works directives should have been included in domestic law by
July 1, but, by the end of October, this had not happened in a third of
cases, according to Brussels. At that point it started 28 proceedings
against governments for failing to include the directives in domestic
legislation or for doing so incorrectly. But its threatened injunction,
which could stop a live project, is an unusual step.
Germany, long identified as one of the worst offenders, is the subject of
legal proceedings on two of the eight public works directives and may face
action on another four. Only Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have
fulfilled their obligations - 'with a few minor exceptions' - to enact all
eight.
The directives, which require all public contracts of more than Ecu200,000
(Pounds 157,000) to be advertised in the Official Journal of the European
Communities, seek to ensure that all EU companies are treated equally when
bidding for public sector contracts.
They demand that contract procedures and technical standards should not be
used to favour domestic companies. Contract conditions should be clearly
stated, and standardised forms used as much as possible. Conditions, once
published, should not be changed to favour one bidder.
The Commission has been particularly concerned about the practice in some
southern Mediterranean countries of reopening negotiations after contracts
have been awarded.
In these instances a favoured supplier can safely bid a very low price,
secure in the knowledge that this will subsequently be renegotiated along
with other contract conditions.
Brussels says this may encourage corruption if final costs are not subject
to open competition but determined by consultation between local officials
and the winning bidder.
The number of legal actions pursued by the Commission against governments
and public authorities for failing to apply the directives to specific
contracts has more than doubled during the past 12 months to about 250.
In one of the most recent, Brussels is threatening to seek an injunction in
the European Court to prevent work starting on a steam turbine contract for
a DM5bn power station at Lippendorf in eastern Germany.
It wants the recently privatised eastern German electricity company, Veag,
to reopen the bidding for the DM400m steam turbine contract which was
awarded to a German subsidiary of Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri.
The German subsidiary of General Electric of the US which claimed it was
'unfairly excluded from the final round of price negotiations' complained to
a Berlin court that European companies, such as ABB and Siemens,
traditionally had been been treated by the German power sector as 'court
suppliers'.
Legal action is not the only weapon at the Commission's disposal.
Governments which fail to apply or police directives properly have been
warned that EU soft loans and grants from the so-called structural funds may
not be available for public works if proper procedures are ignored.
Greece and Spain, following warnings, have agreed to abandon their practice
of reopening negotiations after contracts have been awarded.
The prize for the Commission and companies seeking to break into other
countries' markets is large. Public procurement in the EU totalled Ecu595bn
in 1990, equivalent to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Only 2 per
cent of this was awarded to companies from another country.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Tangentopoli touches the highest level: The judicial shadow
hanging over Silvio Berlusconi will prolong Italy's damaging political
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a polished performer like Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister,
the task of hosting this week's UN conference on cross-border crime in
Naples looked simple: photo opportunities with the UN secretary-general, a
tough line on money laundering and the Mafia, and a chance to improve a
dented international image.
But the job seems to have turned into a cruel joke against a man already
visibly wearied by his short experience of politics.
On Monday, the prime minister was obliged to defend his 10-month-old
political movement, Forza Italia, following a poor showing in Sunday's
regional and local elections. Then, just before lunch yesterday, Mr
Berlusconi received a formal warning from Milan magistrates that they wanted
to question him soon about allegations of bribery and corruption at the top
of Fininvest, his private media, financial services and retailing group.
Putting a brave face on the news, he was expected to return to Naples last
night or this morning for the closing sessions of the UN conference.
Mr Berlusconi has been sent the formal warning, or avviso di garanzia, in
his capacity as controlling shareholder of Fininvest, and it does not imply
that he has committed a crime.
What is certain, however, is that Milan's crack anti-corruption magistrates
would not have risked undermining the government, and upsetting the
financial markets, without first ensuring that they could justify the
sending of a formal warning.
They learned that lesson in October, when Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, who
heads the Milan team investigating Italy's bribes scandal or Tangentopoli
(bribesville), told the press that the inquiry was reaching 'high political
levels'. Even some of his supporters thought the comments ill-judged and
they triggered the resignation, later retracted, of Mr Alfredo Biondi, the
justice minister. Mr Borrelli was obliged to clarify that no avviso di
garanzia was pending for the prime minister. Technically, that may have been
true. Apparently, Mr Berlusconi's name was only added to the list of people
in line for investigation on Monday.
The formal warning is believed to relate to the Milan magistrates'
investigation into bribes of L130m (Pounds 52,000) and L100m paid to tax
police by Mondadori, Fininvest's publishing subsidiary, and Mediolanum Vita,
its life assurance subsidiary, in 1991 and 1992, in return for a favourable
tax audit. These are not new allegations. Mr Berlusconi's brother Paolo was
arrested in connection with the same inquiry during the summer and later
released. Both brothers have admitted publicly that bribes were paid, and
Paolo has assumed responsibility for giving the orders.
The prime minister's line, repeated again yesterday before the formal notice
of investigation was published, is that he has committed no crime, and
therefore need not resign. If Fininvest's top managers erred, it was
because, 'like thousands of other managers and entrepreneurs', they were
victims of extortion rather than actively involved in corruption.
But critics argue that this is not just a matter for Mr Berlusconi's
conscience. The magistrates' decision, coming so soon after Forza Italia's
disappointing performance in Sunday's elections, is bound to bolster the
morale of the opposition parties and trade unions.
That could make it more difficult for Mr Berlusconi to push through the
controversial 1995 budget in the senate. The budget measures, which include
cuts in welfare and pension benefits, were approved by the lower chamber of
deputies on Monday, but the main government parties do not have a majority
in the senate.
The next test for Mr Berlusconi's strength will be tomorrow's talks with
Italy's trade unions federations, aimed at averting a general strike on
December 2, the second in as many months.
It seems unlikely, however, that this will lead to new elections, so soon
after the March poll, which was welcomed as a new start for a country
undermined by widespread corruption. Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian
president, indicated on Monday that in any case he would call for a
'presidential government' if the coalition collapsed, rather than dissolve
parliament.
Of Forza Italia's coalition partners, Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the
rightwing National Alliance, has used Sunday's election results to call for
unity between the government parties, while Mr Umberto Bossi, the volatile
leader of the populist Northern League, indicated yesterday that the
government should hold on at least until full parliamentary approval of the
budget, due by December 31.
What is more worrying, particularly for the international image of the
government, is that the prime minister should still be working under the
shadow of a judicial investigation. Defending Mr Berlusconi yesterday, Mr
Biondi pointed out that the alleged crime 'was supposed to have taken place
when he (Mr Berlusconi) was a private citizen, just a businessman'. But
political opponents question whether this particular businessman should have
taken the risk of running for high office without resolving a conflict of
interest which is helping to prolong a period of damaging political
uncertainty.

French consumer prices increased by 0.3 per cent in October, giving a
relatively stable annualised inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, according to
Insee, the national statistics office. The figures confirmed the weakness of
inflationary pressures in the economy, despite stronger than expected growth
this year. Consumption, however, has remained fragile, with a weakening
expected in October's figures. The prices of manufactured products remained
unchanged in October, while the index for energy and public sector services
declined slightly compared with September. Upward pressure was provided,
however, by food prices, which increased by 0.9 per cent month on month.
Germany's output of cars and trucks rose by 5.3 per cent last month from a
year earlier despite having one less working day, said the VDA German motor
industry association. In October, Germany produced 355,400 cars, 14,000
trucks up to six tons, and 9,900 other trucks.
Year-on-year inflation in the European Union was 3 per cent last month,
according to Eurostat. The provisional figure was unchanged from September
and at its lowest level in seven and a half years. The rate was 3.3 per cent
in October 1993.
The debts of Russia and the former Soviet Union totalled almost Dollars
113bn at the start of the year, according to official figures obtained by
Reuters. Soviet debts are put at Dollars 103,940bn and those of Russia at
Dollars 8,840bn.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Spring sets out coalition terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's parliament yesterday adjourned after failing to elect a new prime
minister, paving the way for a week of intensive horse-trading as political
parties search for a fresh coalition government.
Mr Dick Spring, Labour party leader, set out tough new conditions for Labour
to go back into partnership with Fianna Fail, Ireland's largest party,
following last week's break-up of the 22-month coalition and the resignation
of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister.
He is calling for a new freedom of information law, an easing of the rules
on cabinet confidentiality, more accountability on judicial appointments and
a review of official secrets legislation. He also wants recent ministerial
pay rises rescinded.
The Labour leader's 'strategy for renewal', unveiled to the parliamentary
party over the weekend, is partly a response to last week's crisis when Mr
Reynolds misled parliament over the attorney-general's role in the
controversial case of a paedophile priest's extradition. Mr Spring has
struck a popular chord on many of the issues. The question of cabinet
confidentiality has already been challenged unsuccessfully in the supreme
court when, during the beef tribunal, Mr Reynolds was accused of selective
cabinet document leaks in the investigation into the misuse of official
export credits in the beef industry in 1991.
The Labour proposals are broadly in line with ideas outlined by Mr Bertie
Ahern, the new Fianna Fail leader, on Saturday.
Opinion remains divided within Labour ranks about whether to join forces
again with Fianna Fail, with many of the latter's ministers implicated in
Labour eyes in the extradition case. Moreover, many Fianna Fail MPs are
still bitter about Mr Reynolds' downfall.
One issue of contention could be Northern Ireland policy, where Mr Spring is
keen not to be sidelined as he was by Mr Reynolds.
Mr Spring may have to look for a partnership with the conservative Fine Gael
and one of the smaller parties, which could be more problematic given Mr
Spring's personal difficulties with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader.

The German environment ministry yesterday said it hoped an administrative
court would reach a quick decision clearing the way for a controversial
shipment of nuclear waste to a storage site at Gorleben in northern Germany.
The shipment has been standing for months in a railway siding at the
Philippsburg power station in south Germany while the federal government and
the state of Lower Saxony, where Gorleben is situated, did battle in the
courts. It was to have arrived in Gorleben today but the environment
ministry unexpectedly stopped the shipment late on Monday after a court near
Gorleben had ruled that the fuel rods were incorrectly loaded at
Philippsburg.
Ms Monika Griefhahn, Lower Saxony's environment minister and the most
outspoken opponent of Gorleben, doubted the shipment could be moved this
year. The state government had given its approval last week under pressure
from the environment ministry. The Philippsburg waste would be the first
shipment to Gorleben and has been fiercely resisted by people living near
the site.

Hungary's central bank governor has said he will resign today, ending weeks
of speculation that he would be unable to work with the country's new
Socialist-led government. Mr Peter Akos Bod, appointed by the previous
conservative administration in 1991, said it had been clear since the
government took office in July that he did not have its full support. He was
one of the main architects of the previous administration's economic
policies. Top management at several large state companies have been purged
by the government in recent weeks. Analysts said yesterday they did not
expect Mr Bod's resignation to have a serious impact on financial markets or
central bank policies. However, they said much would depend on who succeeded
Mr Bod who had not been due to step down until 1997. The front-runners are
Mr Ferenc Bartha, government privatisation commissioner, and Mr Gyorgy
Suranyi, managing director of Central European Investment Bank, a
foreign-owned local bank.

<TEXT>
Germany's newly re-elected government planned to curb banks' influence on
industry, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said yesterday, but
indicated that any new laws would be more likely to limit their seats on
supervisory boards than force the sale of shareholdings. He said banks
should contribute to the debate 'instead of immediately pulling out the card
of the constitutional court'. This was a reference to the threat by Mr
Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank chairman, to go to the court if the bank was
forced to sell holdings and pay high capital gains tax. Mr Rexrodt said the
government would study the extent of banks' influence on industry before
proposing laws. But if it decided to rein back existing holdings or limit
new ones, it would use legally and constitutionally correct methods. 'One
cannot expect Mr Kopper to sell holdings of the Deutsche Bank and hand over
half the proceeds to the state as tax.'

<TEXT>
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, yesterday said she was
confident of winning a Yes vote in a referendum next Monday on membership of
the European Union, despite a continuing strong lead in the polls by
opponents of the move. 'I don't look upon the polls as bleakly as some
people do; there has been a tremendous change in recent weeks,' she said.
Although the No camp continues to lead in the polls, the gap has narrowed
significantly since Sweden voted to join the EU on November 13. Mrs
Brundtland said she believed that many people would not make up their minds
on the controversial issue until the last minute, as happened in the EU
referendums in Finland and Sweden. She believes that the prospect of
isolation facing Norwegians now that Finland and Sweden have decided to join
the EU would be enough to make them understand what is at stake if Norway
rejects membership for the second time.
'I don't believe in threats, but I do believe in appeals and responsibility
and it's my conviction that it is best for Norway and its future and for
Europe if Norway joins. I think one week is enough to get this point
across,' she said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Alcatel CIT, the French telecoms equipment company, yesterday
refused to accept the resignation of its chairman, Mr Pierre Guichet, who
has been detained in prison by a magistrate investigating alleged
overbilling of France Telecom, one of the company's biggest clients. Mr
Guichet, who was imprisoned on Monday evening, had tendered his resignation
to avoid damage to the company's relations with France Telecom. But the
board, which said it was shocked by the detention order, rejected the move
in a show of support for Mr Guichet. A spokesman for Alcatel described Mr
Guichet's detention as completely unjustified and said the investigation
would prove his innocence. A company official indicated, however, that the
chairman's request to step down could be considered by a future board
meeting when Mr Guichet is able to participate. Mr Guichet's detention in a
prison to the south of Paris pushed shares in Alcatel Alsthom, the parent
company of Alcatel CIT, down by more than 2 per cent to FFr411. They later
recovered some of their losses, but remain more than 50 per cent below their
January level.
Industry analysts said that shares would remain vulnerable as a result of
the continuing corruption investigations. 'The group is very much in the
magistrates' sights,' said one electronics analyst at a French securities
company. He added that investors had also been unsettled by the damage to
relations with France Telecom.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces questioning as bribe probe widens:
Magistrates step up investigation of Italian leader's business empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian magistrates yesterday warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, that he faced questioning about bribery allegations as part of the
'clean hands' investigation into political corruption.
The move is a sign that the elite team of Milan's anti-corruption
magistrates are stepping up their investigation and their on-off feud with
the government, which took office in May.
However, in a statement broadcast on television last night, Mr Berlusconi
hit back at what he described as 'below-the-belt' attempts to destabilise
the government, saying that 'only a clear and explicit vote of no
confidence' by the lower house of the Italian parliament would induce him to
resign.
Partners in his fragile coalition rallied to his support yesterday.
Mr Berlusconi repeated that he was confident the magistrates had no evidence
for charging him personally with allegations that top managers at his
Fininvest business empire paid kickbacks to tax police in return for a
favourable audit.
On news of the magistrates' decision, the lira slipped to a new low of
L1,035.5 against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon. Government bonds also
weakened and Milan stock market indices fell by more than 2.8 per cent.
International investors fear the increased pressure on the prime minister
might make it even more difficult for the government to push tough 1995
budget measures through the senate, the upper house of parliament where the
coalition does not have a majority. The senate starts debating the proposals
today.
The magistrates' warning does not imply any guilt on Mr Berlusconi's part,
and under special rules he may be interviewed at his official residence in
Rome rather than in the draughty Milan palace of justice.
However, the prime minister was clearly angered by the timing of the
announcement. It came at a moment of maximum international exposure for Mr
Berlusconi, who has been hosting the United Nations conference against
international crime in Naples, and at a low point in his 10-month-old
venture into politics. Forza Italia, the party Mr Berlusconi founded in
January, is recovering from a poor performance in regional and local
elections on Sunday, and his government is engaged in a bruising battle with
trade unions over planned cuts to welfare and pension benefits.
'We are not prepared to allow a disgraceful abuse of criminal justice to
massacre the first rule of democracy, which says that he who has the votes
to govern shall govern,' the prime minister said on television last night.
Mr Berlusconi is likely to be questioned about his alleged involvement in
two or three cases of bribery by subsidiaries of Fininvest, the media,
property and financial services empire he built from nothing.
The prime minister has already admitted publicly that bribes were paid by
the group, although he has pointed out that the sums paid - no more than
L130m (Dollars 81,000) in each case - were small by comparison with overall
turnover. His brother Paolo has taken responsibility for giving the orders
and was briefly arrested during the summer in an earlier phase of the same
investigation.
The prime minister said yesterday that the Fininvest managers already
interrogated were victims of extortion, a line similar to that adopted by
many Italian entrepreneurs caught up in the inquiry into systematic bribery
of tax police.
Speculation about the imminent investigation of the prime minister, either
by Milan or Palermo magistrates, has swept financial markets recently,
fuelled by comments last month by the head of the Milan magistrates that the
inquiries were reaching 'high political levels'.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Major attacks 'unjustifiable' salary increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday condemned 'unjustifiable' salary increases for
executives of privatised companies as Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of
British Gas, said he was considering whether to forego part of a 75 per cent
pay rise.
The government's difficulties worsened as backbench tensions over Europe led
to an unexpected backbench challenge to Sir Marcus Fox, a key supporter of
the prime minister, for the leadership of the powerful 1922 committee of
backbench MPs.
The challenge, from Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the cross-party Commons
defence committee, was widely seen by MPs as an attempt to punish Sir Marcus
for his unswerving support for the prime minister.
In a further blow to the government, around 25 members of the Euro-sceptic
Fresh Start group last night discussed the possibility of mass abstention on
the European communities finance bill, threatening the government's majority
of 14.
The group also considered tabling an amendment to the bill, which provides
for an increase in UK contributions to the European Union. Mr Major has
threatened to call a general election if the bill is defeated or
substantially amended.
In robust Commons exchanges, Mr Major said that excessive executive pay
rises should be curbed by shareholders, but ruled out government
interference.
Mr Brown's pay rise was condemned as grotesque by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour
leader. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it was 'a
V-sign' to gas consumers.
Mr Blair later wrote to Mr Major urging the government to withdraw tax
privileges for executive share options and give regulators power to limit
price increases in industries subject to excessive salary rises.
Mr Brown said that he understood the reaction to the company's announcement
that his salary was to rise from Pounds 270,000 a year to Pounds 475,000. 'I
will consider my options and discuss it with my colleagues and executive
directors in the light of all that has been said,' he told Sky News.
Tory backbenchers said the battle for the leadership of the 1922 committee
could become a proxy contest between Sir Marcus and rightwingers seeking to
destabilise Mr Major's leadership.
Sir Nicholas said his challenge was 'categorically not an attack on the
prime minister'. However, backbenchers said there was a desire to rebuke Sir
Marcus for delivering a warning on behalf of the prime minister that the
defeat of the EU finance bill would prompt an election.

FT  23 NOV 94 / Wall St plunges 91 points on rate rise fears

US share prices fell more than 90 points yesterday amid fears that US
interest rates would have to rise further to head off inflationary
pressures.
Wall Street saw frantic trading as investors rushed to sell stocks, worried
that increases in rates would depress the growth of the economy and
corporate earnings. Last week, the Federal Reserve, the central bank,
increased the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to
5.5 per cent, but analysts are not convinced the Fed has done enough to head
off inflationary pressures.
Equity markets in Asia and Europe also fell yesterday. And early today
markets in the Far East opened sharply lower in the wake of Wall Street's
steep fall. Tokyo was closed for a holiday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 91.52 at 3,677.99, its lowest
level in almost five months and its largest one-day fall since February 4,
when the Fed made the first of six interest rate increases intended to slow
economic growth. Since Monday, the Dow has fallen almost 140 points, or 3.6
per cent. Traders said most of yesterday's selling was concentrated in the
stocks of companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle.
Mr Thomas McManus, an equity market strategist at securities firm Morgan
Stanley, said the market was finally realising that the Fed was likely to
succeed in cooling the economy. He said broad declines in Morgan Stanley's
index of cyclical stocks since October 28 indicated there would be a further
correction in the market. Yesterday, the firm recommended institutional
clients to reduce their stockholdings and put more money into 'cash' assets
such as short-term government securities. It is the latest big Wall Street
firm to advise clients to cut US stockholdings, a trend which has
contributed to the recent losses.
Most Wall Street analysts, however, do not believe that the market is
slipping into a freefall. Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at Dean
Witter Securities, said: 'The big question now is: Is this the start of a
big sell off? I think we're already most of the way through it.'
Asian and European markets, were depressed yesterday by Monday's 45 point
fall in the Dow. The FT-SE 100 index dropped 42.3 points to 3,078.7. Most
European bourses declined by about 1 per cent, with the exception of Italy,
where the Mibtel index dropped 2.8 per cent on the news that magistrates had
warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, that he faced questioning
about bribery allegations.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average fell below 19,000 for the first time since
February. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 3.8 per cent.

RJB Mining, the coal company chosen by the government as preferred bidder
for British Coal's English regions, is seeking to shave at least Pounds 35m
off its Pounds 914m bid after finding coal stocks are below expectations.
It told institutional investors that British Coal's English stockpiles are
1.3m tonnes of coal down on when it made its bid, and this should enable it
to negotiate a Pounds 35m reduction in the purchase price.
The coal stock change provides a fillip for the company's efforts to raise
up to Pounds 1.05bn through borrowing and selling shares. RJB was given
further cheer when Mr John Jermine, executive chairman of NSM, another coal
company which bid for British Coal assets, expressed support for the bid.
Other failed bidders have attacked RJB's assumptions on future sales as
unrealistic but Mr Jermine, whose company bid unsuccessfully for the south
Wales region, said he thought the plans would work.
In City presentations, Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, has told
institutional investors that the 'due diligence' process, through which it
is inspecting the assets, could produce further reductions in the price, on
top of the Pounds 35m it expects to save on coal stocks.
However, the company is not expecting cuts of more than Pounds 100m. Mr
Budge told investors there could be savings of tens of millions, not
hundreds. Government advisers are said to share that assessment.
Although the lower coal stocks will reduce the value of the regions being
acquired, they will also ease RJB's fund-raising task. It could be seeking
less than Pounds 1bn for the bid. The company is valued at just Pounds 157m
on the stock market.
In the face of strong criticism from rival bidders and analysts, Mr Budge is
presenting a highly confident face to the City.
He acknowledges that his company would fail to make the money it has
projected - Pounds 220m in pre-tax profits in 1999 alone - if coal demand at
the end of the century was as low as it has allowed in 'conservative case'
assumptions.
Those figures are viewed by some analysts as too high, but Mr Budge points
out they include forecasts that gas-fired generation will take the place of
up to 50m tonnes of coal equivalent - more than most expectations. The
figures also allow a high market share, 8.3m tonnes of coal equivalent, for
the burning of orimulsion - a bitumen-based fuel.
Mr Budge says he is also making conservative assumptions on cost-cutting, 3
per cent a year, for achieving profit projections.
He assumes, however, that coal can be sold to electricity generators at an
average of Pounds 1.25 per gigajoule after 1998 and Pounds 1.32 in 1999.
These projections, and those for sales of 34m tonnes in 1999, are seen as
extremely optimistic by rival bidders.
RJB refused to comment but Mr Budge has told institutions that at least 90
per cent of debt, possibly all of it, would be paid when existing contracts
with generators expire in April 1998.
The company is also planning to buy two pits, Ellington in Northumberland
and Thorne in Yorkshire, in addition to the 15 which are part of the three
regions it is buying.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank sells part of
loan portfolio

<TEXT>
Christiania Bank, Norway's second largest bank, has disposed of one-third of
the bank's loss-making US fisheries loan portfolio in Seattle.
Although terms of the deal were not disclosed, the bank agreed to sell Trust
Company of the West one-third of the troubled portfolio, estimated at
Dollars 323.5m in December.
As a result the portfolio has been reduced to Dollars 127m and the bank's
exposure to the fishing industry on the north-west coast of the US has been
reduced.
Christiania said it would not now have to report further loan-loss
provisions for the fourth quarter, as it had warned earlier this month.
The bank said international loans to the fisheries sector, particularly in
Seattle, constituted the most troubled sector of its overall loan portfolio.
About 94 per cent of the loan portfolio sold was classified as
non-performing or doubtful loans, according to the bank's
risk-classification system.
It said it intended to reduce the net loan portfolio in Seattle to about
Dollars 100m.
In the third quarter, Christiania made provisions of NKr93m to cover
fisheries loan losses which, for the nine-month period of this year, reached
NKr384m.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Nykredit takes 15% holding in
Bikuben

<TEXT>
Nykredit, the largest of the Danish mortgage credit institutions, is to take
a 15 per cent stake in Bikuben, the country's third largest bank.
The mortgage group will invest DKr540m (Dollars 88.5m) to acquire a 5 per
cent stake from Bikuben, which will offer a further 10 per cent through a
direct share issue at DKr188 a share.
The agreement means Bikuben will use its branch network to recommend
Nykredit's mortgage loans.
In return, Nykredit, which has similar arrangements with 54 banks, will
refrain from setting up a retail banking operation.
Bikuben recently announced a programme to cut its staff and branch network
to strengthen its earnings over the next three years.
The agreement between Bikuben and Nykredit is a response to the challenge by
the two big banks, Den Danske Bank and Unibank, which together have a
two-thirds market share in Danish banking services.
Both have set up their own mortgage credit subsidiaries, which are growing
fast, although their market shares are still in low single-digit figures.
The purchase will make Nykredit the largest single shareholder in Bikuben,
and give it the maximum stake a single shareholder may own in the bank,
according to Bikuben's articles of association.
Nykredit will also obtain two seats on Bikuben's supervisory board.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Cement companies face big EU fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission this week may announce record fines against some of
the region's biggest cement companies after a five-year investigation into
alleged illegal market-sharing agreements.
European Union officials said yesterday they were very close to announcing a
decision, which some observers believe could come later this week.
Some 30 companies are thought to be involved in the inquiry, which, under
commission rules, could result in fines of up to 10 per cent of the European
turnover of the worst offenders.
The investigation originally involved more than 70 companies. The shortened
list is thought to include all the big suppliers including British, French,
German and Italian companies.
It would be the fourth time this year that the fines would have been imposed
by the commission for alleged market sharing or price fixing by European
companies.
The commission in July imposed record fines totalling Ecu132.15m (Dollars
167.8m) on 19 carton-board producers accused of operating Europe's 'most
pernicious' price-fixing cartel.
In February, Brussels fined 14 steel producers more than Ecu100m for price
fixing and market sharing.
Fines against cement companies, if imposed, are likely to be staggered, with
lesser offenders being fined smaller amounts, as occurred in the
carton-board case.
The EU investigations began in 1989 when officials staged a dawn raid on the
offices of 10 leading cement producers in France, Belgium and Germany.
The raids were ordered after customers complained of a low level of cement
imports in spite of large price variations between neighbouring European
countries.
Imports have risen since the late 1980s but still provide a low proportion
of total sales in most EU countries.
Reuter adds from Brussels: Neither the names of companies involved, nor the
size of any fines have been disclosed, officials said. The list would be
drafted at the very last moment to avoid turmoil in the companies' shares.
The probe originally concerned the whole sector, including Holderbank of
Switzerland, Italy's Italcementi, France's Lafarge Coppee, Belgium's CBR,
Britain's Blue Circle, Germany's Dyckerhoff, and Portugal's Cimpor, along
with national and European cement associations. Shares in Lafarge Coppee
fell last week on a press report that the company had made no provisions for
a possible fine. The French company denied the allegations.

<TEXT>
Leading pharmaceuticals groups Glaxo and Wellcome were the star performers
in London following encouraging reports from a conference on Aids.
Wellcome opened weaker as Glaxo decided to backtrack from licensing its Aids
product 3TC to the company and continue to develop it in-house. However,
some brokers argued that the benefits coming out of the conference
outweighed the disadvantages. Lehman Brothers said sales of both products
would be boosted and every additional Dollars 100m of Retrovir sales would
add 2p a share to Wellcome's earnings.
It will be some time before trials on the Retrovir/3TC cocktail are
translated into increased profits. But the news gave a lift to sentiment
and, with the help of a firmer dollar, Glaxo advanced 13 1/2 to 626p while
Wellcome improved 12 to 675p.
VSEL gained 30 at 1518p following widespread weekend press comment on the
possibility of an early reply in the bid battle for the submarine maker from
electronics giant GEC.
British Aerospace eased 4 to 442p, which shaded the value of its all-share
offer for VSEL to under 1459p. According to analysts yesterday, GEC could
shortly step up its 1400p a share cash bid to 1550p. GEC dipped 1 1/2 to
286p. The situation provoked very little turnover: BAe was the most active
of the protagonists yesterday with just 2.4m shares dealt.
Rolls-Royce firmed 2 to 185p as the market embraced the strategic strength
of the company's Dollars 525m agreed purchase of Allison Engine, of the US.
The deal gives R-R a significant stake in US aero-engine manufacture and,
with Allison clawing back to a modest operating profit in the 1994 third
quarter, London analysts warmed to its timing.
What Sir Ralph Robins, R-R's chairman, had to say about a possible share
placing or rights issue next spring took some of the gloss off the occasion.
But both NatWest Securities and Credit Lyonnais Laing see the deal as
earnings enhancing, and expect R-R's preferred financing route to take shape
through a one-for-six rights at 165p a share.
Shell Transport traded up 4 to 711p as the market responded to a company
presentation at the City's Chiswell Street Brewery. Ms Irene Himona of SGST
said the company gave a positive and reassuring performance and focused on
hefty cost cutting.
Regional electricity group East Midland attracted attention as traders
started dealing in the company's new shares after the well signposted share
consolidation took effect. The stock closed at 777p.
There was good buying in three of the smaller water companies which report
interim figures this week. Yorkshire rose 10 to 549p, Welsh 5 to 668p and
South West 2 to 503p. Dealers are looking to see if the three will follow
Northumbrian (723p xd), which reported a 16 per cent dividend increase. One
market watcher said: 'The three are likely to announce favourable payments.
They are aware that the government's golden share expires at the end of this
year and they may be vulnerable to takeovers.'
Mobile communications group Vodafone remained weak ahead of today's
interims, easing 1 1/2 to 206p in turnover of 4.3m for a decline over the
past five trading days of almost 6 per cent. Whispers about possible
customer fraud provisions also hit the shares.
The half-time results are expected to be held in check by heavy overseas
start-up costs, which for the full year could get close to Pounds 60m,
according to Hoare Govett. The broker sees interim profits of Pounds 180m.
High street banks suffered from profit-taking, with Barclays sliding 13 to
590p, Lloyds 9 to 586p and National Westminster 8 1/2 to 523p.
Abbey National declined 7 1/2 to 412p ahead of a quarterly trading update
today.
British Land retreated 12 to 383p after a surprise announcement that the
company is to buy the 51.5 per cent of Quantum Property Fund it does not
control, from financier Mr George Soros.
Dealers were particularly concerned by the sharp increase in the company's
gearing following the deal, given the current rates of interest.
Well received figures from publisher Emap saw the shares improve 5 to 405p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spirits group Allied Domecq tumbled 13 to 583p as dealers said Cazenove, the
company's broker, had downgraded profits expectations just ahead of Domecq's
interim results.
There was no confirmation from Cazenove, but the speculation led to strong
activity in the shares and turnover rose to 5.1m, making it the stock's
busiest session for nearly 6 months. Domecq reports interims on Thursday.
The market range is Pounds 310m to Pounds 340m.
Sentiment was hit further by news that Morgan Stanley had placed the stock
on its 'sell' list from a previous 'hold' recommendation and weighed in with
a sharp profits downgrade. The broker scaled back its profits forecast for
the year 1994-95 by Pounds 26m to Pounds 646m and that of the following year
by Pounds 36m to Pounds 778m. Analyst Mr Charles Winston cited destocking in
the Mexican market, difficult trading at Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing joint
venture, and a revised interest charge.
Nervousness ahead of this week's figures led to the initial retreat in the
stock last week when Smith New Court downgraded current year earnings per
share and moved the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' stance last Thursday.

FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson bucks bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Internationally traded conglomerate Hanson saw its shares ignore some
disappointing news and forge ahead as investors finally noted their recent
underperformance.
The company announced that it had been forced to drop the planned flotation
of US toy maker Ertl because of poor stock market conditions. The news put
paid to hopes that it would raise some Dollars 200m for a 63 per cent
flotation.
However, a large line of some 8m shares which had been washing around the
market was finally cleared, and several specialists pointed out that the
Hanson share price had underperformed the broad market by 7 per cent over
the past quarter.
Investment houses have been expressing their confidence ahead of full-year
figures due next Thursday. Company broker Hoare Govett was in Scotland
talking to investment institutions following a positive review and Lehman
Brothers was discussing a buy note with clients. Hanson gained 4 at 237p,
with turnover reaching 12m, the heaviest among leading issues.

FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures snoozed through much of the session on dull trading
volume, unable to extract inspiration from lifeless cash markets in both
London and New York, writes Jeffrey Brown.
Activity was very thin. Just 6,887 contracts were dealt during pit trading -
down from 10,236 on Friday - and more than 1,000 of these stemmed from
spread trading as investors rolled over into the March contract.
At the 4.10pm official close, the FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,130,
down 10 points. The premium to cash equities was around 10 points, three
points more than fair value.
Traders said the market looked to have gone on hold ahead of the long
Thanksgiving weekend in the US and with the UK Budget - due on November 29 -
rapidly approaching.
The local, or independent, traders had the session largely to themselves and
deal sizes shrank dramatically. The premium on the December contract
narrowed to a couple of points on occasions, but there were few real
attempts to lead the cash market lower.
Stock option volume was also slack, slipping to 21,653 lots, against 35,055
on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for less than 10,000
contracts dealt.
Hanson was the busiest stock option, with 1,492 lots, followed by BT and
Lonrho.

FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Institutions hold back as Wall Street
falters - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were no real surprises around the City of London's trading rooms at
the lacklustre performance by UK equities at the start of a week which
traditionally sees US interest down to a minimum ahead of the annual
Thanksgiving Day holiday, scheduled for Thursday.
And the big institutions were said to be remaining on the sidelines, trying
to assess the mood of the stock market ahead of the Budget, due a week from
today.
At the close of a very quiet trading session the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.0
lower at 3,121.0. The second-liners were equally becalmed, with the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index settling 6.1 off at 3,569.5.
The gilt-edged sector did its best to bolster the equity market, but early
firmness in longer dated issues was quietly eroded in a similarly subdued
session and failed to provide much support for share prices.
Dealers refused to adopt a bearish attitude to the market, however. 'Today
was not too discouraging,' said one leading trader. 'We have gone easier on
very small volume and the selling pressure has been minimal. The undertone
remains solid and there are no scare stories about the Budget doing the
rounds.'
Some traders expressed surprise at London's refusal to respond to a firm
opening on Wall Street and a good performance by European stock and bond
markets throughout the session. And a better showing by the US currency
should have bolstered the big dollar earners.
Share prices were always struggling, with marketmakers, conscious of Wall
Street's rather fragile performance last Friday, unwilling to run bull
positions at the start of the week. Early deals were mostly on the sell side
and the FT-SE 100 fell away to the day's low point, down 14.3 at 3,116.7,
within an hour of the opening.
There was some unease in the market with news that the UK's non-EU trade
deficit came in slightly worse than expected, but analysts said the news
played little part in the day's performance.
Activity was down to a trickle over the lunchtime period, and gradually
picked up in the early afternoon. It was partly stimulated by the higher
opening on Wall Street but later petered out as the US market began to
falter.
Turnover, which has improved strongly over the past couple of weeks, proved
a major disappointment yesterday, reaching a dismal 487.4m shares. The lack
of institutional interest was plainly evident as non-Footsie stocks
accounted for 67 per cent of the day's total. Dealers are hoping that
trading picks up as the week wears on; the value of customer business in the
market last Friday was Pounds 1.28bn, continuing the recent run of strong
institutional activity.
'It was a typical Monday in the market,' said the head of marketmaking at
one of London's leading securities houses. 'Low volume, despite good
performances from gilts, bunds and bonds.' He added that London needed Wall
Street to hold last night.
The drugs sector provided the FT-SE 100 with its best performers. Glaxo and
Wellcome sped ahead following the Glasgow Aids conference at which it was
disclosed that a cocktail of Glaxo's 3TC compound and Wellcome's AZT drug
produced the best results in clinical trials.
Allied Domecq, on the other hand, suffered from yet more downgrades in front
of Thursday's interim figures. Hanson moved ahead as a big line of stock
overhanging the market was cleared.
Oil shares gave ground early in the day, but made good progress towards the
close as it became clear that the market expects the Opec meeting in Bali to
agreee a rollover of the current 24.5m barrels a day output ceiling for 12
months. Crude oil prices were up around 40 cents yesterday, and above the
important Dollars 17 a barrel level.

FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate worries leave Dow
sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Program selling left US share prices at their lowest levels since August 22
yesterday amid uncertainty about future interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 45.75 at 3,769.51.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 3.17 to 458.30, while
the American SE composite weakened 2.76 to 441.28 and the Nasdaq composite
fell 6.93 to 757.74. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 293m shares.
The market began drifting downwards early in the afternoon, with the effect
snowballing towards the end of the day. At one point, just before the close,
the Dow was more than 50 points off before it made a slight comeback.
One factor pushing prices down was continued uncertainty about economic
conditions. In spite of the Federal Reserve's larger than expected increase
in interest rates last week, most economists believe that the Fed will boost
rates again later this year or early in 1995. Such a move would be expected
to hurt equity prices by making borrowing more expensive and ultimately
putting pressure on corporate earnings.
Shares of several major cyclical companies showed declines yesterday. Allied
Signal retreated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 , Caterpillar slipped
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 7/8 , DuPont lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 54 3/4
and Dow Chemical was off Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 64 1/2 .
Conseco, the insurer, forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 40 3/8 after a
proposed merger with Kemper fell apart. Kemper, which said it was still for
sale, tumbled Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 .
Chiron, the biotech company, gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 80 1/4 on news that
it had signed an agreement to form a partnership with Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss
pharmaceuticals company. Under the proposed alliance, Ciba-Geigy would pay
an unexpectedly high Dollars 117 per share for just over 37 per cent.
Major high-technology companies were mixed yesterday afternoon: Digital
Equipment gained Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 1/8 , Compaq Computer was up
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 , IBM shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 72 7/8 ,
Texas Instruments lost Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 78 3/4 and Microsoft, which
trades on the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 .
Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 99 3/4 and Apple Computer shed
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 .
Canada
Initial firmness in Toronto quickly evaporated and stocks drifted easier
before dropping sharply late in the session, dragged down by the Wall Street
trend.
The TSE 300 index finished 40.22 weaker at 4,074.31, while declines
outscored rises by 553 to 221 after volume of 40.9m shares valued at
CDollars 426.9m. All 14 sub-indices were lower, led by gold, metal, real
estate and transportation stocks.
Heavily weighted golds were the main drag on the composite index, falling
2.52 per cent as the New York spot bullion price shed 90 cents to USDollars
383.55 an ounce.

FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS pressured ahead of
shareholders meeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Continent was steady yesterday.
ZURICH looked to the firm dollar to provide some support for industrials,
but UBS and Ciba shares found themselves under pressure. The SMI index
picked up just 0.5 to 2,607.0.
UBS bearers fell SFr15 to SFr1,185 and the registered were SFr1 lower at
SFr279 as the market braced itself for today's crunch extraordinary
shareholders meeting on the bank's plan for a unified share structure. The
premium on the registered stock has slipped to 17.7 per cent, from the 34.4
per cent seen on September 29, when battle lines were drawn with Mr Martin
Ebner's BK Vision.
Ciba registered weakened SFr13 to SFr757 following the news that it was
lifting to 49.9 per cent its stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology company,
amid uncertainty about the longer term benefits of the deal for Ciba.
Renewed profit-taking left Swiss Re SFr9 lower at SFr788, but Roche
certificates picked up SFr35 to SFr5,900.
PARIS confirmed the pattern of dull trading, with the CAC 40 index
struggling to make a rise on the day of 1.33 to 1,927.83. Turnover was
around FFr3bn.
Renault remained at the forefront of activity following its debut on the
bourse last week, with more than 2m shares changing hands, but the stock
closed unchanged at FFr181. Peugeot remained under pressure, losing FFr16 at
FFr785.
LVMH was one of the strongest of the day's offerings, up FFr11 to FFr847,
following the announcement at the end of last week that it was reduc-ing its
stake in Guinness, of the UK.
Generale des Eaux receded FFr4.40 to FFr496.60 after slightly disappointing
nine-month figures.
FRANKFURT failed to make much headway as the market awaited domestic M3 data
sometime this week and a meeting of the Bundesbank on Thursday. In addition,
the closure of both the Japanese and US markets, on Wednesday and Thursday
respectively, is viewed as a disincentive.
The Dax index rose 5.05 in official hours to 2,105.28, but then crawled
backwards in the post-bourse to 2,097.20.
The chemicals sector attracted interest ahead of interim results due to be
announced later in the week. BASF, wisth figures due on Thursday, put on
DM1.20 at DM313.80, Hoechst struggled to a 10-pfennig gain at DM324.10, and
Bayer went in the opposite direction, losing DM1.60 at DM342.00.
VW was among the strongest stocks, up DM6.70 at DM467.50, helped by dollar
strength and in spite of criticisms levelled against the management style of
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chairman.
Elsewhere in the sector, performance was miserable: BMW shed DM3.50 to
DM783.00 and Porsche DM4 to DM695.
MILAN remained driven by politics and budgetary concerns. The slump in the
popularity of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the weekend's
regional elections was viewed as positive, since it reduced the chances of a
snap general election.
However, the successful passage of the 1995 budget through the lower house
of parliament during the day only drew attention to the pitfalls it faces in
the Senate, where the coalition government has no overall majority and will
have to rely on the support of opposition parties.
The Comit index picked up 5.05 to 648.64, but some late weakness was
reflected in the real-time Mibtel index, which finished 38 ahead at 10,374,
off a day's high of 10,401.
Montedison fell L23 to L1,197 in heavy turnover, driven by speculation about
further restructuring.
Credito Italiano picked up L18 to L1,715 as its L2,000bn bid for control of
Credito Romagnolo remained in play. Romagnolo ended L28 down at L16,867, but
off a low of L16,700. Ras, whose L2,300 capital increase is under way, saw
its stock recoup L124 at L15,122 after last week's sharp losses.
AMSTERDAM gained ground on general strength throughout the Continent, but
enthusiasm was limited. The AEX index rose 1.34 to 411.19, having traded in
a narrow range throughout the session.
EVC International, a PVC joint venture between ICI, of the UK, and Enichem,
of Italy, ended the session at Fl 78.10, against a flotation price of Fl
77.00, in reasonable volume of an estimated 125,000 shares.
ING added Fl 1.00 at Fl 79.20 ahead of nine-month results due out later this
week.
STOCKHOLM was higher on stable debt yields, a stronger dollar and the
remnants of the positive momentum established last week by the 'yes' vote in
the EU referendum.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 13.5 to 1,520.0.
The index for the building and property sector jumped 3.3 per cent on hopes
of a surge in new construction projects. Skanska B climbed SKr7 to
SKR176.50, while NCC B rose SKr4 to SKr74.50.
The forestry index climbed 2.1 per cent as SCA B gained SKr4 at SKr119,
while Modo B climbed SKr9 to SKr343.
Volvo B rose SKr2.50 to SKr147.50 as the company said it planned to raise
research and development spending to about SKr9bn.
WARSAW tumbled 4.9 per cent on a lack of confidence that the market was
bottoming out of its recent drop. The Wig index lost 349.3 at 7,190.6 as
traders warned that the market was likely to continue to slide towards
support at 6,716.
Some dealers, however, took heart that turnover fell by 31 per cent to 338bn
zlotys, indicating investors' reluctance to sell at currently depressed
prices.

FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds lead S Africa lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold and other mining shares in Johannesburg reacted to a decline in the
price of bullion, with volume light, but late demand lifted prices off their
lows, Reuter reports.
Industrials finished steady as the sector shrugged off lower world markets
and a number of dividend payments from major companies.
Traders said the undertone in industrials was firm and prospects in coming
weeks remained steady, largely because of seasonal interest in December.
They added that the industrial market was likely to move higher in the short
term as institutions stocked up ahead of the Christmas break and amid
foreign interest.
The overall index ended 22.4 down at 5,901.8, industrials slipped just 4.3
to 6,942.9 and the gold shares index dropped 34.6 to 2,104.2.
Banking stocks were firm again amid a lack of scrip and following recent
good results and bullish prospects.

FT  22 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Further drop in Sony
depresses investor confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A further decline in Sony, the consumer electronics maker, depressed
investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground on small-lot
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 180.84 down at the day's low of 19,121.72. It rose just
after the opening to the session's peak of 19,315.16, but profit-taking by
institutional and overseas investors later hit share prices.
Volume was 177.6m shares, the lowest since November 7. Traders said
investors grew increasingly pessimistic as the Nikkei approached 19,111.92,
the closing price for March 31 which has become a psychological support
level.
Investors are also wary of interim earnings announcements by commercial
banks this Thursday. 'Investors fear that share prices will repeat last
year's plunge following banks' profit reports, and are looking to cash their
stocks,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 11.09 to 1,512.38, while
the Nikkei 300 lost 2.08 at 277.65. Declines overwhelmed advances by 726 to
234, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
up 0.71 to 1,238.94.
Sony, which dropped 5.3 per cent on Friday following reports of its
write-off of losses stemming from its entertainment business, shed a further
Y250 or 4.6 per cent to Y5,230. Other consumer electronics companies were
also lower, Sharp weakening Y40 to Y1,740 and Matsushita Electric
Industrial, which owns MCA, the US movie studio, Y10 to Y1,530.
Bargain hunting supported Mitsubishi Estate, the 80 per cent stakeholder of
the US Rockefeller Group. The company, which met profit-taking last week due
to reports that Rockefeller Center may default on its mortgage payments,
rallied Y20 to Y1,070 on buy-backs.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, supported by strong metal prices last week, dipped
Y20 to Y917 on profit-taking. Steel issues were easier.
Some brokers were lower on earnings fears due to the stagnant trading
volumes. Yamaichi Securities retreated Y14 to Y696 and Daiwa Securities fell
Y30 to Y1,240, but Nomura held at Y1,930.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 123.92 to 21,332.04 in volume of 32.4m
shares.
Roundup
Turnover was generally low among the region's markets, with a number still
worried about the effect of higher interest rates on equity per-formance.
HONG KONG fell 1.3 per cent amid worries about the impact of rising US and
local interest rates on property prices. The Hang Seng index lost 124.20 at
9,303.24, erasing last week's 59.59 gain, while the property sub-index sank
343.52 or 2.0 per cent to 16,518.90.
Among property issues, Sun Hung Kai Properties declined HKDollars 1.75 to
HKDollars 54.75, Cheung Kong 80 cents to HKDollars 36 and Henderson Land
HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 48.60.
Turnover totalled a preliminary HKDollars 2.4bn, down from HKDollars 3.6bn
on Friday.
SINGAPORE retreated 1.4 per cent, led by selling of some index stocks in a
market worried about the possibility of higher interest rates. The Straits
Times Industrial index fell 32.68 to 2,321.99 and the UOB OTC index,
tracking Malaysian stocks, shed 9.55 to 1,171.80.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in idle trade as investors adopted a
wait-and-see attitude amid lack of fresh leads. The composite index eased
3.50 to 1,045.38 in volume that shrank to 73m shares from Friday's 105m.
Selling was mostly in second-line stocks, led by Granite Industries, which
fell 30 cents to MDollars 6.45. YTL Corp bucked the trend, rising 70 cents
to MDollars 17.20 on rumours of a bonus issue.
Malaysian Assurance climbed 30 cents to MDollars 6.30 in volume of 3.9m
shares amid analysts' rerating of the insurance sector.
SYDNEY declined as equities took a lead from the fall on Wall Street at the
end of last week, as well as the firmer Australian dollar. The All
Ordinaries index slid 12.5 to 1,909.5, its lowest level since September 16,
1993. Volume amounted to 132.8m shares worth ADollars 300m.
The Australian dollar closed at a 2 1/2 -year high, with deal-ers expecting
it to break 76 US cents overnight for the first time since June 1992.
Analysts commented that the rising Australian dollar was not good for the
stock market, especially resource shares. BHP receded 8 cents to ADollars
18.92, CRA 22 cents to ADollars 17.18 and WesternMining 11 cents to ADollars
7.35.
In the media sector, which closed 2.1 per cent down overall, News Corp fell
14 cents to ADollars 5.30 and John Fairfax 7 cents to ADollars 2.71.
Among banks, National Australia declined 8 cents to ADollars 10.50 and
Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.25.
TAIPEI was driven down by selling in the last few minutes of trading and the
weighted index lost 45.06 at 6,404.62. Turnover was a thin TDollars 31.8bn.
Buying was seen in industrials such as textiles, foods and plastic shares,
but late profit-taking left textiles as the only gainers. Buying in textiles
was triggered by expectations of an industry recovery, with the most active
issue Shinkong Synthetic Fibres, up 30 cents to TDollars 30.50, followed by
Hualon, which rose 80 cents to TDollars 20.90.
Hopes of an announcement by China Steel that it planned to raise steel
product prices for 1995 boosted minor buying in steel stocks, but they soon
fell back as the impact was discounted.
BANGKOK fell as market sentiment remained depressed, but scattered buying by
mutual funds and possibly some foreign investors left the index above the
day's low.
The SET index lost 16.90 or 1.2 per cent at 1,440.59, with just Bt4bn worth
of shares traded. The finance sector was the worst hit and also the most
actively traded, falling 2.1 per cent on turnover of Bt587.8m.
New listing Thai Rung Union finished at Bt114, against an IPO price of
Bt102, and was the most active stock.
TelecomAsia was actively traded ahead of the December subscription for 25m
shares reserved for Telephone Organisation of Thailand employees from TA's
initial public offering one year ago. The shares are not expected to trade
until after January. TA was unchanged at Bt83.
SEOUL edged lower after a consolidation among the blue chips took its toll,
although domestic, consumption-related shares gained broadly. The composite
index lost 0.50 at 1,117.08, off a day's high of 1,126.26.
WELLINGTON was pressured by a number of heavyweight stocks going
ex-dividend. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 21.64 to 2,031.22.
Lion Nathan continued its downward drift, losing 10 cents at NZDollars 2.90,
a low for the year. Port of Tauranga gained 6 cents at NZDollars 1.22 after
reporting better than expected earnings.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Pound gets lift from Bank governor's
comments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling rallied against the D-Mark in early trading yesterday on the back
of comments by Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, writes Philip
Coggan.
Although the pound weakened in the afternoon, it still finished in London at
DM2.4452, up from Friday's close of DM2.4379.
Speaking in Dubai, Mr George said UK interest rates would have to be
increased if the economy did not start to slow down of its own accord. The
UK's gross domestic product grew by 4.2 per cent in the year to the third
quarter, according to figures released on Friday.
Mr George's comments revived expectations of an early UK interest rate rise,
which had dwindled last week on the back of low infla-tion data and weaker
than expected retail sales statistics. Short sterling futures lost some of
their recent gains, with the March contract fall-ing six basis points to
92.95.
The pound did not make any progress against the dollar, ending the day at
Dollars 1.5681, from Friday's Dollars 1.5690. But on a trade-weighted basis,
sterling edged up to 79.9 from 79.7.
Yesterday's modest strength follows the pound's continued weakness during
November. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets,
said: 'There was a big build-up in sterling positions in advance of the last
Clarke/George meeting but expectations of a rate rise were disappointed.' In
his view: 'An over-exaggerated move in the market has been corrected.'
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro Bank, said that since
the interest rate differential between the UK and US has disappeared
sterling has dropped from Dollars 1.64 to Dollars 1.57. 'The market is
reluctant to believe that UK/US interest rates can drop to parity and
sterling can remain stable,' he added.
The US dollar edged up against the D-Mark but slipped slightly against the
yen, in what is expected to be a quiet trading week ahead of the
Thanksgiving holiday. The only significant US economic statistic will be
tomorrow's publication of durable goods orders for October.
In London, the US currency closed at DM1.5594, against DM1.5539 on Friday,
and at Y98.375 from Y98.525. It finished in New York at DM1.5564 and Y98.30.
The dollar has generally been much stronger against the D-Mark than the yen
in recent weeks. On the cross-rate, the D-Mark fell yesterday to Y63.07,
from Y63.40 on Friday, its lowest level for around two months. 'This D-Mark
weakness is an unwinding of the euphoria in October on the re-election of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ
International.
'Expectations remain strong that the German authorities will move to a
variable rate repo when they meet on Thursday and this may keep the D-Mark
subdued ahead of the meeting,' said Midland's Mr Geddes. 'Meanwhile,
whenever the dollar rallies, we are seeing heavy sales for yen by Japanese
exporters.'
Mr Norfield thinks that 'most people do not think the dollar is going to
fall to DM1.50; therefore, there is a bias to test the upside. Were the
dollar to hit the DM1.58 level, that would be potentially decisive, since it
would threaten to break out of a downtrend that had been in effect since
January'.
The Australian dollar reached its highest point since June 1992, climbing
above 76 US cents. The currency has been boosted this year by commodity
prices, which firmed again last week, and yesterday it gained on
expectations of another interest rate rise. Australia already has 'one of
the highest real yields in the industrialised world', according to IBJ's Mr
Hannah.
The Italian lira and Irish punt held up well in the face of political
difficulties. The lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L1,025 after a
poor performance by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party in local
elections. The punt edged up to IPounds 1.013 against sterling, from IPounds
1.014, in the wake of Saturday's election of former finance minister Mr
Bertie Ahern as leader of Fianna Fail.
The Bank of England gave the UK money markets help of just Pounds 52m at
established rates, compared with a forecast shortage of Pounds 150m.
Overnight rates moved within the range of 5.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Going for
quality at farm machinery show-case - Organisers of London's Smithfield Show
are seeking visitors with spending-power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Smithfield Show, which opens its four-day run at Earl's Court
exhibition hall in London next Sunday, is rooted in the traditions of the
meat trade. But for many years the viability of the event has relied heavily
on the farm machinery industry, which uses it as a winter showcase for
equipment which it hopes to sell to dealers and their farmer customers for
use on the land in the coming year.
A few years ago, the show appeared to be on its last legs. Attendance was
falling a little further each year; machinery manufacturers were pulling
out, leaving unoccupied floor space for probably the first time in the
show's long history; farming and its ancilliary trades faced declining
margins resulting from a combination of shrinking European Union support and
a run of unfavourable weather. Almost the entire industry was in the
doldrums.
But the buoyancy is back and the organisers have every expectation of a
lively and successful show. They base their optimism on a variety of
factors. First, the marketing of the event has been revamped to concentrate
on the 'quality' of those attending rather than mere numbers. A survey taken
at last year's event, for instance, indicated that although attendance was
less than 44,000 it was made up almost entirely of decision-makers in
farming and the machinery trade.
Moreover, 67 per cent said they were likely to place an order for some kind
of equipment as a result of their visit to Earl's Court. Exhibitors have
accepted the logic of this approach and many prestigious companies have
returned, especially after the show's organisers introduced low-cost modular
stands to replace the flashy creations of the past.
The confidence and the cash behind those changes, however, came about as a
result of EU area payments in compensation to farmers for setting land
aside, which were higher than anticipated. The devaluation of sterling in
the autumn of 1992 and the fact that such payments are calculated in Ecus
saw to that and gave UK farmers an advantage over most of their European
neighbours. Further, market prices for many farm-produced commodities have
been higher than expected and well above apparent support levels because of
shortfalls in supplies.
This situation has continued through 1994 and tractor sales, which are
always a good barometer of farmers' confidence, were running marginally
ahead of 1993 at the end of October. Total UK registrations were 16,044
compared with 15,433 in the corresponding period of 1993.
This small advance, the Agricultural Engineers Association believes, is
likely to be eroded by the end of December to give a whole-year figure of
about the same as last year's 17,899 units. That would still compare very
favourably, however, with the low reached in 1992 when only 13,454 tractors
were sold to UK farmers.
How long this relatively lively trade will continue is, however, the subject
of much speculation. Some industry pundits believe it will prove only a
brief interruption to the downward trend that appeared to be established
before the sterling devaluation.
Certainly, the machinery trade seems to regard the current situation as a
temporary window of opportunity which it can exploit. Many farmers see it in
a similar light and have grabbed the chance to replace old and unreliable
machines so as to be able to batten down the hatches when funds become
tighter.
For there is widespread concern that the good times cannot last. Thinking
farmers and machinery manufacturers look at the budget-busting payments to
an industry that is supposed to be getting used to world prices and the free
trade of the Gatt accord and wonder how they can be maintained.
Then there is Franz Fischler, the EU's new agricultural commissioner, who
takes over the portfolio on January 1. This Austrian clearly remains an
unknown quantity. But his background among small mountain farms and
ultra-green policies may not make him sympathetic to the relatively larger
and mainly intensively managed farms of the UK.
Paradoxically, the UK's agricultural industry is already responding to
anticipated pressures by increasing the size of farms so as to benefit from
the economies of scale. One commentator has estimated that up to 1m acres
(400,000 hectares) of Britain are now contract-farmed. This almost certainly
means that the owners are earning significantly more from this land than
they could have done under their own management.
Machinery manufacturers have been doing similar things for years. Takeover,
mergers and joint ventures are increasingly characterising what is now a
thoroughly international business. And when the multinational companies that
serve farmers find it necessary to rationalise it is pretty clear that their
clients, whose businesses are tiny in comparison, should do likewise.
Indeed, the way the Smithfield Show is now organised reflects this cut in
the number of decision-makers at all levels, the need to rationalise and
economise and the increasing internationalism of the trade.
This will be the last full-scale annual Smithfield Show. In future, it will
be held every second year, alternating with the Agritechnica Show in
Germany. Pleasingly, an annual lifestock and meat show will continue to be
held in London just before Christmas.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel plant problems
'serious'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production problems at Norilsk in Siberia, which supplies 120,000 tonnes a
year of the world's nickel, or 15 per cent of total output, appear to be
serious, according to Macquarie Equities, the Australian financial services
company.
Mr Jim Lennon, Macquarie's metals analyst, said last night, however, it had
still to be determined how serious the production losses would be. 'Some
people say the problems can be solved quickly but others say they will have
a long-term impact.'
Nickel is used mainly in the production of stainless steel for which demand
is booming.
While the Reuter news agency last Friday reported a senior official at the
Norilsk plant had denied the problems were serious, Mr Lennon said that
'usually reliable' Russian sources told a different story.
Mr Lennon said he understood that there was an explosion at a transformer at
the Norilsk thermal (gas-fired) power plant on November 4 which took about
two weeks to repair. The plant supplies heating and power to the town of
Norilsk and also to the smelting and refining plants. A power failure
stopped pumping and cooling systems at the station and this caused damage to
three of its four turbines.
The power 'outages' and restriction of heating then led to major damage to
uninsulated pipes and other equipment at the metallurgical plants because
present outside temperatures at Norilsk are minus 30 to minus 35 degrees
Centigrade. 'There are reports that a pipeline carrying concentrate to the
metallurgical plants froze and then exploded,' said Mr Lennon.
'One source expects problems throughout the winter, with full repairs not
being possible until next summer. If this is correct - but it is difficult
to confirm at the moment - there could be a substantial fall in nickel
exports from Russia next year.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International coffee market
distortion attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international coffee sector should be allowed to take full advantage of
higher earnings resulting from this year's surge in prices, Mr Celsius
Lodder, the new executive director of the International Coffee Organisation,
said yesterday.
Addressing a meeting of the Interafrican Coffee Organisation in Lome, Mr
Lodder attacked producing countries that held down domestic prices
artificially or imposed export taxes 'without any regard to overall world
supply'.
He said such actions limited exports and increased international price
volatility at a time when traders and roasters were trying to defend their
market shares and build new markets, for example in eastern Europe and Asia.
'Many producers have accumulated losses and debts, and export companies,
only recently acting in a free-market, liberalised economy, have not been
operating long enough to build up solid working capital,' he added.
Mr Lodder, who took up his post last month, said the ICO had to find a new
role in a less interventionist world, where the private sector played an
increasingly important part.
'The end of the large government coffee authorities, in Brazil and Mexico
for example, together with the privatisation of internal and external trade,
have contributed to making the private sector virtually dominant in some
countries,' he said.
The ICO's goals were to increase membership, involve the private sector in
its activities, raise its public profile and produce more statistical
information and country reports, he said.
Among specific projects, he said the ICO would be linked into the Internet,
the emerging information superhighway that connects about 2m computers and
7,000 databases around the world.
It would also co-ordinate assistance for countries such as Angola and
Rwanda, whose coffee sectors have been badly damaged by war or climatic
disasters.
On production policy, it would develop guidelines for the 'rational
self-regulation' of output, putting an emphasis on incentives to improve
quality rather than quantity.

The Meat and Livestock Commission, the British meat industry's promotion and
market monitoring agency, has set up a joint venture partnership with the
Scottish Agricultural College to provide genetic and breeding advice to
livestock farmers.
The company, which is to be called Signet Farm Business Consultancy, will
begin trading in January next year. It also plans to build on the college's
expertise to offer business consultancy services to farmers.
The venture will include breeding programmes that are already being offered
separately by the commission and the college.
Mr Peter Redshaw, chairman of the new venture, explained: 'The company will
enable us to operate more efficiently and offer an improved service to
farmers'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extended quota roll-over
opposed at Opec meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition emerged yesterday to Saudi Arabia's proposal that the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries rolls over its production
ceiling for the whole of 1995.
Delegates meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali said Kuwait would oppose
the plan when ministers met today to discuss various extensions of 24.52m
barrels a day production ceiling, which has been in force since September
last year.
The Kuwaitis are said to question whether the Saudi proposal would lead to
lasting price increases. They favour a six-month roll-over, a position that
Saudi Arabia also supported as late as last week but dropped in a surprise
move at the weekend.
The Kuwaitis believe the six-month option would give ministers full freedom
to decide next June whether market conditions warranted making changes to
the ceiling.
It is also likely to be credible to international oil markets, according to
Kuwaiti officials.
Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer accounting for about a third of total
output, believes a one-year roll-over would send a strong positive signal to
oil markets.
There were suggestions yesterday, however, that Saudi Arabia was prepared to
be flexible and might agree to modify its proposal if other member states
voiced strong opposition.
An alternative approach could include a commitment to a one-year extension,
with the proviso that ministers would have the option to review the ceiling
and individual national quotas at the June meeting.
Kuwait is believed, however, to be adamant that a six month roll-over would
be sufficient.
Proponents of the one-year option say it would reduce the possibility of an
acrimonious meeting in June over output levels and quotas, the most
troublesome topics for Opec.
Other items on today's agenda include discussions on a successor to Dr
Subroto, the Indonesian Secretary-General who stepped down last June.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease in wake of auction
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

US Treasury prices were down slightly yesterday after a relatively positive
auction of two-year notes.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at
92 27/32 yielding 8.135 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 11/32 , yielding 7.223 per cent.
With little economic news to be released this week, Wall Street looked to
yesterday's auction and an auction of five-year notes today for a measure of
investor sentiment. Few expect the market to shed its generally bearish
outlook, but traders were for the most part pleased with the modest demand
shown for the two-year notes. Uncertainty in the market and a spread of
about 120 basis points above the Federal funds rate helped make the
shorter-term notes attractive.
Volumes are expected to be extremely low all week, however, as traders and
investors take the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The market will close
at 2pm on both Wednesday and Friday.
Also, the market has already begun to look forward to an additional increase
in the target Fed funds rate. Although the Federal Reserve boosted the rate
by a greater-than-expected 75 basis point last week, the language of the
communique announcing the increase left open the possibility of another
near-term increase. The market seems convinced that inflationary pressures
will warrant a higher target rate.
The UK government bond market was largely unmoved by an October non-EU trade
deficit which was larger than expected. The trade gap was Pounds 410m
compared with forecasts of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 275m.
In late trading the December long gilt future moved up  5/32 of a point to
trade about 102 1/2 . The yield spread over bunds had widened out slightly
by 2 basis points to about 120.
Mr Stephen Dulake at PaineWebber in London said some underperformance of
gilts was inevitable after their strong showing last week. He said that
strong GDP data released on Friday meant 'an interest rate rise is on the
cards'.
German government bonds shifted up in lacklustre trading as investors waited
for the money supply figures due out this week. The December bund futures
contract traded at around 90.10 late in the day, a rise of 0.24 of a point,
which Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody attributed to technical trading
before holidays in Japan on Wednesday and the US on Thursday.
Italian government bonds were unmoved despite the unpopularity of pension
reform as evidenced by the poor showing of Mr Berlusconi's party in local
elections. Mr Dulake at PaineWebber said any support for the market was
largely domestic.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: EVC shares at premium on
Amsterdam debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shares of EVC, western Europe's largest manufacturer of polyvinyl
chloride, rose to a premium in their first day of trading in Amsterdam
following a successful international equity issue.
ICI of the UK and Enichem of Italy each sold 35 per cent stakes, raising a
total of Fl 800m, including Fl 100m through the exercise of a so-called
greenshoe option. A greenshoe option allows underwriters to compensate for
any variance in an offering's price. ICI and Enichem retain 15 per cent
minority interests.
The shares, initially priced at Fl 77, closed yesterday at Fl 78.10, up Fl
1.10.
Two European banks - SG Warburg and UBS - were joint global co-ordinators
for the deal, and sold the shares through 'book-building'.
Although UK companies have sometimes sold US subsidiaries through this
method, the technique has rarely been used for the sale of domestic or
European units.
Forty per cent of the new equity was raised from investors in the US, 20 per
cent from continental Europe and 40 per cent from the UK and the rest of the
world.
Warburg said that the issue was well received in ths US, where investors see
EVC as a strong cyclical play.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Further wave of short-dated eurodollar
offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong investor demand for US dollar-denominated bonds prompted
another wave of short-dated eurodollar offerings yesterday.
The dollar sector has witnessed a flurry of activity since last week's
higher-than-expected rise in US short-term interest rates by three-quarters
of a point to 5.5 per cent.
'European investors now believe the process of monetary tightening in the US
is nearing an end, and with US Treasuries weakening despite the rise,
investors now see good value in the US market,' said one trader.
Confidence in the sector is also being supported by a belief that the dollar
is set to appreciate against the yen and D-Mark, traders said.
Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, the financing arm of Toyota's operations in
the US, launched a Dollars 250m offering of three-year bonds, which was
greeted with very strong demand, lead manager Paribas said.
'This was exactly what the market wanted. There are no triple-A rated
corporate names out there at the moment offering such an attractive coupon,'
a Paribas official said.
The bonds offered a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent and maintained their initial
launch spread of 14 basis points above US government bonds after the bonds
were freed to trade.
Paribas expects a large part of the offering to be placed with Swiss retail
accounts although there was also strong demand from retail investors in
Germany and the Benelux countries and from UK institutional accounts.
The proceeds from the offering were swapped into floating-rate dollars.
Both UBS Finance and SBC Finance reopened earlier offerings due to the
strong investor demand for dollar assets. SBC launched a Dollars 100m
offering of seven-year bonds priced to yield three basis points above US
Treasuries. UBS launched a Dollars 100 offering - later increased to Dollars
250m - of two-year bonds, priced level with US Treasuries.
'We saw constant buying in the Swiss retail network of the original issue,
driving the price in the secondary market down to 10 basis points through
Treasuries,' a UBS syndicate official said. The bonds had been launched at
five basis points over US Treasuries.
Also in the two-year dollar sector, Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten launched a
Dollars 200m bond offering, priced to yield two basis points over US
Treasuries. Mainly targeted at Swiss and Benelux retail investors, the bonds
also found firm demand from UK institutions, lead manager JP Morgan said.
The proceeds were swapped into guilders, market sources said.
In the the sterling sector, Deutsche Bank Finance launched a Pounds 100m
offering of two-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over German
government bonds.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday assigned a B+
rating to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's planned first-ever eurobond.
The outlook on the country's foreign currency debt rating is positive, S&amp;P
said.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: East Midlands deal shows
pricing trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The keenly-priced Pounds 350m syndicated loan for East Midlands Electricity
was signed yesterday, highlighting the trend to cheaper lending caused by
intense competition among banks.
The five-year loan, arranged by Chemical Bank, was priced at 15 basis points
over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) which other loan syndicates
regarded as unprofitably low. They suggested that finance for the UK
regional utility could not be raised, and one said at the time: 'This may be
a deal too far.'
However, Chemical Bank said yesterday that European, non-European and
Japanese banks had joined the deal.
Pricing levels for syndicated loans have fallen this year as banks have
fought aggressively for assets while borrowers remain wary of debts. This
has pushed prices of loans close to the level of bonds and the Swedish
government, the biggest borrower on the world's bond market, has turned to a
syndicated loan for a Dollars 5bn five-year financing to replace existing
debts. Citibank and JP Morgan are currently arranging syndication of that
loan, which is priced at 8 basis points over Libor.
One banker said: 'Sweden is getting a fantastic deal.'
Further evidence of competition among banks driving down prices for loans
came when Chemical Bank arranged a keenly-priced Pounds 500m five-year
syndicated loan signed last week for National Power, the UK power generator.
That deal was priced at 17 basis points over Libor and National Power said
the loan was oversubscribed with 25 banks prepared to lend it a total of
Pounds 1bn, double the amount required.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: SFE to appeal against ruling
on new 'option'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Sydney Futures Exchange is to appeal against a recent Federal Court
ruling which permitted the Australian Stock Exchange to trade 'low exercise
price options' (LEPOs), a new type of derivative which the SFE claims is
essentially a futures contract.
The SFE's move is the latest development in a long-running battle between
the two exchanges over who should be allowed to run the market for
individual share futures. The SFE introduced futures contracts on individual
shares in May, becoming the first exchange worldwide to do so. However, the
ASX countered with LEPOs, very deep 'in the money' call options.
The SFE then mounted a legal challenge, stating that these amounted to
futures contracts, and hence could not be traded on the ASX. Under
Australian corporations law, there is a strict divide between the exchanges'
territories - with the ASX allowed to trade securities and the SFE, futures.
Earlier this month, a Federal Court judge sided with the ASX.
However, yesterday Mr Les Hosking, the SFE's chief executive, reasserted the
exchange's belief that LEPOs 'are, in reality, futures contracts . . . they
function as a futures contract, have the risk profile of a futures contract
and should be regulated as a futures contract'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mario Brothers' maker warns of
weakened profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mario Brothers are feeling the pressure, according to a forecast of a
sharp profits decline this year from the computer-game characters' creator,
Nintendo.
Japan's largest maker of computer games yesterday warned that recurring
profits - before tax and extraordinary items - would fall 9.6 per cent to
Y104bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in the year to next March. Sales would be down 27.2
per cent to Y340bn over the same period, it said. The yen's strength has
squeezed margins on the some 50 per cent of sales Nintendo makes abroad,
while European markets have been hit by price-discounting and a fall in
demand.
Nintendo's report for the first half of the year showed a fall in recurring
profits of 16.4 per cent to Y51bn, in line with market expectations. Sales
declined even faster, by 36.2 per cent to to Y166bn.
Nintendo's forecast is less gloomy than the outlook last week from its
rival, Sega. Unlike Nintendo, it is exposed to the amusement hall trade,
where business has been as poor as in computer games.
Like its rival, Nintendo is pinning its hopes on a new generation of
products to stimulate flagging demand for computer games. These include a
16-bit game, Super Donkey Kong, a version of an existing Nintendo line with
new graphics, to be released shortly. A 32-bit hand-held game called Virtual
Boy is due out in April.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kyocera improves at operating
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant demand for cellular telephones and electronic components supported
an 8 per cent increase in consolidated sales at Kyocera, the world's largest
maker of ceramic packages and electronic parts.
Kyocera, whose broad product range also includes microprocessors, karaoke
equipment and artificial bones, enjoyed a 27 per cent rise in operating
profits in the first six months of the fiscal year, to Y26.8bn (Dollars
292.3m) from a previous Y21.1bn, on sales higher at Y228.9bn from Y211.2bn.
However, recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - slid 24
per cent to Y33.1bn compared with Y43.5bn last year. The year-ago figures
were boosted by gains from the listing of DDI, the telecommunications
company in which Kyocera owns 22 per cent, and a share offering from two
companies in which Kyocera is a leading shareholder. Net profits were also
down by 19 per cent to Y18.6bn from Y23bn because of last year's gains.
During the latest period, Kyocera benefited from the surge in world
semiconductor markets, which supported rising demand for its components. As
a result, sales in the fine ceramics division rose 12 per cent.
Electronic components sales climbed 2 per cent on the back of strong sales
to the PC and mobile telephone markets.
Surging demand in the domestic cellular telephones market since
liberalisation in April also boosted the company. In addition, the
popularity of its karaoke equipment combined to lift sales in the
electronics equipment division by 9 per cent.
The company is forecasting a 14 per cent rise in parent sales to Y344bn in
the full year; a 43 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y50bn; and a
21 per cent rise in net profits to Y26.8bn.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moving to right Jakarta's
lop-sided stock market - The government wants to encourage local investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and MANUEL SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something lop-sided about Indonesia's fast-growing stock market.
While local investors own most of the shares in listed companies, foreigners
do most of the trading, accounting for as much as 80 per cent of turnover.
The problem is not uncommon in Asia, but it is particularly acute in
Indonesia, where the share-owning middle class remains relatively small and
the richest individuals tend to hold a high proportion of their assets
offshore. Indonesian officials acknowledge that, as in other countries of
the region, they badly need to develop a broad domestic base of
institutional investors if the capital market is to play a full role in
financing the country's economic and infrastructure development.
The authorities plan to introduce two changes which they hope will propel
the market into the modern world. A new securities law, currently in the
final stages of draft, should allow for tighter regulatory supervision when
it takes effect next year. In a move which must make the London Stock
Exchange blush over its Taurus fiasco - the planned paperless system
abandoned last year - Jakarta is preparing to have fully-automated trading
when it moves to new premises in early 1995.
Though the two moves are not directly connected, the authorities hope both
will enhance market liquidity and broaden the domestic investor base. The
stock exchange reckons automated trading will enable it to handle up to
50,000 transactions a day compared with the current 3,800. Tighter
regulation should improve market integrity and pave the way for greater
institutional participation.
Brokers agree that the market - already capitalised at more than Dollars
50bn - is set to grow exponentially. Daily trading volume has tripled to
Dollars 47m in the last two years. 'We think that volume is going to grow
ten-fold in the next four (years),' says Mr Anthony Davies of Baring
Securities. But there remains scepticism about the direct impact of the new
securities law.
So far, only the outlines are known. Mr Bacelius Ruru, chairman of the
capital markets supervisory agency in charge of the draft, says the law will
reinforce existing bans on insider trading and share manipulation by giving
his agency the power of subpoena and search. It will also tighten standards
of disclosure, particularly of material change in a company's fortunes.
Mr Ruru says he is determined to use the law to raise standards of integrity
in the market, even if it makes him unpopular. 'Once the law is effective,
we will have no other choice but to carry it out,' he says. Automated
trading will also increase the transparency of the market, making it easier
to detect abuse, he says.
Brokers say it remains to be seen how much things change in practice in a
country with a financial system still dominated by vested interests. Other
Asian countries which have introduced similar improvements in regulation
have witnessed only a slow reduction in share-price volatility. It is also
unclear how far the law will go in forcing full disclosure of directors'
dealings and in setting a minimum amount of shares which must be made
available to the public in any flotation.
In the view of many brokers, it is the lack of any ruling in the latter area
that makes for the greatest barrier to liquidity. Says Mr Ruru: 'I appeal to
issuers. Please, you have to float more shares, not just a token.'
However, as in many markets at this early stage of development, such a
suggestion is contentious with company owners worried about loss of control.
Moreover, many would like the authorities to go further and drop the 49 per
cent limit on the portion of a floated company which may be owned by
foreigners. This further restricts liquidity, they argue. Though there are
indications that the regulatory authority is sympathetic to such a move, it
could only be decided at the highest political level.
As evidence of their determination to increase liquidity, the authorities
have, however, scrapped capital gains tax on securities transactions from
next January, and plan to permit the launch of open-ended investment trusts
under the new law. They are also talking about using the market automation
to reduce the minimum lot. This is currently at 500 shares, which means the
smallest transaction in the recent Indosat issue would be more than Dollars
3m.
Mr Ruru hopes such measures will attract pension funds out of bank deposits
and into equities, and that wealthy Chinese investors, traditionally the
main players in the equity market, will repatriate funds from abroad. One
way or another the interest of domestic investors has to be nurtured, given
the huge supply of stock that looms over the next few years.
The government has already announced three privatisations - the telecoms
group Telkom, the PLN electricity company and the Jasa Marga toll road - to
follow Indosat. Further down the road, large issues from the state airline
Garuda and the oil company Pertamina are expected. At some point, the market
will have reached the size where tighter regulation has to be enforced, if
it has become sufficiently robust to absorb so much new paper. That point
has not yet been reached, even among foreign investors who are sticklers for
proper behaviour at home.
Few foreigners complain about the current situation, where company results
may be dribbled into the market as much as six weeks before any official
announcement. 'They just gravitate to the brokers who are best informed,'
says one smirking analyst.

Amalgamated Banks of South Africa, the biggest and most troubled of South
Africa's leading banking groups, has reported a 16.6 per cent rise in
pre-tax profit to R610.7m (Dollars 173m) for the six months to the end of
September, up from R523.9m for the same period last year.
Net interest income rose 8.2 per cent to R1.98bn from R1.83bn, while the
provision for bad and doubtful loans dropped 6 per cent to R262.7m from
R279.4m.
However, attributable income rose only 10.7 per cent to R337.9m from
R305.3m, largely due to a 21.5 per cent rise in tax paid, to R280.5m from
R262.7m previously.
Loans rose 12.5 per cent to R75.2bn from R66.9bn, reflecting an improvement
in the core banking sector. This helped boost total assets to R91.4bn from
R84.3bn, a rise of 8.4 per cent.
However, the share of associated companies' retained income dropped sharply
to R7.7m from R12.3m, largely because of continued difficulties in the
short-term insurance market.
Earnings per share rose 10.7 per cent to 59.7 cents from 54 cents, but the
dividend was only increased 8.8 per cent to 18.5 cents. This means the
payout is covered 3.2 times, consistent with the group's goal of a
consistent dividend cover of three times.
Although the results continue to lag ABSA's main competitors, analysts say
they represent a significant improvement on the last two years, when rivals
gained market share from ABSA as it struggled to integrate its constituent
parts following mergers in 1991 and 1992.
Foschini, the South African clothing and jewellery retailer, has announced a
26.2 per cent rise in attributable earnings to R67.2m for the six months to
the end of September, up from R53.29m previously.
Pre-tax income also rose by 26.2 per cent to R111.5m from R88.3m, reflecting
a 28.5 per cent rise in turnover.

<TEXT>
Australis, the Australian company which has pledged to become the country's
first supplier of pay-TV services next year, announced yesterday it had
reached agreement with three Hollywood studios for a supply of films to air
on its two movie channels.
Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Universal Pictures/MCA
have entered the partnership with TCI, the US cable company which already
has an investment in Australis. The link-up, in which all parties have an
equal share, will have exclusive Australian rights to the studios' output
and libraries for five and a half years. There will be an option to extend
this agreement for a further five years after that.
The movies will feed two of the channels which Australis proposes to launch
next year: one will be for first-run films and the other for films released
over the past three decades. The two channels will be run by a TCI affiliate
at the outset, and then be transfered to Australis 'after the start-up
phase'.
The Australian company said it had agreed to allot the studios options to
acquire Australis convertible debentures at ADollars 1.40 each. The options,
which are exercisable within 27 months, will not exceed 10 per cent of the
company's convertible debenture stock. It has also agreed to allot 875,000
shares each to TCI and Mr Gerry Lenfest, head of the company through which
TCI's Australis stake is held. The price will be ADollars 1.33.
Australis, a new company running only small-scale narrow-cast subscription
services at present, holds one of the two commercially-available satellite
licences in Australia, and has said it will start offering pay-TV services
from the beginning of 1995.
However, some of the country's established media players - such as Mr Rupert
Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer - have recently signed alliances with
telecommunications companies developing rival cable networks.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Battle begins for Spanish
telecoms prize - Bids for licence to operate a second GSM mobile service
open today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final countdown in one of the biggest corporate contests to be held in
Spain will begin today. Under television lights and closely watched by some
of the bigger names of Spanish business and the international telecoms
community, Mr Jose Borrell, minister for public works, transport and
telecommunications, will open two bulky envelopes.
The envelopes will contain rival bids for a mobile telephony licence, the
first significant incursion into the highly-regulated and monopoly-run
Spanish telecommunications industry. The licence will be awarded before the
end of this year.
After examining the bids, Mr Borrell will give one of the two rival
consortia the go-ahead to develop a second pan-European GSM (global system
of mobile communications) digital network to compete with the one to be
installed by Telefonica, the large government-controlled telecoms group.
The prize is substantial. The betting is on start-up figures that, including
the initial cash fee to the government, will be upwards of Pta200bn (Dollars
1.5bn).
Initial investment for the network - which, under the terms of the tender,
must offer GSM coverage for all Spanish cities of more than 10,000
inhabitants within five years - will be at least Pta100bn.
As for the opponents, in one corner is a group called SRM. It is headed by
Mr Jordi Mercader, a former chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Industria
(INI), the public-sector conglomerate, and has the UK's Vodafone as its
principal operator.
In the other corner stands Airtel-Sistelcom-Reditel (ASR), headed by Mr
Eduardo Serra, a former senior INI executive who went on to become junior
defence minister. This group is backed by AirTouch, the US telecoms group.
Vodafone has a 23 per cent stake in Cometa-SRM and AirTouch has a 16 per
cent holding in ASR.
Spain, with a mature basic telephony base, lags comparable economies in the
mobile business. Mr Borrell claims he is setting Spain on a deregulation
course. Once he has decided which second operator is to deliver a mobile
service, the minister will introduce legislation that will both create, and
liberalise, the cable television business in Spain. He also promises that
basic telephony will be liberalised by 1998, with the award of a licence to
the private sector.
All eyes - and a lot of money - are now focused on the mobile telephone
contest and on the referee's role that Mr Borrell undertakes today.
But even before the bids are opened, the contest has its critics. The chief
criticism is that the government has distorted the competition with its own
greed; the two consortia are being forced to bid above an initial expensive
opening price set by Mr Borrell.
Mr Borrell's department has said a minimum of Pta50bn 5) must be delivered
in advance to obtain the GSM licence.
The rival bidders are likely to come close to doubling that sum.
'I'd be surprised if the winning cash bid is not close to Pta100bn,' says Mr
Fernando Pardo, a partner of Price Waterhouse in Madrid and the consultancy
firm's local telecommunications expert.
The government is clearly anxious to earn as much as possible from the
second licence in order to lower its public deficit.
It is also, according to critics, placing an exceptionally high burden on
those bidding for the second licence in order to defend Telefonica.
A clear consequence of such an attitude is that the cost of the contest has
crowded out several domestic companies. If the government wanted to
encourage a wide network of Spanish enterprises to invest in the
telecommunications sector, it has singularly failed to do so; only a reduced
contingent of blue chip companies remain in the second licence contest.
Mr Borrell, when awarding the licence, will be looking at which of the rival
bids offers most in terms of job creation; which would offer additional
industrial investment unconnected with the mobile business; and which puts a
premium on Spanish-based research and development, as opposed to imported
technology.
'The driving force (of the tender) is the creation of a good GSM system for
the country,' maintains Mr Claudio Boada, managing director in Spain of the
US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which is advising the transport and
communications ministry over the award.
Telefonica, which already operates an analog cellular phone network, expects
to earn Pta40bn from 400,000 subscribers this year. Price Waterhouse
confidently expects that the mobile business will have 2m users with the
development of GSM by 1998 and that the market will be worth Pta210bn by
that date.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the big guns in Spanish banking have
lined up behind the two consortia. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) has taken a 30
per cent stake in Cometa-SRM; Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano,
(BCH) share a 27 per cent holding in ASR. Argentaria, the state-controlled
financial group and the other of Spain's big four high-street banks, is
understood to be backing Telefonica's GSM venture.
The other shareholders in the two consortia constitute a revealing list of
who has financial muscle in Spain and a willingness to bet on new
technology. Barcelona's La Caixa, the biggest domestic savings bank, is
behind the Cometa-SRM bid, while five middle-ranking regional savings
institutions have teamed to back ASR. The big electrical utilities, Endesa,
Iberdrola and Sevillana, have sided with Cometa-SRM, while the smaller Fecsa
and Union Fenosa utilities support ASR.
But just as interesting is the roll-call of those who avoided the contest.
Both consortia suffered last minute withdrawals.
Among the big names that pulled out were Repsol, the government-controlled
oil, chemical and gas group; El Corte Ingles, the cash-rich retail store
group; and Prisa, the leading multimedia company which publishes the
newspaper El Pais.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mexico waits for OECD borrowing
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico, which was admitted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development last April, has yet to enjoy one of the important fruits of
membership.
Because of a little-noticed rule change agreed by international bank
supervisors in Basle in July, Mexico has to be treated as a non-OECD country
by banks and securities traders. This means they must set aside more capital
than for other OECD member countries when they lend to the Mexican
government and Mexican banks, and when they hold their securities
Previously, the rules defined the so-called Zone A countries - those
benefiting from the most generous capital treatment - as members of the
OECD.
The July decision from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision meant that
Zone A now 'excludes any country within the group which has rescheduled its
external sovereign debt in the previous five years.'
Mexico, the only member in that category, signed a debt restructuring
agreement in March 1990, which means it should enter Zone A in March 1995.
This should help lower the cost of borrowing and of issuing short-term
securities and eurobonds by the government, public-sector entities and
banks.
'Other things being equal, this change is likely to increase the demand for
Mexican sovereign risk by reducing the cost of carrying Mexican assets. This
would lead to some compression of Mexico's credit spreads,' said Mr David
Lubin of HSBC Markets in London. The shift will mean a zero-risk weighting -
that is, no capital has to be set aside - for claims against the Mexican
government or its central bank.
The risk weighting for short-term government securities and floating-rate
notes issued in foreign currency drops to 10 per cent, while that on
eurobonds, claims on banks and public sector entities drops to 20 per cent.
Previously the risk weighting on all Mexican entities was 100 per cent,
implying 8 per cent of the value of the claim had to be set aside in
capital. Claims on Mexican corporate entities will remain unchanged at 100
per cent.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aids drug lifts BioChem shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of BioChem Pharma, the Montreal-based pharmaceuticals group, rose
strongly yesterday following reports that a drug discovered by the company
has contributed to promising results in combating Aids, writes Bernard
Simon.
BioChem is 17 per cent owned by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group which
has the licence to develop and market the drug, known as 3TC.
Clinical trial results, which were released at a conference in Glasgow,
Scotland, last weekend, indicated that 3TC, in combination with rival UK
pharmaceuticals group Wellcome's AZT drug, sharply reduces the level of the
HIV virus, which causes Aids.
BioChem's shares closed at CDollars 17 1/4 on the Toronto stock exchange
yesterday, up 9 per cent.
The company said yesterday it had renewed its development and marketing
agreement with Glaxo.
Under the agreement, BioChem will receive royalties based on sales.

<TEXT>
Caparo, the UK-based industrial group controlled by Mr Swaraj Paul, the
prominent expatriate Indian industrialist, and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia
have sought approval from India's government to set up a jointly-owned bank.
The new bank, which will provide a full range of retail and commercial
services, is expected to have an initial capital of about USDollars 100m.
Mr Peter Godsoe, Scotiabank's chief executive, said the partners hoped to
obtain official clearance 'relatively early in the new year'. The venture is
the latest in a series of moves by foreign financial institutions to take
advantage of India's economic reform programme.
The UK's National Westminster Bank recently unveiled plans to buy a 20 per
cent stake in HDFC Bank, which is promoted by India's Housing Development
Financing Corp.
Scotiabank, which has the most international ties of Canada's 'Big Six'
banks, last week opened its second branch in India. Its business there has
so far comprised mainly trade and shipping finance.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black ink leaves Canadian banks
red-faced - Profits at the 'Big Six' are likely to be almost too good this
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most inhibited public company can usually be relied on to trumpet
record earnings. Not Canada's 'Big Six' banks, which today start their
annual reporting season for the fiscal year to October 31.
Several of the banks are expected to announce the highest profits in their
history. Royal Bank of Canada, the biggest, is almost certain to become the
first Canadian financial institution to post annual earnings of more than
CDollars 1bn (USDollars 730m).
Yet the banks want to make their performance seem as unexceptional as
possible. In an internal memo, Royal Bank suggests that its public relations
department should encourage the media to 'look beyond the total dollar
amount and use standard financial measures of profitability like return on
assets, return on equity and return on business to realise our profits are
very reasonable'.
According to Mr Peter Godsoe, Bank of Nova Scotia's chief executive: 'If
there is a problem, it's probably that things look too good.'
The banks' sensitivity is understandable. Often portrayed as corporate fat
cats, the Big Six have not merely improved their financial performance over
the past two years, but have tightened their grip on Canada's financial
services industry.
Deregulation in 1987 opened the door for each of the banks to buy an
interest in a large securities dealer.
Mr Alan Hibben, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, estimates
that securities subsidiaries contributed 9.7 per cent of total bank profits
in the second quarter of fiscal 1994, and about 5.4 per cent in the third
quarter.
The banks have also become powerful forces in the mutual-fund industry.
Royal Bank is Canada's second-biggest mutual-funds distributor.
Although they took heavy write-downs during the 1990-92 recession, the
bigger problems suffered by other institutions have given the banks an
opportunity to spread their wings.
They picked up the pieces of the imploding trust and loan industry, which
was unable to withstand the slump in the North American real estate market.
Most recently, several banks have begun to move into insurance after the
collapse of Confederation Life, Canada's fifth-biggest life insurance
company, offered a cheap entry into the sector.
Business conditions have improved dramatically in the past 18 months. In
contrast to the difficult days of 1990-92, the banks now have the wind
behind them.
'The economy is doing well, inflation is low, companies are producing
profits which reduce loan-losses, and retail borrowings have been relatively
strong,' Mr Godsoe says. 'Banking across the board in Canada is a pretty
good business right now.'
The banks are also benefiting from closer attention to costs. Royal Bank,
for instance, cut its payroll by 7 per cent and closed 132 branches and
other offices in the first nine months of 1994.
The outlook for the year ahead is more of the same. Canada's economy is set
to grow by about 3.5 per cent, and loan-loss provisions charged against
income will almost certainly be lower in 1995 than in 1994.
Although real estate remains a headache, most of the banks' other problems -
notably the forest-products industry - are receding.
Mr Hibben estimates that Bank of Nova Scotia will more than double earnings
to CDollars 3.60 a share in fiscal 1995.
He expects that Bank of Montreal, which will be first out of the blocks
today with its 1994 earnings report, will lift earnings per share to
CDollars 3.25 from CDollars 2.82.
There is one wrinkle in these rosy forecasts, however. The loosening of
ownership barriers and other regulatory curbs is gradually eroding the
monolithic facade of the Canadian banking industry.
Instead of marching in lockstep, as they tended to do in the past, the banks
are each carving out a character of their own.
Royal has put the emphasis on personal financial services, mainly through
its purchase last year of foundering Royal Trust, the second-biggest trust
company.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has made the most energetic moves
away from traditional lending to investment banking.
Through a fast-expanding presence in New York, CIBC is aiming to join the
top league of players in international derivatives markets.
Bank of Montreal is the only Canadian bank with a strong full-service
presence in the US, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp of
Chicago.
BoM aims to expand its mid-West base to the point where half its total
earnings come from the US. Last month, it became the first Canadian bank to
list on the New York stock exchange.
Alone among the Canadian banks, Bank of Nova Scotia sees a future in the
emerging markets of Latin America and Asia. Through acquisitions and joint
ventures, it has secured footholds in the Philippines, Chile, Mexico,
Malaysia and, most recently, Argentina and India.
As these divergent strategies take hold over time, the individual banks'
performance may vary more widely. Some may even have cause to celebrate
their achievements without a red face.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Friendly Amgen approach wins
Synergen's support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Binder, chairman of Amgen, is clear about why the biggest US
biotechnology company is not about to succumb to an unwanted takeover.
'There's never been an unfriendly takeover in the biotech industry. It's
never been attempted, let alone succeeded,' he said in an interview earlier
this year.
Friendly takeovers, though, are very much in fashion - and last week Mr
Binder himself conjured up one of the biggest yet. On Friday, Amgen said it
had reached agreement to pay Dollars 240m in cash for Synergen, a
Colorado-based company.
The lack of hostile takeovers, according to Mr Binder, is due to the fact
that the success of biotech companies is built on a relatively small number
of people: a hostile bid could alienate these people, destroying the value
of the company being acquired.
It is not difficult to see why Amgen's approach to buy Synergen won the
support of the company. At Dollars 9 1/4 a share, its offer was about 70 per
cent higher than the stock market's valuation of the company.
Yet even that is only about one-eighth of the peak hit by Synergen's share
price in 1992. It fell from grace in early 1993, though, on the failure of
its most promising drug, Antril, a treatment for sepsis.
The acquisition will boost Amgen's pipeline of new products under
development with Synergen's own range of cancer, inflammation and
neurobiology drugs under development.
The deal should help to counter doubts expressed by some analysts about the
scarcity of new products due from Amgen in the near term. In spite of Mr
Binder's protestations, these doubts have helped to turn Amgen itself into a
potential takeover target, in part explaining a rise in the company's share
price from a low in April of less than Dollars 40 to its close yesterday at
Dollars 56 3/4 , close to a 12-month high.
Amgen has this year maintained a high rate of revenue growth. Third-quarter
revenues reached Dollars 426m, while full-year sales are expected to rise
some 20 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn.

Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group, has acquired a 64 per cent
stake in Flexible Holding of the US for an undisclosed sum. The US company
makes flexible packaging and multi-layer blown film, and has annual sales of
about ADollars 55m (USDollars 41.6m).
The move is the latest in a series of acquisitions by Amcor aimed at
building up its containers and packaging divisions. Earlier this month, it
announced plans to buy RIG Rentsch, a Swiss-based folding carton packaging
business.

Isetan, a leading Japanese department store, posted a sharp rise in interim
recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - as a result of
cost-cutting, including a reduction of advertising and transportation
spending.
Recurring profits for the first six months to September rose 43 per cent to
Y935m (Dollars 9.5m).
Sales, however, fell 2.6 per cent to Y195.4bn, and Isetan officials said
purchase value per customer continued to decline.
After-tax profits jumped 103.8 per cent to Y463m.
Sales of clothing fell 2.3 per cent to Y90bn while food sales declined 2.4
per cent to Y35.5bn.
Sales to corporate customers fell 7 per cent from the previous year.
For the full year to next March, Isetan expects current profits to rise 26.8
per cent to Y5.5bn, the first increase in four years.
Sales are expected to fall 1.9 per cent to Y413bn and after-tax profits are
seen declining 52.2 per cent to Y2.4bn.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: MCI launches service to provide

<TEXT>
MCI, the US long-distance telephone company, has launched a service to
provide easy and secure access to the Internet, a global network of
computers with an estimated 25m-30m users.
'InternetMCI' services will include an electronic shopping mall, Netscape
Communication's Internet browser software and high-speed network connections
to the Internet.
'MCI is making the Internet as easy to use, as accessible and as critical to
businesses as today's global phone network,' said Mr Timothy Price,
president of MCI's business markets arm. 'Businesses of all sizes will now
be able to sell their goods and services over the Internet,' he said.
Leading telephone companies in the US and Europe are expected to launch
similar services over the next few months, according to Mr Jim Clark,
chairman of Netscape Communications, which develops software for the
Internet. This will lead to a huge expansion in the use of the Internet for
electronic commerce, he says.
'By the year 2000, MCI expects commerce on the Internet will exceed Dollars
2bn and be as common as catalogue shopping is today,' said Mr Price.
Another venture addressing the emerging market for electronic shopping was
announced yesterday by Apple Computer, the PC manufacturer, America Online,
an on-line service provider and Medior, a small software company.
The companies have formed a joint venture called 2Market, to deliver
multimedia CD-Rom and on-line shopping catalogues.
By 1998, commercial on-line services will reach an estimated 19m
subscribers, says Forrester Research, a market research firm. On-line
shopping on these subscriber networks are expected to generate about Dollars
5bn in revenues, market analysts predict.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ciba boosts Chiron stake to
49.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba, the Swiss drug company, yesterday made the biggest corporate
acquisition in biotechnology for almost five years with a deal which lifts
its stake in California-based Chiron to 49.9 per cent.
The deal, which values Chiron at Dollars 4.2bn, gives Ciba access to
Chiron's strong research and development programme and a range of products
in areas including diagnostics and ophthalmology.
It strengthens Chiron's finances and marks the end of an era for the
13-year-old company, one of the most successful in biotechnology and the
only large one in the sector with its founding management still in place.
The deal, finalised over the weekend, 'is our response to fundamental
changes in healthcare', said Mr Heini Lippuner, Ciba's chief operating
officer. He said drug company profits were under pressure from governments
keen to cut healthcare costs. Other companies had responded by purchasing
drug-maker or distribution networks. However, Ciba had found no suitable
candidates in its areas of expertise and had therefore chosen the Chiron
deal.
Mr Dennis Winger, Chiron's chief financial officer, said the deal 'brought
financial stability' to his company, in which Ciba already had a stake of
about 4 per cent.
Chiron's product sales for the first nine months of 1994 were Dollars
187.7m, compared with Dollars 147.9m for the whole of 1993 and less than
Dollars 40m in 1988.
Under the terms of the deal, Ciba will make a tender offer for 11.9m Chiron
shares - 37.3 per cent of the company - at Dollars 117 each. The price is
above the Dollars 100 a share that analysts last week suggested Ciba would
be prepared to pay.
Chiron's share price rose Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 80 1/4 .
Chiron will also issue 6.6m new shares to Ciba in return for the Ciba
Corning Diagnostics business and the half of Biocine, a vaccine joint
venture set up between the two companies in 1986, that it does not own.
Ciba will guarantee Dollars 425m of new debt for Chiron and invest up to
Dollars 250m, repayable in cash or shares, in research and development over
five years.
Chiron's president, Mr Bill Rutter, will be invited to join Ciba's main
board of directors.
Mr Sam Isaly of New York researchers Mehta and Isaly said the transaction
would reduce Ciba's earnings per share by 4 per cent in 1995.
The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions of US assets by Swiss
drugs companies. Earlier this year Roche paid Dollars 5.3bn for Californian
pharmaceuticals company Syntex, while Sandoz paid Dollars 3.7bn for food
company Gerber.
The US biotechnology sector has seen a lot of activity this year.
A series of small deals culminated last week with the Dollars 258m
acquisition by Amgen, the world's largest bio-technology company, of
Colorado's Synergen.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rockwell wins battle for
Reliance Electric
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bid battle for Reliance Electric, the US electronics company, has been
won with an increased offer from Rockwell International of Dollars 31 a
share, valuing Reliance at Dollars 1.6bn. The offer, raised from an initial
Dollars 30, capped an agreed bid from rival manufacturer General Signal.
Reliance must now pay General Signal a break-up fee of Dollars 50m, plus
Dollars 5.15m in expenses. In recent weeks, Rockwell had attempted various
legal approaches to have the fee waived, but without success.
The bid from General Signal, worth Dollars 1.3bn, had been expected to fail.
General Signal is a much smaller company than Rockwell, and its offer was in
paper rather than cash. Reliance's shares closed 50 cents higher yesterday
at Dollars 30.75.
Rockwell plans to merge Reliance with its Allen-Bradley division, creating a
worldwide industrial automation business with sales of about Dollars 3.5bn.
Rockwell plans to sell Reliance's telecommunications business, which made up
about a third of Reliance group sales last year.
Rockwell said yesterday the acquisition would bring its turnover to Dollars
12.6bn, of which over 70 per cent would come in commercial markets. As a
leading manufacturer of rockets and missiles, Rockwell has been hit by the
downturn in US defence spending and has been seeking to build up its
non-defence business.
Mr John Morley, Reliance's president, said: 'We believe that Dollars 31 per
share is a fair price and in the best interests of our shareholders.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: BancOne posts loss on securities
holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BancOne, one of the biggest US banks, yesterday announced a one-off
after-tax loss of Dollars 170m on its securities holdings, showing the
damage done to some banks' earnings from the rise in US interest rates since
February.
The bank said the loss stemmed from the sale of Dollars 5.7bn of fixed
income securities which have an average maturity of three years.
The Columbus, Ohio-based bank had been one of the most aggressive in its use
of fixed-rate instruments to lift earnings.
BancOne had used bonds and interest rate swaps to increase its fixed-income
earnings, while keeping a large portion of its liabilities tied to floating
interest rates. The policy enabled it to report one of the best net interest
margins of any US bank last year, but led to a contraction in earnings as
rates moved against it.
Shortly before US rates began to rise in February, BancOne estimated that a
gradual 1 percentage point increase in short-term rates over the following
12 months would reduce its earnings by 3.3 per cent. In the event, rates
have risen 2 1/2 percentage points since the first increase engineered by
the Federal Reserve on February 4.
Doubts about the wisdom of BancOne's interest rate policy have hung over its
share price for more than a year. Yesterday, Mr John McCoy, chairman, said:
'We are determined to take the necessary steps in 1994 to put the issue of
interest rate sensitivity behind us.' In addition, the bank said it would
take an after-tax charge of Dollars 65m to reflect restructuring costs. The
bank indicated it expected to cut 4,300 jobs by the end of next year.
Last week PNC, a regional bank based in Pittsburgh, said a
faster-than-expected rise in interest rates would reduce its net interest
income by about 7 per cent in the final three months of this year, and 15
per cent next year.

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thomson's consumer unit expects
FFr500m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson Consumer Electronics, a division of Thomson, the French state-owned
electronics group, expects to record a net loss of about FFr500m (Dollars
94.3m) this year, in spite of a sharp improvement in operating results,
according to Mr Alain Prestat, chairman.
Mr Prestat told Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that operating
profits for this year should rise to FFr600m, compared with FFr155m in 1993,
but the costs of financing a debt burden of about FFr10bn would pull the
company into loss. For 1995, Mr Prestat said the company was on target for
operating profits of FFr1bn.
The chairman indicated he might seek a capital injection to strengthen the
balance sheet. 'I have always been hostile to the idea of asking for a
capital injection to cover operating losses. But things can change when
these losses have disappeared.'
Mr Prestat described an upbeat scenario for the group's products. He cited
the success of Direct TV, the first digital television service broadcast by
satellite in the US, for which TCE supplies the reception kits.
The company aims to sell 360,000 kits this year and to double production
capacity to build 1.8m units in 1995. Mr Prestat said he hoped for similar
projects in Europe and Asia, from next year or 1996.
In multimedia, Mr Prestat raised the prospect of new partnerships.
In June, TCE concluded an alliance with Sun Microsystems, the US
workstations manufacturer. 'We don't exclude other partnerships, notably in
the field of telecommunications,' he said. But he said he did not envisage
allying with a personal computer manufacturer because the future home
terminal for multimedia would be the television rather than the computer.
He appeared sceptical about the prospect of a large investment for an
information superhighway, as spelled out in a report to the French
government by Mr Gerard Thery, the former managing director of France
Telecom.
The report calls for an investment of up to FFr200bn by 2015, with much of
the expenditure devoted to the development of a national fibre-optic cable
network.
The concept of a highway leads people to think of it in terms of
infrastructure, said Mr Prestat. 'I think, on the contrary, that we should
proceed by considering first the market. We must work on the interactive
services to study the needs and behaviour of consumers.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Incentive surges to SKr1.54bn
after sale of 43% Esab interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment company controlled by the
Wallenberg family, saw profits surge to SKr1.54bn (Dollars 210m) in the
first nine months, compared with SKr66m in the same 1993 period.
The figure, which excludes associated companies, was swollen by a SKr900m
capital gain from the sale of the company's 43 per cent stake in Esab, the
world's leading supplier of welding equipment, to Charter, the UK industrial
group, for SKr1.4bn.
The performance benefited from economic recovery, increased market shares,
and acquisitions. These helped to offset higher financial costs.
The group's purchase of Gambro, a medical equipment specialist, and
MacGregor-Navire, the world's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling
equipment, helped lift sales 49 per cent to SKr12.4bn. The underlying
increase was 12 per cent.
Orders were up sharply, rising 70 per cent in real terms and 22 per cent in
underlying terms to SKr15.5bn.
Including income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab,
included, profits rose to SKr2.71bn from SKr642m.
Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said he expected earnings to continue to
develop favourably. He added that the group had seen a 'distinct recovery'
in western Europe, while North America and Asia continued to develop
favourably.
Incentive gained a majority stake in Gambro through an SKr8bn bid for Cardo,
an investment company, during the summer. It has sold about SKr1.9bn worth
of equities from Cardo's SKr2.7bn portfolio and plans to relist the
remainder of the company early next year.

AEG expects its Electrocom postal sorting machinery businesses in Germany

from DM967m last year, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Sales would stagnate in 1995 before growing by up to 10 per cent in the
following years as the US postal service caught up on delayed investment in
automation, Mr Eberhard Zur, managing director of the German Electrocom,
said yesterday.
AEG completed its takeover of Electrocom Automation, the US company and
licensee of AEG Electrocom, in September and plans to integrate the two
companies under a US-based holding company on January 1 1995.
AEG spent DM450m on the purchase.

division

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux of Sweden, the world's leading manufacturer of household
appliances, says it may spin off Granges, its aluminium and metal-working
unit, in the first half of next year.
Analysts believe it could fetch up to SKr3.5bn (Dollars 477m), excluding
debt. The company, which was bought by Electrolux in 1980, has a book value
of about SKr2bn.
The group wants to sell the unit to Swedish, European and US investors and
list it on the Stockholm stock exchange, subject to market conditions.
The sale is in line with Electrolux's strategy of concentrating on core
business. The company has sold three industrial operations this year, with
total capital gains of SKr2.78bn helping to inflate group nine-month profits
to SKr5.08bn.
Granges is the biggest unit in Electrolux's industrial products division,
with 1993 sales of SKr7.6bn. About half of its sales are outside Sweden,
with the UK being the largest single market.
Its four business areas comprise aluminium, recycling, automotive and
distribution. Operations include a smelting plant at Sundsvall with
production capacity of 100,000 tons.
Granges has benefited from the recovery in aluminium prices and the weakness
of the krona. Both factors helped lift operating profits after depreciation
to SKr295m from SKr182m in the first nine months as sales expanded to
SKr6.8bn from SKr5.7bn.
Electrolux has been dismantling its industrial products division. Earlier
this year it sold Autoliv, Europe's leading supplier of car safety
equipment, and two US operations, Copes-Vulcan and Blaw-Knox.
Apart form Granges, the division comprises materials handling equipment, a
goods protection operation, and Granges Metalock.

Alan Cane predicts mobile phones will be popular gifts this festive season

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Electronic games and multimedia computers seem set to take a back seat this
winter as a new British appetite expresses itself. It will be the Christmas
of the mobile phone.
'It is going to be huge' said Mr Charles Dunstone, managing director of the
Carphone Warehouse. 'The cellular phone market is taking on the
characteristics of the brown goods business. The shops are busy on
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and quiet for the rest of the week.'
The UK mobile phone market is growing with a buoyancy few would have
predicted a year ago. In the past 12 months, almost 1.2m new subscribers
have joined the market bringing the total to more than 2.8m, or about 5 per
cent of the potential market.
More significantly, new cellular phone connections in the UK are continuing
to outstrip connections to fixed networks. Only Sweden has proportionately
more mobile phones among northern European countries.
Analysts are now talking about a total of almost 10m subscribers to cellular
services by the first months of 2000. Only a year ago, the prediction was
less than 8m.
And there has been remarkable price stability since Mr Gerry Whent, chief
executive of Vodafone, the UK market leader, said in June that the company
would make no cuts to its mobile phone tariffs this year. Competitors would
risk profitability if they cut theirs, he said. Cellnet, Vodafone's
principal but smaller competitor, agreed there was no need for further price
cutting.
This gave a signal to the market newcomers, Mercury One 2 One and Hutchison
Microtel's Orange service, that there was no need for a price war in a fast
growing market.
Overall, it was the right prediction even if most of the growth in the
market favours the traditional analogue networks provided by Vodafone and
Cellnet over the new, high technology digital offerings from One 2 One and
Orange.
Mr Dunstone believes a combination of lack of familiar features and limited
geographic coverage is acting against the digital networks. Cellnet, in
particular, has performed strongly.
However One 2 One and Orange are experiencing strong sales and stocks of
Orange equipment are in short supply, Mr Dunstone said.
Vodafone's interim results, expected today seem unlikely at first glance to
reflect this strength with pre-tax profits only a little above the Pounds
175m recorded last year.
Mr Kevin Langford, telecoms analyst with Flemings Research said there were
three reasons for this apparently disappointing performance.
The company has experienced higher than expected start-up losses abroad. It
now operates networks in Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong, Sweden,
Denmark, Malta and Greece and has lost an estimated Pounds 50m to date in
establishing these businesses.
In addition it has experienced higher than expected 'churn', jargon for the
number of subscribers who leave a network during the year expressed as a
percentage of the average number of subscribers.
Vodafone seems to be experiencing churn of about 29 per cent. Cellnet is
seeing only about 24 per cent, according to Mr Langford. He said: 'High
rates of churn can be a consequence of aggressive marketing by service
providers to customers who then find little need for the service.'
It can also be a consequence of fraud. Some 15,000 mobile phones are stolen
in the UK every month. 'Rechipping' or changing the electrical identity of a
phone by switching silicon chips so that calls can be made at somebody
else's expense is already a serious problem.
And finally the rapid growth of the UK market carries its own costs in the
form of high payments for acquiring subscribers. Cellular phone operators
generally help to expand the market and keep the cost of handsets to a
minimum by paying manufacturers a subsidy on each telephone sold.
Stripping out the overseas losses leaves Vodafone with a more convincing
underlying growth rate of about 20 per cent.
How is the new competition faring?
The principal development over the past few months has been the launch in
April of Orange, a service based on digital technology. It competes directly
in technical terms with Mercury's One 2 One. The Mercury service was
initially limited to the south-east of England where it has taken market
share with the bold stratagem of offering free off-peak calls.
According to One 2 One, its share of the market has grown from 3 per cent at
the beginning of the year to almost 5 per cent, with more than 150,000
subscribers. It has now extended coverage to the West Midlands and expects
to reach 60 per cent of the UK population by early 1997.
It publishes no profit figures or estimates of revenue per subscriber.
Neither, after only six months of operations, does Orange.
Orange's approach is to differentiate itself from the competition by
including separate lines for private and business use from the same phone
and 'free' features such as caller identification. Orange expects to have 70
per cent of the country covered by the end of the year.
Nobody expects today's hectic growth to continue for long. The business
market is close to saturation and much of the new growth is coming from the
residential sector which makes lower use of the phone. Rental prices,
inevitably, must start falling again, adversely affecting profits.
It will be a Merry Christmas but there may be headaches ahead in the new
year.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes makes acquisitions for
Pounds 7.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Baynes, the engineer, is spending Pounds 7.2m, in cash, to expand
its aerospace components and valves activities.
Its Kent Aerospace Castings subsidiary has bought the business and assets of
Deritend Aluminium Castings and Triton CNC from Triplex Lloyd and the
aluminium investment casting order book of Sterling International Technology
for a total of Pounds 5.8m.
The group has also bought Rona, a Belgium-based maker of specialist valves,
with turnover of about Pounds 3m, from a private vendor for Pounds 1.4m.
The acquisitions have been funded by a medium-term loan facility and gearing
at December 31 this year is expected to be about 25 per cent.
Triplex Lloyd will use the proceeds to reduce net debt and fund
restructuring costs.
DAC and Triton made pre-tax profits of Pounds 100,000 in the year to March
31.
Sterling's aluminium investment castings sales were Pounds 1.25m in the year
to March.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Cropper edge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in interest charges helped James Cropper, the paper and board
manufacturer, to raise pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 1.14m to
Pounds 1.2m in the half year to October 1.
Rapid price increases in pulp, the papermaking side's main raw material, had
affected trading in this division after a good opening quarter.
Mr James Cropper, chairman, warned that 'at present we do not see an end to
the current shortage of pulp and its ever increasing cost'. These problems,
together with disruption through moving the converting division, would make
it difficult to improve on last year's record Pounds 2.56m profit, he said.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 23.6m. Earnings per share were again 9p
and the interim dividend is held at 1.1p.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Samax is latest new issues victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak conditions in the London new issues market have claimed another victim.
Samax, which is developing mines in Africa, said yesterday it was postponing
its flotation until early next year.
Samax planned to raise Pounds 16m by the end of November via a placing by
stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, on terms that would have valued the
company at about Pounds 50m.
A pathfinder prospectus was issued at the end of last month and the company
toured several financial centres making presentations to potential
investors.
Mr Michael Martineau, managing director, said the response, particularly in
the US, was generally favourable, but 'the directors did not believe that
the anticipated proceeds of the flotation, given conditions in the new
issues market, would enable the company to capitalise on all of the
opportunities available'.
He said shareholder support had given the board flexibility to delay the
issue until market conditions allowed the company 'to achieve a larger issue
size rather than proceed on a scaled-back basis'.
Samax also suffered because mining companies worldwide have been highly
active in raising new money this year. By the end of June, at least Dollars
5.6bn (Pounds 3.41bn) had been raised, topping the Dollars 4.8bn they
collected in the whole of 1993, and there were warnings then about the
danger of 'indigestion' in the new mining equities market.
Samax was set up in 1989 and is developing a graphite mine in Tanzania and a
gold mine in Ghana.
The flotation was to allow it to complete the financing of its mining
operations, repay short term loans and expand its exploration efforts.
Its activities so far have been financed primarily by the Addax Oryx Group,
described in the pathfinder prospectus as a private, Europe-based group
involved in trading and related operations in Africa.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares fall 9p after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vibroplant, the plant hire group, lifted pre-tax profits 88 per cent in the
six months to September 30. However, the share price fell 9p to 120p
following a warning by Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, that after a good
summer the past six weeks had seen some softness in the UK commercial and
industrial markets.
October, November and December were usually the group's strongest months, he
added.
Pre-tax profits climbed to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 1.48m) in the first half, on
turnover down slightly at Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 36.9m). An 11 per cent fall
in US turnover to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 18.2m) disguised a 5 per cent
increase in the UK to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18.8m).
Mr Pilkington attributed the decline in the US to the reduced size of the US
fleet, fewer machines sold and the adverse effects of a 6 per cent change in
the exchange rate.
However, between group trading profits, which slipped to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds
9.67m), and group operating profits, which rose to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds
2.51m), depreciation costs fell from Pounds 7.16m to Pounds 6.13m.
Mr Pilkington said the group had changed its method of charging
depreciation. Previously it had made a full year's charge in the year of
purchase, regardless of whether a machine had been bought in the first month
or the twelfth; now it charged on a monthly basis from the date of purchase.
Interest charges dropped to Pounds 690,000 (Pounds 1.03m) as borrowings fell
to Pounds 20m, for gearing of 35 per cent against 45 per cent a year ago.
UK pre-tax profits grew 86 per cent to Pounds 2.64m due to increased volumes
and prices, with capital spending of more than Pounds 10m. In the US, where
profits doubled to a 'very modest' and 'unsatisfactory' Pounds 144,000,
capital spending totalled Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.6m). Group capital spending
is expected to total Pounds 25m this year.
Earnings per share rose to 3.87p (2.08p) and the interim dividend is 1.35p
(1.22p).

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unigroup offers itself as reverse takeover
vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigroup, the slimmed-down air curtain manufacturer and wind farm operator,
is offering itself as a vehicle for a reverse takeover for a company looking
for an alternative to a float.
The group is seeking to acquire a UK-based business making pre-tax profits
of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m.
The group has cash resources of Pounds 13.6m available as part of the
consideration and to invest in the business.
'The acquisition will be purchased using the group's cash resources together
with new shares,' said Mr Jonathan Mervis, chief executive.
Unigroup made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 364,000 in the year to end
September, against Pounds 4.41m for the previous 15 months, from turnover of
Pounds 6.59m (Pounds 38.5m).
Continuing activities contributed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 333,000 (Pounds
1.21m loss).
Losses per share were 0.1p compared with earnings of 8.5p.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Harborne Tenants fights Bradford takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harborne Tenants, the property investment company, has again urged its
shareholders to reject approaches from Bradford Property Trust.
In a letter sent to shareholders yesterday, the board says it is prepared to
consider a 'fair offer' for Harborne, but considers that BPT is trying to
acquire the company at an undervaluation.
It believes that the net asset value of the ordinary shares in the company
is properly stated at 345p per share. BPT has offered first 230p and then
260p, and Harborne finds it 'surprising' that BPT feels the need to 'cast
aspersions' upon the valuation.
Harborne also warns shareholders that BPT is focusing on the full potential
taxation liability on properties that is not expected to arise unless it is
BPT's intention to dispose of the properties. BPT had yesterday received
valid acceptances for 4.76 per cent of the Harborne ordinary shares and 6.33
per cent of the preference shares. Incomplete acceptances had been received
for a further 3.54 per cent and 3.64 per cent respectively. When the offer
was announced, BPT held 28.1 per cent of the ordinary and 23.7 per cent of
the preference.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rising costs squeeze Norcros - Shares fall
7% as exceptional gain cushions pre-tax profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising cost of raw materials squeezed operating margins at Norcros, the
building materials and print and packaging group, in the six months to
September 30.
The shares fell 9p to 120p yesterday as the company announced a 14 per cent
decline in operating profits to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.6m) on turnover
ahead by 3 per cent to Pounds 194m (Pounds 189m).
Pre-tax profits, however, rose to Pounds 8.98m (Pounds 7.36m) after an
exceptional profit of Pounds 1.35m on the sale and leaseback of a property.
The group still has Pounds 24m of property, which it intends to dispose of
within 18 months.
The rise in profits was underpinned by a 40 per cent reduction in net
interest costs to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 5.2m) after last year's Pounds 49.7m
rights issue helped to cut group borrowings.
However, gearing at September 30 climbed back from 44 to 49 per cent.
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said: 'The cost of virtually every raw
material we use has gone up and it has been almost impossible to pass on.
The overall impact of the costs we have had to absorb is 2 per cent of
sales, or between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m.
'There is a marked reluctance on the part of retailers of any sort to accept
price increases,' he added.
Timber price rises of up to 40 per cent helped to cut profit before interest
at the core buildings division to Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 3.9m) on turnover of
Pounds 91.2m (Pounds 83.2m). Price rises have levelled off in the current
period.
Crosby Sarek, the timber door and window manufacturer, bore the brunt of a
Pounds 1m group reorganisation as its workforce was cut by 100 to 700. Five
years ago the company employed 1,600 people.
Weak demand in the UK and falling export levels left the ceramics division
with turnover down to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 52.3m) while profit before
interest rose marginally to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 3.08m).
However, the specialist print and packaging division reported a 16 per cent
rise in profit before interest to Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 5.15m) on turnover of
Pounds 53.6m (Pounds 51.9m).
Earnings per share rose to 3.3p (2.8p) and the interim dividend is being
maintained at 3.5p.
COMMENT
Norcros needs to grasp the nettle at its building products division. Crosby
Sarek is languishing in a sector which is oversupplied by about 40 per cent,
thanks in part to Spring Ram's expansion in capacity. The company claims to
be the victim of raw material costs, but that is hardly supported by the
performance of businesses such as John Carr, the Rugby-owned joinery
business, which enjoys margins of about 11 per cent. Analysts forecast
full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, which gives a p/e of 18.
Given the flat demand in the home improvement market, that seems a little
optimistic.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: European growth helps Filofax advance 68%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand from continental Europe helped Filofax Group, the USM-quoted
personal organiser concern, to report a 68 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 2.12m in the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose 65 per cent to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 8.3m). Excluding Henry
Ling, the greetings cards business bought in July, and Drakes Office
Systems, a manufacturer of carbonless message books, bought last December,
sales grew by 29 per cent.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for both organic growth
and further acquisitions is exciting.' The group would continue to look for
manufacturers of personal stationery products that could be sold through
existing distribution channels.
Sales in continental Europe rose 65 per cent. The group's four wholly owned
continental subsidiaries showed increased sales of 50 per cent in the
original organiser business, compared with a 20 per cent increase in the UK.
Including the Drakes brand, UK sales increased by 60 per cent.
Demand in the US and Japan was flat. In the US Filofax has reduced the
number of outlets to concentrate on the top end of the market.
Henry Ling contributed Pounds 2m in sales and Pounds 429,000 to operating
profits of Pounds 2.18m in August and September. A large part of its revenue
comes late in the year from Christmas cards. Sales in businesses other than
the original organisers now make up 28 per cent of the total.
Mr Field said that there was considerable scope for growth in countries such
as France and Germany where sales per capita of Filofax Group products was
7p and 5p respectively, compared with 50p a head in Sweden and Norway.
Earnings per share increased by 50 per cent from 4p to 6p and the interim
dividend is raised by 40 per cent from 0.75p to 1.05p.
The shares rose 4p to 233p.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BCE takes step into electronic games
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BCE Holdings, the USM-traded snooker and pool products distributor,
yesterday moved into the electronics games business and placed 100m new
shares at 11p each.
Shares in the group were suspended at 9 1/2 p last month after the group
announced that it was acquiring two companies engaged in the development of
video and computer games. The acquisitions will quadruple the size of the
group, which is valued at Pounds 24m at the issue price.
It is paying Pounds 3.85m for the entire issued share capital of Rage and
Pounds 9.98m for Software Creations. The consideration for both companies is
made up of a mixture of shares, loan notes and cash, with Rage taking 18.2m
shares and Software Creations 36.1m shares. The loan notes are subject to
penalties if profit targets are not met.
Rage has among its games Striker, a soccer-based game, and includes Sega
among its customers. Games developed by Software Creations include
Terminator 2 and Spiderman, and it has Nintendo and Sony among its
customers.
The placing - of which 74.8m shares will be firm with the remainder subject
to a 2-for-5 open offer to existing shareholders - will raise Pounds 11m. Of
the total, about Pounds 1m will be taken up with expenses, while Pounds 5m
will go to the company and Pounds 5m to help finance the acquisitions.
After the deal is completed, there will be more than 217m shares in issue.
The group will operate with two divisions - multimedia, which is expected to
account for 75 per cent of profits, and leisure.
Shareholders will vote on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on
December 14. Dealings in the ordinary shares are expected to begin on the
USM the following day.
Mr Robin Jones, managing director, said yesterday that the revamped group
would be seeking a full listing as soon as possible, probably in autumn next
year.

An all-round improvement at Hewetson, the flooring and building materials
concern, meant pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 158,000 to Pounds 916,000
in the six months to September 30, on sales 48 per cent higher at Pounds
22.3m, against Pounds 15.1m.
Mr Peter Price, chairman, said the result reflected the benefits of
investments made in the business during the past three years and some
improved trading conditions in the early part of 1994. Markets remained
difficult to predict, but as usual a lower profit level was expected in the
second half.
Earnings per share came to 5.21p (0.16p loss) and the interim dividend has

Smith said it had obtained an option to buy Toscana Ondulati, the

Mr James Fraser, Smith's communications manager, said: 'We have always said
that we are looking to improve our coverage across Europe on the corrugating

every market.'
Toscana Ondulati reported turnover of L27.9bn in 1993 and net assets of

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Providing a base for long haul - The
significance of Rolls-Royce's Dollars 525m acquisition of a US aero-engine
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the financial details of Rolls-Royce's proposed acquisition of
Allison, the US aero-engine manufacturer, the City's reaction was remarkably
positive.
Rolls-Royce is paying Dollars 525m (Pounds 320m) for a company that was sold
for 30 per cent less a year ago and that has lost more than Dollars 370m
since 1990.
The deal will be funded by a Pounds 300m rights issue which will hang over
the market for months while Rolls-Royce seeks US regulatory approval. Yet
its shares ended up 2p at 185p.
Rolls-Royce had to work hard to convince analysts that the deal made
short-term financial sense. But there were few who doubted the strategic
benefits.
Allison will broaden Rolls-Royce's product range in aero-engines, a market
where the company itself admits it is difficult to predict winners.
Allison also provides a US manufacturing base which is seen as important
boost to Rolls' chances of involvement in future US defence programmes.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, commented: 'Getting on new programmes such as
Astovl and JAFT will require a constituency in the US.'
More fundamentally, the deal provides further evidence of Rolls'
determination to go it alone, rather than ally itself with with one of its
US rivals - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
Rolls-Royce has increased its market share significantly over the last
decade but in group terms it remains much smaller than its rival's parents.
Many analysts believe it is too small to bear the risks and huge costs of
developing new engine families. The acquisition of Allison and the
associated rights issue, though a sign of management's confidence, will do
little to address those concerns.
It does, however, give Rolls exposure to some strong sectors of the
aero-engine market. It may not be easy to predict which type of aero-engine
is likely to show the best growth over the next decade. But most observers
agree that large turboprop engines, where Allison has a near monopoly, is
one of the most promising military markets.
Allison's other strong market position is in small helicopter engines, where
growth prospects are also good given the swing in defence budgets towards
rapid response and surveillance.
But of the four new Allison engines about to reach the market, it is the
AE2100, large turboprop, that is likely to be its mainstay over the next few
years. The AE2100 powers the C130J, the soon-to-be-launched successor to
Lockheed's hugely successful Hercules transport plane.
Although Sir Ralph denies it, the proposed purchase of Allison may make it
more likely that the RAF will plump for the C130J as replacement for half
its ageing Hercules fleet. Rolls, however, will continue to press for the
RAF to support the proposed European rival, the Future Large Aircraft.
Rolls is hoping it will be chosen by the FLA consortium to supply the
engines.
However, Rolls and British Aerospace believe they will be frozen out of the
project if the RAF chooses to go with Lockheed.
Some observers even suggest that Rolls' French rival, Snecma, will use the
acquisition of Allison to argue against the FLA using Rolls engines.
For the moment analysts are more concerned about Rolls' prediction that,
despite its recent financial record, Allison will enhance group earnings.
Rolls argues that recent cost-cutting has yet to show through fully in
Allison's figures while research and development spending has fallen sharply
following the completion of the four new engines.
'One has to take on trust Rolls-Royce's assurance that the business has
turned,' said Mr Chris Avery, aerospace analyst at Paribas.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Critchley to Pounds 2.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two acquisitions in May helped Critchley Group, the electrical cable
accessories manufacturer, show a 47 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the
half year to September 30.
The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2.35m on turnover 25 per
cent ahead at Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 13.8m). The share price firmed 15p to
close at 459p.
Idento, a German manufacturer, and CCA, a UK distributor, contributed Pounds
382,000 to operating profits and Pounds 1.72m to sales. Total operating
profits went up 50 per cent to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.55m), with an
underlying increase of 26 per cent.
The proportion of the group's sales from outside the UK rose to 46 per cent,
compared with 38 per cent in the first half of last year. However, Mr Ian
McCallum, chief executive, said there was 'still scope for improvement' in
UK sales, which rose by 10 per cent.
Sales in the core business of identification and cable accessories rose 20
per cent to Pounds 12.1m on the back of strong demand in the US and France.
Mr McCallum said margins were improving independently from the acquisition
of Idento and that low-margin products continued to be shed.
Sales at Critchley Wound Components, which produces transformers and
inductors for the telecommunications industry, increased by 55 per cent to
Pounds 3.49m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 11.6p (9p) and the interim dividend is
3p (2.6p).
Critchley said it proposed to cancel its share premium account and transfer
it to a special reserve. Goodwill from the two acquisitions would then be
offset against this account rather than the profit and loss account reserve,
which had fallen into a Pounds 3.56m deficit as a result of the
transactions. The company stressed that this did not affect net assets or
trading. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at an EGM in December.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Diploma 23% to
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth from the electronics and building components divisions of
Diploma enabled the group, which also has interests in special steels, to
lift pre-tax profits almost 23 per cent in the year to September 30.
Profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 20.4m) pre-tax were struck on turnover of
Pounds 192m (Pounds 158m). Operating profits grew to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds
20.2m) while interest receivable slipped to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.3m) as the
group had Pounds 24m cash at the year-end, against Pounds 28m.
The group places great emphasis on strong cash flow, which financed the 21
per cent sales increase.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman and chief executive, said Diploma was 'not
as aggressive in acquisitions as we may well become', adding that the
group's culture was one of 'slow diversification'. About Pounds 4m was spent
on acquisitions in the year.
The electronics division made Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 12.9m) on turnover of
Pounds 127m (Pounds 104m). The main engine of growth remained the PC market.
The expected downward turn of the UK semi-conductor cycle had been deferred,
he suggested, by the recession in continental Europe and by the emerging
potential in 'bridging devices' for multi-media applications.
Sales at Macro, the semi-conductor business, achieved a 29 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 78m, outstripping the market's growth by 8 percentage
points. Nortronic, the other electrical components distributor, lifted
revenue 14 per cent and operating profits 10 per cent.
Profits in the building components side bucked the cyclical trend and grew
by 23 per cent to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 7m) on turnover at Pounds 50.4m
(Pounds 42.8m).
The special steels division benefited from the recovery in the oil industry,
winning orders by being 'able to respond from stock and with service'.
Earnings per share rose to 28.9p (24.4p) and a final dividend of 9.5p (8.5p)
lifts the total to 13.5p (12p).
The shares gained 10p to 448p.
COMMENT
The stock has underperformed the market by 23 per cent over the past 12
months in anticipation of a cycle-induced profits slowdown. However, while
these figures are at the lower end of the expected range, they are perfectly
solid and show, most importantly, that demand for semi-conductors and
building components is not slowing as the cycle dictated. Diploma, cautious
and conservative as ever, is also gradually diversifying, to remove risk
further. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.5m give earnings of 31.8p for
the current year and a p/e of 13.8, a slight premium. The shares have scope
for further progress.

Kleinwort Benson, joint global co-ordinator for the Telewest share
flotation, has confirmed that the issue which is priced today is covered by
a 'green-shoe' option, to meet excess demand and stabilise the share price.
Kleinwort formally notified the stock exchange yesterday that it may

after the shares begin trading on November 30.
The flotation covers a combined total of 216m shares in the UK and overseas
and is expected to be priced at between 165p and 190p, suggesting a total
value for the cable television company of between Pounds 1.61bn and Pounds
1.86bn.
Under the terms, Telewest has granted Kleinwort and Morgan Stanley options
to acquire up to an additional 32.4m shares for the purpose of covering any
over-allotments.

FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent asks MMC to block bid
by rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY

<TEXT>
Midland Independent Newspapers, publishers of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
has told the government it should continue to block the proposed Pounds 92m
acquisition of T Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post, by
the Daily Mail and General Trust, publishers of the Daily Mail.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission unanimously opposed DMGT's proposed
acquisition of T Bailey Forman.
It said the deal would give DMGT too high a concentration of newspapers in
the East Midlands area.
In written evidence to Mr Tim Eggar, trade secretary, MIN argues that the
only way to address concerns about the deal is for DMGT to sell daily titles
in the region. DMGT has described this as 'wholly unacceptable'.
The Birmingham group contends that it is impossible to devise a form of
words that will ensure that the concentration of power involved in the
acquisition would not operate against the public interest.
MIN also says that the amount offered, nearly 29 times the earnings of the
Nottingham titles, suggests that 'DMGT will have to follow policies to
remove smaller and weaker competitors, to allow it to capitalise on a
monopoly position and so maximise its return from local advertisers'.
DMGT has been given a December 5 deadline to convince Mr Eggar that the deal
should go ahead.
Mr Peter Williams, finance director of DMGT has made it clear the company
will demonstrate the diversity of editorial views exhibited by its regional
titles.
Both MIN and Emap, the newspaper and magazine group, are understood to have
bid between Pounds 70m and Pounds 75m for T Bailey Forman last time.
Both will bid again if the titles come back on to the market, but probably
with lower bids.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Soros pulls out of UK property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Soros, the international financier, is pulling out of UK
commercial property only 18 months after announcing plans to make a
'long-term' investment of up to Pounds 250m.
He is selling British Land the 50 per cent it does not already own in their
joint venture in the UK property market for Pounds 142m in cash. Quantum UK
Realty, the offshore fund set as the vehicle for the investment, is
effectively being wound up.
The joint venture has spent Pounds 600m building a commercial property
portfolio since June 1993. Mr Soros said yesterday: 'Although we are
satisfied with the real estate portfolio assembled in co-operation with
British Land, as investment advisers we . . . consider that more attractive
long-term investment opportunities have opened up since the joint venture
was formed.'
Many of the funds run by Mr Soros have had a difficult year as a result of
turbulence in currency and bond markets. Shares in his flagship Quantum fund
have fallen from Dollars 25,282 to Dollars 19,670 during 1994.
The 200 shareholders in Quantum UK Realty, mostly wealthy individuals and
institutions which invest in other Quantum funds, are expected to receive
around Pounds 109 for every Pounds 100 invested last year.
Shares in the fund had been trading at around Pounds 102, a discount to net
asset value. Quantum funds have traditionally traded at a premium to net
assets.
Quantum said that the discount was not acceptable to shareholders.
British Land and Quantum originally planned to invest Pounds 250m each in
the joint venture, which was expected to run until 2003.
Quantum also bought 5 per cent stake British Land which it said was a
long-term holding. These shares were sold in July at a 35 per cent profit.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said: 'We have got the other half of
a portfolio which we already know inside out at a good price and with no
acquisition costs.'
Included in the portfolio is a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, the property
developer which owns half of London's Broadgate office complex and which is
in refinancing negotiations.
Although British Land's gearing is expected to rise to more than 80 per
cent, Mr Ritblat said that the company had substantial credit lines at its
disposal and was still interested in buying Broadgate.
Property shares fell back yesterday. British Land's was among the hardest
hit, falling 3 per cent to 384p.

FT  22 NOV 94 / US rate rises curb interest earnings across the spread:
Flattening yield curve squeezes profits at securities firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While companies across the US this past week have been worrying about what
the latest increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve will do to the
economy and their earnings over the next year, Wall Street securities firms
have been busy focusing on the flattening of the yield curve, and what it is
doing to their earnings right now.
The yield curve, a graphical depiction of interest rates on securities with
varying maturities, has been steadily flattening since the Fed started
raising interest rates in February. At the start of the year, the curve was
relatively steep because of a wide spread between yields on short-term and
and long-term government securities. At the time, the spread between the
two-year and the 30-year bond was 210 basis points.
Since then, the Fed's aggressive monetary tightening has pushed short-term
yields up faster than long-term yields, so the spread has narrowed and the
yield curve has flattened. Last week, the yield spread between two-year and
30-year bonds fell below 100 basis points for the first time since December
1990.
The curve has flattened because investors in long-term government securities
have begun to believe that the Fed's anti-inflation measures will work. This
has restrained bond yields because the less fearful investors are of
inflation, the less likely they are to demand a higher yield.
Investors at the short end of the bond market, however, remain worried that
the Fed may want to tighten policy further, and so have been pushing up
yields on short-term government securities in anticipation of another rate
rise.
The flattening of the yield curve has important implications for earnings of
financial companies, including commercial banks and securities firms. It is
the latter, however, who are being most affected by the trend. Between 1991
and 1993, when spreads were wide and the curve was steep, Wall Street's
biggest firms were borrowing billions of dollars cheaply in the short-term
market and using that money to buy longer-term bonds paying rich yields. The
result was interest earnings which helped Wall Street to record-breaking
profits.
Mr Guy Moszkowski, securities industry analyst at broking firm Sanford
Bernstein, says: 'When firms carry longer-term debt securities and fund
those positions with short-term money, they are earning an attractive
spread. That spread is going to contract in a situation where the yield
curve is flatter.'
Today, such profits are not so easy to come by, he says. For example,
Salomon Brothers - the biggest bond trading firm on Wall Street - earned
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 800m) in net interest income last year. This year,
with a flatter curve, Salomon's net interest income is estimated to fall to
around Dollars 940m.
Other factors - the deterioration in trading and underwriting results
sparked by rising interest rates and volatile markets - have hit earnings,
but the decline in interest income is important because it made up such a
large part of earnings during the 1991-1993 boom.
Marketmaking and broking revenues are also affected, as a treasurer at a
large securities firm explains. 'A flattening curve makes it difficult for
us to carry securities, and forces us to shrink our inventory positions.
This means that the willingness of brokers to hold positions (for customers)
will decline, which generally hurts liquidity in the marketplace and
discourages customer activity.'
For the immediate future, the situation can only get worse because the yield
curve will almost certainly get flatter, and may eventually become inverted.
The curve inverts when yields on short-term securities are higher than on
long-term securities, which usually occurs when interest rates have peaked
and are about to head lower. The last time the curve inverted was 1989,
before the Fed starting cutting interest rates, and given that the Fed may
be near to ending its tightening 'some believe that an inverted curve is
inevitable soon', says Mr Moszkowski.
An inverted yield curve would play havoc with Wall Street, he says. 'Firms
would begin shrinking their balance sheets substantially as inventories
would become very expensive to carry.' Companies would widen the spreads
between their buying and selling prices to make up for lost interest
earnings, which would only further undermine liquidity and reduce trading
activity.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Allied Dunbar to replace pensions with single plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar, the life insurer owned by BAT Industries, the tobacco and
financial services group, is to replace its range of pension policies with a
single adaptable plan intended to give customers greater flexibility.
From the start of next year, customers will be able to decide on a specific
payment term for regular contributions, and switch between different types
of personal pension within a single plan.
The commissions which Allied Dunbar pays its sales force and independent
financial advisers will be trimmed and spread over a longer period of the
policy instead of being taken entirely from the initial premiums.
The move is a further sign of the way the life insurance industry is
responding to the forthcoming new regulatory regime.
From next year companies will have to disclose to customers more information
about products, including the cost of paying commission and the payment back
to investors who surrender long-term policies after just a few years.
Standard Life and TSB have already responded to the disclosure regime by
announcing changes in their products.
Allied Dunbar, which has 5 to 6 per cent of the personal pensions market,
said that the new adaptable pension plan would encourage client loyalty as
it was designed to maximise the benefits of customers who continued their
contributions throughout the period chosen as the payment term, which could
be any time from two years up to the expected retirement age.
However, by including a range of options - customers could decide, for
example, to commit themselves at first only to a five-year plan - it should
also offer a better deal to investors who want to stop contributions after
just a few years.
While two successive five-year policies would produce a lower value after 10
years than a single 10-year policy, they would give better value to
customers at an earlier stage.
The new plan will allow customers to move more easily between types of
personal pensions - for example, from a free-standing personal plan to an
additional voluntary contribution which could run alongside an occupational
scheme.
Mr Tony Reardon, pensions marketing manager, said that the plan would enable
Allied Dunbar to reach new areas of the pensions market: its current
products were more than 10 years old, he said.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Emap sets sights on European purchase: Publishing group
lifts interim profits 34% to Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the newspaper, magazine and exhibitions group, is 'seriously
interested' in the European publishing operations of Maclean Hunter, the
Canadian media group.
Emap, which yesterday announced a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 22.2m for the six months to October 1, is believed to be one of five
groups bidding for the Maclean Hunter business titles in the UK and
continental Europe.
Rogers Communications, which recently acquired Maclean, is selling the
assets which are expected to raise more than Pounds 50m.
Mr David Arculus, managing director of Emap, said the company regards the
Maclean titles, which include UK Press Gazette, as a 'bolt-on' to its
existing business titles.
'Our next tranche of deals will be bolt-on deals and we are looking at quite
a number of them,' he said.
During the first half, Emap spent Pounds 197m on acquisitions including
Pounds 106m acquiring 28 magazines from the French publishers Editions
Mondiales and a further 10 consumer titles from companies within the Hersant
group of France.
The company also spent Pounds 50m on Trans World Communications with
commercial radio stations in Manchester, Preston, Leeds and Cardiff.
Emap is the second-largest player in commercial radio in the UK after
Capital with about 12 per cent of the market.
Emap said the French purchases had cost about 75p-77p for every Pounds 1 in
turnover. Margins were about 5 per cent compared with 17 per cent for its UK
consumer magazines.
The company hopes that rationalisation and better margins on distribution
will lift margins to 10 per cent within the next two to three years.
Underlying growth was 24 per cent. Turnover was 38 per cent up at Pounds
234.2m. Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 7.9p and the intermim at
2.5p was up by 13 per cent.
Mr Richard Dale, media analyst from stockbrokers Smith New Court, upgraded
his forecast for Emap's full-year pre-tax figure from Pounds 59m to Pounds
61m and from Pounds 76m to Pounds 79m for the 1995-96 financial year.
On the consumer magazine side, Emap said the successes were More, the
magazine for young women which put on 17 per cent in sales to 400,000, and
Match Weekly, a football magazine which increased sales by 21 per cent to
137,000. Computer games magazines were the poor performers with circulation
falls of around 30 per cent.
Mr Robin Miller, Emap chief executive, said newspaper advertising revenue
rose 11 per cent. Employment advertising rose 42 per cent, but local retail
advertising was still hit by consumer caution.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Telekom decision postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday surprised the world's leading investment
banks by postponing until next month the decision over which of them will be
chosen to handle the international side of the DM15bn (Pounds 6bn)
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
A decision had been expected yesterday after a meeting of postal and finance
ministry officials. But strong lobbying from European banks which were
concerned that the position of global co-ordinator might go to a US
institution, appears to have persuaded the government that more time was
necessary in view of the share issue's political and financial sensitivity.
Banks close to the talks said that the government was now leaning towards a
more balanced solution in which both a US and a UK investment house would
work with the German banks - expected to be Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank
 -leading the issue. The US and UK are expected to provide most foreign
institutional and private interest in the issue; banks estimate that these
countries will account for some DM3bn worth of share purchases each,
compared with the DM8.5bn or so likely to be sold in Germany.
Government and Deutsche Telekom officials had talks in Washington with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week about a US listing by means of
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Because of their strong placing power
and teams of analysts, US investment banks have been prominent in the list
of candidates for the lucrative global co-ordinating role.
European banks have been arguing in Bonn that a UK-based bank, experienced
in large privatisations such as those of British Telecom and energy
companies, should also be chosen; the Deutsche Telekom issue, likely to take
place early in 1996, will be one of the biggest in Europe.
US banks with the strongest chances include Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley. In the UK, they include SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and NM
Rothschild. CS First Boston has put itself forward solely for the role of
adviser to the government.
Some 22 banks took part in 'beauty contests' to help decide which should
play the main foreign roles.

The chairman of an Alcatel Alsthom subsidiary was yesterday placed under
detention by a French magistrate probing false billing and overcharging of
France Telecom, one of the company's largest clients.
Company officials said Mr Pierre Guichet could step down as head of
Alcatel-CIT, the telecoms equipment arm of the French transport and telecoms
group, after a board meeting today.
They said the move would help limit damage to relations with France Telecom
and would not imply any admission of guilt by Mr Guichet, who has rejected
allegations of wrongdoing.
The resignation would be the second in the past week by the head of a
company involved in a spate of corruption investigations which have rocked
French industry this year. Last Friday, Mr Michel Mauer resigned as chairman
of Cogedim, the property developer and a subsidiary of Paribas, the merchant
bank. He stepped down to answer charges of corruption in a case involving
illicit financing of political parties.
The departure of Mr Guichet would be a further blow to Alcatel Alsthom,
which has been shaken by corruption investigations this year. In July, Mr
Pierre Suard, chairman of the company, was placed under investigation after
allegations that he used company funds for construction work on private
properties.
The investigations, combined with a warning of a fall in profits this year,
have prompted a sharp fall in the company's share price. Alcatel's shares
are about 40 per cent below their level of the beginning of the year.
The probe into the alleged overbilling of France Telecom is a complex case
which started last year. Alcatel says that two employees, who subsequently
left the company, manipulated prices for equipment supplied to France
Telecom to their own advantage. In November last year, Alcatel paid the
state telecoms operator FFr62m (Pounds 7.4m) to compensate for the losses
and the damage to relations between the two companies.
Since Mr Guichet was placed under investigation in May, however, the probe
has broadened. It at first centred on overbilling concerning transmission
equipment, involving an estimated FFr80m of damages to France Telecom. Mr
Jean-Marie D'Huy, the investigating magistrate, is now examining whether
false billing extended to switching systems and switchboards. Judicial
sources say the damages could be in excess of FFr400m.
Alcatel said that Mr Guichet had presented himself voluntarily before Mr
D'Huy in a court in Evry, west of Paris.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Saudi bank set to agree Dollars 245m BCCI payment: Charges
to be dropped in return for settlement
</HEADLINE>

Liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are
on the verge of agreeing an out-of-court settlement of more than Dollars
245m (Pounds 149m) from Saudi Arabia's largest commercial bank.
National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz,
former chief operating officer, are to pay the cash and waive their own
claims of Dollars 600m against the bank. In exchange, the liquidators will
drop all further charges against them, according to sources close to the
negotiations.
The deal would end one of the most significant outstanding pieces of
litigation in the BCCI saga. The bank was closed in July 1991 by global
banking regulators following revelations of widespread fraud. The settlement
follows the launch of five civil actions by the liquidators of BCCI at the
accountancy firm Touche Ross against Sheikh Khalid and NCB in five
countries. These sought damages in excess of Dollars 30bn.
There would be no admission of responsibility with regard to the allegations
made in the actions, which claim Sheikh Khalid made false statements about
loans from BCCI. The actions further allege that he conspired to conceal the
sale of shares in BCCI and elsewhere.
It is understood the deal has been discussed by BCCI's creditors' committee,
which is supervising the liquidation. The money could be released in the new
year. It requires approval from the courts monitoring the liquidation, and
signatures from NCB and the liquidators.
Late last year, Sheikh Khalid and NCB made a settlement with the US
authorities to pay Dollars 225m in exchange for the dropping of criminal
charges brought against them in New York.
As part of the latest agreement, Dollars 180m of the earlier US payment will
be released to the liquidators for distribution to creditors. Sheikh Khalid
will provide additional cash of Dollars 245m and is expected to waive claims
for Dollars 330m in capital notes - a type of loan convertible to shares -
and about Dollars 270m in deposits he was owed by BCCI at the time of its
closure.
Sheikh Khalid took a stake in BCCI in 1986 on behalf of NCB, but withdrew
the following year. He resigned from BCCI's board in 1989, and later from
NCB.
The new settlement will leave outstanding three principal legal actions by
the liquidators: against the Bank of England and the Luxembourg Monetary
Institute, the banking regulator, for failures in regulation duties towards
BCCI, and against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney for
failures as auditors to BCCI.
Court approval is expected shortly for a Dollars 1.8bn payment from Abu
Dhabi to the liquidators. They say creditors will receive a final dividend
of 30p-40p for every pound lost.

FT  22 NOV 94 / US needs further rate rise to curb inflation, warns OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US will need to raise interest rates further to ease inflationary
pressures coming to a head in the economy, warn economists at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The OECD's latest report on the US economy, published yesterday, says most
indicators are signalling the danger of a pick-up in inflation over the next
year or two, and that the 2 1/2 percentage point increase in short-term
interest rates the Federal Reserve has made this year will not be enough to
slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of growth over the long term.
The OECD, which represents 25 of the world's main industrialised countries,
predicts that the federal funds rate, the Fed's principal short-term
interest rate, will have to rise to 6 1/4 per cent by the end of next year.
The projection was made before the Fed's decision last week to raise rates
by  3/4 of a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent, and had not counted on such
a sharp move. Nevertheless, OECD economists still expect further tightening
will be needed next year. 'Even though the case is by no means airtight,
there is good reason to think that inflation has now reached its trough for
this business cycle,' the report says.
It forecasts gross domestic product growth slowing from 3.8 per cent this
year to 2.9 per cent in 1995, with inflation, as measured by the GDP
deflator, accelerating from 2.1 per cent to 2.8 per cent in 1995. US
Treasury officials attacked the growth forecast as too high. The official
forecast is for 2.7 per cent growth.
Last week's rate rise was welcomed by most Wall Street economists, but was
criticised by some manufacturers who complained that the Fed could kill off
the recovery in spite of the absence of clear signs of faster inflation.
The OECD, however, finds evidence that the economy is vulnerable to a rise
in inflation in 'the job vacancy rate, slower vendor deliveries, spreading
capacity constraints and spot shortages in certain sectors and for certain
types of high-skilled employees'.
Many analysts believe that the economy will probably slow in any case,
because of the interest rate increases pushed through. But even if the US
economy has more capacity than the OECD estimates, the report says, 'erring
on the side of restraint would appear to be the best policy'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr George Soros decided last June to invest in UK commercial property,
such was the American financier's reputation that the sector rose 6 per cent
in a single day. Yesterday, when he pulled out, it fell just 1 per cent. Mr
Soros argued the decision was based on asset allocation: with interest rates
moving up the opportunities for sharp increases in asset values were likely
to be limited. However, the move probably says more about how Mr Soros'
property fund has traded than about prospects for UK property per se.
Followers of Mr Soros are not used to seeing their shares trading at a
discount to net assets.
Despite the sector's muted fall, the decision is clearly a setback for
British Land, the company with which Mr Soros had formed the joint venture.
Its disappointment is likely to be motivated less by yesterday's 3 per cent
drop in its share price than the loss of Mr Soros' magic at opening bankers'
doors. Mr Soros' 'long-term investment' was supposed to run until 2004 but
lasted just 18 months.
By spending Pounds 142m to acquire its joint-venture partner, British Land
has raised its gearing to more than 85 per cent. Interest cover is still
comfortable. But the rise increases the risk of a rights issue if British
Land wants to buy Stanhope Properties and its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate
Properties. That fear, rather than the loss of Mr Soros, probably accounted
for yesterday's share price fall.

FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Opec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At one level, the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over whether to
roll over Opec's production ceiling for a year or only six months is purely
tactical. After all, both countries have a shared objective: higher crude
prices. The Saudis believe a year-long freeze would be more effective. In
this case, the market would know there was little chance of the ceiling's
being raised in mid-1995 to meet expected increases in world demand.
Arguably, it would therefore be unwilling to run down stocks next spring.
Yesterday traders responded to the Saudi plan at the cartel's meeting in
Bali by pushing up crude prices.
Kuwait's view that a six-month freeze would carry greater market credibility
is hard to understand, unless it is seen as a ploy to achieve a higher
quota. The sooner the overall ceiling is reviewed, the better the chance of
increasing its own share. By contrast, the Saudis want to keep the higher
quota they received after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and so have an interest
in freezing the regime.
With two of Opec's largest members struggling for market share, the cartel
looks ill-prepared to cut production in 1995 should that be needed. At the
moment, with world demand growing, restraint is unnecessary. But that
outlook could be challenged from several angles: the mild start to winter in
Europe and North America may continue; non-Opec suppliers may increase
production next year substantially; and UN sanctions on Iraq may be lifted.
The manoeuvring in Bali suggests the cartel will find it hard to accommodate
such shocks.

FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Ciba/Chiron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba yesterday insisted its deal with Chiron was good for both groups.
Chiron and its shareholders would not disagree. Financially, the move gives
Chiron access to Ciba's capital backing. That means Chiron will be able to
fund its best drugs without being as concerned about quarterly earnings
results. Industrially, there is an undoubted fit between the companies'
operations, while Ciba can also provide development and marketing expertise.
The danger of a cultural clash between stilted Swiss management and
Californian working practices has been reduced by Ciba's efforts to
alleviate such problems.
Strategically, the deal also makes sense for Ciba. The management concluded
the best hope for its pharmaceuticals business was innovation and the best
route to innovation was through the biotechnology revolution. Chiron, the
biotech group with the largest drugs portfolio in development, will provide
Ciba more than adequate access to that revolution.
Doubts about the deal centre on the high premium paid. Ciba has plenty of
cash, but claims the purchase is earnings enhancing are at best
disingenuous. Ciba, normally proud of its probity in applying accounting
standards, has decided not to run Dollars 1.3bn of goodwill through the
profit and loss account. Whether the deal makes financial sense depends on
Chiron's future earnings growth, a subject about which there is little
consensus in the market. However, the potentially extravagant price paid
should not tarnish Ciba's strategic boldness.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce's proposed acquisition of Allison Engine makes sound industrial
and commercial sense. It takes the UK company into new niches within the
defence market - for example large turbo-prop engines and small engines used
by light helicopters - and broadens its offering in civil markets. The deal
appears to make financial sense as well, even if Allison has an uninspiring
sales record and is only now making a nominal operating profit after three
years of losses. For next year, there is little danger of dilution:
Rolls-Royce's shares are rated at about 25 times next year's expected
earnings and recovery at Allison need not be too pronounced to enhance
earnings overall. Thereafter, it may be trickier, as for 1996 the rating
drops to more modest levels in line with an expected upsurge in Rolls-Royce
profits. But Rolls-Royce has done its sums and predicts 'unbelievable' cost
savings, as it cuts research and development expenditure further and
extracts operating and administrative efficiencies. At the same time,
revenues are set to rise as four new engines go into production.
The transaction will give Rolls-Royce greater clout with its powerful North
American customers, and reduce its vulnerability to fluctuations in the
dollar. But the deal does not answer the big question hanging over
Rolls-Royce's future, which is whether the UK group has the financial and
market muscle to compete with Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric over the
long run. Nor does it do anything to remove scepticism about the Rolls-Royce
share rating, which is taking rather too much in the way of cyclical
recovery for granted.

Two years ago, SAS International Hotels came up with an acceptably ageist
wheeze. Provided there were vacancies, guests over 65 could get a discount
equivalent to their ages. So 70-year-olds had 70 per cent knocked off their
bill; anyone arriving in their hundredth year would get the room free.
Kurt Ritter, chief executive of Radisson-SAS, as the company is now called,
says all went well until a Swedish guest turned up recently at one of the
company's hostelries in Vienna and announced that he was 102. He demanded to
be paid 2 per cent of the room rate to stay the night. The hotel agreed. The
sprightly guest then demanded a game of tennis with the general manager -
and got that, too. It is not known whether he took the GM to five sets.

Democracy is proving to be a pretty exhausting business in Ukraine. The
country has just had its third go at filling its 450-member Verkhovna Rada,
or parliament, and is still more than 40 short. Only nine new members were
voted in after last weekend's elections because rigid election rules,
inherited from the Soviet era, require at least a 50 per cent voter turnout.
Most Ukrainians, buffeted by economic hardships and an exhausting two-step
presidential election, have lost interest. Elections for the remaining seats
have now been put off indefinitely to give voters a rest from the ballot box
and to save money.

It would seem that China's lapdogs are destined to stay right there.
Beijing's City officials, having failed in repeated attempts to ban dogs
outright, have now drafted a law that prohibits their appearance from
markets, hotels, parks, schools, lifts, subways and public buses.
The poor pooches must only be exercised at night, by an adult and with
pooper scooper in-hand. These draconian restrictions are soon destined to
include an annual licence fee of 6,000 yuan - which is more than double
China's average annual urban income.
Dog peddlers are barking mad; a snowy white Pekinese that just a few months
ago would have fetched over 20,000 yuan (Dollars 2,350) is difficult to sell
for 500 yuan (Dollars 60). 'We can't even give them away,' said one.

Whoops. The Bank of England is just about to lose its top economic
forecaster. Paul Mortimer-Lee, 41, head of the Bank's economic forecasting
division, is off to be chief economist of Paribas Capital Markets in a
couple of months' time.
Most Bank economists jump ship at a much earlier stage in their careers, and
the loss of an official of Mortimer-Lee's seniority could be a bit of a blow
for the Bank. The operation of UK monetary policy depends very much on his
type of skill. Decisions on whether to raise or lower base rates are based
on a judgment of inflation 18 months to two years ahead, and the Bank has
sought to set the framework for such decisions through its quarterly
inflation reports.
Unless the Old Lady moves convincingly to plug the gap, it could find its
expertise challenged by the clever clogs at the Treasury and elsewhere.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: Phillip Thorpe - viticulteur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulating the UK fund management industry is not an occupation typically
seen as long on fizz, so Phillip Thorpe, chief executive of the
self-regulatory body Imro, must count as an exception.
It seems he is the proprietor of about 1,000 cases of last year's Cremant de
Loire, a sparkling wine made from a mixture of Chenin and Grolleau grapes
which emanates from just outside Saumur in the Loire Valley. It has recently
appeared on the list at The Alba restaurant in the City of London - thanks
to the efforts of Thorpe and his wife Melinda Lowis, from whose vineyard it
hails.
Appropriately enough for this New Zealand lawyer, Thorpe is applying
antipodean techniques and has hired a New South Wales winemaker to produce a
tipple - retailing at Pounds 6.50 a bottle - which he describes as
'recognisably Loire with touches of fruit and oak'.
The vineyard he and his wife bought four years ago, and which was last in
production some 40 years previously, now turns out 5,000 cases a year - of
the sparkling wine, a still red (Cabernet) and a still white (Chenin). So
Thorpe, who spends weekends in France in his capacity as 'chief financier,
odd job man and unqualified taster', reckons he has enough to permit the
first tentative steps into the UK.
Observer hears he has yet to make purchase of two cases of the Cremant a
condition of Imro membership.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Better schools for all
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the government first published league tables of school and college
performance in English public examinations two years ago, the move was
highly controversial. Enlightenment has now triumphed, and the Labour party
has renounced its opposition to the publication of performance yardsticks.
The challenge now is for politicians, irrespective of party, to develop
policies to improve the lamentable results achieved by the bottom fifth of
Britain's schools.
If extended to other government educational reforms, Labour's change of
heart may foster a welcome consensus on the basic structure of England's
education system. League tables are the first step. The next should be a
Labour commitment to preserve the autonomy of grant-maintained schools,
while vesting the government's necessary reserve powers in local education
authorities.
If Labour also bites the bullet of student finance, it could even lead the
education debate for the first time in the past decade. The recent report of
the party's social justice commission rightly recommended that students
should contribute to the cost of their tuition. It will not be possible to
sustain quality higher education without such a reform - unless other vital
parts of the education system, notably schools, are to be starved of
resources.
Yesterday's performance tables emphasise the work to be done at the pre-18
level. Although for the second year running the tables show improvements in
both GCSE and A-level performance, it is still the case that well under half
of England's 16-year-olds achieved at least five C grades at GCSE.
Truancy rates
Furthermore, that proportion - unacceptably low if Britain is to become a
high-skill economy in the foreseeable future - masks abysmal performance by
a significant minority of schools. Some inner city authorities reported
results barely half as good as the national average, with alarming truancy
rates and individual schools achieving hardly any GCSE passes at high
grades.
There are, of course, explanations aplenty. But none of them are of any help
to the children whose employment prospects are blighted by being unable to
function in jobs requiring basic numeracy and literacy. The publication of
exam results has helped to focus attention on the problem: in some cases
that attention alone has been a stimulant to improvement. But in more it has
simply exposed a failure which continues from year to year.
What is to be done? A host of government policies is on the table or in
operation, notably the rapid development of vocational qualifications to
cater for the less academically able, greater autonomy for school head
teachers and governors, more nursery education, more frequent school
inspections with the threat of task forces for schools which fail to
improve, and the provision of greater financial incentives for teachers.
Greater autonomy
Greater autonomy is valuable to successful schools; but it often exacerbates
the failure of the less successful. For that reason, the principle behind
the plan to send task forces into schools which are seriously failing is
sound. The government has yet to use its powers to do so. It should not
flinch from taking such action.
Only a small number of schools can be tackled by task forces. For the rest,
the development of nursery education and vocational qualifications are vital
priorities. It will not be easy to fund universal nursery provision, and
there are valid concerns about the new General National Vocational
Qualifications. But it would be a mistake to slow the pace of reform: all
four-year-olds should have access to a nursery place, and all secondary-age
pupils should have the option of taking rigorous vocational courses instead
of more traditional academic routes through school and college.
However, there is no use in pretending that educational reforms alone will
improve the lot of failing schools. The problems they face are as much
social as educational - rooted in poverty, family breakdown, racial tension
and urban blight. Most of the areas affected are run at local level by
Labour councils. A new partnership is needed between teachers, councils and
central government to improve inner city schools. If political parties could
exploit their new common ground to that purpose, they would deserve a higher
ranking in the public's estimation.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A different US outlook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The authors of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's
country reports are always at the mercy of somewhat lagged publication
dates. But this month's Congressional elections make the latest annual
survey of the US, published yesterday, read rather like an encouraging
mid-term report, for a pupil subsequently suspended.
One year on from its last assessment of the country's progress, the OECD's
verdict resembles that of the electorate: must try harder. Where it differs
is in believing that both President Bill Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, must deliver more of the same in the years
ahead for the economy's future to be secure. Much of the authors' short-term
analysis has been overtaken by the events of recent weeks. Their sobering
long-term prescriptions for the economy have not.
The US economy, in the OECD's view, has performed 'remarkably well' over the
past two years. 'The expansion has become more firmly established, and job
creation has accelerated, without the re-emergence of any wage and price
pressures thus far.' Unlike many US voters, the organisation awards some of
the credit for this achievement to Mr Greenspan and the administration.
By raising interest rates before any visible hints of inflation, Mr
Greenspan was quicker to tighten the monetary screws than his predecessors.
Many in the business community, predictably, griped. Yet, as the authors
point out, he was acting to slow a recovery very much of his own making.
Domestic demand
Low interest rates have played an unusually large role in driving the
present upturn. The report notes that, by the end of the second quarter of
1994, the interest rate-sensitive components of domestic demand - fixed
investment and durable goods consumption - had risen 30 per cent since the
recovery began at the start of 1991. This helped to deliver the 10 per cent
rise in gross domestic product over the same period, despite the fact that
other demand components rose only 5 per cent.
The organisation is duly sceptical about the possibility that current growth
rates can be sustained without a pick-up in inflation. Manufacturing
productivity has improved dramatically since 1990. Some, including Mr
Greenspan, hope that factors like computerisation and continued low
inflation may produce a structural improvement in the economy's efficiency.
But the OECD, at least, would not rely on it, predicting 2.8 per cent
inflation in 1995, up from this year's 2.1 per cent.
Interest rates
To judge by last week's monetary tightening, Mr Greenspan has decided to be
similarly cautious. Indeed, by raising interest rates by three-quarters of a
percentage point, he has already surpassed the half-point rise by year-end
which the authors expected when the report was written. Mr Greenspan's
decisiveness appears to have had a favourable impact on market expectations.
But the extra  1/4 per cent will give the OECD little reason to revise down
its prediction of 2.9 per cent growth in real GDP for 1995, down from around
3.8 per cent this year.
Updating the report's careful analysis of Mr Clinton's legislative efforts
will present more of a problem. Uncontroversially, the report singles out
the 1993 deficit reduction package as something of a landmark, crediting the
administration for two-thirds of the fall in the overall US budget deficit
in fiscal year 1993. This was 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1993, down from a
record 4.3 per cent in 1992.
The federal budget deficit is expected to fall to a low of Dollars 173bn in
1996. But, as the authors point out, it will then begin to rise again,
topping Dollars 200bn by 1999. Mr Clinton's other legislative programmes -
health care, welfare reform, 'reinventing government' and others - receive
plaudits from the authors, for addressing, if only on paper, the country's
long-term social and economic weaknesses.
Of course, these are all things which Mr Clinton failed to deliver in 1994.
Republicans in Congress might justifiably argue that the voters elected them
to achieve more, in these areas, than Mr Clinton. The danger is that they
will see it as a mandate to do less.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Stitched together for better or worse: Baby Bell phone
companies and US cable TV operators are increasingly chasing the same market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across the US, telephone companies are clubbing together to get into cable
television. Cable companies are clubbing together to get into telephony.
Telephone and cable companies are getting together with each other - and
with the entertainment business.
Next month's Dollars 10bn-plus auction of mobile phone licences by the US
government is triggering a transformation of the communications industry.
But the strategic issue is wider than a race for licences. Companies are
positioning themselves to supply America's homes with an enormous range of
services, from simple phone calls to dial-a-video and armchair shopping.
The two main groups of contestants are the regional phone companies,
otherwise known as Baby Bells, and the cable TV operators. Technically, each
group is now capable of doing the other's job. But as regulated local
monopolies, they have been kept apart by government decree.
Now technological change is creating new opportunities for them to sell each
other's services that are outrunning government's ability to police their
separation. The barriers between them are breaking down.
In the short term, the results could be damaging for both industries. As
Salomon Brothers' telecoms analyst Mr Jack Grubman points out, neither local
telephony nor cable is a growth market in the US.
Annual turnover in US local telephony is put at Dollars 90bn (Pounds 55bn),
cable at Dollars 20bn. More than 90 per cent of US homes have a telephone,
and local telephone sales are rising only in line with inflation. The cable
companies pass 90 per cent of homes and serve 75 per cent.
'Anybody who doesn't have cable,' says Mr Grubman, 'doesn't want it, can't
afford it or has a satellite dish.'
If these two powerful industries invade each other's territory with
investment plans totalling billions of dollars, the inevitable result will
be vastly increased supply and plunging prices. Yet both industries are
planning to spend Dollars 1,000 per customer to duplicate each other's
business, says Mr Grubman.
Some would dispute the figure - the cable companies, in particular, argue
their investment will be smaller. They already have sophisticated networks
in the ground that can carry both TV and telephony, while the phone
companies' networks still consist mostly of old copper wire that cannot
carry TV.
But a battle between the two is now inevitable. Mr Fred Salerno,
vice-chairman of New York regional phone company Nynex, says: 'We see two
full service providers passing houses in America: one a cable company that
looks like a telephone company, the other a telephone company that looks
like a cable company.'
And, he concedes, it will be costly. 'There's no doubt the market will be
somewhat bloodied for a while. Margins will shrink and market shares will
shift.'
The telephone companies, he argues, have three basic advantages. First,
since they need to modernise their networks anyway, adding the capacity to
carry entertainment services comes virtually free. 'We can almost justify
putting broadband networks out there just on grounds of cost reduction, so
the incremental cost of new services is correspondingly low.'
Second, he says, the phone companies have much stronger balance sheets. This
is true in most cases: as long-established monopolies, the Baby Bells have
enormously strong cash flow; cable is a relatively young industry, still
carrying debt from its start-up investment and facing the costs of a new
round of competition.
The cable companies retort that their shareholders know all about that. As
the chief executive of one large cable company puts it: 'Our investors
permit us the luxury of big capital investments for future growth. The Baby
Bells are income stocks and are expected to pay dividends, which is a huge
capital requirement every year.'
Third, Mr Salerno says, customers prefer the telephone companies for
reliability. Historically, the cable companies were created to entertain,
not to provide an essential service. Understanding entertainment gives them
a valuable edge in the coming battle with the phone companies. But their
record in providing service and fixing faults has been correspondingly poor
and, while they claim to have made great strides lately, their image may
still tell against them.
The telephone companies, by contrast, are utilities with a statutory
obligation to provide universal service. If a phone line goes down in the
small hours of a Sunday morning, it is their job to fix it.
'Our primary research suggests,' says Mr Salerno, 'that if we can offer the
same services as a cable company, we'll get the business.'
However, the battle between telephone and cable companies will be
complicated by the growing competition in mobile telecommunications.
In the past, mobile telephony in the US has been restricted by statute to
two networks per region. Typically, these are old-fashioned analogue systems
with limited capacity; as they are upgraded to digital technology, their
capacity will increase at least threefold.
On top of that, the government will next month auction broadband mobile
frequencies for personal communications services (or PCS), which will carry
mobile telecommunications but also other data. There will be as many as six
per region by 1997-98.
The result, says one cable executive, is that 'we will be awash with
wireless capacity'. Charges for mobile telephony are likely to fall as a
result.
At present, says Mr Grubman of Salomon, mobile telephony does not eat into
conventional local telephone services. 'When it costs 50 per cent less (than
now),' he says, 'it could start to.'
Yet both telephone and cable companies are forming alliances with each
other, with the long-distance operators and with the entertainment business
to bid for the new networks. One might therefore ask why the telephone and
cable companies are so keen to join the bidding.
It is here that one runs up against a buzz-phrase in the industry: the value
chain. A continuum, it is said, has developed all the way from wires in the
ground to Hollywood movies or interactive video games: or, as the jargon has
it, between conduit and content.
The telephone and cable companies fear that the value will migrate from the
conduit end of the chain to the content end. Hence last month's alliance
between three of the Baby Bells and a leading Hollywood talent agency, the
aim being to secure a supply of films and other entertainment to put through
the Baby Bells' new cable networks.
At present, this is understandable: the explosive growth in the cable/phone
networks is running ahead of the entertainment industry's ability to feed
it. The logical safeguard against such uncertainty is to be in everything at
once. As Mr Salerno of Nynex puts it: 'Since you don't know where the value
is in the chain, you need to be all the way up and down it.'
There will be two notable absentees from the bidding: MCI, the
second-biggest US long-distance phone company, and media giant Time Warner,
America's second biggest cable company. Both are working on a simple
premise: that as overcapacity develops, they will be able to pick up mobile
phone licences cheaply in their own time.
For the industry as a whole, however, the flourishing alliances involve much
duplication of resources. Inevitably some of the investments now being made
will in the future look to have been a monstrous waste.
Mr Richard Bodmin, head of strategy at AT&amp;T, the biggest US long-distance
phone company, says that the duplication is necessary. 'The way we get more
efficient in this country is through experiment,' he says. 'It's only
wasteful from the standpoint of a philosopher king with a view of how it
ought to work out.'
Mr Bodmin adds that the risk of industry overcapacity is prob-ably not
serious over a 15-year period.
'You're going to get periods of oversupply in given areas, and if you take
any one part of the network, there might be a year or two when it looks kind
of black. But over 15 years, we're nowhere near the end of good ideas to put
down the line.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Personal View: Importance of Nordic influence in EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARL BILDT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Finland and Sweden are firmly set to join the European Union next
year, and Norway is more likely than not to follow, the character of
European co-operation is bound to change. Assuming Norway votes Yes in the
referendum on November 28, one person in four around the EU discussion table
will come from a Nordic country. The northern perspective will have an
important impact on the future of the Union.
This applies not least to efforts to build a common foreign and security
policy that can actively contribute to stability in areas that were formerly
part of the Soviet bloc. It is often overlooked that Russian power in Europe
now directly meets the west and its different institutions only in the areas
of the Baltic and Barents Sea.
The region around St Petersburg, by far the largest European city north of
London, Paris and Moscow, is set to recover its old role as the window to
the west of the Russian lands. The city's impressive industrial and
scientific talent, derived from the concentration of military-industrial
resources in the region, will give it a key role in the transformation of
the Russian economy.
Yet there will be difficulties as well as opportunities. In coming decades
the Nordic countries will be forced to concentrate a large part of their
foreign and security policy on present and potential problems in the area
stretching from Kaliningrad in the south to the Kola peninsula in the north.
These border lands between Russia and the west may become the most
impressive growth region in Europe in coming decades. But we cannot ignore
risks for the reform process in Russia and for political stability in and
around the three Baltic countries. The revanchists of the extreme right and
left are far from dominating Russia's political scene. Yet any sign that
their influence is growing will send shock waves into the Baltic region and
then the entire European system.
In their own interests, as well as those of the wider Europe, the Nordic
countries will want early progress towards bringing the Baltic states firmly
into the structures of European co-operation. With EU agreements on Baltic
trade and economic co-operation now in place, the new Nordic members will be
pressing for the Baltic countries to take part in the EU's future
enlargement towards eastern and central Europe. The Baltic states share in
many respects the same reform policies and western orientation as countries
like Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic.
Along with a desire for further co-operation in the Baltic and Barents Sea
regions, the Nordic states will bring to the EU a sharpening of the debate
on reforming welfare systems. Although Nordic economic growth in 1995 is
likely to be above the OECD average, the structural problems of the welfare
state have left Denmark with appalling long-term unemployment and Sweden
with a huge public debt.
Achieving solutions to these issues will not be easy. The debate on the
Swedish EU referendum, and the recent general election, demonstrated the
strength of 'welfare isolationism' in Sweden. There is still an unrealistic
belief that the now-extinct 'Swedish model' has given us a society generally
superior to those in other parts of Europe.
Early next year, under procedures laid down by the Maastricht treaty, the
new Nordic members will have to present to the EU their economic convergence
programmes. Norway will not have any difficulties. But in Sweden the deep
split over the EU in the Social Democratic party, combined with the coming
elections for the European parliament, may exacerbate political tensions.
If Norway rejects the EU on November 28, the effects on Sweden and Finland -
and Norway as well - will be limited. Nonetheless a Norwegian No would mark
the end of the important work in recent years for the renaissance of Nordic
co-operation in a European framework. Perhaps wavering Norwegians in rural
and northern areas can be persuaded in time that EU membership is a safer
option than a weak link within the European Economic Area.
The Nordic countries must make clear the importance of their northern
perspective. Perhaps most important of all is the Nordic states' attitude to
the larger questions of European co-operation that will be on the agenda at
the 1996 intergovernmental conference. In the near term, psychological and
political difficulties brought to the surface during the referendum debates
might make them appear somewhat reluctant partners. But over the longer term
the Nordic states' national interests and natural abilities will drive them
in the right direction: to play a full part in the wider process of European
integration.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor case against soft commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW SMITHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex's comments on soft commission (November 17) were ill-considered.
There is no case against soft commission that is not also an argument
against all forms of commission and, while payment for services via
commission leads to abuse, it certainly need not.
Payment for research has traditionally been made through commissions.
Forcing these payments to be restricted to houses which offer dealing
services as well as research will reduce the ease of entry and restrict
competition. Measures that contribute to reduced competition are clearly in
the interests of integrated securities businesses and it is fair to point
out that Mercury Asset Management is part of a large integrated securities
business.
It is important that commissions payments of all kinds should not be abused,
but it is equally important that abuses should not arise through fund
management companies being owned by broker/dealers. The regulations designed
to achieve these ends should not, however, serve only to reduce competition.
The Financial Times does not normally support anti-competitive measures and
it is sad to see Lex doing so.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Expediency in Euro airline decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFFREY LIPMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Betts's article on European airline competition ('Struggle at the
airport gates', November 10), underplays one important dimension of the
issue. Fifteen months ago the European Commission appointed its 'Comite des
Sages' (Wisemen's Committee) to propose a way forward for Europe's
floundering airlines.
The Comite's report, widely hailed as a beacon for future development,
concluded that only elimination of state protectionism, and creation of a
genuine 'level playing field' in the European market, would force European
airlines to restructure to be cost-efficient, global competitors.
Shortly after the report was published, the Air France decision was released
 -paying lip service to the detailed Sages conditions, but qualifying each
with legal or bureaucratic nuances effectively to remove the teeth.
Take a few examples:
The report said: 'A privatisation plan must be in place.' The decision
acknowledges: 'Best efforts will be made for privatisation.'
The report said: 'There must be a published independent assessment of any
restructuring plan before implemention.' The decision: 'Has no prior
independent assessment.'
The report said: 'The restructuring should be monitored by independent
experts.' The decision says: 'If the Commission considers it necessary.'
Of course the Sages' recommendations were not sacrosanct - the Commission
was free to accept, reject or amend the proposals. But what is regrettable
for Europe is that the objective analysis and pragmatic safeguards of the
Sages' report have been neatly side-stepped, and political expediency has
played a large role - the very thing which the recommendations sought to
overcome.
Unless the courts amend this decision, or new transport commissioner Neil
Kinnock revisits it, the liberalisation cause will have been set back five
years, and with it the thousands of jobs riding on the travel tourism output
and export revenue that a competitive air transport system can deliver.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Ambitious for global growth: The success of UK investment
bank BZW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has not been a happy year for UK investment banks.
Since the tightening of US monetary policy in February started to disrupt
financial markets and deny the banks easy trading profits, firms such as SG
Warburg have disclosed sharply reduced profits and announced plans to
tighten their belts. The upset has renewed doubts that any UK investment
bank has either the capital or the expertise to rival large US firms such as
Goldman Sachs.
Yet Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, has
survived the turmoil with plans for expansion intact. Its trading technology
and innate caution have brought profits of Pounds 194m in the first half of
1994, despite the difficult trading conditions. And it has started a review
that is likely to lead to a push into the US capital markets.
Created in the run-up to the Big Bang deregulation of the City of London in
the mid-1980s, BZW started a long way behind established UK merchant banks,
such as Warburg. However, it could yet emerge with the best claim to be a
global investment bank.
It has been helped by three strengths:
Innovation: the firm was formed when Barclays acquired stockbroker de Zoete
and Bevan and equity marketmaker Wedd Durlacher and combined them with its
own relatively weak merchant bank. As a newcomer, BZW had to devise and sell
new products to gain business.
'We were not able to grow like a classic UK merchant bank, so we had to do
it the other way round,' says Sir Peter Middleton, BZW's chairman.
Rather than waiting for companies to ask it to raise debt or equity on their
behalf, BZW approached them with ideas that it believed would attract
institutional investors. Last year, for example, it advised 19 UK companies
on issuing enhanced scrip dividends to reduce their tax bills.
'You sit at the cross-roads between issuers and investors listening to the
babble, and you try to pick out strands,' says Mr Amir Eilon, joint head of
BZW's debt capital markets group.
Consistency: it has not attempted to establish trading arms outside the UK
except in countries where it has built up a business in originating and
underwriting securities.
'There is no point in setting up a huge, powerful infrastructure for selling
equities if you do not have a sensible flow of primary business,' says Mr
Graham Pimlott, BZW's head of merchant banking.
This has limited opportunities in some of the fastest expanding markets, but
means that once BZW has moved into a country, it is likely to stay. In
Japan, for example, it has maintained its presence despite making poor
returns after the downturn in equity markets.
'We do not believe in pulling out of things because of a temporary loss of
business or momentum, so we are careful about entering in the first place,'
says Mr Jonathan Davie, head of equities.
Risk management: BZW has powerful software to manage risk that helped
prevent trading losses in this year's difficult conditions. 'This year, we
have been very good at managing risks down in uncertain markets,' says Mr
Andrew Bruce, head of risk management.
The technique should also help allocate capital to activities with the
highest returns, one reason why Barclays has brought its lending to large
companies outside the UK under BZW's control, and is moving towards the same
approach for UK companies.
Yet for all these strengths, BZW also faces obstacles. The largest one is
its weakness in advising big UK companies on corporate strategy, an activity
that generates income in secondary activities.
Mr Pimlott assesses BZW's position in the field as being 'at the bottom of
the first division, but very much in it'. Mr David Band, chief executive,
admits progress has been slower than originally expected because of
entrenched loyalties to other banks in the UK market.
Comparing BZW with Warburg, Mr Band says: 'We have got the products and are
building the clients, while they have got the clients and are filling in the
products.' But displacing old-established firms such as Warburg as advisers
is a hard task. 'There is a system of appointed merchant bankers and
brokers, and you usually only get the chance to dislodge them when they have
mucked something up, or there is a conflict,' says Mr Band.
Another difficulty is BZW's lack of a strong arm issuing and trading US
equities and bonds, which limits its claim to be a global player. At the
moment, it has small US bond operations, and sells only European and Asian
equities there. It has just launched a review to find a way of correcting
this, and must choose between trying to grow the business organically,
forming a partnership with a US investment bank, or possibly acquiring a
smaller US securities house.
However, BZW has one advantage over competitors: access to capital from the
parent bank. This gives it the strength to expand through acquisition, and
allows it to operate with less day-to-day capital than free-standing rivals.
Mr Chris Ellerton, a bank analyst at Warburg, estimates that BZW would
require more than twice its level of equity capital if it operated as an
independent firm and wanted the capital strength of JP Morgan, the US bank.
Its ability, as a subsidiary of Barclays, to operate with less day-to-day
capital tends to flatter its profits. BZW reported a 42 per cent return on
net assets last year, making it hugely profitable. But the figure would have
been lower if it had operated with the amount of capital needed to stand
alone. Rivals also argue that profits are inflated by the integration of
Barclays' money markets and foreign exchange operations within BZW.
Its dependence on Barclays for capital backing creates a further obstacle in
establishing a clear image for BZW with potential customers. Mr Band says
that it has further to go in this regard, including disclosure of more
financial information than the bare pre-tax profit published at the moment.
'I think we'd be perceived as more valuable if people knew more about how we
were made up,' he says.
Yet BZW's greatest weapon against US investment banks may be outside its
control. If European capital markets be-came less fragmented, and a stronger
pool of institutional investment funds developed, Europe could start to
rival the US as a target for companies raising capital. This would help
leading European investment banks drum up business from those companies.
Until that happens, BZW and its European rivals will find it a struggle to
become true global players.

FT  22 NOV 94 / The odour of rising damp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If they had privatised the Conservative party its board would be in a right
old pickle. Think about it. There they would sit, the dignitaries of Tory
Promotions plc, dog-eared copies of the latest consultants' report spread
out before them. Report? That is not the word. The note prepared by Mr John
Maples is the most devastating indictment of a sinking enterprise since Noah
was informed, following in-depth qualitative research, that there was a
distinct odour of rising damp about the place.
The deputy chairman of the party did not intend that his charge-sheet should
be published. He might have known better. My colleague Robert Peston
reproduced its main points in yesterday's FT. It says, very nearly in so
many words, that the government has been seen through by a significant
proportion of the voters who supported it in April 1992. 'We must deliver
improved results in the four key areas of the economy, law and order,
education and health,' writes Mr Maples.
Quite so. But does he fully appreciate what he is saying? Sure he does. He
is as an affable and apparently straightforward fellow. He is telling Mr
John Major, for whose perusal the note was intended, that after 15 years of
Conservative rule, four of them under the prime minister, people feel
insecure about jobs and living standards. They doubt the government's
competence, and suspect its motives. They are nervous about the prospects
for treatment in hospitals. They deplore the collapse of families, values
and morality, wince at school closures, and - unkindest cut of all - believe
that Labour would be more likely than the Tories to restore law and order.
Nor is the boss himself spared. 'Special consideration and planning is
needed for the prime minister's activities to give meaning and focus to
everything else we do,' he writes circumspectly on page 12, echoing page 2's
call for 'purpose and direction'.
There we have it. Mr Maples's thesis is a cry of despair. He has analysed
the results of detailed interviews with 80 people who voted Tory last time,
but who doubt that they will again. Every Tory MP with a majority under
20,000 knows why. 'So, what can we do . . .?' wails the deputy chairman. He
hopes that better news management will help the party explain that 'four or
even five years of recovery with no rise in living standards' is 'good for
the longer term'. You can appreciate the difficulty by noting one particular
paragraph in the appendix to his memorandum. Voters, it appears, have come
to believe that 'although in the 1980s the Conservatives seemed to promise a
classless society of opportunity, the reality is now that the rich are
getting richer on the backs of the rest, who are getting poorer'.
Funny about that. Fate has so arranged matters that Robert Peston's scoop
appeared on the same day as the announcement by British Gas that its top
managers are to pay themselves up to 75 per cent more. This self-improvement
plan is exceeded in the modesty of its aspirations only by the delicacy of
its timing and the tact with which it has been conveyed. It follows the
latest round of gas price increases, which will be higher for those who fail
to pay by direct debit. Clearly, British Grab likes to have its hand in your
pocket. It feels more comfortable there.
The voters who told Mr Maples that they worry about their jobs will note
that the performance indicators upon which privatised industry directors are
basing their handouts to themselves move sharply upwards whenever employees
are sacked. Hence the motto of the 1990s: downsizing equals upbonusing.
Labour cannot lose on this one. All it has to do is remark in tones of
injured innocence that the government could give the regulators of
privatised monopolies stronger powers. Mr Major has time in which to act.
His publicly owned administration is sitting on a five-year contract. A
private-sector Tory Promotions board would feel less secure. Its members
would be trembling at their deputy chairman's report. The poor boobies would
not know whether to resign or award themselves double pay, triple bonuses,
and universal options.
Do not misunderstand me. Labour could yet lose the next election, even
against this imperfect government. It is good at losing. Bear with me as I
shuffle my files. Yes. Here it is. Any Southern Comfort?, the mirror-image
of the Maples report, was published in September. This Fabian pamphlet, by
Giles Radice and Stephen Pollard, noted the failings of the people's party.
It, too, drew on focus-group research into potential Labour voters. It found
that while Labour is better regarded than it was, it is still on probation.
White-collar and skilled manual employees are worried about crime, jobs,
health care, their children's futures. Labour has not yet convinced
sufficient potential converts that it will make the streets safe and enlarge
the employment market without raising taxes or restarting inflation.
See? Mr Tony Blair's repositioning of his party has indeed only begun.
Yesterday Mr Pollard, he of the Radice-Pollard pamphlet, argued, in a paper
published by the Social Market Foundation, that Labour should explicitly
embrace the market. In The market and Clause IV he offers an idealist's
version of the statement of aims that will shortly be put before Labour's
national executive. He wants references to trade unions and nationalisation
out, and a statement that the market is the only efficient means of
allocating resources in. Mr Blair may do all that, but not so starkly. He
could waffle on about ethics and little else, but that would be to dodge the
issue. He could resort to cloudy talk of public ownership in auspicious
circumstances, but then he might as well keep the present quasi-Marxist
formulation.
Whatever he does he had better not dilly-dally. Next week the chancellor
will deliver what may become the last budget before tax cuts are back in
fashion. That will lay the groundwork for a 'responsible' act of brigandage.
Next year, or the year after, or in both years, Mr Kenneth Clarke, finance
director of Tory Promotions plc, will try what has worked so well in the
past. He will bribe the shareholders with their own money. The Maples memo
can then be shredded. Glued to the national lottery, this nation of suckers
may once again get the government it deserves.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share dealing risks in Russia
eliminated by new systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KAREN ANTONYAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Fears over share security deter investors in Russia'
(November 16), merely encourages investors' belief that all share
transactions in Russia carry a high risk of fraud. In practice, experienced,
reputable brokerages have developed procedures that all but eliminate the
settlement and custodial risks referred to.
The Sirius computerised settlements system, currently being adopted by a
number of the latest Russian enterprises, including Surgutneftegaz and
Yuganskneftegaz, provides buyers and sellers with a secure and auditable
mechanism. Electronic trading systems are being introduced by KPMG while DCC
is developing a secure custodial system.
Russian securities law may be in its infancy, but it still provides strong
and clear redress for investors who find themselves in conflict with factory
managers and their registrars. The main deterrent to increased investment in
Russia may well be the disproportionate publicity afforded to incidents such
as Transworld's.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, The FT particularly will realise that there are losers in all types of
business endeavour. Why should network marketing be any different?
It is very sad that Bethan Hutton's article (Weekend Money: 'Inside the
pyramid game', November 19) fails to mention any of the positive aspects of
the Amway business, the important part Bris and Kerry Bovill have played in
developing that business and, in so doing, the opportunities they have
created for hundreds if not thousands of people facing a bleak and uncertain
future.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nicaragua hindered by stabilisation
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Orlebar's article, 'Nicaragua limps back to life' (November 1),
is mistaken in saying there has been no economic growth in Nicaragua since
the 1970s. In fact, following the Sandinista revolution in 1979, the
country's gross domestic product expanded at an average rate of 4.8 per cent
a year from 1980 to 1983.
One important reason for the decline from 1984 onwards was the lack of
access to foreign finance, mainly due to the economic boycott of Nicaragua
instituted by the US government. Since the UNO government took office in
1990, though, the country has received exceptionally large amounts of
foreign finance, with loans and donations amounting to almost 40 per cent of
GDP a year.
However, much of this finance was conditional on the government implementing
one of the most hard-hitting stabilisation and structural adjustment
programmes in Latin America. This has led to a situation where, according to
government figures, 55 per cent of the population is now without a proper
job, and poverty has increased strikingly, especially in rural areas.
Mr Orlebar gives the impression that little has yet changed in the public
sector, but this is not true. Government consumption has been cut by a
third, employment has been reduced by 20 per cent, and nearly all the
country's 350 nationalised companies have been privatised.
The key problem in Nicaragua is that, despite all the foreign finance, after
three years of structural adjustment policies, the economy has still not
demonstrated any significant growth.
Imports of expensive consumer goods have flourished, to the benefit of a
small minority, but the balance of payments has deteriorated and private
investment is now even lower than it was in 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SEPPO RAISANEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Emma Tucker's article (Perspectives: 'Welcome to Soviet Belgium',
November 12) about Soviet Belgium's burrocracia (as the Brazilians write it)
in the strongest way indicates the need for the so-called developed
countries to adopt the Brazilian despachante (expeditor) system.
Despachante is the full-time professional interface who, for a modest fee,
makes all direct contact between an expat or a native and officialdom
(customs, police, tax men, including the paying of fines and buying of
'presents') unnecessary. The only thing he cannot do is provide his
customer's fingerprints.
All this without a treaty against bureaucracy - written by whom? The
bureaucrats?

FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: My Night with Reg - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alas, poor Reg. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite bonkability . . .
knew him in the Biblical sense.
Horatio, in this case, is Guy, a confirmed bachelor who is nearing 40 and
who does a lot of listening. My Night with Reg - one of the several success
stories of 1994, now reaching the West End after its acclaimed opening in
March at the Royal Court's little Theatre Upstairs  - is a wistful comedy by
Kevin Elyot about six gay Englishmen during the last ten years. Reg, whom we
never see and who dies before the second of the play's three scenes, was a
right little goer; but only Guy begins to discover how much so, as each of
the other men start to confide in him.
Not that Reg was unique. Daniel (his official lover) and John (his most
smitten secret lover) used to get around no end until he entered their
lives. Once he leaves their lives, they pick up the old promiscuity where
they left off. All of this they tell to Guy, who is still languishing, 15
years after Oxford days, with a love for John that he never confesses.
Guy knits ('a cover for my door-sausage, actually') and has bestial 'phone
sex with Brad, whom he has never met ('a lorrydriver, he says. I suspect
he's a florist, but what's it matter?') and listens and frets. Yet cruel
fate has it that it is poor, neurotic, spinsterish Guy who, to our surprise,
departs, of Aids, before the third scene.
My Night with Reg switches from farce to pathos and back again throughout;
it is studded with lines so funny that the audience guffaws for the next
half-minute; it rings so many bells for me that I wonder if Elyot and I have
friends in common; and it has brilliant effects of suspense. William Dudley
has designed a gorgeous interior set that fills the large Criterion stage.
And Roger Michell's direction negotiates the trickiest moments - men in
tears or starting to make love with each other - with extraordinary
persuasiveness.
I wish, however, that the play did not come garlanded with press quotations
that speak in superlatives and about genius; and I wish, for its sake, that
it did not reach the West End towards the end of a year which has already
brought a billion plays about homosexuality to British stages. (How many
plays are there around to take one's aunts to, for heaven's sake?)
Most of the Reg characters are too close for me to caricature for me to care
much about them. Sure, I experienced a succession of various tiny pangs on
their behalf. John Sessions brings immense braggadocio panache to Daniel -
but about half his role consists of comic set pieces, and he delivers them
as such. David Bamber overdoes the knock-kneed neurosis of Guy, a role that
surely could stand more dignity; I could not believe that the other
characters could bear the respect for him they claimed. Only the pathos of
John - the most physically attractive and the most spiritually doomed - is
seriously affecting, and unusual. And Anthony Calf's interpretation of this
dear unhappy beauty, utterly absorbed in his own pointless and charming
life, is astonishing - a study in golden hopelessness.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Primitivism given the nod - An overdue retrospective
of Frank Dobson's sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Dobson died in the summer of 1963 at the age of 77, closing a career
which had brought him early critical success but ended in illness and
comparative neglect. He was recognised as a distinguished artist up to a
point - Royal Academician, sometime Professor of Sculpture at the Royal
College and all that. And he had continued to work until his last few years.
Indeed he was responsible for the Zodiacal clock which happily still
animates the preserved facade of Bracken House, the old headquarters of the
Financial Times, beside St Paul's.
Even so, he was to be memorialised in that very British, faintly patronising
way, as an artist whose talent had been unsustained, his promise
unfulfilled. With the judgment of his obituary in The Times was a hint as to
why this should be so: '. . . the intrinsic merit of his work . . . always
commanding respect, even though it was to some extent overshadowed by, or at
all events less spectacular than, that of some of his contemporaries.' Yes
indeed, and it is by the nicest irony that this present exercise in critical
rehabilitation - which is entirely welcome - should be undertaken under the
aegis of the Henry Moore Foundation and its Institute for Sculpture at
Leeds.
For Dobson was of the generation of artists that immediately preceded that
of Henry Moore, trained in the years before the Great War and declaring a
first creative maturity in the first years of the peace, when the Moores,
the Hepworths and the Skeapings were still at art school. His immediate
sculptor peers were such artists as Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and
Gaudier-Brzeska, and like them and their pre-war contemporaries abroad -
Kirchner, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani - he was already well aware of the
invigorating creative possibilities opened up by the example of primitive
and ancient sculpture.
The earliest piece in this show, a crouching figure carved in sandstone,
arms crossed and head laid back flat upon the shoulders, dates from 1915,
and openly declares the clear if generalised influence of pre-Columbian
carving, a source which a dozen years later we find Henry Moore tacitly
reserving to himself. It is easy to forget just how general the interest in
the primitive was even by the turn of the century, with Gauguin away in the
South Seas, and how strong its effects upon both painting and sculpture
across Europe. It is equally easy to forget quite how effective Moore and
his critical apologists, Herbert Read and Adrian Stokes, were in rewriting
the critical history of British Sculpture, AM as it were, and PM.
The reputations of Gill, Gaudier, and Epstein especially, have been
reappraised and much restored in recent years. That of Dobson, who in the
early 1920s was widely considered the best of them all, alone has continued
to wither in neglect almost until now. There is no need for us to swing back
to the adulatory excesses of Roger Fry, who considered Dobson's to be the
first true and pure sculpture ever to be attempted in England, or Clive
Bell, who thought he 'promised to become the best (sculptor) we have
produced for centuries', to find such neglect, on the evidence of this
beautiful exhibition, both gross and unfair.
But we can also begin to understand quite why he fell so out of favour. He
would always be safe enough for a public commission here, an offical
exhibition abroad there, to be chosen for the aborted Venice Biennale of
1940, for example, or in 1951 to be given a commission for the Festival of
Britain. But we can see now that even at his most popular and celebrated
moment in the 1920s, he never was a truly avant-garde or experimental
artist. That nod towards the primitive was no more than a nod, and his truer
sympathies lay with that more classical strain in modern European sculpture
represented by Maillol and Bourdelle.
And why not? Dobson was ever intelligent and sensitive in his modernism,
looking to such as Matisse and Picasso as it suited him but never
self-consciously or artificially. And if the natural development of his work
led him away from abstraction or an extreme formal distortion, it should
never be a criticism of an artist to accuse him of not being avant-garde.
But our age would seem to require it. Dobson was never the greatest of our
sculptors, his example more useful for the probity of his craftsmanship than
for any conceptual innovation. Do the reclining figures of the 1920s show a
way that Moore would follow yet never admit? Do the combined heads and
figures offer a link to Gaudier and Modigliani? Do the little bronzes look
to Matisse and Degas? The arguments go round and round. It should be enough
that in the works shown here, notably an exquisite torso of 1928, and the
larger figure, 'Cornucopia' of 1927, in both of which the figure turns with
the easiest of grace, he produced some of the most beautiful and
accomplished carvings of his time.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Goals for ABSA winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leyton Orient are not winning many soccer matches this season but they
scored at the annual prize giving of the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts yesterday, the jolly when corporate sponsors are
rewarded for their commitment to the arts.
The 'O's won the award for increasing access to the arts. The club
commissioned Arc Theatre to write a play about racism and tour local schools
with it. The aim was to attract more young blacks and Asians to its matches.
The ABSA winners were the usual mix of the imaginative and the predictable.
The Royal Bank of Scotland deserved recognition for its corporate programme
which has kept the arts afloat in Scotland, most notably the Edinburgh
Festival and Scottish Opera, and Lloyds Bank won again, this time for youth
sponsorship through its Film Challenge.
Other deserving cases were Manchester Airport, which took the International
Sponsorship prize for taking Contact Theatre and Tara Arts abroad, and Ernst
&amp; Young, which, as a first time sponsor, committed a great deal of cash to
the Picasso show at the Tate.
Underlining that sponsorship now positively embraces the avant-garde were
the prizes for Beck's Beer, which preserved Rachel Whiteread's concrete
'House' beyond its demolition date, and Ibstock, which took the new category
of sponsorship in kind by providing the 50 tonnes of clay sculptor Antony
Gormley needed for the 43,000 figures in his work 'Field for the British
Isles.'
Dartington Crystal won the Long Term Commitment award; Allied Domecq the
Single Project, for its Pounds 3m support for the RSC; and Barefoot Books
was the small business winner for helping Polka Theatre. The Guinness Award
went to the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, which has acquired 12 new sponsors in
the past year, while the Business in the Arts Adviser for 1994 is Mike
Stallard of London Underground.
Arthur Andersen sponsored the Awards along with The Times, whose critics'
award went to the New Contemporaries touring arts exhibition. After five
years BT has done its bit and this annual show, which lifted the careers of
David Hockney and Damien Hirst, needs a new backer.

We tend to think of Coward as a playwright of the 1920s, '30s and '40s.
Congratulations therefore to the Greenwich Theatre for reviving his 1966
play A Song at Twilight. As it begins, it reminds you of sundry other Coward
plays. But, as it develops, it also reveals a gift for suspense that Coward
had seldom employed. Then, seriously, it addresses a subject that had
underlain all Coward's earlier oeuvre but round which he had always,
childishly, skirted.
One of the several ways in which A Song takes your breath away is the
hostile light in which the male protagonist - Coward's own role - is viewed.
The role has wit and a certain urbane charm, on the surface; and no doubt
Coward himself made the most of those. But then the play peels that surface
away.
We see Sir Hugo Latymer, an eminent elderly writer living in Switzerland,
being beastly to his wife Hilde. She doubles as his secretary, and their
relationship is a development of that of Garry and Monica in Present
Laughter. We see him being charming to his young butler, Felix. But all
this, we sense, is preamble to the arrival of his old flame, Carlotta.
Carlotta turns out to be a well-preserved and much-married lady aged about
50; and the degree to which she skirmishes with Hugo and reminds him of the
past makes her a successor to Garry's wife Liz and the seductress Joanna,
both in Present Laughter. But all this is also preamble.
The most daring feature of Tom Smith's excellent Greenwich production is how
uncharming and unsympathetic it makes Sir Hugo from the first. John Quentin,
who plays the role, is testy, acid, defensive. His lack of charm makes him
an unnatural Cowardian, but has the advantage of ensuring that we face
head-on Hugo's unpleasant hypocrisies, cruelties, evasions. Gideon Davey,
the designer, has given Hugo's sitting-room a glacial air. Lois Baxter, as
the elegant Carlotta, has both the rapier conversational technique and the
womanly charm to point up all the more clearly what Hugo lacks. Alison
Skillbeck, as Hilde, neatly catches the dowdiness, forbearance, and
pragmatism that have been necessary to live with this man for 20 years.
If you are inclined to see this play, read no further; just go. For the best
fun of A Song is its suspense. The skeleton in Hugo's cupboard which
Carlotta finally addresses is his own homosexuality. We reach it,
melodramatically, just before the interval. But the beauty of the play is
that Carlotta is not blackmailing Hugo, though he presumes she is. She
simply wants him to admit not merely that he has a homosexual past, not
merely that his thoughts have been homosexual all his life, but most
importantly his own capacity for loving anyone.
It is this link between Hugo's sexual repression and his misanthropy that is
the play's most exciting feature. It illumines everything; the preamble, we
see, was not preamble at all. And the play's wordless conclusion - Hugo's
gasping reaction as he re-reads the letters he once wrote to the man who was
his one true love - suggests that his own ice is indeed about to crack. A
Song at Twilight is Coward's most adult play, and so this revival does him
honour.
At the Greenwich Theatre, SE10.

It comes as a shock to realise that Henri Cartier-Bresson is still alive. So
many of his photographs have passed into the common currency of images it's
sometimes hard to remember they are the work of an individual vision rather
than a mass race memory. The French photographer, now 86, is the subject of
Omnibus (10.25, BBC1), that fascinatingly tries to pin-down the elusive, to
freeze the momentary and preserve the fleeting - like photography;
particularly Cartier-Besson's own. Like his compatriot, Olivier Messiaen,
who composed his Quartet for the End of Time as a result, Cartier-Bresson
was in a wartime prison camp. If Jean Renoir was right in maintaining that
Hollywoood needed a few bombs dropped on it, does suffering really sharpen
the creative juices?
More visual art, or possibly not, in Without Walls: the Turner Prize (9pm,
Channel 4). The brouhaha contrasts agreeably with the cosiness of last
night's Evening Standard Drama Awards or tonight's Royal Film Performance
(11.40pm, ITV). What with that and royal variety shows, HM deserves a large
tax rebate.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Purcell's King Arthur - Opera in recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from his one real opera, the seemingly indestructible Dido and Aeneas,
Purcell's theatre works sit uneasily on the modern stage, where, to be taken
seriously, austerity is more to be prized than frolicsome glamour. Dryden
and Purcell's King Arthur has little to do with the stuff of Athurian
legend: lacking Camelot, the Lady of the Lake of the Knights of the Round
Table, it focuses on Arthur the forger of Britain's imperial destiny and his
campaign against the Saxon invasion, culmination in a dramatically feeble
though rousing enough glorification of Britain's greatness - an occasion for
some of Purcell's most uneven music, veering between the sublime 'Fairest
isle' to tub-thumping fanfares.
King Arthur demands a lavishness of presentation available to only the most
generous of budgets and, if Dryden's play is enacted in full, a comparable
stamina from audiences. Concert performances of the music alone are an
obvious alternative, yet however wonderful Purcell's music, it does need
some kind of broader context for it to make its dramatic impact. A favourite
solution - a narration to link the more than 40 musical numbers - was
adopted at the King Arthur conducted by John Eliot Gardiner at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Saturday as part of the South Bank centre's ongoing Henry
Purcell: the English Genius series (which has already boasted an outstanding
Fairy Queen from Roger Norrington - due on CD shortly from EMI).
The narration proved a mixed blessing, however. While Dryden's flowery
rhetoric certainly has its attractions, its hammy delivery by Edward
Petherbridge (replacing the advertised Simon Callow) in tone more
appropriate to the Death of Little Nell jarred with Gardiner's polished,
fluent, often spirited but generally bland account of the score. Neither the
secure playing of the English Baroque Soloists nor the robust delivery of
the Monteverdi Choir could hide the fact that for all Gardiner's command of
Baroque style there was dangerously little interpretation. Does not
Purcell's music need as firm a guiding hand as any other great composer's?
Nonetheless, there were some outstanding moments: the Frost Scene with
Stephen Varcoe an anguished, eloquent Cold Genius and Nancy Argenta an
exquisite, vibrantly reassuring Cupid; and some fresh, ardent singing from
Paul Agnew in his tenor solos, including the impossible stratospheric 'I
call you all to Woden's Hall'. But on the whole, Dryden's subtitle to King
Arthur aptly summed up the general tone of Gardiner's approach: 'British
Worthy'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Virtuoso cellist - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, which continues in full spate
through next weekend, has assumed the mantle of the former Almeida Festival.
All the Almeida virtues are triumphantly reproduced. Huddersfield's artistic
director, Richard Steinitz, is as tireless as Pierre Audi and Yvar
Mikhashoff used to be about trawling new music for anything seriously
interesting: original forms, artists with unheard-of talents, ambitious new
ensembles.
The current festival differs from the Almeida one only in having more venues
and tighter programming - and being in Huddersfield. If more music students
got modest grants to spend a week at the festival each year, the long-term
effects on the collective imagination would be profound. On Sunday, a
recital by the extraordinary cello virtuoso Frances-Marie Uitti was a
perfect case in point.
In arcane new-music circles, Miss Uitti is notorious for having developed a
way of playing the cello with two bows at once, permitting full four-note
chords and much more besides. Contemporary composers are constantly anxious
to do more with less: the Uitti style expands the range of the cello into
untested possibilities. But she proved also to be a formidable, intrepid
musician; none of her boggling feats seemed mere tricks, but were laden with
sense and feeling.
Half of her recital consisted of short solo pieces composed or adapted for
her, each of them addressed with fervent conviction. The second half
consisted of one premiere: Advaya, with electronics and a 'midi-keyboard',
by Jonathan Harvey - one of the festival's featured composers this year. The
interplay between Uitti's cello and the extra electronic voices and sounds
was sensationally effective, and sometimes built to massive climaxes on a
near-orchestral scale. It made a unique experience, one that seized the
imagination by main force. Harvey's wild ingenuity and Uitti's acrobatic
finesse left us awestricken.
Peter Maxwell Davies is also featured, still in the throes of celebrating
his 60th birthday. Tonight the Royal Philharmonic plays an all-Davies
programme at Huddersfield; on Sunday it ventured only part of it in the
Royal Festival Hall, together with of Vaughan Williams's evergreen Tallis
Fantasia and John Ireland's jolly, ropey Piano Concerto, played for more
than its worth by the excellent Kathryn Stott.
Since Max is the RPO's 'associate conductor/composer', it seemed odd that
his London birthday concert should be so mingy. He was represented only by a
suite from the first act of his 1991 ballet Caroline Mathilde (commissioned
by the Royal Danish Ballet) and by one of the dimmest little pieces he has
ever composed, 'A Spell for Green Corn: the MacDonald Dances' for violin and
orchestra.
Since the ballet music sounds disappointingly like, well, ballet music -
naked tunes-with-accompaniments, simple, unambitious dramatic effects, much
of it reassuringly tonal in a style that does not fire Max's inspiration -
the new 'Spell for Green Corn' followed it with a particularly dull thud. It
was hard to credit that he should put his name to such a feeble
folk-fantasy, devoid of any inventive spark.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tate Gallery yesterday announced the six architects selected as
finalists in the competition to design the proposed Tate Gallery of Modern
Art on London's Bankside.
They are David Chipperfield (UK); Herzog &amp; de Meuron (Switzerland); Office
for Metropolitan Architecture (Netherlands); Rafael Moneo (Spain); Renzo
Piano (Italy); and Tadao Ando (Japan). The winner will be announced in
February.
The Tate will be applying to the National Lottery financed Millennium Fund
for much of the Pounds 80m needed to convert the disused power station into
the nation's leading museum of modern art. The gallery space available of at
least 120,000 square feet is larger than the current Tate at Millbank: this
will continue as the Gallery of British Art.
The FT has offered to organise a competition for the design of a footbridge
linking the new Tate with St Paul's, which is immediately opposite across
the Thames.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: A question of standards - Robert Rice
on resistance to further regulation of the derivatives industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the two and a half years since Mr Gerald Corrigan, then president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned bankers to take a very hard look at
their off-balance sheet activities or risk tighter derivatives regulation,
relations between regulators and the derivatives industry have improved
markedly.
In March this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with the UK Securities and Investments
Board, issued a statement on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives
 -financial instruments such as futures and options - calling for the
industry and regulators to work together.
The industry welcomed the initiative. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA), an industry-backed organisation set up by
dealers in New York in 1984 to standardise derivatives documentation to
reduce credit risk and increase legal certainty, wrote to the regulators
offering help.
Suddenly, however, this spirit of co-operation is threatened by pending
litigation in the US. Bankers Trust, a leading derivatives dealer, is being
sued by two US companies, Gibson Greetings, a greeting cards manufacturer,
and Proctor &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods company, for losses on derivatives
contracts sold by the New York bank.
Gibson alleges it was misled by Bankers Trust on the risk of a complex
interest-rate swap and Proctor &amp; Gamble that it was sold financial
instruments without a full explanation of their risks.
Bankers Trust denies liability, claiming Gibson and Proctor are
sophisticated clients which entered into the transactions with their eyes
open and, in Proctor's case, that it formally suggested the company limit
its risk by unwinding all or part of the transactions when changes in market
rates began to affect its position adversely - advice Proctor ignored.
Few derivatives lawyers believe the banks have anything to fear from these
actions. But there is a nagging concern that, if either company wins, other
dealers may find themselves in court and a rash of derivatives litigation
would lead to calls for tighter regulation.
For ISDA, tighter regulation would be a big reversal. One of ISDA's legal
advisers, US derivatives lawyer Jeffrey Golden, now a partner with City
solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, says broad-based litigation should not obscure how
hard a lot of people in the derivatives industry have worked to reduce risk
and increase legal certainty over the past 10 years.
Regulators have spent a great deal of time worrying about largely
theoretical legal problems which might affect the derivatives markets, he
says. But the search by regulators for absolute legal certainty can be
overdone.
Further regulation, rather than co-operation with ISDA to reduce legal
uncertainty and credit risk by encouraging wider use of standard
documentation, could prove counter-productive, he says.
Mr Ernest Goodrich, managing director of Merrill Lynch, New York, and an
ISDA board member, says that, against the growth in the global derivatives
market - an estimated Dollars 13,000bn in notional value this year - the
amount of litigation has been minimal over the past 10 years.
Standardised documentation will not prevent a Drexel Burnham Lambert or
British &amp; Commonwealth insolvency. But standardisation may make it easier to
find a white knight or help evaluate the swap portfolio of a troubled market
participant, Mr Golden says.
In the early days, before ISDA was formed, lawyers used to draft individual
swap agreements for market participants which resulted quickly in a battle
of the forms.
As the inter-dealer market developed, dealers began to enter several swaps
with the same counterparty. Looked at gross, their exposure to each other
based on each transaction was misleading. A more sensible picture of their
exposure came from netting the results of all transactions with each other,
setting off obligations against sums owing.
Negotiating a new contract for each trade no longer made sense and dealers
pushed for master agreements which would facilitate such things as netting
of counterparty exposure.
ISDA's first efforts at standardisation came in 1985 with a Code of Standard
Wording, Assumptions and Provisions, a menu of provisions for dealers in
drawing up contracts. It produced a revised code in 1986, followed in 1987
by forms for master agreements for dollar rate interest swaps and for
multi-currency interest rate and currency swaps, plus definitions and an
ISDA agreements user's guide.
Other documents followed and then in 1992 a new generation of ISDA documents
were produced. These included a master agreement for multi-currency
cross-border deals and one for local currency single-jurisdiction deals,
foreign exchange and currency options definitions and confirmations and a
confirmation for over-the-counter equity index option transactions.
Since then the pace has hardly slackened. ISDA has produced a bilateral
credit support annex to the master agreement, where collateral will be held
in the US under New York law, and an over-the-counter single share option
confirmation where it is thought the option will settle by physical
delivery.
Obstacles to ISDA's attempts to reduce legal uncertainty and credit risk
through standardisation have included a preference by some international
dealers to document derivatives under separate master agreements for
different products, such as the international foreign exchange master
agreement which caters exclusively for spot and forward foreign exchange
transactions, rather than using a single, multi-product master agreement
such as the 1992 ISDA master agreement.
ISDA members find it hard to fathom why any dealer should go to the expense
and difficulty of negotiating and handling several master agreements with
the same counterparty. Mr Golden says multiple masters waste time, cost
money, invite documentation backlog, increase the risk of mistakes in
agreements, divert management attention and potentially increase credit risk
and capital costs.
ISDA has powerful allies. The study in July 1993 by the Group of 30 top
industrial countries of derivatives concluded market participants should use
one master agreement with each counterparty, which provides for close-out
and settlement netting to document existing and future derivatives
transactions including foreign exchange forwards and options. A single
master agreement creates the greatest legal certainty that credit exposure
will be netted, it said.
Yet the G30 survey found only two-fifths of dealers documented derivatives
transactions under a single, multi-product master agreement.
There will be cases where parties want to use separate master agreements.
But ISDA is not saying a single multi-product master should always be used;
simply that using separate masters as a matter of course is inefficient and
costly.
If regulators are tempted by an upsurge in litigation (unconnected with
attempts to reduce legal uncertainty) to extend the regulatory regime, they
might do better to think again. More could be achieved by working with the
industry to increase standardisation.

Will a future Argos catalogue feature tanks and Rolls-Royce cars? The next
chairman of the catalogue retailer is to be Sir Richard Lloyd (above),
chairman of Vickers.
Sir Richard, 66 next month, will join the board of Argos as deputy chairman
on January 1. He is expected to take over as chairman at the annual general
meeting in May, when David Donne, who will be 70 next year, plans to retire.
As well as chairing Vickers, Sir Richard is deputy chairman of Hill Samuel
bank and a non-executive director of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, Siebe and Simon
engineering.
Mike Smith, chief executive of Argos, yesterday described Sir Richard as 'an
ideal person for us to take on board'. Smith did not believe that experience
of the retail sector was a necessary prerequisite. 'Sir Richard has a wide
range of experience in areas where we feel he can add value.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on EU's competence - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has exclusive competence to conclude international
agreements relating to goods, but its competence in respect of agreements on
services and intellectual property is to be shared with the member states,
the European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The Court's opinion had been sought by the European Commission in the
context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round
agreements.
At the start of the round in 1986, the Commission was granted the power to
negotiate on behalf of the European Community and the member states.
However, it was stated that this did not prejudge the question of the
competence of the Community and the member states on particular issues.
The final act and the WTO agreement were signed by the Council of Ministers,
the Commission and the member states. Prior to the date of signature, the
Commission sought the Court's opinion as to the EU's competence in
concluding agreements in three areas - goods, services and intellectual
property.
The Court said it was generally clear the Community had exclusive competence
to conclude international agreements relating to goods. Such goods included
products under the Euratom Treaty.
For products covered by the European Coal and Steel Treaty, member states
had exclusive competence. The Community had exclusive competence, on the
other hand, for international agreements which covered different types of
goods, including those within the ECSC Treaty.
For agricultural products, while it was true that a specific Treaty of Rome
provision relating to agriculture served as the legal base for the agreement
on agriculture, this fact did not impede the international commitments
relating to agricultural products from being covered by the EC treaty
provisions relating to the common commercial policy. These gave the
Community exclusive competence.
In relation to services, the Court first reiterated that the common
commercial policy provisions of the Rome treaty were to be interpreted
widely and the examples given in the relevant treaty provisions treated as
non-exhaustive.
Thus services were not excluded as a matter of principle from the scope of
the common commercial policy. Insofar as the relevant agreement on services
 -the GATS - was concerned, the Court said there was no reason why
trans-frontier supplies of services should not be treated in the same way as
goods and therefore be covered by the common commercial policy, for which
the Community has exclusive competence.
Other types of services - where the beneficiary of the service went
physically to the state where the service was provided, where a subsidiary
was established in the state where the service was to be provided, and where
individuals supplied services to other states - did not come within the
scope of the common commercial policy.
The Court also held specifically that transport services did not fall within
the common commercial policy. The mere fact that embargo measures taken by
the Council which affected transport services were taken under the common
commercial policy did not change this position.
However, the Court did hold that the Community shared competence with the
member states to conclude the GATS. In making this finding, the Court relied
on, among others, the internal market provisions of the Rome treaty which
allowed any related harmonisation measures to limit the powers of the member
states to negotiate with third countries.
In respect of intellectual property, the Court said provisions in the TRIPs
agreement concerning the prohibition on counterfeit goods were covered by
the common commercial policy.
Other provisions not so closely connected with external trade were not
within the Community's exclusive competence. However, as with the GATS, the
Court said the Community shared competence with the member states to
conclude the TRIPs.
Finally, the Court said, notwithstanding its opinion, it was necessary to
bear in mind the obligation on member states and the EU to co-operate
closely in international matters.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Linklaters aims to win US securities
business - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Linklaters &amp; Paines, the City solicitors, has appointed Edward Fleischman,
former commissioner with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, to help
give the firm a US securities law capability.
Linklaters plans to develop the methods and resources necessary to provide
US legal advice on international securities transactions. This way, it hopes
to offer clients a full service, making it unnecessary for them to use US
law firms when they want to access American markets.
The need for US securities law expertise has arisen mainly in the past three
years, as US investors have shown an increased appetite for foreign
securities, and the SEC has liberalised its rules, making it easier for
foreign issuers to gain access to the US markets.
Linklaters says that, while this has eased part of the compliance burden on
issuers, clients have remained worried about potential liability under the
US Securities Act and the risks of litigation in the US. As a result, even
when the clients were placing only part of an issue in the US, they have
been advised to approach the whole transaction according to US domestic
practice, and have used US law firms to handle the business.

FT  22 NOV 94 / People: NFC's Ian Barr hits the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Barr, 44. has lost his job as NFC's human resources director following a
decision to slim down the London head office of Britain's largest road
transportation group.
Barr is the second NFC executive to go within the past three months. At the
end of August Peter Sherlock, 49, the chief executive, quit after only 18
months in his job and a month later NFC announced that James Watson, 59, the
company's chairman and former finance director, intended to retire on
December 19.
Watson, who joined the group in 1968, took over as chairman in 1991 from Sir
Peter Thompson, the man who masterminded probably the most successful
employee buy-out of a nationalised industry. However, Watson did not inherit
his predecessor's luck. NFC's profits have disappointed, its shares have
performed miserably since last year's Pounds 263m rights issue, and the
decision to recruit an outsider as chief executive has demoralised what once
was a highly motivated workforce.
Sherlock, a former director of Bass, was the most senior executive to be
brought into NFC's close-knit top management team. Barr, who joined NFC from
Chloride in 1989, was the only other outsider. His departure at the end of
the year reduces the number of NFC executive directors to four - Robbie
Burns, 46, Trevor Larman, 49, Denis Olliver, 50, and Graham Roberts, 44.
They are all NFC veterans and have been with the group for an average of 27
years.
The timing of Barr's departure - following a review of the corporate head
office role - is unusual since NFC is still looking for a new chief
executive. However, it is understood that Sir Christopher Bland, who takes
over as chairman next month, is already playing an important role behind the
scenes at NFC. His next big test will be to find NFC's next chief executive.
Robbie Burns is thought to be the most favoured internal candidate but there
is some concern that NFC's top management remains too inbred.

Nigel Russell has given up leadership of James Capel's Scottish investment
trust operation to set up business alone as NJR Research.
James Capel says that Russell, 36, who is described as an entrepreneurial
character, wanted to branch out into research for fund management companies.
Capel says it will be NJR Research's first and largest client. 'I don't feel
I have lost him,' says Bob Benton, managing director. 'I'll probably see him
more than I used to.'
Russell worked as an analyst at Commercial Union before joining Capel in
London. He later moved to Edinburgh to build a successful operation
sponsoring investment trust flotations. His departure has prompted Capel to
bring its investment trust operation to London. Michael Cuthbert will move
with it to London but three more junior staff will remain in Edinburgh.
James Capel made the move to London to bring its investment trust business
closer to sales and market-making of the products.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most fathers would be pleased if their sons got a job in investment banking
 -especially if the post was a directorship at CS First Boston and the son
was only 30. Most fathers would be pleased; but not Christian Purslow's. 'He
was disappointed,' says Purslow junior.
For the Purslows own Grenson Shoes and royal hatters Herbert Johnson.
Christian Purslow sits as a non-exec-utive director on the family board,
where he will remain, but his father Terry had wanted him to take on an
executive role.
Christian Purslow did once work for Grenson Shoes, but not as an executive.
In his holidays from university he worked in the Northampton shoe factory.
One eight-week job was to empty a shed of wooden lasts, the blocks from
which Grenson artisans stitch the shoes. Christian Purslow did the work 'for
love' and about Pounds 1 an hour.
From then on, Christian Purslow's career has gone up and up. He left
Cambridge in 1986; he worked first for the Lek Partnership and then for Sir
Ralph Halpern of the Burton Group, where he advised on corporate strategy.
That is where he met Stephen Hester of CS First Boston. Hester tried to
entice him into banking then but Purslow went to Reuters Holdings to head
global new business for the financial information group. It is only now that
he has been tempted away. 'I have been trying to get Christian Purslow to
join us for the past five years and he finally accepted on Friday night,'
Hester said last week.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Life catches up with laptops - New disclosure
requirements for insurers have placed greater importance on detail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Treasury insisted that all UK life insurance sales agents and
advisers should give customers more information about their policies, it
also delivered a bonus for makers of laptop computers and mobile phones.
Some life insurance companies were already emphasising technology when the
Treasury made its move in July last year. But the new requirements to give
more information to potential investors on the products, the costs of
selling them, and the returns to the customer if long-term policies are
surrendered in the first few years, have forced the whole sector to give the
issue greater priority.
The disclosure regime, which will be compulsory from the new year, has
focused attention on the appropriate technology in two ways.
First, having to reveal the cost of selling a policy has put even more
importance on cutting costs for selling and for processing the sale. Second,
having to provide customers with more information that is specific to their
circumstances creates a need for more sophisticated systems.
'I think there will be no escaping technology from January,' says Nigel
Smith, sales computing manager at Axa Equity and Law.
The scale of the challenge facing the sector is underlined by the fact that
even NatWest Life, which opened for business at the start of last year with
computer systems costing Pounds 40m, is having to make some changes.
NatWest Life had provided its sales force with Toshiba laptops linked to a
Unisys mainframe, where the information keyed in by sales agents is
automatically downloaded. Adam Walton, head of life and pensions, says the
systems will be modified to take account of the disclosure requirements both
when a policy is sold and when it is issued.
The company, a subsidiary of the National Westminster Bank group, has had
some benefit in making a late start, since it could set up a system from
scratch and decide to sell only a limited and relatively straightforward
range of products.
For other life companies, with wider product ranges and more established
systems, meeting the demands of disclosure requires a greater response.
For example, Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest insurers, is upgrading
the laptops it provides for its sales force, as will be Axa Equity &amp; Law,
which will also provide printers for all its sales agents who use laptops,
so that documents can be produced in the customer's home. Other insurers
expect upgrading the process to take place over some months next year.
Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer, is taking a different
approach. Instead of buying laptops for the 7,000-strong sales force, Alan
Smith, marketing director for its home service division, has placed the
largest-ever single order in the UK for mobile phones.
The phones will be programmed to Prudential's 'quoteline' where the 200
operators will key in to the computer what the sales agent says about a
customer's circumstances and provide the detailed information. It is backed
up by a freephone number for the areas of the UK where mobile phones do not
work.
Alan Smith believes that in the future laptops will be the answer - but says
Prudential's decision for the current changes is based both on cost and the
sales process.
The company estimated that buying laptops would cost Pounds 25m initially,
and then an annual cost of Pounds 11m. The mobile phone solution is
estimated to cost Pounds 3m as a one-off expense and then Pounds 5m a year.
Smith adds that trials on how the laptop fitted into the sales process
showed it was an encumbrance. Simply by flipping the screen up, the sales
agent created a barrier. 'If I'm a sales agent, when I concentrate on keying
in information, I lose eye contact and the customer is back watching
EastEnders.'
For life companies with more diverse distribution than Prudential, using
more technology can be a more complicated process.
Axa Equity &amp; Law, for example, sells its products in three ways: through a
direct sales force, through 'tied agents' - separate companies that agree to
sell only the life insurer's financial services products - and through
independent financial advisers.
Nigel Smith says that laptops are not compulsory, and though nearly all tied
agents use them, only about half the direct sales force does. These sales
agents have a choice of machines they can rent: all are capable of
connecting with Elvis, the company's main system, but the cheaper ones take
longer. He thinks the company will probably review early next year its
policy of allowing laptops to be voluntary. 'It is a cultural issue in many
respects.'
Independent advisers can also access the Elvis system, but there are
regulatory limits to the support that individual life companies are allowed
to give independent advisers.
One way through this for life companies, and for advisers who want
information about the companies' products, is the Exchange, owned by Origo
and AT&amp;T.
This project was launched in 1991, and is a way of giving independent
advisers electronic access to information about life companies' products.
Advisers pay Pounds 250 and an annual charge of Pounds 65 for the software,
while life companies provide an annual subsidy of Pounds 4m.
The system does not yet cover every life and pensions product, but within
two years Paul Lindsey, its managing director, expects to have all products
except group pension schemes available.
As for the new regulatory requirements, Lindsey says: 'From January we will
be giving independent advisers the ability to calculate specific commission
at the point of sale, and to be able to print out client-specific
illustrations'.
He is in no doubt that the disclosure regime has acted as a catalyst in
speeding up the use of technology.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Keeping better tabs on truancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widespread truancy highlighted in today's educational league tables is
likely to heighten the debate in schools about the use of electronic
technology to monitor pupils' attendance records.
Merely checking up on pupils more rigorously can make substantial cuts in
truancy figures, according to research by the Truancy Unit at the University
of North London. Nearly two-thirds of truants would not skip lessons if they
believed there was a risk of getting caught.
Monitoring systems such as swipe cards and electronic registries are seen by
many teachers as expensive, complex and unproven. But the schools that have
pioneered their use are frequently enthusiastic about them. Don Vickers,
head of Hesketh Fletcher High School in Manchester, reports that truancy
rates have declined dramatically since the introduction of an electronic
register in September 1993.
This system, which was produced by Bromcom, a Kent-based computer company,
supplies the teacher with a small computer in an A4-sized folder instead of
a paper attendance register. The computer folder includes a radio
transmitter and receiver, which transmits data to a radio tranceiver unit
mounted on a nearby wall or roof. These units, the number of which depend on
the layout of the school, are linked to a PC in the school's office. The
system has been installed in 80 schools at an average cost of around Pounds
20,000.
The advantage of this system is that it reduces teachers' administration,
allows regular and more accurate monitoring of absences and produces letters
to parents about the absence quickly. It also allows the school to check
attendance at every class, cutting down truancy after pupils have
registered.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Biotech patents under threat - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the European Union Draft Directive on the legal protection of
biotechnology inventions will be known shortly. An EU Conciliation Committee
is due to meet on November 28 to see whether differences between the Council
of Ministers and the European Parliament can be worked out.
Unfortunately, if the Parliament's amendments to the directive are adopted,
the impact on biotechnology in Europe will be worse than being left with the
uncertainty of a patchwork of national legislation. Industry research,
medical science and the prospects of finding new medicines will be worse off
than they are today.
First introduced in 1988 with the intention of defining, clarifying and
harmonising patent law for the biotechnology industry in Europe, the draft
directive has recently undergone a number of mutations, mainly stemming from
a well-intentioned but under-informed concern with bio-ethics.
While no one would disagree that patenting parts of the human body in situ
should be banned, it is vital that patent protection be available for
isolated products derived from the human body if new biotechnology-derived
medicines are to be developed. In the pharmaceutical industry, products will
simply not be developed if R&amp;D costs cannot be recouped during the period of
exclusivity that the patent system provides.
The European Parliament does not seem to have realised the importance of
this distinction and has voted in an amendment (Amendment 3) which would
effectively reverse the original intention of the directive.
The amendment means there is now a grave danger that isolated human genes,
proteins and enzymes could be rendered unpatentable in Europe. This would be
a retrograde step compared with current patent laws. More important, Europe
would be placed at a competitive disadvantage with respect to other
countries with a major biotechnology industry, especially the US and Japan.
The consequences for investment in Europe would be devastating.
The fault - and the solution - lies with the European Parliament. By
February of this year, most of the issues raised by the directive had been
addressed, and the Council of Ministers had reached a 'common position'
which was acceptable to industry. However, a committee of Members of the
European Parliament proposed a number of amendments, many of which the
European Commission agreed with industry would be potentially lethal for
biotechnology development in Europe.
It is universally felt within the industry that adoption of the directive in
its present form would have far-reaching consequences, creating an incentive
for pharmaceutical companies to leave Europe rather than invest here.
Equally serious would be the impact on the development of new
biopharmaceuticals and on the treatment of genetic diseases such as cancer,
cystic fibrosis, Huntingdon's chorea, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, arthritis
and atherosclerosis.
The membership of the Conciliation Committee, which meets on November 28 to
try to find a way round the problem, consists of 12 MEPs and 12 members of
the Council of Ministers. The Council has made it clear that it refuses to
accept Amendment 3 and wants to establish a legal framework that enhances
Europe's competitiveness in this important field.
Therefore, the ultimate outcome will depend largely on the attitude taken by
the MEPs. It is still possible that these MEPs and the European Parliament
as a whole can put the directive back on track before it is too late.
If not, industry is unanimous in its feeling that it would be better to have
no directive at all.
The author is chairman of the biotechnology committee of Interpat, an
organisation representing the world's research-based pharmaceutical
industry. He is also senior vice president, corporate intellectual property,
at SmithKline Beecham.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Raising the birthrate - A
Scottish initiative to increase the number of start-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland now have a special
advantage over their counterparts elsewhere in the UK: they are able to take
out loans from their banks for up to seven years at a rate of interest
guaranteed not to go up by more than 1 percentage point.
The cost of the guarantee is borne not by the borrower but by Scottish
Enterprise, the official development body, under a scheme developed with the
four Scottish clearing banks, which had to overcome strong Treasury
opposition. Scottish Enterprise reckons it will cost it Pounds 5m over the
next two years to guarantee the Pounds 100m of loans which the banks are
making available.
The small business loans scheme, which is available to businesses employing
up to 250 people in manufacturing, construction and business services, is a
product of Scotland's Business Birthrate Initiative. The initiative, which
was launched on November 1, is aimed at raising the rate at which new
businesses are formed in Scotland, and at increasing the number that survive
to become significant companies.
It focuses on encouraging more people to start businesses, removing some of
the financial impediments to launching and expanding a company, and
eventually changing a national culture which accords a low status to the
entrepreneur.
It was started by Crawford Beveridge, a Scot who returned from a senior post
at Sun Microsystems in California to run Scottish Enterprise. He was baffled
by the contrast between the endeavour displayed by Scots outside Scotland
and the apathy exhibited at home.
Studies he commissioned showed that while Scotland's business birthrate
between 1978 and 1990 was 77 new companies employing more than 50 people per
1m of population, the equivalent number for the West Midlands was 86; and
for the south-east of England it was 116. Massachusetts in the US dwarfed
them with 333.
It was calculated that if Scotland's business birthrate since 1978 had
matched that of the West Midlands an extra 70,000 jobs in independent
businesses would have been created on top of the 125,000 people in Scotland
already working in them.
Yet the proportion of the Scottish population interested in creating new
businesses was found to be around the UK average. People were apparently
being held back by the difficulties in raising finance faced by businesses
everywhere, but also by a pervasively anti-entrepreneurial environment.
According to an opinion survey, people in Scotland rated entrepreneurs below
manual workers such as plumbers and bus drivers on their list of admired
professions.
Scottish Enterprise decided that raising the business birthrate should not
be a top-down affair. The strategy was thrashed out in seminars with
businessmen, professional advisers, bankers, officials and journalists. This
resulted in a document listing dozens of desirable schemes and objectives,
but it was expected that the drive to implement most of them would come from
others. That includes the local enterprise companies in the Scottish
Enterprise network, some of which were already taking a lead in trying to
encourage more entrepreneurship.
For example, Dunbartonshire Enterprise, north of Glasgow, runs a training
programme named Teamstart for professionals and middle managers interested
in forming their own businesses.
People in middle-class neighbourhoods are targeted by mail. About 30 people
go on each two-month course and the aim is to produce between 10 and 12
businesses, eventually employing between 20 and 30 people, some of which
could become significant companies.
David Pearson, in charge of enterprise development, points out that
Teamstart is separate from the government's enterprise allowance scheme
which in Dunbartonshire results in the formation of about 400 single-person
businesses a year. His start-ups include a nascent shipping line, an airline
hoping to operate to London's City airport, software companies and a
manufacturer of sub-sea vacuum cleaners.
In Lanarkshire, which is wrestling with the problems caused by the closure
of the Ravenscraig steelworks, an Entrepreneurial Exchange is being set up
by a businessman helped by the Lanarkshire development agency. Established
entrepreneurs will encourage aspiring businesspeople and give their time
free to advise them.
The chairman is Bill Fleming who founded and later sold the Smiley tyres and
exhausts repair chain and is now one of Scotland's business angels - wealthy
individuals who invest in new and expanding ventures. Scottish members of
the UK angels organisation Linc (Local Investment Networking Company), last
year invested Pounds 13m in new and expanding businesses.
One manifestation of the birthrate initiative organised by the private
sector is the business forum - evening sessions where businesspeople explain
their projects to their peers and face questioning. The first forums have
proved so popular that Russel Griggs of Scottish Enterprise calls them 'the
only meetings in Scotland you can't get into'. So far no business idea
expounded at the forum has metamorphosed into a trading company, but equity
has been raised and contracts made.
Alastair Balfour, managing director of Insider Publications, which has just
launched a monthly magazine for new and growing businesses, believes about
300 different schemes are under way as a result of the birthrate initiative.
He says it has touched a chord in the business community and stimulated
co-operation between the public and private sectors. He cites as an example
the small business loans scheme, dependent on links between Scottish
Enterprise and the banks, which should soon be followed by a scheme to
provide capital to projects too small for normal venture capital providers.
The initiative's target is to raise Scotland's business birthrate to the UK
average by 2000, which implies achieving a 50 per cent increase in the
number of new businesses started every year and which would create 25,000
extra jobs. But it is too early to measure its success in producing
start-ups, partly because no satisfactory way has been devised to measure
them.
As for changing the attitude to entrepreneurs of the average Scot, Pearson
urges patience. 'We are seeing more favourable coverage in the Scottish
media than we used to. There is a lot of enthusiasm around. But we are
trying to make cultural shifts that will take 10 years.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New Tessa urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most private businesses would prefer to invest out of retained income rather
than with debt or by raising equity. It allows them to retain control and is
ultimately cheaper.
But many small businesses fail to retain enough of those earnings. Partly
because of favourable personal tax incentives, small business owners tend to
take more money out of their businesses than is healthy for their financial
stability.
Barclays Bank believes they need to be encouraged to keep more in their
businesses for future investment. It has asked the government to consider
introducing a Business Tessa account for all businesses in this year's
Budget.
The account would function like the personal Tax Exempt Special Savings
Account, making interest on retained earnings saved for a minimum period
free of tax.
'It is a small, low-cost, targeted tax incentive,' says David Lavarack, head
of Barclays Small Business Services. Barclays has discussed the proposal
with the DTI and other departments, whose reaction has been 'favourable',
Lavarack says.
The Tessa would be focused on small businesses which have a chance of
surviving and growing over the medium term but which fail to achieve their
potential because of low reinvestment
Incorporated and unincorporated businesses with sales between Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 1m would benefit most from a Business Tessa. But all businesses
would be allowed to invest up to Pounds 20,000 a year for five years. At
this level, the cost to the Treasury in lost tax on interest would build to
about Pounds 200m after five years and would benefit over 350,000
businesses.
Barclays says the small-business sector is characterised by high rates of
closure and low average growth rates. 'Reducing the level of closures would
provide a real boost to the UK economy,' it says.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A tale of two serial
investors - A successful merger in the food industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adolf Winter had almost no sales team and no finance director. And yet from
a standing start, Winter built Beni Foods over five years into a company
with sales of Pounds 85m. Last week he sold it to another well-known name in
the meat-processing industry, Ron Randall.
For a start-up, this is impressive stuff. What is more, Randall believes
Winter has sold at a time when the business - preparing and packaging
quality meats for supermarket chains - is still packed with potential.
Beni's next phase of development is being entrusted to a kind of businessman
and woman which is becoming increasingly important to venture capitalists -
a serial investor who puts up equity alongside the venture capitalists and
who either brings the deal to the financiers or is brought in as part of a
management buy-in team.
In this case, Randall brought the deal to the venture capital community.
After a beauty parade, he says, he chose a partnership with Morgan Grenfell
Development Capital because of its ability to underwrite a deal of this size
and its ability to react quickly.
Randall had been cutting up meat as a butcher's boy since he was 16, and put
together his first meat processing company, Meadow Farm Produce, in 1972
when he was 21.
In 1984, he floated Meadow Farm Produce on the Unlisted Securities Market at
a value of Pounds 6m. Two years later Hillsdown, the food group, bought it
for Pounds 62m. He then reversed a company into Sims Catering Butchers,
built the Sims Food Group before resigning in 1991 to build two more food
packaging companies, TS&amp;W and Randall Parker.
When Randall approached Winter earlier this year, Beni Foods was not for
sale. 'My initial approach was, would he consider being part of my ideas,'
Randall says. His suggestion that the groups merge was politely declined.
'But he said maybe it is time to consider what to do with the rest of my
life.'
Winter's background is equally steeped in the food industry. He too built a
meat company before selling out to the Trent Meat Company in 1984. He then
spent three years researching the market before launching Beni Foods.
But it was quite a start-up. On a green field site in Milton Keynes, he
built a 45,000sq ft factory and started selling finely sliced quality meats
to supermarket chains feeding the consumers' growing appetite for
sandwiches.
Since then Winter has invested Pounds 36m and built the factory to 190,000sq
ft.
Randall says that Winter had realised that he needed to put in a top
management team. While more junior management was in place, a business that
Randall says is heading for Pounds 100m of sales next year was clearly not
manageable much longer by Winter alone.
The market is rapidly growing in the UK, with 85 per cent of cooked meat
going into sandwiches and the market for healthy convenience foods growing
apace.
Then there is the Continental market. Randall believes the UK could become
an important source of prepared quality meats for chains in other European
countries. But attacking these markets would only be possible with more
management, Randall believes. He will therefore be recruiting a finance
director, a managing director, a procurement director and a sales team to
work alongside him.
And Winter? He will be retained as a consultant for a year but has declined
to take a public bow. A private man, he has taken a 'life style' decision
and is understood to be returning to his native Austria, leaving two sons
with small shareholdings and as active managers in Beni Foods.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Independents deplore exam ranking
system - Headmasters would much prefer other criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent schools do well in the government's performance tables, but
remain almost as distasteful of them as state schools.
As last year, independents accounted for almost three-quarters of the top
200 schools, judged by the percentage of pupils attaining at least five
grade C passes at GCSE, and dominated the higher ranks of the A-level
tables.
Independent schools appear to have held their own even when selectivity is
taken into account. At A-level independent boys' schools - including many
which do not select their entry at all - managed an average of 20.62 Ucas
points for each pupil, compared with 20.92 for state grammar schools.
Independent girls' schools also almost managed to match state grammars, with
an average of 19.57 compared with 20.
The Department for Education has published a study of academic 'value
added', comparing pupils' A-level scores with their earlier GCSE results.
This showed that at all levels of GCSE performance pupils were likely to
fare better in independent schools than in the state sector. Academics
considered this study to be crude and simplistic, but the publicity it
generated helped independent schools.
Strong league table showings are also increasingly being used in
advertisements for schools, and parents appear to be referring to them in
deciding to switch their children between schools in particularly
competitive markets.
In Greater London, schools say they have lost more pupils to the four most
successful selective schools - North London Collegiate, the two St Paul's
schools and Westminster - since publication of league tables by newspapers
became widespread four years ago.
Exam rankings are closely studied by parents, particularly in the Far East
where many boarding schools with declining rolls are looking for recruits.
So why the hostility? The schools still believe the government is selling
them short because the assumptions underlying the figures are arbitrary.
At A-level the complaints surround A-level general studies, a subject
normally taught in less time than other A-levels, often as a compulsory
adjunct to an A-level course to allow a well-rounded curri-culum.
Many universities refuse to recognise it when making conditional offers of
places, and last year Professor Alan Smithers of the University of
Manchester, a government education adviser, attacked it, saying it had
failed to broaden the curriculum.
He even found that some students revised for it by playing Trivial Pursuit.
For this reason the Financial Times and other newspapers exclude general
studies when compiling A-level league tables. But in the government's tables
it counts for as much as any other A-level.
Given that some universities recognise the subject, a fair position might
fall somewhere in the middle. As it is, the policy means that schools where
general studies is more or less compulsory as an additional A-level, such as
the two Birmingham King Edward's schools, have an advantage. These two place
general studies at the centre of their sixth-form curriculums.
A further problem is the government's use of age groups, rather than a
school's own year groups. This makes for ease of collection of data by the
government's statisticians, and for state schools it is usually a fair
assumption.
But it is much more common in the private sector either for children to be
promoted a year or for them to take their time. Boarding schools in
particular often allow children to defer exams if they have been moved
around frequently earlier in their education.
Independent schools say as a result the government data should not be used
for measuring excellence, but simply for spotting schools which are in
trouble.
Certainly the government top 10 of independent schools is very different
from that published by the FT in August, which excluded general studies and
was based on year groups.
Only three schools are common to both: Downe House, a girls' boarding school
in Berkshire which came eighth with the FT and fourth with the government;
King Edward VI High, ninth with the FT and second on the government figures;
and Westminster, top of the FT table, and nine places lower on the
government's figures.
'Famous name' schools which appear to have been sold particularly short by
the government data are Winchester - fourth with an average points score of
30.2 according to the FT, but 51st, with a score of 26.1 on government
assumptions - and St Paul's Girls' - 10th with a score of 26.9 in the FT
tables but 53rd with 26.1 points in the government's.
At GCSE the government assumptions have an even more marked effect. A survey
by the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) showed that some
schools benefited, with St Mary's in Ascot being credited with shepherding
117 per cent of its pupils through to five GCSE grade Cs.
Isis also found, however, 61 schools where it claimed the government had
understated pass rates by 10 per cent or more, compared with the figure they
would have reached by taking year rather than age groups. Again some famous
names saw their results understated, including Harrow  - 86.5 rather than
99.4 per cent - and Haileybury - 86.7 rather than 98.9 per cent.
Against this background even independent schools which on the surface
benefit from the government's tables try to play them down. Mr Hugh Wright,
head of King Edward's, Birmingham, prefers to direct attention to the
school's achievements on the rugby and other sporting fields, in which it is
a national power in spite of selecting only on academic ability.
Mrs Joan Clanchy, headmistress of North London Collegiate, described the
tables rather more condescendingly as 'good clean fun', and is worried that
they may increase pressure on pupils.
Mr David Woodhead, chief executive of Isis, summed up a view prevalent among
most of the sector. Independent schools, he said, were 'especially damaged
by the department's bureaucratic stubbornness'.
They are, he said, 'not afraid of league tables. But they are increasingly
unhappy with a system which ignores the achievements of many pupils and
significantly distorts the performance of most schools.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Vocational qualifications have yet
to come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's school and college league tables are an important staging post
in the evolution of vocational qualifications in the UK.
The tables include statistics on achievement in vocational courses taken in
England, supposedly signifying that the government means what it says about
vocational courses enjoying 'parity of esteem' with traditional GCSEs and
A-levels.
The information presented on the success of schools and colleges with
vocational courses is extremely skimpy, however. Whereas detailed 'point
score' averages are given for GCSE and A-level candidates, only a bare
figure for 'percentage of candidates achieving qualifications' is given for
their vocational counterparts.
The tables show the great majority of vocational candidates to be
successful. At schools and colleges catering for post-16-year-old students,
an average of 81 per cent of candidates achieved their vocational
qualifications.
A still more impressive 87.6 per cent of 15- and 16-year-olds taking
vocational equivalents of GCSEs 'achieved all qualifications or units
attempted'. That compares with 43.3 per cent of candidates passing five or
more GCSEs at grades A to C.
Such figures will fuel concerns voiced in recent official reports about the
rigour and value of vocational qualifications.
Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University, an authority on the
vocational system, said: 'The problem is the existing philosophy of the
National Council for Vocational Qualifications (the government agency
responsible for vocational courses). Until now it has emphasised 'pass' or
'fail' as the criteria for assessment, not grading.'
Prof Smithers believes that new assessment procedures, with greater emphasis
on grading and external assessment and less on coursework, are 'essential if
vocational courses are to live up to expectations and hold high status'.
Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, said that 'much
has been done to ensure suitable grading'. The new general national
vocational qualifications (GNVQs) are awarded on the basis of three grades
(pass, merit and distinction). However, the gradings do not appear in the
league tables so the performance of schools and colleges cannot be compared.
The tables highlight the extent to which vocational qualifications are the
preserve of sixth-form and further-education colleges. According to Mr
Hillier all post-16 colleges and 'half of all schools with sixth forms' are
offering the new GNVQ courses.
The tables show, however, that most of the schools that offer GNVQ courses
are entering only a tiny fraction of their students for them, with most
sticking to traditional A-levels.
By contrast, most sixth-form and further-education colleges are entering
more candidates for vocational courses than for A-levels. Swindon College in
Wiltshire is a typical case, recording 219 candidates in their final year of
study for post-16 vocational qualifications compared with 164 for A-levels.
Earlier this month the Office for Standards in Education, the schools
watchdog, urged an improvement in the design and assessment of GNVQs. It
said that the rate of improvement since the piloting of the exams a year ago
was 'far too slow'.
Mr Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, highlighted the fact that
external assessors did not check that different institutions used the same
gradings when setting assessment, while the curriculum had not been defined
with sufficient clarity.
The government nonetheless remains intent on extending GNVQs further down
the age range. GNVQs for 14-year-olds will be piloted in English and Welsh
schools next year, with an assessment system which has been radically
altered in response to attacks from inspectors.
Schools already experienced in vocational education have been asked to
tender for piloting courses in three subjects - business and finance, health
and social care, and manufacturing - from September next year.
Ministers want to pilot more courses in 1996 - including leisure and
tourism, art and design, and science - and expand to include schools which
have little experience of teaching vocational courses. The courses, to be
known as GNVQ Part Ones, are expected to be offered to all secondary schools
from September 1998. Each GNVQ will be equal to two GCSEs.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Local authorities cast doubt on the
accuracy of truancy figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accuracy of the truancy figures for England released by the government
was called into question yesterday by a number of local education
authorities.
Manchester, top of the truancy table for secondary schools and, for the
second year running, home to the 'worst' school in England, said yesterday
that up to 11,000 pupils had been omitted from the government's
calculations. A similar problem occurred last year.
The authority said nearly a third of its schools had failed to return
absenteeism figures to the government. As a result the validity of the
tables was in doubt.
The government recorded a total of 48,566 pupils of compulsory school age in
Manchester, but according to the authority the actual figure is just under
60,000.
The authority said: 'We do recognise that Manchester does have a problem
with truancy, but we are taking active steps to deal with it both within the
local education authority and on an individual school basis.
'However, the overall picture presented by the tables is very misleading.'
The authority stressed that of the 11,000 pupils not included in the table
there were 'some very good schools that would have had a very good record on
attendance'.
The local education authority for Kensington and Chelsea, placed second to
Manchester in the secondary school truancy table, also criticised the
accuracy of the government's calculations.
It said that its figure for the percentage of half days missed by secondary
school pupils without authorisation - a key truancy measure - was out by
nearly a quarter.
Kensington and Chelsea said yesterday that the correct figure was 2.8 per
cent, not 3.6 per cent as recorded in the government's table.
According to the authority the mistake was due to one of its schools having
filled in a form incorrectly. Mr Mike Stoten, head of education for
Kensington and Chelsea, said: 'The department has admitted it has got the
wrong number in its booklet, but they are being bloody-minded and are
refusing to change it.'
Officials at the Department for Education said the authority should blame
itself for not having checked through its submission properly.
An official said: 'It will certainly learn a lesson for next year.'
Tower Hamlets, another of the worst placed authorities, also suggested that
the government's figures differed from the ones its schools had submitted.
The authority said: 'These things are just so complicated it is not
surprising that cock-ups occur.'
However, most of the individual schools badly placed in the truancy league
were willing to admit to having attendance problems.
The two worst schools, Ellen Wilkinson High School in Manchester and Agnes
Stewart High School in Leeds, both recorded a truancy rate of 30 per cent.
Mrs Yvonne Kneen, headteacher of Ellen Wilkinson, said that in spite of a
number of initiatives to reduce truancy it would take a long time for the
school to solve the problem. She believes it is mainly a function of the
disadvantaged backgrounds of most of the school's pupils, who live in
inner-city Manchester.
The school has taken on a special school liaison teacher, whose role is to
check on children who have a poor attendance record. Some of the school's
governors have been involved in searching the local shopping centre for
absent pupils and the local police have been patrolling nearby streets in
unmarked cars.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Colleges step up the fight on
A-level battleground
</HEADLINE>

Today's performance tables reveal significant changes in the pattern of
English education for post-16-year-olds.
Further-education colleges, for long the Cinderellas of education, appear to
be competing fiercely in the marketplace for A-level education. Following
incorporation in April last year, all colleges have been removed from local
authority control and are run as independent organisations.
They are funded in relation to their student numbers. This has given them a
strong incentive to recruit students who might at one time have gone to
schools.
Several colleges are sizeable institutions with more than 1,000 candidates
entered for different qualifications.
Many authorities also wanted to establish sixth-form colleges simply to save
money, a move recommended by the Audit Commission among others. Four local
education authorities - Richmond-upon-Thames, Salford, Bury and Harrow - no
longer have any school sixth forms and entrust all their A-level provision
to sixth-form colleges. The government only publishes local authorities'
average A-level results for schools, however, and excludes further education
colleges, so it is difficult to judge whether these policies have been
successful.
Some policymakers are worried that too many colleges now offer A-levels, and
that their traditional concentration on vocational qualifications means they
do not provide adequate academic competition for schools.
In the past year the Department for Education gave approval to several
schools catering for 11-16-year-olds to start sixth forms. Mr John Patten,
the former education secretary, had said that schools without a sixth form
were like 'a body without a head'.
The figures lend this some support, but it is only limited. Several colleges
which would be viable if they offered only vocational qualifications have
started entering significant numbers of candidates for A-levels, and several
appear to have rather weaker results than the average of all schools.
It is difficult to measure this, however, as the government is trying to
encourage a 'mixed economy' of A-levels and vocational qualifications, which
in many cases will be good for entry to new universities. Thus it is hard to
compare schools which do only A-levels with colleges where academic
qualifications are often a supplement to a much more time-consuming
vocational course.
The Department for Education's tables tackle these problems by quoting the
average Ucas points for candidates who attempt two or more A-levels, and for
those who attempt one. The idea is to separate those taking an A-level to
top up a vocational course from students taking a fully academic course,
therefore providing a fairer comparison.
Candidates trying two or more A-levels at colleges - and therefore making
A-level the backbone of their courses - fared less well at further-education
colleges, but the gap was small. According to government data, the average
points score in schools was 16.7, but when all further education colleges
were included, this fell to 15.3.
The table lists the 20 colleges which offered the most vocational
qualifications, and in most cases they also offered sizeable numbers of
wholly A-level courses. In most of the cases listed A-level performance was
significantly below average.
However, many of the colleges, such as Sheffield, enter large numbers of
candidates, making it much harder to maintain a high average.
Calculations for Colchester Sixth-Form College (pictured), which last year
entered 678 A-level candidates, demonstrate the distortions large numbers of
entrants can cause. The college's most successful 100 candidates this year
gained an average of 33.07 Ucas points, a score which would have ranked them
in the top five for the country, among selective schools which have about
100 pupils per year.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Data show girls outperforming boys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girls' schools are racing ahead of boys' schools in exam performance and
girls are outperforming boys in mixed-sex schools, suggesting that equal
opportunities should be turned on its head in education - boys, not girls,
seem to need the most help.
An FT analysis of the government's league tables appears to confirm that
boys underachieve most in socially deprived areas and in non-selective
schools. In GCSEs and vocational qualifications unacademic boys appear to
have far weaker chances than girls of getting the basic qualifications
needed for a job.
This appears to strengthen claims that the UK faces social problems caused
by the emergence of a large number of underqualified men who will have
difficulty finding jobs. Except in independent schools, girls appear to be
significantly ahead at A-level, offering them a better chance of higher
university qualifications.
Girls' schools had been expected to outperform boys' schools at GCSE,
following the strong results announced by independent girls' schools in
September. Of the 97 schools which according to the government managed to
win five GCSEs of at least a grade C for 100 per cent of their pupils, 58
are for girls only, while only 13 are boys only.
Analysis by the FT of average performance shows that in every sector girls'
schools managed to achieve five GCSEs or more for far more of their pupils
than boys' schools.
Most worryingly for those who fear the emergence of a large group of
underqualified and unskilled men, the gap is widest in non-selective
schools.
In secondary moderns, which exist in only a few parts of the country for
children who fail the exams for grammar schools at either 11 or 12, an
average of 34 per cent of girls managed five GCSE grade Cs, compared to only
21 per cent of boys. At comprehensives the disparity was almost as big - 44
per cent to 34 per cent. Less academic boys appear to be underachieving more
seriously.
This partly reflects educationalists' claims that selective schools have
always had to take into account that girls are more able than boys at 11,
and set higher pass marks for girls than for boys.
The gap is comparatively narrow in selective schools, where academic boys
have been creamed off, with girls' grammars managing 89 per cent to 87 per
cent from boys' schools.
In independent schools - predominantly more selective than maintained
schools - the gap was 83 per cent against 75 per cent, in opted-out schools
the gap was 71 per cent to 64 per cent, while in local authority schools,
which tend to include those with the highest levels of deprivation, it was
52 per cent to 34 per cent.
The superiority of girls' schools at 16 is not only academic, as they appear
to be providing pupils with more vocational training as well. At local
authority maintained girls' schools, 37 per cent of 16-year-olds take
vocational courses, compared with 35 per cent at boys' schools. At grant
maintained schools the disparity is 53 per cent to 28 per cent, while at
independent schools it is 46 per cent to 34 per cent. Unacademic boys are
not, therefore, being offered vocational passports to a job instead. Girls
are more likely to show the necessary discipline to win a skill-based
qualification.
At A-level the picture is more mixed, with academic boys streamed into boys'
independent and grammar schools doing slightly better than their
counterparts at girls' schools. At independent schools those entering two or
more A-levels could expect to win 20.62 A-level points, compared with 19.57
at girls' schools.
At local authority maintained schools, however, girls' school pupils tended
to get one A-level grade more than those at boys' schools, averaging 14.53
points compared with 12.61.
These figures tally with overall data for pupils at both single-sex and
mixed schools produced by the National Consortium of Exam Results for the
BBC's Panorama programme last month. These showed girls marginally
overtaking boys at A-level this year for the first time. According to the
consortium's figures, girls' average point score per A-level exam was 4.8,
compared with 4.7 for boys. In 1991 girls lagged, with 4.1 to 4.2.
GCSE revealed a much wider disparity, with girls managing a C grade or
better in 51 per cent of the subjects entered, compared with 41.4 per cent
for boys. This was the second year running that a disparity on this scale
was recorded, even though the coursework content of GCSEs - thought to
favour girls - had been reduced.
Individual subject entries revealed even wider disparities. In English 62
per cent of girls managed at least a grade, compared with 43.3 per cent of
boys. There was a similar gap in French, passed by 48 per cent of girls and
31.2 per cent of boys.
Boys held advantages in traditionally masculine subjects, but they were
minimal - science GCSE was passed by 44 per cent of boys, compared to 43.6
per cent of girls, while in maths 41 per cent of boys and 40.08 per cent of
girls managed a grade C.
Professor Michael Barber, of Keele University's Centre for Successful
Schools, disagrees with the theory that there is a 'glass ceiling' women
cannot break.
He said: 'When this batch of girls is in young adulthood they will break
that ceiling and go far. What we really need to do now is address boys'
underperformance in literacy.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Town with a remarkable double - A
look at two of Chelmsford's high achievers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anthony Tuckwell, headmaster of King Edward VI grammar school in
Chelmsford, Essex, 'honestly can't remember' where his school was placed
last year in the government's school league table.
He sets little store by KEGS' ranking - seventh among all secondary schools
in England at A-level in the tables published today. 'By and large the
league tables tell you mostly what you know already,' he said.
KEGS was part of a remarkable double - 400 yards down the road the
Chelmsford County High School for Girls was placed 10th, giving the small
Essex town two of the top 10 places, and the only two taken by state
schools.
Both are highly selective, grant-maintained schools in a Conservative
heartland. Chelmsford, 35 minutes from London by train, is solidly
middle-class with one of the highest commuter populations in the county.
KEGS, a school mainly for boys which admits girls in the sixth form, draws
45 per cent of its 710 pupils from the Chelmsford district, with others from
nearby Billericay and Brentwood.
Mrs Jean Patterson said the school's selectivity and staff, rather than its
ranking in the league tables, persuaded her to enrol her two sons at the
school. 'I am very sceptical about this type of ranking. The data is so
raw.'
Mr Tuckwell said most pupils come from families with professional or
managerial backgrounds.
He said: 'We have a very able intake, so one would expect to be well placed
whatever we did. All the things the school provides have nothing to do with
league tables.
'Things like music, drama and sport are not reflected in the exam results.
Neither are the relationships between the staff and the pupils.
'Exam results are a one dimensional picture, whereas the schools are three
dimensional institutions.'
Mrs Bernice McCabe, his counterpart at the Chelmsford County High School for
Girls, is more sympathetic to the tables. She said: 'They have opened up the
whole debate about standards in education. They make us feel more
accountable. Parents have the right to know how schools are doing compared
with each other.'
But both Mrs McCabe and Mr Tuckwell see the present form of the tables as
flawed. She said: 'In their current format they do not tell us much.'.
Chelmsford County High School is already implementing a mechanism to measure
the value the school adds.
Mr Tuckwell believes tables which reflect added value are essential, but is
uncertain how well such things can be measured. 'The crucial point is how we
managed to add value to our children's education. With very able children,
many of whom might get grade A anyway, what value we add cannot necessarily
be measured merely through exam results,' he said.
Mrs Sandra Edgar, head of science at CCHS and director of the value-added
project, said the school was trying to introduce value added measurements at
earlier stages.
Maya Currell, a 13-year-old second year pupil at CCHS, said the league
tables could give outsiders the impression that 'all we do is work'. But the
school offered many activities such as sports, music, drama, dance and
photo-graphy.
Nicola Irvine, another CCHS pupil, said: 'Some people outside the school,
who do not have much to do with it other than the fact that they live here,
say the school is an exam factory, but that is not true.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Grant-maintained schools spending
plans exaggerated by 40 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cross-party Commons education select committee yesterday said the
Department for Education's spending plans for grant-maintained schools which
have opted out of local authority control had been exaggerated by 40 per
cent, John Authers writes.
It said the figures were 'inconsistent and implausible' and risked
undermining education expenditure planning.
Early last year the department predicted that by January this year there
would be 700,000 pupils in grant-maintained schools, with 1m by April this
year. But instead the number of schools opting out has subsided and only
550,000 pupils were taught in the sector by the start of this year, 600,000
in April and 620,000 by October.
It meant that by April the number of pupils in grant-maintained schools was
40 per cent below the level planned for by the government.
The MPs said the department's spending projections suggested either that
growth would have to be reduced or that there was a 'systematic
understatement' of what was happening. They dismissed officials' claims that
the figures were not predictions but 'working assumptions'.
The report said: 'Semantic fine-tuning cannot hide the fact that the
department's projections for grant-maintained pupils numbers have proved
very inaccurate.
'If it were to turn out that many more of the government's plans were merely
working assumptions with no real substance, the whole basis of the public
expenditure planning process could be jeopardised.'
The committee's comments come as a further blow to ministers who are
campaigning to encourage schools to opt out. Labour has said that
grant-maintained schools would be returned to some form of 'local democratic
accountability' which has further curbed the numbers opting out.
It added that the department had to 'improve its quality control'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Dispute over time spent on teaching
unresolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
League tables of the amount of time schools spent teaching their pupils,
published for the first time this year, seem to have left one of last year's
biggest educational disputes unresolved.
Mr John Patten, the former education secretary, believed that the amount of
time spent teaching pupils had to affect academic achievement and asked for
the figures to be published.
Concerns about variations in the school day were first raised by Professor
Stewart Sutherland, the former chief inspector of schools, who said at least
1,000 schools were not meeting the department's guidelines. Recommended
school teaching time per week is 21 hours for those aged five to seven, 23.5
hours for those aged between 8 and 11, and 24 hours for secondary school
pupils.
Prof Sutherland found a variation of about 20 per cent between schools in
the amount of time they spent teaching each week - equivalent, as he put it,
to a day.
Mr Patten responded by asking Ofsted, the education watchdog, to conduct
urgent research into the effects of the variations. But they did not produce
a clear-cut answer.
Ofsted said quality rather than quantity of teaching time mattered most.
There was 'at most only a very weak association between the amount of taught
time and educational achievement'.
Today's league tabling exercise appears to give full support to Ofsted's
assessment. Secondary schools offering 23 hours teaching a week or less tend
to be slightly below the national average for GCSE passes, although the
figures are very uneven.
Some of the schools are atypical, including a number of tutorial colleges,
where teaching is intensive and takes place with small classes. Summerhill
in Suffolk, one of six schools which teaches for only 20 hours each week and
where only 8 per cent of pupils managed five GCSE C grades, is also scarcely
representative. It is an independent school with a deliberate and
controversial policy of allowing pupils to express themselves and has little
discipline.
Only two of the schools which taught for 35 hours or more had less than a 50
per cent success rate in gaining five good GCSEs.
However, the 82 schools which taught for more than 30 hours each week
included only four of the 97 which managed to get 100 per cent of their
pupils five good GCSEs. The others appear to have managed on less.
But the presence of one school near the bottom of the rankings for teaching
time suggests that Mr Patten need not have worried too much about the issue.
Manchester Grammar taught its pupils for only 22.5 hours each week last
year. All of them managed five GCSEs of at least a grade C. It was the
biggest school to achieve this.
Dr Martin Stephen, high master of Manchester Grammar since the beginning of
this term, told journalists yesterday that he was not enthusiastic about
league tables.
He said: 'They are misleading and I don't think people realise what they are
reading. I am not a convinced supporter of league tables because they leave
out some of the most important information about a school.'
In the case of Manchester Grammar, anchored at the top of both GCSE and
A-level tables, they appear to have included information that was
irrelevant. Following these results schools are more likely to try to
improve the quality of their teaching time rather than the quantity.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: On-line reports to parents urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parents could be given on-line computer access to school inspectors' reports
and other information collected by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, under
proposals outlined yesterday.
Mr Mark Gladwyn, head of strategic programmes at CCTA, the government centre
for information systems, suggested that the information collected and held
by Ofsted might be made available to personal computer users over the
Internet - the informal system of computer networks which connects databases
and computers across the globe.
Mr Gladwyn said the records of births, deaths and marriages since 1837 could
also be made available on-line - a move which he said would be immensely
valuable to historians and other researchers.
Earlier this month the Treasury confirmed that Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget
speech would be made available over the Internet soon after the chancellor
delivered it to the Commons next Tuesday.
'Information superhighways present us with a new and exciting opportunity to
improve the way we share and access information,' Mr Gladwyn said yesterday.
He was speaking at a CCTA consultative meeting on information superhighways
attended by more than 800 public and private sector delegates.
He said providing electronic access to information was in line with the
government's drive for more open government. The Open Government Code of
Practice, published earlier this year, emphasised the importance of
volunteering and increasing the availability and accessibility of government
information.
Mr Robert Hughes, minister for public service and science, said the
information superhighway 'means government is open for business around the
clock. The individual citizen can ask questions when it suits them, their
school or small business rather than when it suits a civil servant.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Catchment area link to success is
underlined
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The list of England's strongest and weakest non-selective schools at GCSE
demonstrates the powerful link between a school's success and the catchment
area from which it draws children.
At the top of the table are comprehensives which tend to be based in wealthy
suburban areas, such as Bexley Grammar in south London or George Abbot near
Guildford, Surrey, or to have a well-established reputation so that they are
over-subscribed, and therefore to some degree selective.
Hasmonean High in north London, which has developed a nationwide reputation
since newspapers started publishing league tables based on exam results, has
again ranked highly on GCSE scores. It has a distinctive ethos because it is
a Jewish school catering for the north London Jewish community, and cannot
be described as a typical neighbourhood comprehensive.
Several others have 'grammar school' in their name, indicating past
traditions, although they are now non-selective.
The lowest achievers at GCSE virtually all fall in urban areas and most are
shown as having high truancy rates.
Schools which the Department for Education listed as achieving five GCSE
grade Cs for less than 10 per cent of their pupils are in a series of inner
urban areas. They include: Grange Upper and Belle Vue Boys in Bradford;
Broadgreen, Croxteth and John Paul II Roman Catholic High in Liverpool;
Malory in London; George Dixon GM in Birmingham; Lyndhurst in Gateshead; and
the Benjamin Gott High School in Leeds.
Most are still maintained by their local education authority but a number of
schools which have special status as part of government initiatives to
revitalise education in inner cities are also among the lowest performers.
For example no pupils achieved five GCSE grade Cs or better at Battersea
Technology College in Wandsworth, south London, which specialises in
technology.
Some are near much more successful schools, leading to the claim that
selective schools in big cities, often believed to have offered social
mobility to able children from deprived backgrounds, have helped ensure
other urban schools are even less successful.
For example in Liverpool, the Blue Coat school, a comprehensive with
long-rooted independent traditions and one of the highest GCSE pass-rates in
the country, co-exists with several of the weakest performers.
Three Birmingham schools appear in the bottom 50 in spite of the presence in
the city of King Edward's and King Edward VI independent schools, which
offer state assistance to children through the government's assisted places
scheme, and several grammar schools. The city ranks 85th overall among
English education authorities, slightly better than its level of social
deprivation might indicate.
Value-added studies by academics suggest that pupils at all levels of
ability perform better in exams if the children surrounding them are more
able. This is usually taken as an argument for selectivity, but as
researchers such as Mr Peter Tymms of the University of Newcastle put it in
a recent study, the finding could lead to two separate policies: 'Does it
make sense to separate out the very able so that they can feed,
intellectually, on one another or should their beneficial influence be as
widely spread as possible?'
The presence of many big independent day schools in London may also have
speeded 'middle-class flight', hitting inner-city comprehensives.
Only 11 per cent of pupils managed the equivalent of five O-levels at
Highbury Grove in Islington, north London, where Sir Rhodes Boyson, the
former Conservative education minister, was once headmaster. It serves an
area hit hard by social deprivation, but many parents in the borough's
pockets of affluence may have opted out of the state system.
Mr David Blunkett, the Labour education spokesman, yesterday seized on these
figures, promising action to deal with inner-city 'sink' schools. He said:
'Where we will do much more than this government is by acting to help those
schools which are falling behind, to prevent them from becoming sink
schools.'
He added action was crucial in primary schools, if under-achievement at
secondary schools was to be stopped.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Wales 'long way short of targets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All eight counties in Wales have shown an improvement this year in the
average performance of pupils at state schools in obtaining GCSE passes. But
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said the results left Wales still behind
England and Scotland and 'a long way short of our targets'.
He said he was pleased that 136 maintained schools had recorded an
improvement in the number of pupils achieving five or more A-C grades and
that the Welsh average had improved from 37 per cent to 39 per cent.
He added, however: 'The spread of results, with the best LEA school
obtaining 73 per cent and the worst only 4 per cent, is far too wide. More
action is needed to lift standards in the worst performing schools.'
Average performance ranged from 30 per cent of pupils gaining five or more
A-C grades in Mid Glamorgan to 45 per cent in Dyfed and Powys. The biggest
improvements were in South Glamorgan, which went from 35 per cent last year
to 40 per cent, and in Powys, which was up from 40 per cent.
The highest-scoring state school - with 73 per cent of pupils gaining five
or more A-C grades - was Bishop of Llandaff High School in Cardiff. The
worst performing, with 4 per cent, was Glan Ely High School in Cardiff.
Among independent schools Westbourne College gained a 100 per cent figure,
and Howell's School 99 per cent. Both are in South Glamorgan.
More than 19 out of 20 state pupils aged 15 were entered for at least one
GCSE or Certificate of Education this year, and nine out of 10 pupils gained
one or more graded GCSE result.
At A/AS-level all counties but one showed an improvement in the average
passes of candidates entered for two or more subjects. The exception was
Gwynedd, which on a points basis stayed at 14, the same level as last year.
The average for Welsh schools rose from 14 to 15.
The range was from 13 points in Mid Glamorgan to 16 in Powys and South
Glamorgan.
The highest rating by a state school was by Penglais Comprehensive,
Aberystwyth, with an average per pupil of 23 points for those taking two or
more subjects. In the independent sector Ffynone House School in West
Glamorgan scored best with 28 points.
This year the Welsh Office publishes the absenteeism level at schools. Mr
Redwood said: 'I recognise that irregular attendance in many cases might be
out of the immediate control of the school. But I hope by publishing these
figures it will encourage schools to investigate unauthorised absences.
'I find it very worrying that in Mid Glamorgan pupils on average miss more
than one day a fortnight, and in South Glamorgan more than one fifth of all
the absences are unauthorised.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Scotland reports steady improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tables of examination results for Scottish schools show a small but
steady improvement over the past three years in the performance of pupils in
Standard grade, the exam taken by those aged 14 and 15.
There was also a modest improvement in highers, the main examination for
school leavers entering further and higher education.
The tables, covering 1992-93, also show that schools in Orkney, followed by
Shetland, have the best performance in standard grade and in highers,
followed by the Western Isles and Borders region. Strathclyde region has the
worst performance, with the average of seven areas in the region dragged
down by one of them, Glasgow.
The Scottish Office does not provide a league table of schools, nor does it
give the truancy rate. This is because Scottish Office ministers concluded
that to present results as a league table would be misleading because it
would not take account of individual schools' intake and the economic and
social background of their catchment area.
The Scottish Office believed truancy figures were likely to be misleading.
The tables, produced by the audit unit of HM Inspectors of Schools, contains
11 measures of performance for each secondary school, covering the numbers
of presentations and the grades achieved in standard grades, highers,
certificate of sixth-form studies and vocational certificate modules.
The tables also list the performance of private schools in Scottish
examinations. This does not usually present a full picture of those schools,
because they normally enter pupils for English GCSEs and A-levels, as do a
small number of state schools.
A leading figure in Scottish education said: 'The best way for parents to
use these tables is to study the performance of the school their child is
attending, or will be attending. Unless they know the background against
which other schools operate comparisons are virtually meaningless.'
The tables show that over the three years a slightly higher percentage of
pupils achieved better levels in standard grade, and there was a modest
increase in the percentage of pupils gaining one or more higher in bands A
to C, the top three bands.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton MP, the Scottish Office education minister, said
the government would be studying a way of measuring the value added to
pupils by each school.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: GCSE yardstick shows 5% boost -
Figures for A-levels reveal 4% improvement / Selective independents continue
their dominance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second year running the Department for Education performance tables
of English schools show sharp improvements in GCSE and A-level exams.
In the most closely monitored indicators, schools logged a 5.35 per cent
improvement in the numbers passing at least five GCSE exams at grade C or
better. The performance of pupils taking mainly A-levels in the sixth form
improved by 4 per cent.
The national average was for 43.3 per cent of a school's pupils to achieve
at least five C grades at GCSE, while 85.6 per cent achieved five at the
lower grade of G.
Candidates for two A-levels or more managed a score of 16.7 Ucas points on
average, a 4 per cent improvement from 1993.
These figures, following an improvement of 8 per cent in GCSE performance
last year, fuelled claims that schools' behaviour had been changed by the
tables.
The government now seems likely to publish new indicators next year,
however. There has been renewed criticism that the tables do not put
schools' performance in sufficient context to make sound judgment.
That criticism is made on two grounds: that the tables exclude measures of
pupils' ability when they started at school, and that they omit social and
economic problems in a school's catchment area.
The Labour party and Labour-led local authority associations back
publication of such measures. They now approve of league tables in
principle, although they object to the way the government has chosen to
present the information.
Independent schools have continued their dominance, accounting for all but
four of the top schools in the A-level league and almost three quarters of
the 200 judged by their GCSE results.
Figures for vocational qualifications taken by 16-year-olds gave support to
the government's decision to introduce new, more rigorous General National
Vocational Qualifications in schools next year. The national average pass
rate in schools which offered vocational qualifications to 16-year-olds was
87.6 per cent.
Local authorities, having abandoned their opposition to the tables, said
more information rather than less should be published. This was partly
because of the continued powerful correlation between social deprivation and
poor scores in GCSE exams.
As last year the Financial Times has included an indicator of social
deprivation to put local authorities' performance into context. This is
taken from the Additional Educational Needs index, which until last year was
used by the environment department as part of its calculations for
distributing grants to councils.
This index was calculated using three factors: the proportion of benefit
claimants in an area, the proportion of children from single-parent
families, and the proportion of immigrants (an indication of the number of
children who do not speak English as a first language). It has been
discontinued, but local authority associations believe the index as updated
last year provides a fair reflection of the social problems faced by
different authorities.
As happened last year, the authorities with the most additional educational
needs had the weakest GCSE results. Southwark in London, bottom for the
second year in three, ranked 102nd of the 108 authorities in England which
administer secondary schools for social deprivation. All the authorities in
the bottom 10 by GCSE performance were in the bottom 20 judged by
deprivation.
It appears difficult for individual local education authorities to shift
more than a few places in the overall tables from year to year. Only 12
authorities moved by more than 10 places compared with last year.
The Isles of Scilly's one secondary school has children up to the age of 16
and has negligible truancy. It is top for the third year running and is
likely to remain so.
The rest of the upper reaches are dominated by outer-London boroughs, whose
problems tend to be overstated by the index of additional educational needs,
and by counties in the south-east.
The Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities, whose members
include several of the worst-performing authorities at GCSE, said the
government should have included a measure of schools' improvement.
It published its own figures, compiled by Keele University, for 75 London
schools, mapping their performance since 1990, when the Inner London
Education Authority was abolished and control of education was given to the
inner London boroughs.
This used an index for GCSE performance with the 1990 level taken as 100. On
this basis only one school failed to improve since 1990 while five had more
than doubled their performance.
Ms Sheila Knight, who chairs the association's education committee, said the
tables 'can lead to complacency in those schools which are apparently doing
well, and demoralisation in those schools which are working desperately hard
to improve the results of less able pupils'. She called for a measure of
schools' improvement to be included.
The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority is expected to publish its
proposals for showing the value which schools have added to pupils next
week. They are expected to endorse a measure similar to that used by the
association.
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities, also Labour-controlled, backed
publishing more information rather than less, and said the job could be done
more cheaply by the authorities themselves.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Familiar names crop up at the top of
the list
</HEADLINE>

The list of England's top schools produced by the government's examination
performance tables has a familiar look about it.
Selective independent schools dominate, with only four state schools in the
top 50 when judged by A-levels - all four long-established grammar schools
with a history of independence and which have opted out of local authority
control.
Virtually all are in urban areas, which provide a large pool of academically
able children, and their sixth forms are small compared with the sixth-form
and further education colleges where most English students now take
A-levels.
Most exceptions to these general rules have strong inbuilt advantages. For
example the only top 50 school with more than 200 A-level candidates was
Eton College, arguably the most famous and prestigious boarding school in
England. Manchester Grammar, the next biggest, has a similarly formidable
reputation.
Two other schools named in the Clarendon report at the end of the last
century - Westminster and St Paul's, both in London - finished ahead of
Eton.
Less privileged schools which managed a strong result include The Grange,
Northwich, founded as a grammar school in 1978, and York College for Girls,
an Anglican foundation which this year entered only 16 pupils for A-level
and plans to amalgamate with a local Quaker school.
The top performers, as last year, are the King Edward's and King Edward VI
High Schools, independent schools on adjoining sites near Birmingham
university.
Both are highly selective and financially well-resourced, having raised
money from corporate sponsors for capital projects such as a new
craft-teaching block. They also make maximum use of the assisted places
scheme - attacked at the weekend by the Labour party - which provides state
aid to help families on low incomes to pay fees.
Similar criteria are at work at GCSE level, although the government figures
do not differentiate sufficiently to draw strong conclusions. Of the 97
schools listed by the Department for Education as achieving five GCSE passes
of at least grade C for all their pupils, only 17 are in the state sector.
Again, most serve affluent or big urban catchment areas.
They are: Kendrick Girls' Grammar, Reading; King Edward VI Camp Hill and
King Edward VI Handsworth, Birmingham; Newstead Wood School, Orpington;
Aylesbury High School; Pate's Grammar School, Cheltenham; Dartford and
Rochester Girls' Grammar Schools, Kent; Clitheroe Royal Grammar School,
Lancashire; Skegness Grammar School, Lincolnshire; Woodford County High,
London; Newport Girls' High, Shropshire; Altrincham Grammar, Cheshire; Queen
Mary's Grammar, Walsall; King Edward VI Grammar, Stratford-upon-Avon; Bishop
Wordsworth's, Salisbury; and Wolverhampton Girls' High School.
Only five of these are still maintained by their local education authority.
But many of the schools which have opted out of local control had a
tradition of independence before they joined their local authority, so these
figures do not necessarily point to improved academic success once schools
opt out.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Treasury windfall found in Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has been handed a pre-Budget crock of gold with news that for
the past 18 years it has been sitting on a pile of banknotes which could
modestly contribute to cutting the UK's expected Pounds 32bn budget deficit
this financial year.
Notes worth Pounds 300,000 have been booked in the Treasury's name in a
secure deposit in the vaults of the Bank of England deep under Threadneedle
Street since 1976.
Customs &amp; Excise officers seized the money while enforcing foreign currency
controls designed to stop large sums of cash being channelled in and out of
Britain. The controls were dropped in 1979.
A Treasury official welcomed the Financial Times's discovery of the
existence of the cash, and said it would look into the matter. 'Every little
bit helps,' the official said, referring to the assumption that the money
could be used to fund public spending.
The cash was seized from a Swiss-based 'middle man', who had a business
allegedly spiriting money from UK individuals out of the country.
The Swiss agent was arrested in London by Customs, acting on behalf of the
Treasury, and a suitcase containing the notes was confiscated for use as
evidence in court proceedings.
But the suspect later fled to continental Europe and has never stood trial,
with the Treasury later abandoning interest.
Because the seizure took place in the City of London - and the Bank seemed
the obvious place to store the money - it was handed over to Threadneedle
Street for safe keeping.
Although legally the cash would appear to belong to the UK citizens who
entrusted it to the Swiss agent, no one has come forward to claim it.
Property seized by Customs can be sold, with any proceeds handed to the
Treasury's consolidated fund used for public spending.
So assuming the Treasury can sort out the paperwork in time, Mr Clarke may
be able to announce in his Budget next week that an extra Pounds 300,000
will be available to be spent on public projects or used for a modest tax
reduction.
The Treasury's lack of knowledge of the Pounds 300,000 worth of notes will
do little to boost its reputation for sound control of the nation's
finances.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Eggar rules out single regulator for the utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, yesterday ruled out for several
years at least the creation of a single energy regulator and other
significant reforms to utility regulation.
He said the UK had 'got the balance between bureaucracy and accountability
just about right' in regulation.
Mr Eggar's comments follow criticism of recent regulatory decisions and
calls from within the regulated industries for reform.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, has been among those
pressing for reform, saying that regulators should be brought together in a
single organisation and their deliberations made more open.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, gas regulator, has suggested a need for a single
energy regulator in the long term.
Mr Eggar said at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs
that the essence of UK policy was that industries and their problems were
different.
He said: 'Each needs a different regulatory approach. There are some issues
where fine judgments of fairness and public interest need to be made and
where a commission is precisely what is needed. That is why our regulatory
arrangements already have one, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.'
Mr Eggar said a specialist regulator could develop the depth of
understanding of each industry. 'The changes which are coming in the gas and
electricity industries are sufficiently complex to require the undivided
attention of a specialist before the case for a single energy regulator
could be properly considered,' he said.
He added: 'The fact that both sides complain at most regulatory decisions
may well mean that most of the time the regulators are getting it just about
right.
'Certainly the dramatic efficiency improvements of the past few years
suggest that the new structures we have created are delivering our overall
objectives.'
Mr Eggar said rules for good regulatory practice included 'consistency and
predictability, transparency, and speed and efficiency.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Sizing up the chancellor's shade of green - The
environmental options business and lobbyists would like to see in the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The caution with which environmental pressure groups, manufacturers and
retailers greeted the proposed pollution measures announced in last week's
Queen's Speech was typical of the wariness surrounding government attempts
to 'green' domestic and business activities.
They are now wondering whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will
include measures intended to help the environment in his Budget next week.
Business is concerned about how fiscal instruments will affect
competitiveness. Pressure groups fear taxation could be used to replace
regulatory measures.
Most groups expect the chancellor to continue raising duty on fuel. Mr Roger
Bate, director of the environment unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs,
said: 'He is committed to a 5 per cent real increase per annum on fuel . . .
There was quite a lot of bad press on VAT on domestic fuel but now that is
considered water under the bridge so my guess is that will probably stay.'
Some analysts argue that increasing fuel prices - especially for cars - may
make little or no impact on pollution. Mr John Cridland, environment
director of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'It has not been
demonstrated that increasing the price on petrol would reduce the cars on
the road.'
Mr Bate warned that fuel taxes bore most heavily on those who were least
responsible for the problem. 'The worst effects are on disparate groups,
like rural individuals who contribute very little to pollution. It would be
better to privatise the roads or introduce congestion pricing,' he said.
Alternative options for addressing this problem would need a longer
timescale than one Budget and would entail considerable capital investment.
One such option might be congestion pricing - taxing car owners based on the
amount of time they spend in traffic jams - to target the environmental
problem directly, rather than taxing activities associated with
environmental damage, such as the use of fuel.
Such a charge would require cars to be fitted with a smart card that would
tally the minutes spent idling in traffic, with the owner charged
accordingly, encouraging drivers to travel at different times or to use
public transport.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which produced a prospectus for possible
inclusions in the Budget, discussed one mechanism for direct taxation of
pollution: emission taxation on individual sources. Units of pollution would
be measured much like gas or electricity use, and taxed proportionately.
The institute said there was a trade-off between direct taxes such as
emission taxation, and financial instruments based on existing tax bases -
such as VAT on fuel. Setting up a new tax system might entail high
administrative costs, but is more likely to be specifically levied on
sources of pollution.
In the Queen's Speech the government made clear its plans to push through
schemes to increase recycling. One instrument that could encourage this is a
landfill levy - a charge on landfill owners in the hope that the extra cost
would be passed on to customers, encouraging them to seek other
alternatives.
The CBI supports a charge on the packaging industry to support recycling but
is sceptical about the landfill levy. Mr Cridland said: 'No analysis has
been done with the landfill levy to assess the effect it will have on
business or the environment.'
With all green taxation issues, he said, it was important to consider
whether the benefit of a particular tax to the environment outweighed the
impact on business competitiveness.
He said: 'Economic instruments are a very trendy policy mechanism but their
introduction does not always follow a thorough assessment of whether the
cost will outweigh the benefit.'
Friends of the Earth believes cost-benefit analyses should be subservient to
the need to prevent pollution at source. Mr Andrew Lees, campaign director,
said: 'A cost-benefit analysis in the traditional approach is an
inappropriate tool for assessment . . . How do you do a cost benefit
analysis on the basis of value for money today versus value for money later?
Environmental assets increase with time.'
While Friends of the Earth advocates the use of taxation to curb
environmental damage, it does not believe taxation can eliminate the
problems on its own.
Mr Lees said: 'Economic instruments can only be used for fine-tuning, they
are no substitute for the regulatory approach. The government may use
environmental taxes to camouflage its deregulated agenda.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Benn expelled from MPs' sleaze inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwing Labour MP, was last night voted off the
Commons committee on privileges which is investigating allegations of sleaze
against two Conservative MPs.
The decision to remove Mr Benn was taken by the 17 MPs on the committee
after the former Labour cabinet minister broke its rules and gave the press
an account of the discussions at its last meeting.
The decision was taken after a session lasting 1 1/2 hours, and will be
debated in the Commons - possibly later this week. The Labour MP can only be
formally removed after a vote by the entire House.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons and chairman of the committee,
said after the meeting: 'The committee has met and agreed a report to the
House recommending Mr Benn be removed from the committee forthwith. The
report, together with the minutes of the proceedings relating to the
committee, will be published as soon as possible.'
Mr Benn later released his own report of the committee's proceedings and the
background to the meeting.
It is understood that only two MPs - Mr Bill Michie, the MP for Sheffield
Heeley, and Mr Benn himself - voted against the expulsion. One Labour
committee member said that he backed the principle of opening some committee
sessions to the public but Mr Benn's policy of giving the press a full
account of private sessions could not be justified.
The committee is due to interview two Conservative MPs, Mr Graham Riddick
and Mr David Tredinnick, in the next few weeks after allegations that they
received cash for asking parliamentary questions.
It is also expected to probe allegations that two former ministers, Mr Neil
Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, took payments from Mr Mohamed Fayed, the chairman
of Harrods, for tabling questions.
The committee has been in deadlock since last month when Labour MPs,
including Mr Benn, withdrew from its proceedings over a decision to hold the
inquiry in camera.
Labour MPs have insisted that justice must be seen to be done in the
'cash-for-questions' affair. But Tory MPs have expressed fears that a public
session - which could be reported under the protection of 'parliamentary
privilege' - would be unfair to interviewees.
After its last session on November 1 Mr Benn published the committee's
private deliberations as 'my own reports of its proceedings'. His account of
the meeting showed that the Conservative members argued strongly against
interviewing Mr Riddick and Mr Tredinnick as long as Mr Benn insisted on
publication.
A motion expelling the MP could be put to the Commons later this week. The
committee will decide under what conditions it will interview the two Tory
MPs after the expulsion has been debated.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Gas dash warning for coal sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal's remaining English mines could sell less than 20m tonnes a
year to the electricity generators after 1998 following a renewal in the
dash for gas, Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of the
corporation, said yesterday.
This compares with contracted sales of about 29m tonnes a year until 1998.
Mr Edwards' forecast compares with that by RJB Mining, the coal company
chosen as the government's preferred bidder to take over the three English
coal regions, that the market will be at least 28m tonnes at the end of the
century, with it supplying the bulk.
Mr Edwards told a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs
that prices in core contracts with generators were likely to be Pounds 1.10
a gigajoule or less after 1998. RJB assumed a price of Pounds 1.32 a
gigajoule in the key assumptions for its Pounds 914m bid for the three
regions. Mr Edwards' company, Coal Investments, bid for the two regions
around the Yorkshire area and Nottinghamshire.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Unsafe factory ships detained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixteen foreign ships, including five Bulgarian fish factory vessels or
'Klondykers', were detained in UK ports last month after failing safety
inspections, the Department of Transport said yesterday, Charles Batchelor
writes.
Evidence of a crackdown on fish factory ships came less than three weeks
after the government announced a series of other measures to tighten
controls because of the poor levels of maintenance on these vessels. From
next year Klondykers will have to apply in advance for licences to operate
in British waters.
Many governments have started to institute tougher controls of vessels
entering their ports because of growing dissatisfaction with the quality of
supervision exercised by the states under whose flags the vessels sail.
The five detained vessels, all flying the Bulgarian flag and owned by the
Bulgarian company Okeanski Ribolov, revealed a catalogue of deficiencies.
They were infested with cockroaches or rodents, had unhygienic accommodation
and had inadequately qualified crews.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Hamilton repeats Fayed denials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, last night denied
that he had been guilty of any impropriety as a result of his involvement
with Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods.
In his first speech in the Commons since returning to the back benches, Mr
Hamilton attacked the press for hounding him out of office after he had been
subjected to allegations.
He insisted that there was no truth in the claim that, before becoming a
minister, he had accepted bribes at 'Pounds 2,000 a time' to put down
parliamentary questions.
Nor, said Mr Hamilton, had he received Pounds 50,000 for putting down 17
questions for the House of Fraser, the one-time owner of Harrods.
Tory backbenchers rallied to his support as he denied abusing his position
as an MP, or betraying the trust of the prime minister.
Mr Hamilton said he bitterly resented suggestions that 'I was prepared to to
accept payment in cash or kind to ask parliamentary questions or change my
opinions'.
He contrasted the extended publicity given to his 'celebrated stay' at the
Ritz hotel in Paris - owned by Mr Fayed - to the brevity of a report about a
payment which Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, had failed
to declare in the Commons register of interests through a 'mere technical
over-sight'.
Mr Hamilton dismissed charges of 'so-called sleaze' levelled at the
government in general, and stressed that the 'plethora of allegations' to
which he had been subjected in no way concerned his conduct as a minister.
He suggested that the Nolan committee examining the standards of conduct in
public life should have its remit extended to cover the activities of the
media. Mr Hamilton said the power of an editor vastly transcended that of
most MPs and that of many ministers.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Regional bias 'hampers R &amp; D'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's poor record in research and development in recent years, relative
to its main competitors, is partly attributable to the overwhelming
concentration of R &amp; D activity in south east England, says a report
published yesterday.
This concentration leads to poaching of workers, creates skill shortages and
fuels wage inflation, says the report by Newcastle University's Centre for
Urban and Regional Development Studies.
It says that the government's 'free-market' approach to the funding of R &amp; D
is a factor in the creation of this regional imbalance.
Tackling the UK's poor R &amp; D performance is central to addressing its
decline as a manufacturing economy, says the report.
It says the UK experience contrasts with that of other European Union
countries, where governments have developed policies to regionalise R &amp; D
activity by building on industrial clusters.
It advocates that the UK government creates a strong regional dimension to R
&amp; D policy by setting up regional technology teams, or task forces, to
promote research networks with a clear sectoral focus, linking small- and
medium-sized businesses with universities and big companies with significant
R &amp; D resources. The task forces' immediate role would be to sponsor
research, policy and analysis and sectorally-sensitive R &amp; D initiatives.
The report, produced for the north east-based Trade Union Studies
Information Unit, says that among European countries, the US and Japan, only
in the UK did the proportion of gross domestic product spent on R &amp; D
decline in the 1980s.
There was also a marked shift from public to private R &amp; D financing, with
public sector expenditure concentrated on defence-related activities.
The report was sparked by a recent spate of heavy job losses in the north
east, concentrated in highly skilled craft, technical and scientific grades.
The report says such jobs are those which the region can least afford to
lose.
It questions whether the current emphasis on diversification of the regional
industrial base through inward investment, such as Samsung's recently
announced Pounds 450m electronics complex for Teesside, is addressing
underlying structural problems.
Mr Andy Pike, one of the authors of the report, said: 'You can see Samsung
as a great success, or a confirmation of the north east's role in Europe as
a low-cost assembly location.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Litigation against coastguard rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coastguard service cannot be sued for negligence over the way its staff
perform their normal duties, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Claims for damages against the service, controlled by the Department of
Transport, would be against the public interest because its efficiency and
the trust between it and the sea-going community could be damaged, Judge
Gareth Edwards QC said.
He dismissed claims for negligence against the service which alleged
coastguards had failed to respond promptly to the distress calls on
September 5 1988 of fishing boat Inspire, which sank off the Welsh coast
with the loss of three lives.
The claims were made by Mr Sam Skinner, sole survivor of the incident, who
suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after his ordeal, and the widow of
crew member David Webster.
Mr Skinner and Mr Webster's widow sued the Department of Transport, claiming
that coastguards should have acted on Mr Skinner's Mayday distress call at
3.20pm that day - heard very indistinctly by a radio operator - instead of
waiting until the boat was reported overdue at 10.30pm.
The judge ruled that coastguards owed no legally enforceable duty of care to
any member of the seafaring community - even in emergencies - except when
the danger was created by their own actions.
'The coastguard has vast responsibilities and slender resources,' he said.
'Litigation could involve examination of operational decisions made at a
time when an officer had to choose swiftly between several options.'
The threat of legal action was unlikely to prompt higher standards, but
might lead to a 'defensive mentality' and a drop in the effectiveness of the
service.
The judge added that he doubted whether many seafarers would wish their
relationship with the coastguard to be soured by the possibility of
litigation.
He noted that the widow of Mr Terry Jones, skipper of the boat, did not
pursue a damages claim, and said it was possible that Mr Skinner, who owed
his life to the coastguards, initially took the same view.
But Mr Skinner's psychologist had encouraged him to bring the legal action
because a finding of blame against someone might have helped him recover
from his trauma.
The judge went on: 'Speaking for myself, I wish to advise those who believe
in therapy by litigation to think again.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Small-business report slams big banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four largest clearing banks are generally seen by small businesses as
providing worse services than those offered by the smaller banks, according
to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business.
The findings, produced by the University of Nottingham on the basis of 5,500
responses to questionnaires, showed Allied Irish Banks with the highest
score at 57.1 and TSB with the lowest at 44.2.
Two years ago, a similar survey showed that the highest score was 52.2 (Bank
of Scotland) and the lowest, 43.8 (Lloyds Bank). Lloyds is now equal second
with Yorkshire Bank on 57.1, while Barclays Bank is at 48.5 and National
Westminster Bank, 50.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the FPB, said the survey showed that
small businesses were deterred from changing bank because they saw few
differences and were concerned about the difficulties of switching accounts.
It also suggested that the larger the business, the better the relationship
it tended to have with its bank.
Mr Stuart White, head of small business at Midland Bank, said the message
for the clearing banks was that they needed to concentrate continually on
their relationships with small businesses.
Mr White, who chairs the small-firms subcommittee of the British Bankers'
Association, said it was encouraging that banks in general had scored higher
than they had done two years ago. He acknowledged, however, that this might
be partly due to a more favourable economic climate, rather than because of
rising service standards in banks.
Yesterday's report uses the same data as the FPB's report last month, which
indicated that small businesses believe banks are providing worse value for
money now than they were four years ago.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Wakeham to lead press watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Wakeham, former government chief whip and leader of the Lords, was
yesterday confirmed as the new chairman of the Press Complaints Commission,
to succeed Lord McGregor on January 1.
'The task now is not simply to maintain self-regulation, but to strengthen
it - to put its survival beyond the bounds of reasonable political debate,'
Lord Wakeham said yesterday. 'That is vital not just for the sake of the
press but for the health of our democracy.'
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's heritage spokesman, said he doubted if Lord Wakeham
would have the 'robust independence' which was essential in the job. 'It is
another job for an ex-Conservative Minister. . . . what we need is someone
who holds the public's interest first and foremost.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Exchange unveils Pounds 30m computer update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has unveiled the main elements of the technology
which it hopes will secure its future as a world operator in equities
markets.
It announced yesterday the availability of London Market Information Link,
the most important phase in the 'Sequence' programme of electronic trading
and information services. In the next two years Sequence will replace the
exchange's collection of incompatible computers and software systems which
have grown up since the 'Big Bang' in 1985.
LMIL provides traders and independent information providers with trading
data in digital (computer code) form, as well as the infrastructure to
support future services. It is intended to operate in parallel with
MarketLine, the existing computer readable service, until March 31 next year
when the older service will be closed.
About 30 customers - chiefly the bigger market makers such as BZW and
information providers such as Reuters - already receive the new data feed,
which has so far cost the exchange about Pounds 30m to develop. They have
had to develop their own software to receive the feed.
The software was developed under contract by Andersen Consulting, which also
has a contract to manage the exchange's computer systems. Mr Hugh Morris,
Andersen partner with responsibility for the exchange account, said LMIL was
the foundation for a programme which would help the City cut costs and
simplify its systems.
Ms Christine Dann, director of business operations at the exchange, said:
'Sequence demonstrates the exchange's commitment to maintain the
competitiveness of the markets as a whole and London's position as an
international financial centre.'
The short time-scale for the Big Bang's implementation in the 1980s forced
the exchange to build systems on an ad hoc basis, resulting in higher costs
and a lack of flexibility for its users.
It is determined not to repeat the experience with Sequence. Customers will
receive information and be able to trade through a single digital interface.
New services can be added without altering the interface, and changes to
exchange rules will be possible by simple amendments to existing software.
There are as yet no firm plans for linking the new electronic trading
systems to Crest, the electronic settlement system under development by the
Bank of England.
Unless the two systems can be linked information will have to be keyed in
twice at higher cost and with greater risk of errors.
Not all exchange members are convinced about the new service. ADP, the
US-based information provider, is offering software which will convert the
new service into the old format.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Growth 'puts pressure on capacity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent growth of UK manufacturing is putting even greater pressure on
capacity, particularly in sectors such as clothing, paper and printing, a
survey suggests.
The survey, by Trade Indemnity, the credit management group, found that 48
per cent of clothing manufacturers were operating at or above optimum
capacity.
Among paper and printing companies the ratio was 45 per cent, the second
highest of any industry sector.
In all, 42 per cent of the 687 companies surveyed in the third quarter said
they were operating near their optimum capacity, with 7 per cent claiming to
be 'overstretched.'
Meanwhile, only 3 per cent of companies report that they are operating below
50 per cent of their optimum capacity, compared with 26 per cent in the same
period last year. Trade Indemnity suggests this trend is 'the twin result of
capacity reductions and increasing demand.'
The survey shows that demand is picking up across most sectors, although
companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 20m are experiencing the
biggest increase.
Business services and food distribution groups are the most optimistic
sector, with 62 per cent and 60 per cent respectively expecting activity to
pick up soon.
The survey notes that one problem that continues to dog businesses is late
payment of bills. Only 2 per cent of companies said they were being paid on
time, showing no improvement since last year. The average late payment time
was 22 days, with paper and printing companies reporting the highest late
payment level of 27 days.
Meanwhile, the average value of long overdue debt rose in the past quarter
to Pounds 157,000, compared to Pounds 118,000 in the third quarter of last
year.
The survey found rising raw material costs were creating greater pressure on
margins and undermining profitability, particularly in the paper, printing,
timber, furniture and textiles sectors.
Ms Barbara Bennet of Trade Indemnity said: 'The upward pressure on raw
materials prices and an increase in the average value of long-term debts are
both significant negative trends . . . they mean that credit risk will be
more difficult to predict and the paper and printing sector is already
showing itself to be under considerable pressure.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Materials demand widens trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union
widened slightly last month, as the recent manufacturing growth sucked in
more raw materials.
But export volumes rose to a new record, and the underlying trade pattern
continued to point to a relatively benign trend.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the trade deficit with non-EU
countries - which account for almost half of all UK trade - was Pounds 410m
in October, up from a deficit of Pounds 333m in September.
A surprising deterioration in the oil balance accounted for some of the
increase. In the three months to October, compared with the previous three
months, the value of oil exports fell 17 per cent.
The CSO said the drop partly reflected the fact that oil exports to North
America had surged in the summer.
Measured without oil, the trade deficit fell slightly in October. Excluding
both oil and erratics, and calculated on a three-monthly basis - a
measurement that represents the best guide to the underlying trend - the
deficit was Pounds 1.09bn in the three months to October, down from Pounds
1.44bn in the previous three months.
A rise in imports was the other reason for the deficit widening. The total
value of imports rose 1 per cent in October, compared with September, while
import volumes grew 4 per cent.
The total value of exports fell 0.5 per cent in the month, while export
volumes grew only 2.5 per cent.
The rise in imports was primarily generated by increased demand for
industrial raw materials, which reflected the broader recovery in
manufacturing in recent months.
Imports of pulp, paper, textiles and other raw materials grew in the month,
the CSO said, with overall imports of basic materials running 6.5 per cent
higher in the three months to October compared with the previous three
months. Compared with the same period a year ago, imports of raw materials
were 16 per cent higher.
Imports of consumer goods dropped significantly, running 6.5 per cent lower
in the three months to October compared with the previous three months.
Analysts yesterday said that the fall in imported consumer goods reflected
weak consumer demand and possibly some import substitution. Economists were
divided about the broader implications of the rise in industrial import
volumes.
Mr Jonathan Loynes, economist at Midland Global Markets, pointed out that
rising imports of basic materials suggested that industrial production would
rise in the months ahead, and said that the downward trend in the deficit
was continuing. But Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura, Japanese
securities house, said the deficit was likely to deteriorate further, as
rising demand sucked in more imports, while the recent strengthening of
sterling could reduce exports further.

FT  22 NOV 94 / 'Cautious consumers' bad news for shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence is improving slightly but high street shops will
probably not see a bumper Christmas this year, according to consumer surveys
released yesterday by Gallup and Barclaycard.
The latest survey conducted by Gallup on behalf of the European Commission
found that consumer confidence rose slightly this month, with 19 per cent of
people surveyed saying that they expected their household finances to
improve in the next 12 months, compared with 18 per cent last month.
Meanwhile, 27 per cent said they expected their finances to deteriorate, a
significant improvement from the pattern seen in spring, when more than 40
per cent of households expected a deterioration.
The negative balance of eight between these two numbers was the second best
result this year, up from September's 11 per cent. The last time a positive
balance was recorded was in May 1993.
The proportion of people indicating that they believe it is a good time to
make a big purchase such as a washing machine, compared with those who do
not, rose to 11 per cent last month. This was higher than the previous
month's 4 per cent, but in line with levels seen since February.
In spite of this improvement a survey by Barclaycard suggested yesterday
that consumers remain cautious in the approach to Christmas.
Consumers plan to spend an average of just Pounds 325 this Christmas - an
increase of only 2 per cent on last year's figure of Pounds 318, or about in
line with the annual inflation rate.
More than half of consumers say they will finance Christmas from income,
with 27 per cent planning to use their savings, and only 6 per cent
intending to increase their level of credit card borrow-ing.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard's chief executive, said: 'Our experience
. . . suggests consumers are actually more confident than they will admit.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Lockheed confident of winning Hercules battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US aerospace manufacturer, said yesterday it was optimistic
that the UK government would buy its latest generation Hercules C-130J
transport aircraft to replace half its ageing Hercules fleet.
The order for up to 30 aircraft has been bitterly fought between Lockheed
and British Aerospace, which wanted the government to buy the European
Future Large Aircraft.
Lockheed said: 'Because the FLA is not available in time the decision is
between refurbishing the existing Hercules or buying new C-130Js.
Refurbishment does not stack up and no other country has backed it.'
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment beyond saying a final decision
had not been made. It is understood that an MoD evaluation committee has
recommended purchase of the C-130J.
That recommendation will go to ministers and an inter-departmental
committee, with a final decision expected before Christmas.
The committee is likely to recommend that if the MoD does choose the C-130J,
Britain should rejoin the FLA project which it left in 1989.
It is understood that at the Franco-British summit at Chartres last Friday
Mr John Major came under pressure from President Francois Mitterrand for
Britain to rejoin the project.
If Britain rejoins development funds might be made available from the
Department of Trade budget as launch aid, which would not be in breach of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules covering government funding
of aircraft projects.
British Aerospace, the company that would build the wings for the FLA if
Britain joined the project, has argued strongly that its lead in wing design
would be lost to French and German companies if the RAF bought the US
aircraft. It has also argued that all 66 Hercules aircraft would need to be
replaced with the FLA if the company was to gain sufficient work to build
the wings. That objection might be overcome if Britain agrees to replace its
tanker and maritime patrol aircraft with the FLA.
BAe has said the FLA would be bigger and faster than the C-130J, and, if the
UK became a full member of the programme, it would be worth Pounds 5.5bn and
secure 7,500 jobs.
BAe said it was continuing to lobby for refurbishment of the existing
Hercules fleet until the FLA became available in 2002. BAe has submitted a
proposal to the MoD under which it would maintain the Hercules fleet,
including a basic refurbishment, at about 20 per cent of the costs estimated
by the MoD.
BAe has also asked that any decisions be deferred until March, when the full
results of a year-long FLA study will become available. The MoD is thought
to be sticking to its 1994 deadline, effectively ruling out the FLA for the
current competition.
BAe apprentices and engineers will be lobbying parliament tomorrow to argue
for the FLA.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Labour presses for regulation of gas salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is to try to extend the role of the gas industry's
regulatory regime to cover excessive salary increases for top executives.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told the Commons
last night in the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech that Labour would try
to provide the additional powers through an amendment to the government bill
to increase competition in the gas industry.
He underlined the challenge the amendment would provide for Conservative
backbenchers who had criticised the 75 per cent salary rise - to Pounds
475,000 - for Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas.
He said the salary increases were a 'scandal' and condemned Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, for lacking the courage to
oppose them.
Mr Heseltine insisted that since privatisation British Gas had improved its
competitiveness and profitability.
He told jeering Labour MPs that it was the success of the government's
privatisation policy that had forced them to abandon threats of
re-nationalisation.
Mr Heseltine recalled that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had stressed
that the government believed it was necessary for executives to exercise
'restraint' in awarding salary increases. Such increases would also be
subject to judgment by the market and by shareholders.
Downing Street said, however, that although Mr Major would not comment on
the particular case of British Gas, he felt 'very strongly' about excessive
pay rises.
A spokesman said that if shareholders in a private company felt pay rises
were excessive, they could take action to curb them.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, added his voice to
criticisms of the pay shake-up when he told Channel 4 News: 'I think that it
is insensitive and there is no doubt at all that there will be much
criticism of that decision.'
Meanwhile, Mr Brown yesterday insisted he would have earned Pounds 400,000
under his old pay deal, which included bonuses. Now he will just receive the
basic pay.
He added: 'I have got nothing to do with setting my salary at all.
Non-executive directors decide what they think is fair remuneration; they
decide my salary.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Air of mystery around utility pay packages: British Gas's
defence of its executive salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confusion, as well as condemnation, greeted the news of pay rises of up to
75 per cent awarded to the top directors of British Gas. Attempts to get an
overall view of the salary changes have so far been frustrated by a lack of
detailed information.
British Gas attempted to paint the pay rises as compensation for a shake-up
in the executives' perks and pay structure, as well as bringing their pay up
to the level of comparable companies.
The company said that the increases were part of a pay restructuring that
involved shorter contracts, the abolition of annual bonuses and the
replacement of a share option scheme with a long-term incentive plan. It
added: 'They have gained something. They have lost something. There is an
element of compensation in there.'
But this argument was marred by British Gas's inability to give details of
its new long-term incentive plan, which will pay bonuses related to British
Gas's performance compared with other companies in the FT-SE 100 index. The
company said: 'We will just have to wait for the package to be unveiled next
year.'
Depending on its size and performance criteria, the long-term incentive plan
could substantially increase the salaries of the British Gas executives.
According to New Bridge Street Consultants, a pay consultancy, the long-term
incentive plans that have already been introduced in 76 big companies
typically give a maximum annual award worth between 50 per cent and 100 per
cent of salary.
British Gas said the introduction of a long-term incentive scheme in place
of an annual bonus and share options would help make managers 'perform on a
long-term view'.
Compensation consultants were critical about British Gas's decision to
abolish annual bonuses while increasing basic pay. Mr Brian Friedman, head
of compensation and benefits at Arthur Andersen, said: 'I would say it was
counter trend. The trend is towards more bonuses and less basic pay.' The
existence of an annual cash bonus allowed the company to cut pay levels in
bad years, he pointed out.
Consultants were less critical of the decision to set the new levels of
basic pay received by British Gas directors by making comparisons with the
median salary paid in 30 big international companies such as BP, British
Telecommunications, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan. Mr Friedman said: 'For a
company of that size the absolute pay level does not look out of line.'
Mr Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants, said, however, that
choosing a peer group of companies to make such a comparison involved 'a
great element of subjectivity'.
Consultants said it was unusual for both chairman and chief executive to
receive such high salaries. Mr Richard Giordano, as non-executive chairman,
will receive Pounds 450,000 while Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, will
receive Pounds 475,000.
Several aspects of the British Gas scheme are considered to be
forward-looking by pay consultants. Among big companies, Reuters, Courtaulds
and GEC have announced plans to scrap share option schemes, which are often
viewed as depending on a flawed link between share price and performance.
There is a growing trend for companies to put directors on shorter contracts
and give greater details about their remuneration. In the case of British
Gas the promise of greater disclosure does not extend to disclosing the name
of the consultants which advised the remuneration committee.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Tories support sentiments of strategy paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative backbenchers representing a range of views in the party
yesterday voiced support for the main thrust of a strategy paper written by
Mr John Maples, the deputy chairman, and obtained by the Financial Times.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, said he
agreed with most of the sentiments in Mr Maples's paper. 'It is not the
policy itself. It is the way the policies are put over. Our policies are not
being explained properly. What he said - although it was lurid language -
was something most of us would agree with.'
Mr Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, said Mr Maples had hit 'a number of
nails on the head' and produced the sort of document the leadership needed.
'I don't agree with all his comments, but I think he was absolutely right to
give the advice he did in general.'
Mr John Townend, rightwing chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee,
said he had been pressing ministers to wake up to reality for some time.
Mr David Shaw, MP for Dover, said: 'The broad thrust of what John has said
is absolutely right. It closely accords with what people have been saying
inside the party.'
Mr Richard Shepherd, the Eurosceptic MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said the
memorandum 'has effectively been written to the government by every
Conservative MP over the last year'.
Several MPs said Mr Maples accurately reflected their belief that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, should postpone the next increase in value added tax
on fuel due next April.
Labour, which yesterday submitted a petition to 10 Downing Street opposing
the increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent, is to try to force a vote
blocking it after next week's Budget.
Mr Clarke is thought to be determined to press on with the increase. He is
thought to believe that postponing it would merely add to the government's
difficulties by allowing Labour to prolong its attacks on the issue.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, said it was 'significant' that the document
admitted 'on the key areas of concern to the voters - the economy, living
standards, NHS, social division - we are getting it right and they are
getting it wrong'.
Commenting on Mr Maples's suggestion that a few backbench 'yobbos' should
metaphorically beat him up, Mr Blair said he was not particularly surprised:
'Character assassination is their stock-in-trade.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Call for return of cash from IRA raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday called on the IRA
to return the money stolen in a post office raid in Newry on November 10,
during which postal worker Mr Frank Kerr was killed.
Sir Patrick, speaking in Belfast after the organisation's admission of
responsibility for the robbery, said that the IRA 'cannot bring back the
life of Mr Kerr but they can mark their sincerity by returning the money
they stole'.
It is thought that Pounds 130,000 was taken in the raid.
The IRA said its members killed Mr Kerr but the robbery had not been
sanctioned by the leadership.
'Responsibility . . . for this incident lies with an identified problem in
the army's chain of command and not with the volunteers involved. This has
now been rectified,' it said in a statement.
The IRA remained committed to the peace process, the statement added. Asked
whether the IRA admission of guilt would damage plans for exploratory talks
between British officials and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
before Christmas, Sir Patrick said: 'It is important that whether the attack
in Newry took place or not, the timetable laid down by the prime minister
should be adhered to.'
Sir Patrick added, however, that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had made
an important qualification for the talks, that the IRA ceasefire was
permanent.
Northern Ireland officials said yesterday talks were still most likely
before Christmas, although reports they could take place in 10 days' time
are probably premature.
Meanwhile, the implications of the IRA admission over Mr Kerr will be
considered by the Irish Republic's caretaker government today. Acting
justice minister Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn will report to a scheduled meeting
of the cabinet.

FT  22 NOV 94 / MPs question building society accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday questioned how far building societies were accountable to
their millions of members as a cross-party Commons committee resumed its
inquiry into financial regulation.
Against the background of the government review of societies' powers and
duties to their members, MPs on the Treasury committee expressed concern
that if societies were given more powers they could move into higher risk
areas of without members being able to exercise effective control.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society,
admitted to the MPs that societies should do more to ensure that customers
who were members were aware of their membership rights.
He said, however, that there was no need for either consultative committees
or places on the board reserved for 'member directors', as the Treasury's
discussion paper had suggested. Mr Lister called these 'solutions in search
of a problem'.
He and his colleagues insisted that societies needed a more permissive
regulatory regime in which to operate as the personal financial services
sector became ever more competitive.
Mr John Wriglesworth, strategy and marketing general manager, said societies
had to be able to provide the services their customers wanted. 'If you don't
offer them a variety of products, you go out of business,' he said.
This analysis was challenged by Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey
National, who told the committee that not all societies wanted wider powers
or should be subjected to them. Abbey National, the home loans and banking
group, is a former society.
Mr Birch said societies' customers, both members and non-members, should
receive annual statements reminding them of their status and, where
applicable, their rights.
The pressure on societies over accountability was heightened by the British
Bankers' Association, which told the Treasury review there was an
'accountability gap' in the governance of societies. Until this was filled
societies should not be given open-ended powers, it said.

Tate Gallery director Nicholas Serota contemplates the interior of the old
Bankside power station in London yesterday. The disused building, across the
Thames from St Paul's Cathedral, is to be converted into the new Tate
Gallery of Modern Art.
The final shortlist of architects for the Pounds 80m project was announced
yesterday. Just one is from the UK - David Chipperfield Architects. The
others are Herzog &amp; de Meuron (Switzerland), Office for Metropolitan
Architecture (Netherlands), Rafael Moneo (Spain), Renzo Piano Building
Workshop (Italy) and Tadao Ando Architect and Associates (Japan).
The six were chosen from an initial shortlist of 13. The winner will be
announced in February, with the building work due to begin in 1996. The
gallery, which will be bigger than the whole of the Tate's Millbank
building, is planned to open in the year 2000.

Tougher measures to curb the sale of confidential financial information are
being consdiered by the Office of the Data Protection Registrar following
claims that personal information about British Telecommunications' customers
is available on the black market.
A Welsh language current affairs programme, The World on 4, revealed last
night that itemised phone bills could be acquired on the black market, with
details of bank and building society accounts and national insurance
payments.
Mrs Elizabeth France, the registrar of data protection, said yesterday her
office was aware of such undertakings and was looking into ways to take
strong action against offenders.
She said: 'Recent changes approved to the criminal justice and public order
bill will only come into force in January, and we are investigating how this
will affect our powers. The sale of confidential data is of major concern to
us, and we have held talks with British Telecom and other organisations on
this issue.'
BT said there may have been instances where personnel had given out
confidential information. It said: 'In the unlikely event of a British
Telecom employee giving or selling this information, the minimum penalty
would be dismissal.'
BT viewed the issue very seriously, but did not believe it to be a
widespread problem.

Mr John Gardner, the VG managing director, has written to Mr Jonathan Evans,

His company said yesterday the contracts demonstrated that 'News

FT  22 NOV 94 / Granada warned on breach of code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Television faces the prospect of a fine or an on-screen apology for
repeated violations of Independent Television rules on 'undue prominence' of
products in programmes.
The programme complained of is This Morning, the two-hour live, weekday ITV
programme which appears 32 weeks of the year.
Sir George Russell, Independent Television Commission chairman, has informed
Granada that the commission is 'minded to impose a statutory sanction' for
the latest two breaches of the programme and sponsorship codes.
The ITC can impose a fine of up to 3 per cent of Granada's qualifying
revenue in the last financial year or Pounds 150m.
The ITV company has been given a formal warning for an item transmitted on
September 21 which featured Mr Victor Kiam discussing his Lady Remington
range of jewellery. Viewers were invited to win pieces by devising an
advertising slogan for the range.
This, the ITC said yesterday, broke the rules which state that competition
questions must not refer directly or indirectly to the products of the prize
provider. Prizes should not be referred to editorially elsewhere in the
programme. The product was also given undue prominence during the course of
the programme.
On October 12 groceries from the Safeway supermarket group were featured as
competition prizes, the ITC says, again in breach of the rules.
The ITC said yesterday it was concerned by the recurrence of code breaches
on This Morning after six previous interventions during this year and last.
The commission said yesterday: 'The ITC considers the failure to secure
consistent compliance is unacceptable, particularly where advertiser or
product references are involved.'
Ms Andrea Wonfor, joint managing director of Granada Television, said last
night that the complaints 'represent isolated lapses in editorial judgment
but nevertheless we view breaches of the programme code extremely
seriously'.
Granada has now introduced new procedures.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Carpet dealer owes suppliers Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Liverpool carpet wholesaler in business since 1926 has been forced into
receivership because UK consumer confidence has still not revived, a KPMG
Peat Marwick insolvency practitioner said yesterday.
D. Huglin (London) - which in spite of its name operates from Speke,
Liverpool - has debts of Pounds 2m, almost all owed to suppliers. The main
creditor is the Beaulieu carpet manufacturing group in Belgium.
Huglin is in the medium-price market, selling carpets wholesale and through
mail order in the UK and Ireland.
Mr Tim Beer of KPMG, who has been appointed joint administrative receiver
with Mr Philip Ramsbottom, said: 'This is symptomatic of what is going on in
the general economy. Recovery is not as strong as some people hope.
'Neither the housing market - which drives many carpet sales - nor consumer

FT  22 NOV 94 / Asean under pressure to speed the pace of trade
liberalisation: Prospects following the Apec talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To judge by the behaviour of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister,
at last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Jakarta, one
might think that Asean, the six-nation south-east Asian group to which his
country belongs, was in disarray.
Dr Mahathir took the gloss off the occasion by expressing public doubts
about the plan by Apec, the 18-nation trade forum, to free trade and
investment in the Pacific Rim by 2020. That cannot have pleased his host,
President Suharto of Indonesia, a fellow Asean leader, who had set great
store by agreement on this.
Had this been a meeting of the European Union the recriminations might have
reverberated for weeks. Yet it is a measure of both the strength and the
weakness of Asean that there is scarcely a hint of embarrassment. Asean
countries, which also include Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and the
Philippines, are used to the pragmatic view of consensus which characterised
Jakarta. Apec's other 12 members may find that this continues to affect the
pace at which they can move forward.
The essence of Asean's philosophy is that its members avoid coercion and
collaborate only when they perceive it as being in their national interest
to do so. This is in stark contrast to the way others, such as the US, see
Apec. They regard it as a vehicle for cajoling governments to bargain away
some sovereign rights for the sake of the general good.
Mr Hadi Soesastro of Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International
Studies admits that Asean's lowest-common-denominator approach has produced
a 'dismal' record on economic co-operation, but he says that, by shying away
from internal tension, Asean has come to enjoy a 'great sense of
togetherness'.
Moreover, with a population of 340m, a fast-growing economy and an import
market of Dollars 226bn (Pounds 138bn) Asean has assumed considerable
economic significance. 'Asean is an entity that nobody can just push aside,'
says Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's trade minister.
Founded in response to the communist threat at the time of the Vietnam war,
Asean had security matters as its main original concerns - typical for a
group of small countries. Over the years its collaboration has extended both
formally and informally to a wide range of activities. Asean has endorsed
the policy of constructive engagement with the military regime in Burma,
which is most heavily promoted by Thailand and Singapore. With the end of
the cold war, it has sought to refocus the debate on security through its
regional forum which encompasses a range of international dialogue partners.
Now it is also trying to put together its own free trade area, an effort
often dismissed by outsiders because it is basically confined to tariff
reduction and is peppered with exceptions. Even after the sweeping tariff
cuts in its recent budget, Malaysia still affords heavy protection to its
domestic car industry. Indonesia is reluctant to expose its petrochemical
and aerospace industries to full international competition.
If the bad news for Apec is that Asean is likely to resist outside pressure
to speed the pace of regional trade liberalisation, the good news is that it
shows signs of doing so for internal reasons. Already Asean has added
non-processed agricultural goods to the products covered by its free trade
talks and it is reducing the time-frame for liberalisation.
'We might be seen to be rather partial and weak, but we are making
progress,' says Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thai deputy foreign minister.
Among the factors pushing Asean forward is the gradual re-emergence of
Indochina. Asean will not only find itself competing with cheap labour from
this quarter, but will also come under pressure to broaden its membership,
starting probably next year with Vietnam. Overarching the debate will be a
need to offset the growing economic and political power of China.
According to Mr Richard Grant of London's Royal Institute of International
Affairs, pressure from the private sector at home, as well as the perceived
success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will also drive Asean's
own liberalisation process faster than many now expect. Within seven to 10
years a 'fairly complex' arrangement could be in place.
There is no guarantee, though, that the group will then warm to Apec's
ambitious programme. Some argue that Asean's involvement in Apec mostly
reflects a desire to dilute the influence of China and Japan in the region.
Like the regional security forum, the intention is that it should remain
little more than a talking shop. But the risk in the trade policy area is
that another powerful member, the US, will come to dominate proceedings.
That goes a long way to explain both Malaysia's ambivalence and the
predilection of most Asean countries for pushing any binding decisions back
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the new World Trade
Organisation. After all, the multilateral forum is where the influence of
big brothers is most greatly diluted.

FT  22 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Australia beef exports hit by US - Trade
officials fear other nations may join sales ban after pesticide concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Australian trade officials yesterday sought to lessen a threat to the
country's ADollars 3bn (Dollars 2.2bn) a year beef export industry after a
decision by the US to halt the sale of Australian beef until further notice.
The US action follows a temporary ban on the sale of Australian beef by
Japanese retailers. Both countries acted after tests which showed that some
beef consignments might be contaminated with a chemical pesticide used in
cotton growing. The chemical, chlorfluazuron, is found in cotton waste which
was fed to some cattle after the country's severe drought led to limited
grain supplies in September and October.
According to the Cattle Council of Australia, the chemical is non-toxic and
only a very small proportion of Australian cattle - those fed cotton waste
from irrigated cotton - have any chance of being affected. All livestock
from affected areas, predominantly in New South Wales, were being tested.
Nevertheless, the CCA acknowledged that the trade consequences for the beef
industry, Australia's third largest export sector with overseas sales of
ADollars 3.2bn in 1993, could be serious. Australian officials met
counterparts at the US Department of Agriculture last night in an effort to
allay US concerns and resume trade. Afterwards an Australian embassy
official said the department had asked for more data and further talks but
the ban remained in place.
Japan and the US are the two biggest markets, accounting for three-quarters
of beef exports. But there are fears other, smaller customers could follow
the lead taken by the US and Japan.
In Darwin, Mr Bob Collins, the federal primary industries minister, said
testing had shown that 'the actual levels of this chemical that have been
detected are very, very small. It's a question of satisfying the importing
authorities and health authorities in our customer countries that we've done
everything that could be expected of us in terms of containing the problem'.
The enhanced agricultural export opportunities flowing from the Uruguay
trade round could be eroded or even negated if countries are given 'undue
freedom' to pursue unilateral environmental protection measures, the
Australia's National Farmers Federation warned yesterday.
The gain to Australian farmers from the Gatt agreement has been estimated at
about ADollars 1bn a year in additional exports. But it is feared these
opportunities could be much reduced by non-tariff barriers dressed up as
environmental protection measures.

<TEXT>
A delegation from Enron of the US is in Yemen to discuss investment in the
gas sector, including a Pounds 2.5bn (Dollars 4.1bn) Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) project.
Enron had signed a memorandum of understanding with Yemen in December 1993
to exploit gas reserves estimated at between 20 and 30 trillion cubic feet
in the Marib-Jawf area. But Hunt Oil, leading a consortium including Exxon
and South Korea's Yukong, at the time said it had not agreed to any other
company's involvement in the export of the gas it discovered in the Marib
area. The issue was shelved during Yemen's two-month civil war, which ended
on July 7 with the defeat of southern secessionists.
Yemen's Supreme Economic Council, which gives final approval for investment
projects, last week agreed to introduce new terms and conditions for gas
contracts and told the oil ministry to re-evaluate bids from companies. The
LNG project involves a main pipeline from the Marib area to either the Red
Sea or the Arabian Sea as well as a pipeline from Safir in the Marib area to
the capital Sanaa to meet local requirements. It also involves a
liquefaction plant with an annual capacity of 5m tonnes of LNG and an export
terminal.

Australia yesterday urged the 18 countries which signed the Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation 'free trade' agreement to instigate a regular process
to ensure that their trade policies were on track, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney.
Senator Bob McMullen, the country's trade minister, said he envisaged a
process similar to the Gatt trade policy review mechanism, which would help
to 'provide assurance that all Apec participants are moving forward towards
free trade and investment'.
He said that there were four main areas which needed close attention if the
declaration was to be turned in action. These were the review process; the
development of a dispute settlement system; agreement on industry specific
measures and timing; and a decision on how comprehensive the deal should be.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Ecuador determined to open public sector: Government is
pushing ahead with opportunities for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite considerable political opposition and legal obstacles, the
Ecuadorean government is pushing ahead with measures to open its public
sector to private investors.
While strategic sectors such as telecommunications and electricity still
require legislation before state monopolies can be put on the block, a host
of concession contracts will be offered to private investors in other
sectors traditionally operated by the state.
One such move is to have the private sector manage the country's principal
roads. A request for tender to operate large tracts of the Pan-American
highway, which connects the country with its northern neighbour Colombia and
with Peru to the south, will be held in December.
The contracts for 10 of the most profitable sections of the road could be
worth in excess of Dollars 100m in annual revenues.
The government says it can no longer afford to maintain the road, which is
in a dismal state and requires an estimated Dollars 45m (Pounds 27.4m) in
annual upkeep. Less lucrative routes are later to be offered to
public/private joint ventures.
Some 14 enterprises, most of them foreign, have shown interest in bidding,
but there are concerns that protests by motorists against road tolls, a
novelty in Ecuador, may well cause repeated closures.
The state modernisation council, Conam, also announced bids in coming months
for several municipal drinking water projects. This opens a host of
opportunities for the private sector to build and operate water purification
plants in 200 municipalities throughout the country. In the coastal city of
Esmeraldas a private company has already been granted the operation of a
drinking water plant it had constructed.
The Guayaquil port facilities, currently operated by the military-dominated
port authority, are to be offered in concession in the first half of 1995.
The port of Guayaquil, which moves 4m tonnes of cargo annually, is the first
of several Pacific ports on the privatisation list.
Despite much opposition to the construction of a Dollars 600m oil pipeline,
the government remains determined to go ahead with the 15-year
build-operate-transfer concession.
After impeachment of one energy minister and parliament's intention to vote
a second out of office over the issue, the government has had once again to
postpone the bidding process until January 1995.
A consortium of Prudential Securities and the international airline
consultant SH&amp;E is to launch an international road show, promoting the sale
of a 50.1 per cent stake in the Ecuatoriana airline via a special auction to
a pre-selected group of buyers. It is hoped to sell an additional 25 per
cent stake on the stock exchanges in Quito and Guayaquil.
Conam officials decided that Prudential's recent settlement of charges
brought by the US government related to the sale of high-risk limited energy
partnerships to small investors in the US during the 1980s would not affect
diminish its ability to promote Ecuatoriana.
Meanwhile legislation that would allow for the sale of a 45 per cent stake
in the telephone company Emetel is awaiting congressional approval. This
proposal is more likely to be approved than the government's own
telecommunications law, rejected in July. The current proposal was presented
by the opposition Social Christian party, the strongest faction in
parliament. Mr Mauricio Pinto, Conam president, says he expects to offer
Emetel shares in 16 months.
Mr Pinto is equally confident that a good portion of the state electricity
sector can be privatised before the government's term runs out in mid-1996.
'The electricity sector is less controversial than telecommunications or
petroleum,' he says. One advantage is that several public power plant
operators are already constituted as limited companies.
Ecuador's overall investment climate has improved considerably since the
administration of President Sixto Duran Ballen took over two years ago.
Macro-economic stability, liberalised foreign investment regulations, and a
recent debt agreement have restored confidence among foreign investors.
The recent bids for concession contracts in the exploration of oil and the
installation of a cellular phone system suggested strong interest among some
foreign investors. The securities market has seen dramatic growth in recent
months. The Quito stock exchange has seen its trading volume increase by 70
per cent over last year while its price index for the month of October alone
jumped by 30 per cent.
Government statistics confirm growing foreign capital inflows. Direct
foreign investment is to nearly double this year while significant amounts
of repatriated capital continue entering the country. Mr Augusto de la
Torre, general manager of the central bank, says: 'If we can maintain basic
political stability in the near future, we're on our way to becoming Latin
America's next emerging market.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Mexican union cries foul at paper's tactics: Vendors of the
daily Reforma are no respecters of tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Mexico City - where a population of 18m buys a mere 500,000 daily
newspapers - a peculiar kind of circulation war has erupted.
The war is not over price. Nearly all 32 papers in the capital charge the
same high price of 60 US cents per copy. Nor is better information the main
weapon: competition among reporters at most publications still consists of
seeing who can most elegantly transcribe a government press release.
The struggle is instead between an aggressive new daily from the north of
the country and the politically powerful Union of Newspaper Hawkers, whose
17,000 members claim to hold the exclusive right to sell newspapers in the
city.
The fight between the Reforma newspaper, which has just celebrated its first
birthday, and the union is one example of how the old methods of doing
business are breaking down in Mexico.
In the latest twist in the campaign, Reforma sent its own vendors out into
the street last Sunday - the day Mexicans mark their revolution.
It is one of five days in the year when union members do not work and,
therefore, newspapers normally do not circulate.
Reforma's owners claimed the paper sold 100,000 copies on Sunday, its
highest-ever sale.
And while their motley salesforce of columnists, politicians, journalism
students and housewives have suffered violent attacks and theft from
established newsstand owners in recent weeks, Sunday passed off mostly
peacefully.
Selling on the holiday marking the Mexican Revolution is just one of several
things that the union, behind the power of its quasi-monopoly status and
violent reputation, refuses to do. Its distribution methods do not allow
publications to choose where they want to target their sales. Most newsstand
operators do not open until after 8am. When they do open, they are loaded
down with stacks of papers that have no market.
Many dailies, perhaps half of those in Mexico City, live off flat-fee
government advertising rather than sales or circulation-sensitive private
advertising and therefore see nothing wrong with a distribution monopoly
that allows them to be at least seen in the street, if not purchased.
The union has been a favourite of the government, which in the past has used
it as a last line of defence against renegade or independent publications.
President-elect Ernesto Zedillo's first public campaign appearance was a 5am
greeting of union members as they queued up to receive their stock.
But for a paper like Reforma, the union is a hindrance. 'We are fighting for
our right to free expression and to work when and how we want,' says Reforma
publisher, Mr Alejandro Junco, who claims circulation is back now to normal
after falling initially by 40 per cent when the new distribution system was
introduced at the start of this month.
Mr Junco argues that his paper has been designed for an elite audience.
He wants to send most of his newspapers to wealthier neighbourhoods where he
can reach his target public, something he cannot do through the union.
Mr Junco also runs El Norte, Reforma's highly successful sister publication
in the industrial capital of Monterrey, which through aggressive marketing
and skilful distribution has raised per capita newspaper readership to the
highest levels in Mexico.
Along the way El Norte effectively destroyed the Union of Newspaper Hawkers
in Monterrey. 'This freedom of expression stuff is all just a publicity
stunt,' says Mr Nestor de Buen, a lawyer for the union. 'The problem is
commercial and what they really want to do is destroy the union.'
Reforma seems to agree, placing more hopes on its case before the
monopoly-busters at Mexico's recently created Federal Competition
Commission, than in negotiations at the Interior Ministry, which regulates
the media.
'This isn't about freedom of the press. Quite the contrary,' argues Mr de
Buen. 'The union provides a service to many different publications. . . and
if Reforma were to kill off the union, other papers in Mexico City who
depend on its distribution would suffer a serious adjustment.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Brazil under pressure on indexation: Pay rises in line with
prices stoking inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in Brazil is expected to remain higher than hoped until the end of
the year, and is adding to pressure for the government to outlaw the use of
indices which keep salaries and taxes rising in line with prices.
The private Fipe research institute announced yesterday that inflation
between October 16 and November 15 rose to 3.45 per cent, compared to less
than 1 per cent in September after the introduction of a new currency, the
Real.
The government's official inflation figure for the period, due to be
published later this week, is likely to show inflation rising from 1.86 per
cent in October to about 3 per cent.
The rise stems partly from one-off factors such as rent reviews and higher
food prices after a drought, and the inflation rate is expected to fall
slightly next month.
But unexpectedly high inflation in the government index, known as the IPC-r,
is worrying because, according to law, salaries have to be increased in line
with the index.
The IPC-r has risen nearly 20 per cent since the Real's launch, leading to a
bumper pay rise for workers with pay reviews. The increased salaries are
also probably adding to inflation by stoking consumer demand.
Before launching the Real, the government was forced by Congress to accept
the link between salaries and the index. Congress feared inflation would
otherwise eat away at workers' spending power. The government was worried
about its tax revenues and ruled that overdue tax payments would be
increased in line with inflation, as measured by a separate index.
Advisers to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, due to take over as president on
January 1, are now starting to study how to remove or modify these indices,
which most economists agree fan inflation. One idea is to allow companies to
negotiate wages directly with their workers, instead of relying on
industry-wide union agreements and indices.
However, persuading Congress to accept such measures will be difficult,
especially since the government had aimed for monthly inflation of only
about 1.5 per cent for this year. Many congressmen, and some ministries,
oppose removing indices because they believe Brazilian workers do not have
sufficient bargaining power against their employers.

FT  22 NOV 94 / IMF urged to forgo secrecy of programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under secretary, yesterday called on the IMF
and member governments to forgo the traditional secrecy of Fund programmes
to build public support for difficult adjustments.
'Adjustment programmes are negotiated in secret,' he noted. 'The
governments' letters of intent are not made public. Background documentation
is never released. For the poorest countries, the medium-term economic
scenarios prepared by Fund analysts have not been given to the public
either.'
He spoke after addressing a one-day meeting of parliamentarians from 18
countries who have oversight responsibility of their governments'
contributions to the multilateral lending institutions. The meeting was
hosted by Congressman Barney Frank, chairman of the House banking
sub-committee.
Mr Frank, an advocate of greater openness by the multilateral development
banks, will lose his chairmanship when the new Congress convenes under
Republican control next year. However, numerous Republican members are
suspicious of the multilateral banks and will demand reforms.
Mr Summers said the IMF and World Bank remained the best tools available for
promoting collective prosperity. But more could be done to improve projects
by involving the participation of those people who would be affected and
therefore were most knowledgeable.
'A more open IMF, working with member governments, would help build support
for its programmes,' he said. 'If we have learned anything about the
adjustment process, it is that more local ownership is essential, if it is
to succeed.'
He said although there were reasons for the secretive central banking
culture, more could be done to share what the Funds knows with the world.
'An IMF that shared its assessments of economic performance could make a
greater contribution to global capital market stability,' he said. 'Things
have to be different in a world where private capital flows are the dominant
source of finance in emerging markets.'
In contrast to the Fund, the World Bank had made strides in efforts to open
up. Since the controversy over the Narmada dam project in India, the bank
had opened information centres in London, Paris and Washington, which are
supposed to provide assessment of projects two years before they come to a
vote.
Nearly 7,100 requests for information were received in the first seven
months after these centres were opened.
New evaluation procedures established by the Bank have raised questions
about the proposed Arun dam in Nepal, Mr Summers said. A new independent
inspection panel, created by the Bank in 1993, had been asked to investigate
the proposal.
The World Bank had committed itself to zero real growth and slashed expense
accounts, but still too much spending occurred that could be traced to its
'formerly bloated culture', he declared. He said it was 'an outrage' that
the secretary of the treasury had to fly business class while World Bank
research assistants flew first class.

FT  22 NOV 94 / OECD praises US on economic growth: But warns of both
macroeconomic and structural problems in the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development gives the US high
marks in its annual survey* for economic performance over the last two
years, but warns of both macroeconomic and structural problems in the years
ahead.
'The fundamentals seem sound for the immediate future. The expansion has
become more firmly established, and job creation has accelerated without the
re-emergence of any wage and price pressures thus far,' the OECD says in the
survey, published yesterday.
The organisation says policy-makers have recognised that there is very
little slack left in labour or product markets and have acted early, by
standards of the past, in order to head off a clear acceleration in
inflation - although the OECD still believes that the Federal Reserve will
have to raise interest rates further over the next year.
'Only if such action succeeds will the expansion be sustained for a longer
period, avoiding the bust which inevitably follows a boom,' the report says.
The OECD forecasts gross domestic product growth slowing from 3.8 per cent
in 1994 to 2.9 per cent in 1995, with inflation, as measured by the GDP
deflator, accelerating from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.8 per cent in 1995.
It projects a current account balance worsening to Dollars 147bn or 2.2 per
cent of GDP this year and to Dollars 161bn or 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1993.
But the Paris-based organisation sees cause for alarm both over the US's
fiscal health in the longer term and over worsening social problems.
'Many of these problems are related to inequities: between those at the top
end of the income distribution - who enjoy some of the finest health and
education services in the world - and those at the bottom - who lack access
to even minimally adequate social services. Only if these inequities are
attended to will the long-term economic future of the nation be secure,' the
OECD says.
On the fiscal front, the OECD applauds the 'gratifyingly significant deficit
reduction' undertaken by the Clinton administration, but warns that much of
this improvement is largely cyclical.
In the near term, the administration's budget projections may be too rosy,
the report says, because they rely on real interest rates remaining
extremely modest in comparison with the 1980s and lower than the current
reality. In addition, a number of popular tax provisions such as the
research and experimentation tax credit are due to expire, and will have to
be paid for if they are renewed.
The OECD also questions the official budget assumption that federal pay
rises will average less than 2 per cent a year for the six years from 1994
to 1999, a cut in real terms of more than 8 per cent, which is inconsistent
with the declared goal of eliminating the estimated 26 per cent pay gap
between government non-defence employees and their private sector
counterparts over the next nine years.
In the longer term, the OECD warns that much more needs to be done to cut
the budget deficit.
'First and foremost, the United States remains at a serious disadvantage
with respect to the rest of the world in terms of its lack of investment and
especially saving, and there seems little prospect of the private sector
providing much relief in this respect' since federal borrowing, although
down from a peak of 87 per cent in 1992, still accounts for more than three
quarters of total net credit market borrowing.
'There is, therefore, widespread agreement that the surest way to alleviate
the shortage of saving is for the public deficit to be cut,' the OECD says.
While noting the Congressional Budget Office's doubts about whether the
Clinton administration's proposed reform of the healthcare system would in
fact bring down the deficit, the OECD warns that an overhaul cannot be
avoided much longer.
'Differences of view on the design of healthcare reform must not become a
stumbling block to the enactment of any significant reform programme. For
without a comprehensive overhaul of some sort, spending pressures are likely
to remain unabated, while inequality of access to adequate care will
continue to increase,' the report says.
Noting the worsening financial projections for Social Security and Medicare,
which respectively provide pension payments and health insurance to the
elderly, the OECD also urges action to control entitlement spending.
'The longer that action is delayed to deal with these solvency problems, the
more draconian the solutions will have to be,' the report says.
The survey also provides some support for suggestions by some leaders of the
new Republican majority in Congress for scrapping taxes based on corporate
and personal income in favour of a consumption-based tax.
This might expand the tax base, the OECD says, because all the credits,
loopholes and tax expenditures contained in the current system will cost the
government as much as Dollars 436bn this year.
'To put it another way, as much as 37 per cent of the tax base has been
eroded. Reversing that erosion would allow the same revenue to be raised
with lower statutory rates which presumably would be less distortionary,' it
notes.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Report highlights inequalities in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US federal government needs to take on more of a role in compelling
individual states to iron out the inequalities in the US education system,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its
annual survey of the country's economy.
Primary and secondary education are 'mediocre at best', the report says, and
inadequate funding for education in economically deprived areas has
contributed to social problems requiring costly intervention in areas such
as welfare and law enforcement.
'The states have imposed significant costs on society through their
decades-long neglect of the education of children from less-advantaged
communities. US society now finds itself in a situation where whole
communities experience massive educational failure at a time when the
economic penalties for such failure are growing,' the OECD says.
International comparisons show US school students' performance is generally
lower than other countries, especially in mathematics, where the average US
student at 13 lags an average French student of the same age by about 18
months of schooling.
But the disparities within the US are much wider than the gaps between the
US and other countries.
Children in Iowa and North Dakota rank second and third to Taiwan in
international comparisons of mathematics skills, with Minnesota, Maine and
New Hampshire not far behind. But Mississippi ranks at the bottom of the
OECD's listings, behind Jordan; and Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas fared
only a little better.
The OECD suggests the US is looking in the right direction with recent
attempts to define national educational standards in the Goals 2000
programme first agreed between the state governors and former President
George Bush and turned into legislation under President Bill Clinton.
Such standards are important, although 'little can be taken for granted in
the debate on curriculum content in the United States', the OECD says,
noting in a quizzical footnote the continued efforts of Christian
fundamentalists to block the teaching of the theory of human evolution.
It is, however, sceptical of how good the results will be. Goal 5, the OECD
notes, calls for US students to be first in the world in science and
mathematics achievement by the year 2000 - which would require them to make
up a lag equivalent to two years of schooling in just six years.
More particularly, the OECD notes that there will be virtually no change in
the amount of money spent on education under the Goals 2000 law, and little
difference in its targeting.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Dole disowns Helms remarks on abilities of president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Robert Dole and other senior Republicans have distanced themselves
from weekend comments by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that
President Bill Clinton was unfit to be US commander-in-chief and that this
view was shared by leading members of the military.
Mr Dole said that, whatever reservations he may have held earlier about the
president, 'he's up to the job now.'
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said that the president had 'been doing better
for a while' and that it was incumbent to support the commander-in-chief,
whoever it was.
Mr Helms, probably the most right-wing member of the Senate, is likely to
take over as chairman of the foreign relations committee.
He has already threatened to make trouble for the president's foreign policy
if a vote on the Gatt treaty is not postponed until next year.
His weekend interview drew an instant rebuttal from General John
Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and an even more
incendiary reaction from Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff.
Mr Panetta described Mr Helms as an extremist with 'reckless' views and
recalled his long support for apartheid in South Africa.
His remarks, he said, sent 'terrible signals' to US enemies overseas, to US
servicemen and 'to kids in our country who are taught to respect the
president'.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Governors warn Congress on ideology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ascendant new class of Republican governors have begun warning their
party colleagues in Congress not to pursue an ideological agenda to the
point of undermining their ability to manage their states.
The specific message from a weekend meeting of present and newly-elected
governors in Williamsburg, Virginia, was that the Republican congress should
not be sidetracked by issues such as voluntary prayer in schools, draconian
welfare reform and the constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
Governor Pete Wilson of California said the states 'are not colonies of the
federal government'. Governor John Engler of Michigan put it more bluntly.
'If we don't deal with the economic issues, we'll need more than prayer to
solve our problems.'
Republicans gained 11 governorships in the mid-term elections two weeks ago
and now control 30 of the 50 states and eight of the largest nine, with
Florida the single exception. Republicans are also now in the majority in
about half the state legislatures.
In a joint press conference and in other interviews, several seemed
concerned that so much attention has been focused in the past two weeks on
the legislative agenda promulgated by Congressman Newt Gingrich, likely next
Speaker of the House.
Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey thought a constitutional amendment
to reintroduce voluntary prayer into schools was a poor idea, while Mr
George W. Bush Jr, governor-elect of Texas, though not opposed to the idea
in principle, objected if it were imposed on his local school districts by
Congress.
Governors Whitman and Wilson also urged the Republican Party not to adopt
strong anti-abortion positions, both in any legislation before Congress and
in framing the 1996 party election platform.
Governors George Voinovich of Ohio and Bill Weld of Massachusetts were
openly nervous that a constitutional amendment to balance the budget might
merely constrain state financial resources further.
Both said that any amendment should contain language freeing the states of
the obligation of enforcing federal programmes for which insufficient funds
were made available.
Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin was critical of Mr Gingrich's notions
on welfare reform, which would severely limit the time spent on public
assistance and which would deny benefits to unmarried teenage mothers, and
their children, who, he has said, might be placed in orphanages.
Mr Thompson expressed a preference for more extensive block grants to states
to administer programmes as they thought best. 'Each of us in our own way
has gone to Washington on bended knee, to get a waiver in order to do
something.' This 'mating dance,' he suggested, should come to an end.
There is nothing new in the Republican desire for greater state autonomy.
President Bill Clinton has often spoken of the states as 'the laboratories
of the nation' and has, not always at the margins, encouraged them to
develop their own social programmes, especially in healthcare.
But the present crop of governors, new and old, have not been reticent in
pointing out that they won office on their own records and ideas, and not by
wholehearted embrace of Mr Gingrich's radical 10-point 'Contract with
America' designed for candidates of the House.
Some of them, including Governors Wilson, Whitman, Weld and Thompson, are
seen either as possibilities for the party's national ticket in 1996 or as
influential in shaping both the ticket and its policies. Control of the
larger states is an immeasurable Republican advantage in the next
presidential election.
Governor Whitman, a rising star since her election last year and her
subsequent implementation of tax-cutting initiatives, said: 'I hope Congress
understands that what got everyone elected this year was fiscal issues.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Reform passes last hurdle in Japanese Diet: End of
multi-seat constituencies seen as a challenge to LDP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan opened a new book in political history yesterday when the upper house
of the Diet (parliament) gave definitive approval for a reformed election
system, to come into force on December 25.
This finalises a comprehensive new set of political rules, under which
politicians will have to compete harder for parliamentary seats than before,
a threat to the conservative old guard of the Liberal Democratic party which
has run Japan for most of the past four decades.
It removes an obstacle to an early general election, at a time when Japan's
fragmented opposition is weeks away from forming a single new party, to
combat a potentially unstable government coalition of conservatives and
socialists.
Parliament yesterday adopted a bill to redraw electoral boundaries for the
new electoral system, a mixture of first-past-the-post single-seat
constituencies and proportional representation. It replaces a unique
multi-seat constituency system, in place since 1925, which had made it
possible for many politicians to get a seat with as little as 10 per cent of
the vote.
Yesterday's completion of political reform is the starting signal for a
power struggle within the main parties. They must now allocate candidates to
the 500 seats of the new system, 11 fewer than than now.
Because of the boundary changes, the three coalition parties have been left,
awkwardly, with competing candidates in 110 districts, while the opposition
faces the same problem in 40 constituencies, according to a poll by the
Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
One example is Gunma, a rural area north of Tokyo, where former LDP Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and the son of a former LDP leader, Mr Yasuo
Fukuda, have ended up in the same single-seat district. One of them,
clearly, has to offer to compete in a different constituency. That is a
difficult decision, given that close ties, patiently nurtured over many
years, are the traditional method of getting a parliamentary seat.
Yesterday's parliamentary decision concludes a five-year debate on political
reform, triggered by the resignation in 1989 of former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, to take responsibility for the exchange of shares for political
favours. This and other cases had provoked public distaste of the ruling
class.
In an attempt to rebuild credibility, the LDP then proposed the first of a
series of draft reform plans. It has taken five governments and the LDP's
first period of opposition in 38 years to get the new rules on the statute
book.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Lifetime jobs may hurt company competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's tradition of lifetime employment may impair the competitiveness and
hence the creditworthiness of some its largest companies, a leading
credit-rating agency warned yesterday.
A report* by the Tokyo unit of Moody's Investors Service says the agency has
already 'incorporated some negative credit implications' in its ratings of
sectors where Japanese companies are carrying much heavier staff costs than
international competitors.
These are banking, airlines, steel, chemicals, cement, paper and pulp. If
this led to a reduced credit rating, their funding costs would rise.
Moody's suspects these companies will be tempted to allocate capital
inefficiently and expand sales, at the expense of profits, to be able to
continue paying surplus employees. 'Without decisive changes. . . their
positions within the global market will be threatened,' it warns.
Lifetime employment, the preserve of Japan's top 300 to 400 companies,
survived other recessions because it was seen as a competitive strength, as
an aid to productivity and product quality. It may still be one for some car
and electronics makers, the report says.
But growing international (especially Asian) competition, in both cost and
quality, plus the legacy of excessive Japanese industrial investment in the
late 1980s, has left many companies bloated compared with their closest
competitors. Economists agree that Japan's economic recovery will not be
strong enough to absorb the full surplus of capital and labour, the report
adds.
As an example of how the need to provide jobs for life can affect managers'
investment decisions, Moody's cites Japan's bulk chemicals industry. There
have been mergers in this formerly fragmented sector, but the resulting
economies of scale have been disappointing because the mergers were not
followed by heavy redundancies.
Steel companies' performance has been harmed by their strategy of launching
often poorly performing diversifications, in theme parks, memory chips and
food, for the sole purpose of employing surplus staff. General trading
companies have failed to close unsuccessful diversifications, while banks'
earning power has been 'dismal' over the past five years, partly because of
their high employment costs, the report goes on.
Not all sectors have been so reluctant to cut costs, however. Several
shipbuilders cut their staff by up to 80 per cent during the 1980s, some
textile companies cut their work force by half, and steel companies cut head
office staff by up to 60 per cent late in the decade. But it took several
years of losses to force them to take the plunge and many staff were shifted
to subsidiaries or affiliates, on salaries subsidised by the parent company.
Despite the high cost of lifetime employment, Moody's does not believe the
system will quickly disintegrate. It is deeply entrenched because of the
seniority-based salary system, whereby employees are underpaid for the first
20 years or so of their careers and then receive sharp pay rises, peaking in
their 50s. In contrast, European and US salaries tend to peak when staff are
in their 30s or 40s.
Several leading manufacturers tried to move away from the social contract in
1992, but this attracted bad publicity and attacks on managements'
credibility from the Labour Ministry. Others positively want to keep
lifetime employment as a way of holding on to accumulated expertise.
Unfortunately, argues Moody's, that is only a competitive advantage in a
small number of high value-added sectors, where products and services are
sold on quality rather than cost. Lifetime Employment and its Credit

FT  22 NOV 94 / Mieno dismisses fears over offshore output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shift of Japanese manufacturing capacity offshore in recent years does
not threaten Japan's long-term industrial performance, the outgoing governor
of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno, said yesterday.
It merely reflects an emerging division of labour within Asia, and as such,
is even a healthy development, he declared in an interview. 'The movement of
production offshore is a reaction primarily to the rapid industrialisation
of Asia which is creating a division of labour between basic industrial work
and high-technology, highly-skilled jobs.
The changes would ensure growth prospects would improve for all countries,
including Japan. Japanese industry would be 'upgraded' as it focused more on
the sophisticated sectors where it is most competitive.
Business and labour groups have expressed concern that the movement of
Japanese investment to the rest of Asia represents an industrial 'hollowing
out' that will reduce Japan's long-term employment and growth prospects. 'I
disagree with the view that the new division of labour will reduce the
potential rate of growth in the Japanese economy. The dynamism of the
economy has enabled the country to overcome difficulties in the past and
will do so again.'
Mr Mieno, who retires next month, reviewed his five-year term, among the
most turbulent in the bank's 100-year history, marked by policies aimed
first at bursting the 'bubble' of rapid increases in asset prices at the end
of the 1980s, then at reviving the economy from the ensuing slump.
The central bank's main challenge remained the task of restoring soundness
to the financial system as it continued to be burdened by bad debts,
accumulated by the collapse of asset prices in the early 1990s, Mr Mieno
said. The current trend of falling wholesale and retail prices stemmed from
three developments: declining asset prices, the high yen's impact on import
prices, and changes in the distribution system that were reducing business
costs.
A risk existed import prices might have a deflationary effect in the short
term, but in the longer term, if the commitment to deregulation was
maintained, lower prices and costs would benefit producers.
He addressed concerns that Japan was losing financial business to other
capital markets because of its rigid regulatory environment. Part of the
explanation was purely cyclical, linked to the weakness of Japan's economy
in the past few years and the reaction to the 'bubble' years. But 'I have to
admit room exists to open further domestic financial markets, particularly
by improving the ease with which foreigners and Japanese have access to
capital markets.'
He identified several measures which should be taken to improve Tokyo's
attractiveness, including faster deregulation and improvements to the
financial infrastructure, especially Tokyo's archaic settlements systems.
If those measures were taken, Tokyo would continue its strong role as an
international financial centre.
Mr Mieno repeated his pleas for the central bank's greater independence, a
theme of his governorship. He expected his successor, Mr Yasuo Matsushita,
to share his view it was time to change the legislation governing the
relationship between the bank and the Finance Ministry.
The growing links between individual countries' monetary systems 'made it
more important than ever for each country to pursue policy aimed at
maintaining its own economic stability.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Rise in Japanese household spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's household spending in the three months to September rose by 0.5 per
cent in real terms from the same period a year before, according to figures
published yesterday by the Management and Co-ordination Agency, Gerard Baker
reports. The increase was the first in three quarters, and suggests the
gradual economic recovery is lifting consumption. Household spending in the
month of September alone increased 2.0 per cent from a year earlier,
following a 0.4 per cent fall in August, a 0.1 per cent rise in July, and
five consecutive monthly falls to June. Agency officials said the increase
was largely due to special income tax cuts which took effect in the summer.

Mr Joe Modise, South Africa's defence minister, said yesterday the country
would be prepared to take part in peace-keeping operations on the continent,
provided such actions were carried out on a multilateral basis. Speaking at
a conference in Johannesburg, Mr Modise said South Africa would support the
establishment of regional security alliances to help prevent armed conflict
in sub-Saharan Africa. But he noted that South Africa would not undertake
any peace-keeping duties unilaterally. The announcement, which marks the
first time South Africa has publicly committed itself to a military role
outside its borders, has fuelled speculation that the country, which has by
far the most powerful army in the region, might share in a peace-keeping
force in Angola to help bolster the peace treaty signed last weekend between
the Angolan government and the rebel Unita movement.

Angola's government accused Unita rebels of attacking its positions
yesterday and said the raids jeopardised a peace pact signed only 24 hours
earlier. State radio quoted a government statement as saying the rebels had
attacked the northern town of Uige on the eve of a permanent ceasefire which
is scheduled to be implemented at 12.00 GMT today.
Government forces captured Uige from Unita last week in what the rebels said
at the time was a violation of a truce aimed at paving the way for the peace
pact. Delegations from both sides signed the pact in the Zambian capital of
Lusaka on Sunday. But the ceremony was undermined by the failure of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to sign it
personally, as originally planned.

Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained Burmese pro-democracy campaigner,
yesterday urged the UN to support democratic movements and rejected the
argument, popular among east Asian governments, that authoritarian rule is
essential for the development of poor countries. Ms Suu Kyi, under house
arrest in Rangoon for more than five years, made her comments in a speech to
a UN conference in Manila read for her by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the former
Philippines president.
In the speech, Ms Suu Kyi criticised Asian and African governments for
portraying democracy as a 'western' concept alien to other cultures and for
suggesting that economic growth was the only important issue, a view that Ms
Suu Kyi said could be 'a recipe for disaster'. 'True development of human
beings involves much more than mere economic growth.' she said. After years
of dismissing Ms Suu Kyi as a troublemaker, Burma's military junta has
recently held two rounds of talks with her in Rangoon. 'Most totalitarian
regimes fear change,' Ms Suu Kyi said in her speech, 'but the longer they
put off genuine democratic reform, the more likely it is that even their
positive contributions will be vitiated.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Palestinian aid programme 'has been failure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The international aid programme to Palestinians has been a 'failure', the
United Nations said yesterday, warning that unless donors urgently changed
strategy, further violence could erupt in the Gaza Strip, torpedoing Middle
East peace.
In his strongest and most sombre assessment yet, Mr Terje Larsen, UN
under-secretary-general for Palestinian territories, said living standards
in Gaza were falling 'like lead'; donors were largely to blame for the
looming Palestinian economic crisis.
'The situation in Gaza is more dangerous today than before the peace
agreement was signed,' Mr Larsen said in an interview with the Financial
Times. 'The gap between expectations and delivery is so large, and unless
donors get together to deliver, the peace process will fail. Time is running
out. We are at the edge. It could collapse any day.'
Mr Larsen's remarks came as tension between Mr Yassir Arafat's supporters
and the Islamic militant opposition continued on the streets of Gaza. Up to
10,000 loyalists of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, hundreds firing guns in the
air, chanted warnings to Islamic groups they blame for last Friday's
internal violence which left 14 Palestinians dead.
Mr Arafat encouraged the demonstrators, calling the march a referendum on
the self-rule authority he controls and on the Palestine Liberation
Organisation. 'The state of alert continues. You are the protectors of
security, no one can take away from Fatah and the Palestinian police.'
Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had not reached agreement with
Mr Arafat on how to calm the situation since Friday's killings; each side
accused the other of being 'traitors'.
Mr Larsen said World Bank figures showed only Dollars 140m disbursed to
Palestinians this year of a total Dollars 700m (Pounds 437m) pledged for
1994. Most had gone for salaries and running costs of the Palestinian
authority; only one project, to clean up Gaza, had made any impact on living
standards.
'The donor effort is a failure; the strategy wrong, the priorities wrong and
the timetable wrong. There has been an over-emphasis on long-term projects,
but the poor and hungry and sick can't wait. If there is no food for the
children and no heat for the winter, who will support the authority and the
peace process?'
Donors needed to refocus aid on public works to generate employment in Gaza
(unemployment 52 per cent), and where at least one-third of families live
below the poverty line of Dollars 470 a year.
A public works programme worth up to Dollars 100m to provide 20,000 jobs for
the next six months was needed within 'weeks' to save the peace process. Mr
Larsen criticised Israel's closure of the Gaza border which stops thousands
of Palestinians reaching their jobs in Israel. 'The policy of closure is a
collective punishment. It undermines the peace experiment, donor efforts and
Israeli interests. It must be stopped immediately.'
Palestinians were to blame for disorganisation and inconsistency, but donors
should have found ways to disburse the money they promised. 'Predominantly I
criticise donors, not the Palestinians.'

FT  22 NOV 94 / Beirut property prices soar to sky-high limits: Laws of
supply and demand seem to have little effect on rents or prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of property in Beirut is one of the most hotly debated subjects in
Lebanon today. Since the end of the country's 17-year civil war, the cost of
residential and office space in and around the centre of the city has soared
to unprecedented levels.
Ar the top end of the market, a 500 sq m apartment with a sea-view can be
bought for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 955,000) to Dollars 2m. Unlike similarly
priced properties in the prime areas of London, Tokoyo and New York, this
includes little in the way of extra facilities.
There may be limited car parking space and a porter, but there is no
guarantee that street lighting or telephones will work. The surrounding
roads and pavements are rarely cleaned, and within short walking distance
there are likely to be huge piles of rubble from construction work which is
not due to be finished before the year 2000.
Even among the wealthy Lebanese returning from abroad, few are willing to
pay such prices; the odd buyer tends to be from the Saudi and Kuwaiti
super-rich keen to have a second home in an Arab country. As a result, most
affluent Lebanese are renting houses in the eastern suburbs or in the
surrounding mountains while they wait for the costs of moving into central
Beirut to come down.
Estate agents estimate that about 30,000 premium apartments, priced from
Dollars 300,000 upwards, are empty in Beirut. They are becoming concerned at
the prospect of a huge property over-supply at the top end of the market
which shows no signs of driving prices down, while housing needs for middle
to low-income earners are not being sufficiently catered for.
'There's a real estate crisis here in Lebanon,' explains Mr Antoine Maroun,
who heads the real estate division of the largest financial and services
group in Beirut, Lebanon Invest. 'There's a clear over-supply in residential
housing; prices have reached astronomical figures.'
The main factor driving the supply side is the high expectation that Lebanon
is on the road to recovery under the guidance of its billionaire prime
minister, Mr Rafik Hariri.
These have been fuelled by the successful launch of Solidere, the Dollars
1.8bn real estate and property development company which is rebuilding the
centre of Beirut, and more recently, by Lebanon's over-subscribed Eurobond
issue (its first ever), which last month raised Dollars 400m for the
country's reconstruction programme.
'Private property developers are hoping to tap into this new-found
confidence. They are rapidly putting up new units to meet a genuinely high
demand for quality housing,' Mr Maroun says.
The high prices are caused by the method of financing the construction work.
Although there are more than 70 commercial banks in the country, long-term
credit facilities, especially mortgages, are almost impossible to come by.
The banks deal mostly with dollar-denominated, short-term financing for
trade and commerce. Most construction projects are self-financed, with
little in the way of leverage.
'Because owners are financing their buildings from their own savings, prices
are not coming down. They can afford to wait for a buyer. If they were
borrowing from banks, the situation would be much different, there would be
a crash,' says Mr Henry Tyan, general manager of Banque Nationale de Paris
Intercontinentale, one of the top four banks in the country,
On the demand side, the absence of a mortgage culture severely restricts the
financing abilities of potential buyers. 'Because of the lack of long-term
credit facilities, people can either afford to buy property outright or are
forced to pay short-term interest rates on a long-term loan, which is not
very efficient,' Mr Riad Salameh, central bank governor, explains.
In an attempt to tackle this problem, the government has restructured the
Housing Bank by reducing its stake to 20 per cent and selling the rest to a
group of commercial banks.
At the end of this month, Mr Salameh says that funds of Dollars 100m from
Arab and international donors will be available from the bank in the form of
competitively priced, long-term mortgages to small-property seekers. Estates
agents in Beirut have welcomed this move but say it will still exclude those
who wish to have a mortgage of over Dollars 100,000 and, more critically,
low-income and poor people.
In the teeming suburbs of southern Beirut, for instance, where hundreds of
thousands of people live in squalid, over-crowded conditions, there is a
huge shortage of proper housing. With high unemployment and an average
income of less than Dollars 150 per month, they have little hope in paying
rents, let alone becoming property owners.
Many families continue to squat in disused and damaged buildings while they
wait for the government's reconstruction programme to reach them. A
six-year, Dollars 280m plan has been drawn up to rehabilitate the area,
including Dollars 100m-worth of funds from the Eurobond issue.
Meanwhile, the fundamentalist group Hizbollah has capitalised on the
situation by providing a basic welfare system in the form of schools,
hospitals, essential supplies and some low-cost housing.
Some Lebanese explain the cruel distortions in the property market as
inevitable in a country recovering from a long and devastating civil war. Mr
Maroun partly blames the problem on a lack of information on the market.
'We need to develop a data base to put some discipline into the market. The
lack of good information is inhibiting its development,' he says.
Until then, the Lebanese will have to live with the fact that too many
luxurious apartments are sitting idle while hundreds of thousands of victims
of the war are still desperate for a secure roof over their heads.

<TEXT>
Nineteen years after the Franco dictatorship ended, Spaniards have learnt in
detail for the first time about the grotesque circumstances of the dying
general's departure from his El Pardo palace outside Madrid.
In a documentary by the private Antena 3 television station, members of
General Francisco Franco's medical team lifted a pact of secrecy to reveal
how he underwent emergency surgery in primitive conditions in the palace
guard's disused infirmary.
Although desperately ill, the 82-year-old leader had stayed on at the palace
for weeks while the Spanish public was kept in the dark about the true state
of his health. In the last week of October, 1975, medical bulletins had
disclosed the seriousness of his heart condition. But Franco, who had ruled
Spain for 36 years, still wanted to die in his own bed.
Surgeons described how the general, suffering a stomach haemorrhage and
bleeding profusely from the mouth and nose, had to be carried downstairs in
a rug since they could not negotiate the staircases with a stretcher.
The infirmary, about a kilometre away, belonged to the first world war era,
complete with original glass cabinets. According to one of the doctors,
there was only a dirty yellow towel to cover the general's naked body when
be was placed on the operating table.
And then the lights went out. The local electrician in El Pardo village had
to be summoned from his bed to fix improvised lighting. One surgeon, holding
up a lightbulb, received a series of electric shocks because the floor was
wet. One astonished commentator said yesterday it was 'like the infirmary at
a third-rate bull ring'.
The general, who surprisingly revived once his wounds were sutured, was then
finally moved to the modern La Paz hospital in Madrid, where he died more
than two weeks later. The contrast provides a bizarre symbol for the mixture
of the modern and the archaic which characterised Spain in the latter Franco
period.
The doctors denied that the general, whose final days coincided with a
mounting crisis between Spain and Morocco over Spanish-controlled Western
Sahara, was kept artificially alive for political reasons. It was just that
old soldiers of his ilk do not die easily.

pay price for splitting up to contest many towns and regions

Forza Italia, the political movement founded and led by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday sought to play down the
results of Sunday's local elections which indicated the party was losing
grassroots support.
The main national coalition parties - Forza Italia, the populist Northern
League and the far-right National Alliance - split up to contest many of the
242 regional and mayoral elections, and suffered as a result. Of the
government parties, only the Alliance was able to boast of increasing its
share of the vote. The main opposition party, the former Communist PDS, also
performed well.
In spite of the difficulty of interpreting the scattered local results,
analysts estimated yesterday that Forza Italia's support could have slipped
by 10 points since the June European elections, in which the party received
more than 30 per cent of the national vote. Mr Cesare Previti, Forza Italia
defence minister, said a low turnout of voters had hampered the performance
of the centre parties.
Mr Gianfranco Fini, the Alliance's leader, said yesterday that the only way
forward was for the feuding members of the coalition to stick together. He
pointed out that had they agreed to run under a single banner they would
have outscored the centre-left parties in many of the local polls.
The most closely watched contest was in the northern industrial town of
Brescia, where Mr Vito Gnutti, the League industry minister, supported by
Forza Italia, was beaten by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, ex-leader of Italy's
former Christian Democrats, in the first stage of the two-round poll. With
nearly all the results in, Mr Martinazzoli had received 41 per cent of the
votes, and Mr Gnutti 26.8.
Mr Gnutti and Mr Martinazzoli will fight the second round alone, on December
4, and the final result could depend on the choice made by National Alliance
supporters. The Alliance's young candidate, Ms Viviana Beccalossi, won 12
per cent of the first-round votes. This was more than expected, to the
irritation of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, who considers Brescia and
the surrounding region his party's heartland.
Mr Berlusconi, in Naples for the opening of the United Nations conference
against organised international crime, was able to draw comfort yesterday
from news that his government's much-criticised 1995 budget measures had
passed their first parliamentary hurdle, winning the formal approval of the
lower chamber.

FT  22 NOV 94 / French right to study US-style primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's centre-right coalition parties finally agreed yesterday to study
the practicalities of US-style primary elections to select a single
conservative candidate to carry their colours in the race for the Elysee.
After months of desultory discussion about the dangers of a divided
conservative movement losing a third successive presidential election next
year, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister and interim president of the RPR
Gaullists, and Mr Francois Bayrou, education minister and secretary general
of the centre-right UDF federation, agreed on a joint feasibility study of
primaries.
The study group would report by Christmas, Mr Juppe said, on whether
primaries could be held and, if so, how. The RPR leader said there was now
no time to lose, with the first round of the presidential election set for
April 23 and the final round on May 7. Any primaries would have to be held
'by January-February, at the outside', he said.
In the aftermath of their second defeat at the hands of President Francois
Mitterrand, the RPR and UDF did in fact sign 'a charter for primaries a la
francaise' in 1991. This stipulated that their parties' members and
loyalists should vote in primaries held by region and at weekly intervals
ending no later than 13 weeks before the first presidential election round.
But all this remained a dead letter until very recently.
That primaries are now at least a possibility for the French right is
largely due to Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, who has been
campaigning for them for months. But up to now the problem has been that
proponents of primaries have been suspected of being closet supporters of Mr
Edouard Balladur, because the RPR prime minister leads his fellow Gaullist,
Mr Jacques Chirac, in opinion surveys. The Chirac camp, as well as some UDF
politicians, have therefore shied away from the idea of primaries as
favouring the Balladur campaign.
But the steady rise in the polls of Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president who is weighing a Socialist presidential bid, at last
seems to have convinced the Chirac campaign - of which Mr Juppe is
co-president - of the need for an early end to their divisive civil war with
Mr Balladur.
Primaries for the RPR and UDF would require no legislation, because they
would be an internal party matter. But by the same token, organisers would
not be able to use state facilities, such as town halls, as voting booths.
Mr Juppe said it would also be important to prevent outsiders infiltrating
the ballot and for all candidates to promise to respect the eventual result.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Russian officials blamed over cash probe
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international investigation into the flight of capital from the former
Soviet Union has run into the ground because of the refusal of Russian
officials to co-operate, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Jules Kroll, president of Kroll Associates, the leading international
corporate investigative agency, described the Russian investigation as the
'most frustrating case' of his company's 22-year history. He told UK
regulators attending a seminar in London that Russian security officials had
held back from providing information that would have allowed his agency to
name and locate those responsible for illegally transferring funds to the
west.
'We never received any feedback from their (Russian) internal security
people to whom we entrusted the task of following up our leads,' Mr Kroll
said.
This is the first time that Kroll Associates have publicly commented on the
problems of one of their most prestigious and high profile investigations.
It is estimated that the apparent failure of the Russians to complete the
contract may have cost Kroll up to Dollars 4.7m in expected revenue.
The agency was contracted amid wide publicity in 1992 by the then Russian
government led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, who is now the leader of the reformist
opposition party Russia's Choice.
The Kroll investigation had strong support from the International Monetary
Fund and the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries who were
considering fresh aid for Russia at the time but were anxious about the
issue of flight capital estimated to be running at Dollars 1bn.
Mr Kroll told the seminar organised by a London-based financial think-tank,
the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, that his investigators had
identified a series of suspect bank accounts and property holdings owned by
Russians in the west.
'Unfortunately we came up against a roadblock,' he said.

Workers at the Belfort site of GEC Alsthom in eastern France will today vote
on whether to end a strike which has halted production at four subsidiaries
of the Anglo-French engineering group this month.
It is one of a spate of industrial disputes over the past few weeks which
have prompted concerns about a deterioration in labour relations and higher
wage demands from trade unions. It follows a stoppage at Pechiney, the
aluminium and packaging company, and comes amid a call by unions for
industrial action in the public sector later this week.
Union officials say industrial action in support of wage claims is justified
by the fact that salaries have not kept pace with improved company results
and the recovery in the French economy after the recession of 1992-1993.
Industrialists and economists play down the risk of widespread industrial
action. 'It is a situation of sporadic rather than general unrest,' said Mr
Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economics research institute, citing
the declining trend in the number of strikes and in union membership.
However, employers express concern about the demands for higher wages. This
is prompted by the rise in such demands as a cause of industrial disputes.
For the first time since 1990, pay demands have become the most common
factor in stoppages and strikes in French industry.
At Pechiney, the strike at the company's Dunkirk smelter was ended after
management agreed to increase monthly pay by between FFr450 (Pounds 54) and
FFr600 (Pounds 72). At GEC Alsthom, unions are demanding that salaries for
the 7,400 workers at the Belfort site be increased by FFr1,500 a month. They
are helping to organise today's vote, but are urging a rejection of the
management's offer to award pay rises of between FFr100 and FFr500.

Russia could increase its share of the world's foreign direct investment
from 1 per cent to 10 per cent within five years if it reduced its internal
barriers to trade and promoted a more favourable image abroad, Mr Percy
Barnevik, chairman of ABB, the Swedish-Swiss heavy engineering group, said
in Moscow yesterday.
'The world knows about Russian oil and gas but it does not know of the
advantages to be had in Russia from educated people and high technology,' Mr
Barnevik said following a meeting of the Foreign Investment Advisory
Council, a business forum designed to assist Russia's re-integration into
the world economy.
At the two-day meeting, western business leaders expressed their concerns to
senior Russian officials and discussed means of attracting greater
investment into Russia and promoting its exports more effectively.
The Russian team, headed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, first deputy prime minister,
and Mr Yevgeny Yasin, economics minister, said they welcomed the
contributions from western companies - including Ernst &amp; Young, Mars,
Coca-Cola, Thomson, BP and Procter &amp; Gamble - and would consider
implementing the recommendations.
Three working groups suggested Russia establish a more predictable tax and
legislative environment for foreign investors and set up half a dozen
business centres in foreign capitals to promote Russia's trade interests.
Although many of the western executives publicly praised the extraordinary
openness of the Russian government at the meeting, they added in private
that it was critical for Russia to act on its good intentions.
Mr Robert Wilson, chief executive of RTZ, the British mining company, said:
'You cannot polish the image if the substance is not right. One of the
general concerns for the mining industry, in particular, is that we have to
have access to world markets, we have to have world prices and we have to be
able to use a fully convertible currency.'
After taking a telephone call from Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, who is touring the Gulf states, Mr Chubais said: 'It was decided
that we will hold a special session of the government to discuss the working
plan drawn up by this meeting.'
That task will be complicated by the fierce opposition of Russian
nationalists, who have complained about Russia selling itself to foreigners.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Capital spending in Germany set to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West Germany's economic recovery will be given an extra push next year by
the first increase in industrial capital spending since 1991, according to
the Munich-based Ifo economics institute.
Despite complaints yesterday from the BDI industry federation that results
and order books were not yet strong enough to support fresh investment, the
institute said corporate spending budgets would increase by a real 5 per
cent to about DM78bn (Pounds 32bn).
The BDI's latest economic report said although there was no doubt recovery
was under way, weak consumer demand in the home market meant it lacked
dynamism. It remained to be seen if the current export-led upswing would
lead on to a dynamic investment cycle 'typical of Germany's most recent
economic past'.
Reporting on its regular autumn survey of more than 2,000 companies which
account for almost half the region's total capital expenditure, Ifo said
most impetus would come from a 25 per cent surge among machinery makers and
10 per cent more spending in the automotive industry.
New cuts of up to 5 per cent were planned in aerospace, data processing,
precision engineering and shipbuilding.
Although the expected improvement reflected rising profits and confidence
following the aggregate 30 per cent slump from the spending peak reached in
the year after unification, the institute pointed out that most of the new
investment was designated for restructuring, rationalisation and replacement
of old plant.
Only 16 per cent would be spent on increasing capacity, compared with 18 per
cent last year and 27 per cent in 1991.
Restructuring had been the main investment goal in the motor industry since
the early 1980s, the institute said, and this would once again account for
more than half the sector's budgets next year.
However, it also suggested planned spending on expansion could rise in the
light of rising orders and capacity utilisation. Ifo data also published
yesterday showed manufacturing plant use continuing to rise rapidly during
the second quarter of the year.
From 82.3 per cent in June the average rate had increased to 83.7 per cent
in September, and would have been higher but for a further fall in
utilisation of plant used for making non-durable consumer goods.
Meanwhile, rising factory-gate prices for products such as aluminium, steel,
chemicals and other basic production goods, reported by the federal
statistics office yesterday, provided further evidence of rising demand and
economic revival.
Even so, the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent in October, and
stood just 1 per cent higher than a year earlier.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Brussels warns on German power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is threatening to seek an injunction to prevent work
starting on a DM400m (Pounds 164m) German power station contract, following
complaints of unfair competition.
Germany has been identified by the European Union as one of the worst
offenders for failing to apply directives designed to ensure equal
opportunities for foreign companies bidding for public sector contracts.
The Commission, separately, has started legal proceedings against the Bonn
government in the European Court for failing to incorporate properly into
German legislation two of eight EU public works directives. Brussels is also
understood to be considering court action against Germany for failing to
apply four other directives correctly.
It has asked Veag, the recently privatised eastern German electricity
company, to reopen the bidding to supply a DM400m steam turbine for a DM5bn
power station at Lippendorf, near Leipzig in Saxony.
The contract was awarded to a German subsidiary of Swiss-Swedish group Asea
Brown Boveri. However,the German offshoot of General Electric of the US has
complained that it was 'unfairly excluded from the final round of price
negotiations'.
The Commission, which believes tender procedures were unfairly applied, has
warned it may seek a European Court injunction to prevent work starting
unless the bidding is reopened.
The issue may be complicated by GE's failure last month to persuade the
Berlin district court that the relevant EU public works directives should
have applied, although these had not been transposed into German law when
the contract was awarded. This judgment is likely to be challenged by the
Commission.
GE told the Berlin court that the invitation to tender for the turbine
contract had been tailored by Veag to favour the European companies ABB and
Siemens, which traditionally had been treated by the German power sector as
'court suppliers'.
It claimed Veag had changed its requirements after putting the contract out
to tender. Ms Patricia Sherman, counsel to GE's international trade
department, said yesterday: 'As we found out in the past in trying to enter
the German market, there will always be technical reasons for not awarding
the contract.'
Veag, which was recently sold to a German energy consortium led by RWE,
Preussen Elektra and Bayernwerk, said it had adopted an 'open' attitude in
its negotiations with GE.
Mr Gerhard Braunlein, of Veag's legal department, said GE failed to win the
contract 'for technical reasons' and its bid had been considerably higher
than ABB's.
The Commission has increased its efforts to ensure the public works
directives are applied properly. It is currently taking legal action in
nearly 250 cases of alleged breaches of the directives, double the number of
cases being pursued at the same time last year.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Shaky future for wage talks system: As the 1995 round
starts, fewer workers are covered by it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last year's fractious wage round in Germany's trend-setting metal
industry, the signs are that 1995 will be a comparatively peaceful affair.
But the rhetorical blows are being exchanged with the usual gusto.
The union, I G Metall, has demanded a 6 per cent pay rise following the
restraint it it showed last year - accepting a 2 per cent rise which in turn
led to a hefty drop in unit labour costs, thanks to big productivity
increases in the economic upturn.
Metal industry employers complain that the recovery still leaves German
labour costs at the top of the world league. They are also making their own
demands for an agreement which runs for two years and a postponement of the
35-hour week due to be introduced next October.
Insiders on both sides expect a settlement around 3 per cent, a bit higher
if a two-year deal is accepted. The pay negotiations usually begin in the
autumn and end, sometimes acrimoniously, in the early spring.
A smooth passage for the 1995 wage round does not, however, secure the
long-term future of the German system of centralised pay bargaining system,
as an increasing number of German companies, particularly in the east, fall
outside its reach.
Although the system has taken some of the credit for the country's post-war
economic success it is now following a difficult path between flexibility
and fragmentation.
Not for nothing do union officials worry these days of a Japanese-style dual
labour market developing in Germany, with a core of highly paid, secure
workers covered by union agreements in big companies and a periphery of
insecure, poorly paid workers in smaller companies which are not covered by
agreements at all.
A kind of two-tier system has long been in place. According to the IDW
economic institute, average hourly pay for a blue-collar worker is about 8
per cent above the agreed minimum. But in some companies - such as
Daimler-Benz - the average rate has been closer to 50 per cent above the
basic.
Officially, about 90 per cent of all employees in Germany are said to be
covered by union-negotiated minimum rates, even though only about one third
of employees are in unions. Privately, some union officials say the coverage
of union agreements could now be as low as 65 or 70 per cent, with large
parts of the service sector having grown up outside the system altogether.
'There are plenty of Handwerk (skilled trades) companies around here where
people are getting paid about half the negotiated minimum for the metal
industry,' according to one I G Metall official based near Hanover. The
official said he did not wish his name to be quoted in case his comments
should be interpreted as supporting employer-friendly arguments.
Mr Joerg Barczynski, the I G Metall spokesman, claims that the metal
industry employers exaggerate the number of companies who are not in the
industry's bargaining association or are threatening to leave it. 'It is
employer propaganda to frighten us into accepting whatever they offer,' he
says.
Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, the metal industry employer
association, disagrees. In a recent interview he warned that more and more
companies were finding creative ways to avoid agreements by establishing
subsidiaries outside the system.
It is hard to know whom to believe. It is generally recognised that about
one-third of metal industry employers are not in the association. Some are
household names such as Volkswagen and Hewlett-Packard, which still
recognise unions and have their own house agreements. Most are small and
medium-sized companies who have never been in the association.
A few well-known companies, such as Georg Fischer the engineering company in
Baden-Wurttemberg, have left the metal industry association in recent years
because of complaints of inflexibility over fringe benefits and working
time. But a survey by the metal industry employers association in Hesse -
conducted just before last year's wage round - found little evidence of
companies deserting the system.
Also, the greater influence of medium-sized employers in Gesamtmetall in the
past two years has meant more stress on flexibility as well as strong
downward pressure on some fringe benefits. An agreement - modelled on
Volkswagen's - for cutting the hours and the wages of employees to avoid
redundancies has been used by about 10 per cent of all companies in the past
year.
But if the line has been held in the west, it may be a very different story
in the east. Mr Lutz Glasewald, an official of the DGB, the union umbrella
body, in Cottbus, says a lot of companies are paying well under agreed
rates. 'It is part of our job to sift out those who are not paying because
they genuinely cannot afford to and those who are simply trying to squeeze
out more profit,' he says.
Mr Glasewald says most of the bigger companies in the metal industry and
chemical industry associations do pay the minimum rates but more than half
of the Handwerk companies, often suppliers to the bigger companies, are not
in any association.
This may be part of the necessary flexibility in the east, a countervailing
factor to the equalisation of wages due in 1996. I G Metall has agreed a
system whereby east German companies which genuinely cannot keep pace with
equalisation can be given an exemption, but only if they open their books to
inspection. Few like to do that, and as a result there have been only about
30 such exemptions in the past two years.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Corsica faces fraud crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The French Agriculture Ministry yesterday promised a crackdown on Corsican
farmers accused of defrauding Brussels of millions of francs' worth of
subsidies. Contrary to reports from Brussels, the ministry claimed there was
no question of cutting off aid to the whole island because only a minority
of farmers were involved. The report by a European Commission team of
inspectors which visited Corsica in September found widespread fraud,
including false addresses given by farmers to get special aid for mountain
regions, bogus subdivision of cattle herds to sidestep ceilings placed on
the size of herd eligible for aid, and double counting of cows.
The report, leaked to Liberation newspaper yesterday, said one of the
reasons for recurrent forest fires on the island was that farmers turned to
arson to clear mountain bush for pasture. The Commission has recommended
that cattle premia, paid out of EU and national funds, should be linked from
now on to better protection of the environment.

<TEXT>
France will use the forthcoming European Union summit at Essen to propose
creation of a special fund to finance measures promoting 'good
neighbourliness and stability' in eastern Europe, Mr Edouard Balladur, the
prime minister, said yesterday. He made the proposal in a speech opening a
seminar in Paris on his plan for 'a European stability pact'. This is his
main initiative in foreign policy and one which he hopes will conclude with
a ministerial conference next March, in the middle of France's chairmanship
of the EU and its presidential election campaign.
As part of the conference on European stability which opened last May,
regional discussions have been held on political tensions in the Baltics and
central Europe. The aim is that countries such as Hungary and Romania should
to settle their minority disputes before joining the EU, and Mr Balladur's
new fund plan is to help, for instance, improve education facilities for the
large Hungarian minority in Romania's Transylvania province.

Portugal plans to sell shares in three or four state companies direct to
foreign investors in 1995, starting with a 20-25 per cent tranche of cement
group Cimpor (Cimentos de Portugal), according to Mr Francisco Esteves de
Carvalho, secretary of state for finance. He told the weekly newspaper
Expresso that the Cimpor shares would be offered in packages aimed
specifically at European, North American and Asian investors, probably
during the first quarter.
The government sold an initial 20 per cent tranche of Cimpor on the Lisbon
stock exchange in July to mainly Portuguese investors for Es39.6bn Pounds
250m. He said the stage two sale would be followed by the more complicated
privatisation of 20-30 per cent of the Portugal Telecom telephone company.
'The actual size of the operation will have a lot to do with the behaviour
of the domestic market and its capacity to absorb the issue,' he said. About
70 per cent of the Portugal Telecom shares would be targeted at foreign
investors, while the remainder would be offered simultaneously to Portuguese
investors at the same price.

<TEXT>
Labour the junior coalition party, which felled Mr Albert Reynolds' Irish
government last week, yesterday suggested its leader, Mr Dick Spring, should
be prime minister. Holding the balance of power between parties that cannot
rule alone, Labour wants to capitalise on new popularity brought about by
its decision to sink Mr Reynolds in a row over handling of an extradition
case. Opinion polls show it is now the second most popular party behind
Fianna Fail, which chose acting finance minister Bertie Ahern to replace Mr
Reynolds as its leader. Public approval of Mr Spring has shot up.
'Spring is an outstanding statesman. Few in this country would not share the
view that he would make an excellent Taoiseach (prime minister),' said Mr
Brendan Howlin, who represented Labour in the last cabinet as health
minister. Political commentators expect most or all of Ireland's parties to
propose their leaders for the premiership today. Mr Howlin's comments were a
strong indication that Labour may pursue a demand for Mr Spring to be prime
minister when the horse-trading between parties gets under way later this
week. Mr Ahern said he expected the formation of a new government to take
around two weeks.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Cement market may face fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission this week could announce record fines against some
of the region's biggest cement companies following a five-year investigation
into alleged illegal market-sharing agreements. Brussels officials yesterday
said they were very close to announcing a decision. Some 30 companies are
thought to be involved in the inquiry which, under Commission rules, could
result in fines of up to 10 per cent of the European turnover of the worst
offenders. The investigation originally involved more than 70 companies. The
shortened list is thought to include all the main suppliers including
British, French, German and Italian companies.
It would be the fourth time this year that fines have been imposed by the
Commission for alleged market-sharing or price-fixing by European companies.
In July, Brussels imposed record fines totalling Ecu132.15m (Pounds 104m) on
19 carton-board producers accused of operating Europe's 'most pernicious'
price-fixing cartel. In February, Brussels fined 14 steel producers more
than Ecu100m for price-fixing and market-sharing.
The cement investigations began in 1989 when officials staged a dawn raid on
the offices of 10 leading cement producers in France, Belgium and Germany.
The raids were ordered after customers complained of a low level of cement
imports in spite of large price variations between neighbouring European
countries. Imports have risen since the late 1980s but still provide a very
low proportion of total sales in most EU countries.

Consumer prices in Denmark increased by 0.2 per cent from September to
October and by 2 per cent over the 12 months to October, according to
official statistics. The 12-month rate of increase was unchanged from
September, but in the year to October, 1993, the rate was only 1.5 per cent.
The price of coffee rose by 5 per cent from September to October and has
increased by 35 per cent since June this year, the statistical office said.
The rise in inflation is in accordance with government forecasts for this
year. In 1995 the government expects year-on-year inflation to be a little
higher at about 2.2 per cent on average.
Unemployment in the European Union was at a provisional rate of 10.7 per
cent, seasonally adjusted, in September, unchanged from August and a year
earlier, according to Eurostat, the EU statistics office.
Dutch retail sales rose a revised 1.9 per cent (from 1.8 per cent) by volume
in September compared with a year ago, according to the central bureau of
statistics. The year-on-year volume rise in August retail sales was revised
to 2.5 per cent from 2.4 per cent.

Environmental policies should become an integrated part of all European
Union policies, including agriculture, energy, transport, industry, regional
and structural policies and relations with east Europe, says the EU's
incoming commissioner for the environment, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a Danish
Social Democrat. 'My opinion is that it could and will have negative
consequences for the environment if the environment is not taken into
consideration when we are discussing all these other areas,' she said
yesterday.
She sees environmental policy as a way for the EU to respond more to public
opinion and therefore to make the EU more popular.
'I think there are in general high expectations from the citizens of Europe.
The environment is one of the very big issues in which a lot of people all
over Europe are interested, and I shall try to meet these expectations,'
said Ms Bjerregaard.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Rolls-Royce pays Dollars 525m for US military engine maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday announced its
largest ever acquisition, which aims to bolster its competitive position
against stronger US rivals.
The Dollars 525m (Pounds 336m) purchase of Allison Engine Company, a
military engine supplier, will give Rolls-Royce a US manufacturing presence
and expand its product range to cover half the western military market.
The company said the deal, contingent on US regulatory approval, will be
funded by a share issue. Analysts expect Rolls-Royce to make a rights issue
raising more than Pounds 300m when the deal is completed next spring.
Allison has a range of heavy military transport and small helicopter
engines, creating almost no overlap with Rolls-Royce. In addition, the US
company has just completed a Dollars 1.8bn product development programme,
leaving Rolls-Royce in a position to use its global sales and marketing
network to boost sales for four new Allison engines.
The acquisition was seen by City observers as evidence that Rolls-Royce aims
to expand independently, rather than through co-operation with its larger US
competitors - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney - as has been speculated.
Allison, a General Motors subsidiary for 64 years, was sold to a Dollars
370m management buy-out in 1993, when an offer from Rolls-Royce was turned
down.
The workforce has since shrunk to 4,300, from 7,000 employees in 1991.
Rolls-Royce employs about 4,200 people in North America, and there is some
overlap in sales and marketing, and in research and development, where a
restructuring could further cut costs. After spending Dollars 1.8bn to
develop the new engines, Allison is expected to halve R&amp;D expenditure from
Dollars 113m in 1993. This should bring it back to operating profits in
1994, after three years of heavy losses.
Some analysts believe that the link with Rolls-Royce should increase the
chances of a substantial order from the Royal Air Force for Lockheed's new
generation Hercules. The C130J military transport aircraft is powered by
Allison's new turboprop engine.
About 30 per cent of Allison's revenues comes from its spares business, with
29,000 engines in service - more than Rolls-Royce. The company has tangible
net assets of Dollars 210m, and is being acquired on a debt-free basis.

However, a Financial Times analysis showed, also for the second year
running, a strong correlation between poor GCSE pass rates and social
deprivation.
The Isles of Scilly, the least deprived area of the country according to
government indices, was first in the tables for the third year, while
Southwark, an inner London borough, had the worst results for the second
time.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said the results of the
exams, taken by most 16-year-olds in England and Wales, showed the success
of the government's league tables, first published in 1992. 'This is the
foundation of a national treasure trove of information.' She said the
percentage of pupils gaining five or more GCSEs at a grade C (equivalent to
an old O-level pass) or better rose from 38.3 per cent in 1992, when the
tables were first published, to 41.1 per cent last year and 43.4 per cent
this year.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, claimed to have 'leap-frogged
the Tories' with a pledge for a future Labour government to publish even
more information. He promised to 'highlight schools which are showing real
improvements year-on-year in exam results', and to develop tables which
showed 'how much added value a school has achieved for a pupil' between
their entry to secondary school and their final exams.
Teachers' unions remained critical. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the
National Union of Teachers, said: 'They show what anyone with any sense
would expect - exam results reflect social background.'
A number of local authorities criticised the government's calculations of
truancy levels in primary and secondary schools. Manchester, which tops the
secondary school truancy table, claimed the figures excluded about 11,000
pupils from a total of 60,000. In one Manchester school, the figures
suggested that 30 per cent of pupils were playing truant at any one time.
Kensington and Chelsea, placed second behind Manchester in the truancy
table, said the government's calculation of the level of truancy among its
secondary school pupils was exaggerated by nearly a quarter. The authority
said that one of its schools had made an error when filing its return and
that Department for Education officials had refused to alter it. However the
department said local authorities had been given the opportunity to check
their schools' submissions.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Nato bombs Serb-held airfield: Raid in Croatia launched as
response to air attacks on Bihac enclave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato aircraft yesterday carried out a heavy bombing raid on an airfield in
Serb-held territory in Croatia, in the biggest military operation in the
history of the Atlantic alliance.
The operation, launched in response to Serb air attacks on the embattled
Moslem enclave of Bihac in north Bosnia, involved 39 aircraft from the US,
Britain, France and the Netherlands.
US president Bill Clinton described the Nato action as a 'strong and
entirely appropriate response' to the Serb assaults. 'It was the right thing
to do,' he told reporters in Washington.
Admiral Leighton Smith, the Nato commander for southern Europe who directed
the operation, said the raid was successful and all aircraft had returned to
their bases in Italy.
He said the Udbina airfield - used by the Serbs as a base for two assaults
on Bihac last week - had been put out of action, although the Serbs could
repair it. The Nato force also struck at anti-aircraft installations and a
missile site.
In an apparent reference to the fact that no Serb aircraft was destroyed, Mr
Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, described the Nato
air raid as a 'limited action'.
Nato's effort to police the skies over Bihac - in keeping with the 'no-fly
zone' proclaimed by the UN - had been made impossible by the proximity of
Udbina, only a few minutes' flying time from the enclave.
Officials in the Serb-controlled area of Croatia claimed one person had been
killed and seven wounded by the Nato raid which wrecked two villages near
Udbina. Locals briefly took two Czech UN employees hostage in retaliation.
In Belgrade, the government of rump Yugoslavia described the Nato operation
as 'unprovoked and irresponsible' and said it would 'play into the hands of
extremists and those who advocate a war option'.
State-controlled Belgrade radio reported the Nato attack prominently and
echoed the charge that villages had been damaged. The Serbian media have,
since August, been virtually blacking out news from the war front in keeping
with the more moderate line adopted by President Slobodan Milosevic.
The raid, carried out by the Atlantic alliance after receiving a UN mandate,
marked a dramatic act of international co-operation after a period in which
the US and Europe had been at at odds over Bosnia.
President Boris Yeltsin indicated that Russia accepted the need to take
action against the Serb forces based in Croatia following their intervention
in the fighting around Bihac. Germany welcomed the Nato operation and
announced that the international contact group - the US, Russia, Britain,
France and Germany - would convene on December 2 to consider further moves
in Bosnia.
Despite these signs of improving international co-operation, Mr Yeltsin said
Russia and other European countries were still strongly opposed to the
recent US decision to stop enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia.
Akashi said the Nato action was a 'necessary and proportionate response' to
the air raids launched from Udbina last week in which napalm and cluster
bombs were used.
UN officials stressed that they had approved the operation on Sunday
morning, hours after the passage of an emergency resolution by the UN
Security Council. They said bad weather had apparently made it necessary for
Nato to postpone going into action by one day.

FT  22 NOV 94 / Tory chief warns big pay rises cause 'real offence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative party campaign strategy document says 'excessive executive
pay packages, especially in the privatised utilities, cause real offence'
and calls for increased taxation of executive share option schemes.
The disclosure of further details from the draft paper, excerpts from which
were published yesterday by the Financial Times, is likely to embarrass the
government in the wake of the Pounds 205,000 pay rise given to Mr Cedric
Brown, the chief executive of British Gas.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'What
British Gas have done is broadly to say 'we are a world class company'.' But
the campaign paper, by Mr John Maples, the party's deputy chairman, said
such pay rises cause 'real offence' - a view understood to be shared by Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
The strategy for improving the party's image before the next election,
prepared for Mr Major and Conservative central office, is based on
interviews with 80 disenchanted Conservative voters on average income. They
are described as seeing the government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver
on its promises'.
The paper says: 'Could we in the future tax share options as income not
capital gains and introduce some level of options above which tax would be
changed as they rise in value not just when they are exercised.'
This proposal to curb the substantial profits from option schemes available
to directors of public companies is broadly similar to the Labour party's
policy.
A furore was also caused yesterday by the suggestion in the paper that the
government consider 'postponing some of April's proposed tax rises if fiscal
conditions permit'.
The paper continued: 'Delaying implementing the second instalment of VAT on
fuel would be dramatic.' Many Tory backbenchers backed this proposal. Mr
Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, told BBC Radio's PM programme yesterday that
there were people 'who believe that the second tranche of VAT on fuel is
uncomfortable for them'.
The paper also proposes 'changes to the pace of NHS reform, eg not pursuing
further performance pay for doctors'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow leader of the Commons, last night wrote to Mr
Major urging him to 'categorically repudiate the tactics proposed by Mr
Maples'. The paper also says that 'we really must use the Parliamentary
timetable, debates, ministerial statement etc' to control the political
agenda.
Mrs Taylor said this and other suggestions, such as that Tory backbench
'yobbos' metaphorically beat up Labour leader, Mr Tony Blair, were 'an abuse
of both parliamentary procedure and the principle that government should
govern in the national interest'. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker,
indicated she would 'deprecate' any behaviour which could be seen as
parliamentary yobbery.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): High hopes of paper groups tearing
ahead - Stora/MoDo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A picture of an industry in a strong recovery phase should emerge this week
when Stora and MoDo, two of Sweden's leading pulp and paper groups, report
their nine-month figures. Expectations are high, not least because AssiDoman
and SCA, their two main domestic competitors, both raised their full-year
profit forecasts last week.
Pulp and paper groups worldwide are benefiting from higher demand and a
strong rise in prices after three difficult years. The impact has been felt
all the more strongly by Swedish companies because of the weak krona and
impressive productivity gains.
Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, is expected to announce a
nine-month profit of around SKr2bn (Dollars 275m) when it presents its
figures on Wednesday. The figure will be inflated by capital gains and
reduced financial costs, but it will also show a stronger underlying
performance. One difference from the six-month result is that the group
should finally be feeling some impact from the price rises that took effect
in the first half.
MoDo, which reports on Thursday, will feel the price effect more strongly
because of its big exposure to pulp and fine paper where prices have
increased most. Analysts expect a profit of up to SKr980m. The company is
also expected to confirm it will go ahead with a SKr2bn investment in a new
newsprint machine at Braviken.

Results to be reported this week for the six months to September will show
Japan's leading commercial banks still in the mire. They are expected to
report - on Thursday and Friday - yet another decline in recurring profits,
before tax and extraordinary items, and in net earnings, marking a record
four-and-a-half-year profits decline. Non-performing loans will once more
have to be written off, a legacy of the explosion of lending, backed by
over-valued properties, just before the 1990 collapse in asset prices.
Sluggish demand for capital, due to corporate Japan's reluctance to invest
in new equipment, has hit lending volumes.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Opinion poll adds to pressure for resolution of Irish crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's outgoing ruling coalition partners were under growing pressure
last night to find a speedy resolution to the current political crisis.
The coalition's difficulties were exacerbated by an opinion poll indicating
widespread opposition to a general election and 43 per cent of those polled
backing a new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour.
The Dail, Ireland's parliament, is due to meet tomorrow to try to agree a
new government and vote in a new prime minister, though no conclusive result
is expected. Political parties will probably ask for more time. Mr Joe
Costello, a Labour MP, indicated that 'substantial' negotiations would only
start after tomorrow's vote.
Amid fears that a protracted delay in forging a new government could damage
the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr Bertie Ahern, the newly installed
Fianna Fail leader, said he would 'take account' of the poll, which
indicated 73 per cent against calling early general elections.
Ireland's outgoing government broke up last week with the resignation of the
prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, before a vote of confidence which he was
expected to lose.
The crisis began when Labour accused Mr Reynolds of misleading parliament
over the attorney-general's role in an extradition case involving a Roman
Catholic priest who was later convicted in Northern Ireland of child abuse.
Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general involved, also resigned from his new
position of president of the Irish High Court.
Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme, Mr Ahern referred to the
'fairly substantial nature' of yesterday's opinion poll and made it clear he
favoured a new arrangement with Labour. However, in his first public
statements since being voted in as party leader on Saturday, Mr Ahern also
tried to reassure his traditional Fianna Fail support and backed the
objective of a united Ireland with a promise of a social programme 'that
takes account of our distinctive values and convictions'.
Much will depend on Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader and outgoing foreign
minister, whose withdrawal from the government on Wednesday ensured its
downfall. A Fianna Fail-Labour coalition would do much to restore momentum
in the peace process and provide continuity as Dublin and London try to
finalise the framework document to provide the basis for a lasting
constitution for Ulster.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of renewed war in Mozambique have receded now that Mr Afonso Dhlakama,
the former rebel leader, has accepted defeat for his Renamo movement in last
month's first multiparty general elections, Reuter reports from Maputo.
The October 27-29 poll was won by his civil war foes, President Joaquim
Chissano and the Frelimo party, which has ruled since 1975 independence from
Portugal.
Mr Dhlakama insisted, however, that final results announced by the
independent national electoral commission on Saturday contained
irregularities and were not free and fair as declared by international
observers.
Nevertheless, he said he would play a constructive role as head of the
opposition in parliament, adding: 'I send a message of peace to the
Mozambican people.'
The results gave Mr Chissano 53.3 per cent and Mr Dhlakama 33.73 per cent of
the 5.4m votes cast in the presidential election. Frelimo won 129 seats in
the 250-member parliament. Renamo won 112. A small coalition, the Democratic
Union, won the rest.
Mr Aldo Ajello, the United Nations representative who has been overseeing an
October 1992 peace accord that ended 16 years of civil war between Renamo
and the formerly Marxist government, gave his seal of approval. So did the
Organisation of African Unity and the European Union.
'Problems have occurred, irregularities were recorded and disruptions did
take place,' Mr Ajello told a news conference. 'However, throughout the
entire process, there has been no event or series of events which could
affect the overall credibility of the elections.'
Diplomats said the risk of fresh conflict now seemed remote. 'Dhlakama had
to say there were irregularities to save his pride. But Mozambicans are
tired of war. He knows there is no point going back to the bush,' said a
western diplomat.
Mr Dhlakama boycotted the first day of voting because of fraud allegations,
prompting fears that he might plunge Mozambique back into war as happened in
Angola, southern Africa's other former Portuguese colony. But pressure from
the the UN, which had spent Dollars 1m a day on the peace process, and from
neighbouring states, which threatened intervention, persuaded him to rejoin
the elections.
Mr Chissano, in a victory broadcast, called for peace among the 16m people,
most of whom have lost family, friends or limbs in the war, which reduced
Mozambique to one of the world's poorest countries. 'War was defeated at
these elections,' he said. 'All have the patriotic obligation to heal the
wounds.'
While promising to open dialogue with opposition parties and urging that Mr
Dhlakama be treated with respect, Mr Chissano revealed no plans to include
his former foe in the cabinet due to be formed by mid-December.
Hardliners in Frelimo balk at international pressure to form a national
unity government.

February and mounted other protests to try to force the government to resign

A United Nations mission to monitor respect for human rights in Guatemala
will begin operating today amid a climate of social instability and soaring
levels of abuses. The mission of some 300 observers is fruit of an agreement
signed in March between the government and left-wing guerrillas, which both
sides have since frequently violated. Its mandate is to support the
authorities in investigating human rights abuses and to make recommendations
on how existing institutions can be improved. But it faces a judicial system
where judges are frequently bribed or threatened and a police force which is
poorly paid, badly trained, routinely corrupt and with little investigative
capacity. The mission will also need the co-operation of the powerful army,
which has jealously guarded its independence and virtual de facto immunity
from prosecution.

<TEXT>
Security chiefs in the Basque Country yesterday claimed that they had dealt
a significant blow against the Eta separatist group after a succession of
detentions and the discovery of urban hideouts and arms caches. However, the
violent response by Eta supporters, who rioted in protest, served to dash
hopes for peace in the Basque country. The events, which centred on Bilbao,
followed the arrest last in week in Toulon, south France, of Mr Felix Lopez
de la Calle who was allegedly in charge of Eta's active service units. The
apparent response by Eta to the Toulon arrest was an attempt to murder an

FT  21 NOV 94 / Dole 'close to a deal' on Uruguay Round: Republican leader
says fast track legislation may not be renewed by Congress next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, yesterday said he
was close to a deal with the administration on passage of the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation this year.
Mr Dole is considered the key to approval of the Round; some lobbyists say
he can bring 12 Republican votes with him. Sixty out of 100 votes are needed
for passage of a budget rule, which would clear the legislation for floor
action. Even with Mr Dole's support, the vote is expected to be close.
He also suggested on television yesterday that Congress would not support a
renewal of 'fast track' legislation next year. This could kill
administration plans to negotiate further trade agreements with Chile and
other Latin American nations.
The so-called fast track is a promise by Congress that it will vote trade
agreements up or down, without attempting to amend them. The administration
was unable to get fast track renewal attached to the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation this year, even with Democrat control of Congress.
That failure is seen as having crippled President Bill Clinton on the trade
front as he prepares to meet Latin American presidents at the summit of the
Americas next month.
Mr Dole met administration officials at the weekend and threw a new demand
on the negotiating table. He has asked for 'assurances' from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the treasury secretary, which would ease passage of a cut in the
capital gains tax rate next year.
This could be accomplished without cost to the budget, if the proposed
legislation is 'scored' by the Treasury as a revenue enhancer rather than a
loss, as Republicans have been arguing for years.
As a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996
Mr Dole is struggling to satisfy the concerns of the Republican right wing
that the WTO would mean a loss of US sovereignty.
He said he would 'fix' the legislation with amendments next year. 'I
proposed a way to get out of the WTO if we have these arbitrary, capricious,
adverse decisions coming from this secret panel,' he said.
One of his suggestions is to establish a panel of US trade experts to report
to Congress on rulings from WTO dispute settlement panels. Congress could
pull out of the WTO after three rulings, unfavourable to the US, were deemed
by the experts to be not in conformance with WTO rules.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Hume dismisses reports that the IRA will split

<TEXT>
Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, has dismissed reports that the IRA will split
and one faction will resume violence.
His comments followed reports that an IRA faction based in South Armagh
would take up arms again by March if Britain did not make significant
constitutional concessions to the republican movement.
He said at the weekend: 'I have been at the centre of the (peace) process
from the very beginning. I can tell you there are no deadlines for the IRA,
no secret deals.'
Earlier Mr Hume said he firmly believed the ceasefires by the IRA and the
loyalist paramilitaries would prove durable.
He said at his party's annual conference in Cookstown, County Tyrone: 'Can I
express the belief that the decisions taken in recent times by the
leaderships of the Provisional IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries will
prove to be truly historic decisions in that they will prove to be decisions
that have taken the gun and the killing of human beings out of our politics
for ever.'
Mr Hume started bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fe'in, the IRA's political wing, in 1988.
At the weekend he paid tribute to the part played in the peace process by Mr
Albert Reynolds, former prime minister of the Irish Republic, but added: 'We
in this party take it for granted that all major parties in the Dail
(parliament) are totally committed to the peace process and we will work
closely with whatever government emerges to continue the process.'
He said: 'Peace and justice in the north transcend party politics in the
south.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (31): Heavy burdens of history - Quentin
Peel / An era ends, but German foreign policy stays cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the last Russian troops marched past the giant Soviet war memorial in
East Berlin last August, followed a week later by the beating of the retreat
for the western allies, it marked more than the end of an era. It symbolised
the recovery of sovereignty for a united Germany.
The two events to celebrate the final departure of the erstwhile troops of
occupation - still too sensitive to be combined in a single ceremony, in
spite of the end of the Cold War - drew a clear line under the post-war
period. They also highlighted the fact that four years after unification,
the debate on Germany's national identity, its national interests, and its
proper international role, is still unresolved.
The calls for such a rethink are coming from all sides. At home, they have
been made from left and right, from such distinguished figures of the past
as former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, as well as from the present generation
of politicians, like Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the
ruling Christian Democrats (CDU).
The international community, from US President Bill Clinton to Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general of the United Nations, is also urging
Europe's most powerful State to assume its full international
responsibilities.
Given the importance of the issue, it is perhaps surprising that it did not
play a larger role in this year's marathon election campaign. The whole
theme of unification, its costs and domestic consequences, was paramount.
Yet the foreign policy consequences failed to emerge as a cause of dispute.
One reason is no doubt because foreign policy has traditionally been an area
of cross-party consensus, with the pursuit of unification its prime focus.
The main parties of the political establishment - the Christian Democrats,
Social Democrats and Free Democrats - have always agreed on the need for
ever closer integration into the European union. It was seen as the other
side of the coin to German unification, the essential reassurance for the
rest of Europe that a unified Germany would be no threat. And it worked.
A second reason for the lack of real popular debate is the instinctive
desire, which runs deep through the German population, for foreign policy
initiatives to be cautious and re-active, not adventurous and pro-active.
The devastating experience of Nazi rule and wartime defeat has left a deep
suspicion of anything which might smack of German high-handedness, in spite
of the stereotypes still peddled in parts of the foreign press. Hence the
resistance to any serious discussion of the 'national interest' in foreign
policy.
In spite of all that, the discussion is well under way in the smoke-filled
rooms of Bonn.
Inevitably, Europe is the dominant focus - but now with the opening of
western Europe to the east quite as important an issue for German
policy-makers is the continuing integration of the European Union in the
west. Germany is the one member of the EU which is equally committed to
widening and deepening simultaneously, unlike the French, who are primarily
interested in deepening, or the British, who really just want the widening.
In a key-note paper, Reflections on European Policy, published by the CDU
group in the Bundestag in September, the rationale was clearly spelt out:
'The only solution which will prevent a return to the unstable pre-war
system, with Germany once again caught between East and West, is to
integrate Germany's central and eastern European neighbours into the (west)
European post-war system, and to establish a wide-ranging partnership
between this system and Russia,' it said. 'Never again must there be a
destabilising vacuum of power in central Europe.'
It adds: 'Germany has a fundamental interest both in widening the EU to the
East, and in strengthening it through deepening. Indeed, deepening is a
precondition for widening. Without such further internal strengthening, the
Union would be unable to meet the enormous challenge of eastward expansion.
It might fall apart, and once again become no more than a loose grouping of
States unable to guarantee stability.'
The latter is Germany's horror scenario - a weakening of the western
institutions which have underpinned security and stability since 1945, just
as eastern Europe is itself under enormous strain. For Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, his absolute commitment to the cause of European integration has been
a key factor in persuading him to stay in office at least until 1998. He
intends to be a driving force for another big step towards European
integration at the 1996 EU intergovernmental conference.
However, German policy-makers are keen not to frighten their partners - not
least the British - from the conference table. 'Let us look for practical
policies to resolve practical problems,' says a senior German diplomat. The
practical problems are jobs and competitiveness; peace and stability in
Europe; and overcoming the divide between rich and poor, which threatens to
engulf western Europe in a new wave of migration from both south and east.
Then he argues that none of those problems can be resolved by the
traditional nation-state: they require trans-national solutions.
Yet even if the European integration process is common ground, there are
clear divisions in Germany about how it should proceed. There are also
differences over how the opening to the east can be accomplished. And there
is still disagreement over just what role Germany should be playing in the
wider peace-keeping process on the world stage.
The Christian Democrat paper on Europe argued that a 'hard core' of European
integrationists, encompassing Germany, France and the Benelux countries, was
inevitable, because only they would be able to join economic and monetary
union (Emu) in 1999. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, immediately rejected
the idea as by implication, if not intention, too 'exclusive'.
Mr Kinkel, a Free Democrat, is also at loggerheads with Mr Volker Ruhe, the
minister of defence, who is urging rapid membership of Nato for Poland and
the other central European states, but the clear exclusion of Russia. The
foreign minister is far more concerned not to offend Moscow, nor to leave
the defenceless Baltic republics isolated, by creating a new European divide
on the Polish border.
As for the whole process of peace-keeping, Mr Ruhe and the Christian
Democrats are most concerned to give the Bundeswehr, the German armed
forces, a new role by widespread participation in UN exercises, while both
Mr Kinkel's FDP and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are more cautious.
Each occasion will require the specific approval of the German Bundestag,
and each time there will undoubtedly be a huge debate.
These are the issues which will continue to divide the political
establishment as it seeks to define Germany's new role.
But in outline, perhaps, that role is already clear: Germany will be the
swing power in Europe, involved in an eternal balancing act between east and
west, seeking to reconcile and integrate.
It will do so with one hand still tied behind its back. For it will still be
loath to lead, and merely seek to react to the initiatives of others.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (32): Foreign travel is a national
obsession - Germans abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not even recession can staunch German Wanderlust - and its concomitant drain
on the balance of payments. Indeed, as recent experience has shown, the
depression of holiday prices by international economic decline, coupled with
the apparently unwavering strength of the D-Mark, actively encourages
efforts to escape to the sun, writes CHRISTOPHER PARKES.
Banks regularly issue exchange rate guides specifically aimed at trippers
seeking the best value for their hard currency on quick getaway breaks.
Popular newspapers printed excited reports during the summer when the
Italian currency lost further ground and DM1 would buy L1,000 for the first
time.
Despite the domestic slump which has brought real income cuts, rising taxes
and unemployment, German spending on foreign travel is forecast to increase
around 3 per cent this year to some DM64bn (Dollars 41bn). Although this
implies stagnation in real terms after a real 3 per cent increase in 1993,
when set against falling expenditure on all other personal and household
goods and services, it serves to underscore the strength of the national
drive to get away.
According to a new study by the Cologne-based IWD economics institute, the
average west German family sets aside more than DM200 a month - almost a
third of its leisure budget - for holidays. According to Dresdner Bank, a
consumer poll in which people were asked which areas of spending they would
find hardest to reduce found holidays ranked second only to the basics:
food, rent and clothing.
The vacation may be sacrosanct, but it is becoming a considerable burden on
the balance of payments. While the national travel account has been in
deficit for almost 40 years, the gap between German spending abroad and
foreign travellers' spending in Germany has increased 50 per cent since
unification. While travel expenditure has risen from DM47.5bn to DM64bn,
revenue income has barely budged, increasing a mere DM1bn since 1990 to an
estimated DM18bn this year. As a result, last year's travel balance was a
record DM46bn in the red.
The domestic industry has suffered from the effects of recession in
neighbouring European countries as well as the daunting strength of the
currency. Following a 10 per cent decline in 1993, the number of foreign
guests staying in German hotels fell 3 per cent in the first half of this
year.
But the domestic industry's most enduring disadvantage, according to
officials at the government-funded DZT tourism promotion authority, is lack
of marketing effort. France, which arguably has more natural holiday appeal
than Germany, spends four times as much on generic promotion than the DZT's
DM52m budget allows. Austria spends DM20m a year.
Earlier this year DZT's new management set about trying to correct 'false
ideas' about Germany as a holiday destination, targeting young foreign
travellers likely to be drawn by musical and other popular cultural
attractions. As its researches had shown, the average age of vacationing
visitors was 'well over 50,' according to marketing chief Ms Eva-Marie
Sternagel.
Surprisingly, however, Dresdner Bank data show that although revenue from
foreign tourists in 1992 accounted for only 0.7 per cent of GDP, the
absolute total of DM17.5bn was only a little behind that of Austria, and
compared favourably with the UK's DM21bn.
Meanwhile, the industry's potential in the former GDR is only just being
tested. Despite the natural attractions of the Baltic coast, the relatively
low population density and newly-accessible cultural centres such as Leipzig
and Dresden, the region has attracted hardly any visitors from neighbouring
eastern European countries. They prefer to spend their hard currency in
locations more exotic than a former communist state. Westerners, too, have
been deterred by the lack of relatively good quality accommodation and
complaints of over-high prices are common.
Although some 340,000 eastern jobs already depend directly or indirectly on
tourism, the government estimates the industry needs a further DM6bn in
private investment to raise hotel and guest-house bed density from its
present level of around half that in the west. The heavy costs of rebuilding
the basic infrastructure in the region, such as roads and railways, drains,
water, power and telephone connections, has limited the volume of funds
available for popular attractions such as sports and cultural facilities.
Meanwhile, the local inhabitants are quickly developing their western
cousins' taste for travel, but lower earning power tends to limit their
range. Favoured destinations include western Germany, Austria, Spain and
Switzerland. As in the west, the average-income, four-member family reserves
14 per cent of its disposable income for leisure activities - an average of
DM554 a month. Little more than DM100 of this is set aside for holidays -
just enough to cover the average German travel agent's price of a two-week
foreign holiday for one.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (30): Chrysalis of a Bank of Europe -
Peter Norman explains the significance of Frankfurt's European Monetary
Institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of Germany's pivotal role in the European Union and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's passion for greater European integration, Germany is poorly
endowed with EU institutions.
The move of the European Monetary Institute to its new Frankfurt
headquarters this month goes some way to redressing the balance.
The EMI has been set up to prepare the planned European System of Central
Banks (ESCB) which will be established if and when the EU fulfils the
promises of the Maastricht Treaty and moves to the third and final stage of
economic and monetary union, with a single currency and single monetary
policy.
Meanwhile, the institute exists to strengthen the co-ordination of monetary
policy among the EU's 12 central banks and promote economic convergence
among member States so they can meet the tough criteria which the treaty has
prescribed for Emu membership.
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI president, and about 75 staff have
installed themselves in an imposing city centre tower block that was
formerly the headquarters of the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft. Last week's
meeting in the rechristened 'Eurotower' of the EMI's governing council,
which comprises the EU central bank governors and Mr Lamfalussy, was a
signal that the EU's newest institution had begun work in earnest after 10
months of preparation in borrowed office space provided by the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) in Basle, Switzerland.
Mr Lamfalussy, who moved from being general manager of the BIS to take over
the EMI presidency at the start of this year, has described the EMI's first
task as constructing a 'turnkey' central bank for Europe that is capable of
operating effectively once the political decisions to go ahead with Emu have
been taken.
After much haggling, European leaders bowed to German wishes and agreed just
over a year ago to site the EMI in Frankfurt.
They also endorsed the 65 year old Belgian banker, academic and monetary
policy expert as its head. At that time, there were many who wondered
whether Mr Lamfalussy and the institute were being launched on a futile
endeavour.
The EU was still suffering the aftershocks of 18 months of monetary
turbulence. These had seen the departure of the British pound and the
Italian lira from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System, numerous parity changes among surviving ERM currencies and a
speculative run on the French franc in July and August 1993 that had
culminated in the widening of the ERM's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent
either side of its members' central rates.
Since then, calm has returned to the ERM. The exchange rates of the
surviving member currencies have stabilised at levels close to those that
existed before August 1993.
Interest rates in continental Europe have fallen and the region appears to
be enjoying a broad based, non-inflationary economic recovery. According to
Mr Lamfalussy, 'things are not as negative as they looked a year ago'. The
way is clear for intensive work towards Emu, if not yet for the political
decisions to take monetary union further.
The institutional framework and operating principles of the planned European
central bank system have been defined in the Maastricht Treaty. It has been
left to the EMI to design its organisation in detail and specify the
relations between the future European Central Bank (ECB) and the national
central banks that will also be members of the ESCB.
The EMI has to work out how the EU's future single monetary policy should be
managed.
It must also tackle such issues as the preparation of banknotes to be used
after the introduction of the Ecu as a single European currency and how
national payments systems should be linked.
These may sound like dry technical matters. But as Mr Lamfalussy has
observed: 'The veil of technicalities obscures important matters of interest
to individual countries and market participants alike.'
The nature of future monetary policy throws up several big issues involving
differences of central bank practice that could result in tensions between
such heavy-weight institutions as the Bundesbank and the Bank of England.
The EMI will have to consider whether Europe's monetary policy should be
guided by a money supply measure as in Germany or an inflation target as in
Britain. If a monetary aggregate is chosen, which one should it be? Should
commercial banks, as part of the management of policy, be obliged to deposit
compulsory minimum reserves with the ESCB? If so, should these be interest
bearing or not?
Fostering central bank co-operation is the other part of the EMI's mandate.
This task, which Mr Lamfalussy considers as important as preparing the
central bank, will involve building up the EMI's economic research capacity.
EU economics and finance ministers were given a foretaste of the EMI's
ambitions in this area at an informal meeting of the EU's 'Ecofin council'
at Lindau on Lake Constance in September. Mr Lamfalussy presented the
findings of a penetrating EMI analysis that demonstrated how different
levels of budget deficit, variations in currency volatility, and member
states' widely varying inflation records explained why they had been
impacted to varying degrees by this year's bond market turbulence.
His presentation also served as a reminder to the ministers that Mr
Lamfalussy is a believer in monetary union. He says its implementation is
essential to protect what has been achieved in creating the European single
market. However, he doubts whether Emu can be achieved by 1997 - the
earliest date in the Maastricht Treaty. Emu and establishment of the ECB
could take 'five, six or 10 years'.
If so, the EMI, which is due to be closed down as soon as the ESCB starts
operating, will turn out to be a more durable part of the Frankfurt
financial scene than its designers envisaged. With a staff drawn from all EU
countries (including Austria, one of the applicant countries), it should
help bolster Frankfurt's credentials as an international financial centre
and offset some of the shock generated by Deutsche Bank's recent decision to
strengthen its investment banking presence in London.
But the EMI's role will be judged ultimately by the performance of the
central banking system that is due to supplant the institute, if and when
Emu occurs.
There is much to do before the EU achieves Emu along the lines envisaged in
the Maastricht Treaty.
The excessively high budget deficits and indebtedness of most EU member
state must be reduced to credible and manageable proportions. Europe's
politicians must generate the political will to move to stage three.
Then there is the vexed question of achieving greater political union in the
EU, which many economists, politicians and officials (notably in Germany)
consider essential if Emu is to prove a lasting success.
Speaking in Paris recently, Mr Lamfalussy acknowledged that much was beyond
his capacity to deliver. 'Even if done well', he said, the EMI's
preparations for Emu would 'not necessarily tip the scale of the political
decision in favour of moving rapidly towards monetary union.'
But he made clear that he and the EMI mean business. 'I shall do everything
in my power to give no excuses to those who, on the pretext that preparation
for the organisation of the European Central Bank is inadequate, wish to
postpone the date of the political decision,' he said.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (29): No end in sight for high public
borrowings - Conner Middelmann assesses demand for capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year will see a sweeping overhaul of German public-sector borrowers,
with familiar names disappearing and new ones appearing in their place.
However, although it will be redistributed, the financing burden will remain
heavy and officials at the Finance Ministry and the Bundesbank, its issuing
agent, will have to continue probing the frontiers of innovation to ensure
Germany's debt finds a safe home.
As a result of the privatisation of public-sector companies and the
consolidation of several funds created to finance German unification, old
capital market favourites such as the Treuhandanstalt, the post office and
the railway authorities will no longer issue bonds as from 1995. Some of
these bodies' debts will be assumed by the government, while others will
service their debts independently under a new name.
Nevertheless, public sector indebtedness is high and the country's financing
and debt servicing burden remains heavy. While Germany's total public-sector
deficit, including state and local governments, is expected to drop markedly
from this year's level of around DM145bn as the Treuhand deficit falls away,
the Federal government's deficit next year is likely to remain little
changed at around DM68.7bn, compared with DM69.1bn this year. Finance
Minister Theo Waigel is due to present an updated budget forecast for 1995
on December 14.
Meanwhile, the cost of servicing Germany's debt is set to increase, and Mr
Waigel has warned that as of 1995 every fifth D-Mark spent by the Federal
government will go towards debt servicing.
So far this year, the government has managed to scrape through its borrowing
programme, aided by a strong cash position at the beginning of the year and
a generous DM18.25bn contribution from the Bundesbank in April. Each year,
the central bank transfers the bulk of its profits to the government, which
uses the money to pay down existing debt.
However, Bonn's funding was dogged by the sell-off which devastated global
bond markets this year and caused yields worldwide to soar. Amid nervous
market conditions, the Bundesbank's decision in May to cancel a debt auction
at very short notice sent shudders through a market fearing that the
government was unable to raise the funds it needed.
In September, with 10-year yields close to their 7 3/4 per cent high, the
government decided to issue a 10-year floating-rate bund pegged to the
three-month Frankfurt interbank rate.
The issue met with disapproval from the Bundesbank, which for years has
opposed money-market instruments on the grounds that they interfere with its
monetary policy-making and foster a short-termist mentality among market
participants.
This has turned the spotlight on an issue which has been the subject of
heated debate for the last two years: will the German government eventually
issue Treasury bills with maturities of less than one year?
For the last two years, a provision to issue up to DM50bn of such bills
(dubbed Bu-Bills) has been included in the Federal budget, but as yet none
has yet seen the light of day.
Following this year's approval of D-Mark money-market funds and amid
prospects for rising short-term interest rates, investor demand for such
instruments is likely to increase in 1995. However, while most sophisticated
bond markets boast liquid yield curves ranging from one month to 30 years,
Germany's maturity spectrum starts at one year and is most heavily weighted
in the four- to 10-year sector, with a relatively illiquid 30-year sector.
The very short end of the German yield curve has largely remained
underdeveloped due to resistance from the Bundesbank. Indeed, in August it
announced it would stop issuing short-term bills, known as Bulis, for fear
that they would fuel the growth of money market funds.
'We did not want to provide investment opportunities for money-market funds
by issuing Bulis, thereby reinforcing (the trend towards) short-termism,'
Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said recently. Moreover, 'we
have asked the Federal and state governments not to issue short-dated debt
instruments,' he said, explaining that increased short-termism in government
financing would fuel economic short-termism generally. (Short-term
financing) may create new business opportunities, but it does not contribute
to the stability of the financial system,' he said, warning of the increased
interest-rate volatility and economic destabilisation which could follow.
The Bundesbank also appears to fear that if the government funds itself
regularly at the short end of the yield curve, it will start exerting
pressure on the central bank to keep short-term interest rates low.
However, despite the Bundesbank's opposition, many analysts say it may
eventually have to bow to pressure from the Finance Ministry and the markets
to issue Bu-Bills. Although the central bank advises the government on its
funding, it is the Finance Ministry which makes the final decision on how to
raise the money.
'The steeper the yield curve gets, the more favourable it will be for the
government to issue short-dated debt,' says Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, economist
at UBS in Frankfurt. Indeed, locking in high debt servicing costs by issuing
long-dated bonds would further increase the budget deficit. The 10-year
benchmark bund currently yields around 7 1/2 per cent, compared with 5 1/8
per cent for three-month money.
Some warn that, by issuing money market bills the government could incur a
refinancing risk by having to roll over its bills every few months at
possibly rising interest rates. However, over the long term, it is usually
cheaper to raise short-term rather than long-term funds because yields
curves tend to be upward sloping more often than being inverted, says Mr
Rainer Back, head of fixed income research at Dresdner International
Research Institute. 'The market would like the government to offer a
balanced mix of debt, ranging from three months to 30 years,' he says.
Moreover, 'it is in the interest of Frankfurt as a financial centre that we
should be able to offer short-term bills to international investors,' says
Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF Bank. Moreover, he says that
'if the amount of Bu-Bills in circulation were restricted to, say, DM20bn
this could hardly be interpreted as veering towards short-termism.'
Money market funds are another compelling reason for allowing money-market
debt issuance. 'Now that they exist, you can't un-invent them,' says Ms
Alison Cottrell, economist at Kidder Peabody in London.
'Given people want to invest in money market instruments, surely it's
preferable to keep their savings in Germany and help them fund the deficit
rather than pushing them into other countries which offer T-bills,' she
says.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (28): On the road to Prague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is a school of thought in the German investment community which
believes that within only a few years most of the advantages of
manufacturing investment in the Czech Republic will have withered away,
writes Christopher Parkes.
The Linde group and Jungheinrich, its rival in the lift truck business, are
unconvinced. For a total investment of DM37m they recently opened a new
purpose-built factory on a 40 hectare greenfield site in Moravamy, south of
Brno on the Prague-Vienna road.
The joint-venture Juli plant is now being equipped and staffed to
manufacture between 80,000 and 100,000 electric lift-truck motors a year -
once the task of a factory in Hamburg - in a classic example of the export
of German jobs and manufacturing due to unfavourable conditions at home.
The fact that from the purchase of the site to the start of production in
June this year took only 16 months with none of the horrendous planning
permission delays encountered in Germany was only one of the attractions.
Since building electric motors is a labour-intensive job, the Brno pay rates
of DM3 to DM5 an hour are a central factor, as is the 42 1/2 -hour working
week and the standard allowance of two weeks' holiday.
But Brno, renowned for its electro-technical department at its technical
university and the local industry, also offers a wide range of workers and
potential suppliers.
Together, the new site and workforce provide a 'clean-sheet' start for a
lean production project intended to cut the cost of motors by 40 per cent,
reduce the number of motor variants from more than 70 to around 35, and
homogenise design.
At present virtually the entire process comprises assembling components
imported from Germany, but the driving logic of the Juli process is for the
parts to be supplied as cheaply and promptly as as possible. It can only be
a matter of time before they, too, come from Czech factories.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (27): Poles and Czechs compete with the
German worker - Manufacturers head for eastern Europe

When the Polish economy finally finds a firm footing there may be room in
the market for three industrial gas suppliers at most, according to Mr
Gunnar Eggendorfer, a Linde group director.
At present, while the economy is anything but stable, the key metal-working
industry is going into reverse, the zloty is weakening almost continuously
against the D-Mark, and inflation runs at more than 30 per cent, there are
more than half a dozen, slugging it out in a market which generated just
DM136m in sales last year.
As a rule of thumb, Mr Eggendorfer reckons that annual sales of DM100m are
necessary to keep a single industrial gas supplier occupied and profitable.
It is not a situation designed to appeal to German companies, typically
risk-averse and stability-obsessed, but it is one Linde - plus competitors
Aga, British Oxygen, Liquid Carbonics, Messer Griesheim and a handful of
management buy-outs - may usefully learn to live with.
The lessons will come in useful when the time arrives to push further
eastwards into the new markets and manufacturing bases in the former Soviet
Union. But it is too soon for Mr Eggendorfer. 'Everything is still too
uncertain over there,' he says.
Although Mr Eggendorfer and his chairman Mr Hans Meinhardt make much of the
hardships and uncertainties of pioneering in the Germany's eastern frontier
lands, they are equally eager to point out that all Linde's gas interests in
the region - all set up or bought in the last four years business - are
profitable.
Even in Poland, where on top of all the other problems sales per employee
are only a third of those in the Czech Republic, Linde is making money from
its core business of separating air into its component gases and packaging
it for industrial users.
Since 1990 the group, also known as a leading supplier of lift trucks and
refrigeration plant, has invested DM950m in the former communist east, with
a good half of the total spent in eastern Germany and DM250m in the Czech
Republic. The balance has bought Linde varying volumes of market share in
Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.
Total 'eastern' sales of DM480m last year already account for about 20 per
cent of group gas turnover.
Difficult as conditions are in these markets, Linde, which decided to
develop industrial gases into a core business five years ago, had no
alternative to investment. While other companies making other products might
be content to export into the new markets, the costs of transporting heavy
gas bottles mean exports are not viable beyond a range of 80 to 100km.
It is also characteristic of the gas market that the early entrants or
indigenous producers tend to take dominant market shares, effectively
locking out outside competitors. Air Liquide's 75 per cent of the French
market, for example, is a good enough reason for Linde to limit its
ambitions to the west of its homeland.
Accordingly, analysts say, Air Liquide has kept away from the Czech market
precisely because of Linde's early coup with the purchase of a majority
stake - plus an option on the balance - in the state-controlled Technoplyn,
based in Brno, Moravia, which has a market share of well over 50 per cent.
Apart from four German technical specialists among 740 employees, the entire
management and workforce is Czech. Apart from a few curio photographs of
ancient compression gear and air separators, most of the old equipment has
been replaced with Linde plant imported from Germany. 'But at its heart it
is a purely Czech company,' insists Mr Meinhardt.
In contrast to the experiences of some smaller, entrepreneurial foreign
investors, larger groups such as Linde and Asea Brown Boveri which controls
a boiler engineering plant on the other side of Brno, have slipped
relatively easily into professional, co-operative relationships with their
Czech colleagues.
Although the ABB works has tough production and quality targets comparable
with those in the Swiss-Swedish group's western works, they have been
accepted just as readily by former Kombinat managers as the requirement that
they should learn the group language, English.
As for Linde, Mr Meinhardt claims to be surprised at the similarity between
Czech and German attitudes to work and responsibility. There is no
resentment against foreign takeovers and no traces of any historic
antagonism between Czechs and Germans.
'Linde has profited well from the collapse of the old order in the east,' he
says. 'But we knew it was important to come here on a business footing and
not to try to play the role of the know-it-all.
'Here, especially, we are well on the way to making yields on our
investments comparable with those at home.'

As they voted to elect a new Bundestag, or lower house, Germans were
relieved that they had at last reached the end of a mammoth round of local,
state and federal elections.
For over seven weeks, television and radio devoted worthy discussions about
the campaign. Some politicians said they feared the electorate was sick of
the non-stop coverage.
But behind the scenes, another debate was taking place: how to re-write
Germany's broadcasting law. The discussion coincides with a period of rapid
change in the media where Germany's moguls and non-Germans are joining ranks
or competing to increase their market share.
According to Mr Dieter Wolf, president of the country's federal Cartel
Office, Germany's television - and media owner ship structure - is an
oligopoly.
There are two public television channels: ARD and ZDF. These faced
competition a decade ago when the German government allowed independent
channels to operate. The three largest privately-owned channels are SAT1,
RTL and Pro 7. The bulk of the television advertising, worth an annual
DM4.8bn, goes to two media groups - Leo Kirch, whose high-tech studios are
based in Munich, and Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media group, which has
joined forces with CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting company.
Kirch has a 43 per cent stake in SAT1, a 25 per cent stake in Premier TV, a
pay TV movie channel, a 48 per cent stake in Pro 7, a 25 per cent stake in
Deutsches SportFernsehen (DSF), a sports channel, and substantial stakes in
a Swiss, Italian and Spanish channel. He also holds a 35 per cent stake plus
one vote in the Springer publishing house, which in turn holds a 20 per cent
stake in SAT1.
Alongside the Kirch group is Bertelsmann. It holds a 37.5 per cent stake in
Premiere TV, 38.9 per cent in RTL and has a 74.9 per cent in the Gruner+Jahr
giant publishing house, as well as stakes in Stern and Spiegel, the
political weeklies.
Until recently, Germany's broadcasting authorities turned a blind eye, or at
least kept the debate about reforming the ownership structure of Germany's
independent television channels on the back-burner. But two recent
developments brought the issue out into the open.
The first was the decision by Mr Rupert Murdoch, the Australian mogul and
owner of Times Newspapers in the UK, and Bertelsmann to save VOX, the
television channel by taking a 49.9 per cent stake.
The other development was a major venture by Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche
Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, to create a joint venture
called Media Service which will offer to manage and distribute new TV
channels, as well as specialist tele communications services on Deutsche
Telekom's cable tele vision network.
This venture was referred to the European Commission which earlier this
month ruled that the Media Service would hinder competition. The three
parties are expected to return to the drawing board and revise their plans.
The three partners meanwhile have insisted that 'the new joint venture will
not act as a broadcaster or provider of programming,' and will be
scrupulously neutral in its treatment of future clients, restricting itself
to technical, administrative and distribution services.
All sides are also adamant that they are not seeking to create a monopoly
over distribution of future digital television services in Germany. But the
Cartel Office, and Germany's Medienanstalten, which consists of 15
regulators representing each of the 15 states, are sceptical. 'Having
oligopolies is one thing. But we have to see if there is no competition
between them,' said Mr Wolf.
The Medienanstalten are just as sceptical and even more critical about the
ownership structures in German broadcasting. The Medienanstalten are quangos
which also represent the regions and local communities. They are supposed to
act as a watchdog with the aim of ensuring a variety of high quality
programmes for the German consumer. They carry out this task by issuing
broadcasting licences. A regulator, for example, can award satellite and
cable licences, which would give a TV station access to about half of
Germany's households. In addition, any station must apply to the individual
regulators in each state for terrestrial frequencies.
'We want more competition. But where does the border lie?,' said Mr Hans
Hege, chief regulator for the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Mr Hege's concern
is that the Media Service backed by Bertelsmann and Kirch will effectively
monopolise the market. 'The big issue is one of concentration by the
oligopolies. What is required now is a new media law which would monitor and
control both market and audience share.'
Under current legislation, owners of independent, private television cannot
own more than 49 per cent in any channel. But what some regulators want is a
law which allows any individual broadcaster no more than a 35 per cent stake
of the audience.
That might be hard to monitor given that audiences fluctuate. Moreover, that
law would not weaken the oligopolies run by Bertelsmann and Kirch which in
theory could together dominate well over half the audience share through
their diverse television channels and their overlapping ownership interests.
'We have to consider all these things,' said Mr Wolf. 'But we have to make
sure that competition between the oligopolies continues to exist,' he added.
Recent developments suggest otherwise.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (25): Expensive learning curve - Student
militancy sinks cash reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is surprising how little students need to protest in Germany before they
derail even relatively modest plans to reform the higher education system.
At the beginning of February this year, several hundred thousand of them
braved the cold and took to the streets across the country. While in France,
such demonstrations sometimes turn violent, with students pitched against
the police, the German protests were a measured affair: some stopped the
traffic in city centres, others organised public readings.
The focus of their wrath were government plans to inject a bit more vigour
into a further education system which for years has produced very well
qualified students but has recently seemed rather unwieldy compared with
other similar systems.
The reforms had proposed that students would do tests after two semesters,
instead of after four, to ensure they were meeting academic targets; they
had also required students who were studying too slowly to pay fines.
There was no surprise about the fines: German students need on average seven
years to finish their degrees, compared with an average 3.3 years in
Britain.
The tests and fines were part of a package of reforms which had been debated
extensively a year ago. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had convened an education
summit and there had been countless other discussions to see what could be
done to give students more choice, improve competition among universities
and cut costs of around DM30bn for universities alone.
However, within days of the protests, Mr Rainer Ortleb, the education
minister, had resigned. The plans were shelved in the run-up to the October
elections and they do not seem to be a top priority for the new government
which wants to avoid arguments among the three party coalition.
Under the federal system, education is largely a responsibility of Germany's
16 Lander. While they work hand in hand with the federal government, all
important decisions, including financial ones, are made in the state
capitals. The fact that each Land has a slightly different education policy
also made it harder to reach consensus about far-reaching reforms.
Efforts to cut costs also made little headway. BAFoG, the training
assistance law which ensures that around 770,000 students receive funds to
finance their studies, was to have been frozen until 1996. In July, Mr
Karl-Hans Laermann, the new minister, managed to increase it by 2 per cent,
which was less than the rate of inflation but nonetheless a setback for the
government.
Meanwhile, the university system is bursting at its seams: 1.8m students are
expected to make do with 850,000 places at universities.
Since 1977 the number of new students has risen by 73 per cent, an increase
in line with other industrial democracies, but while Germans are not loath
to sign on, around 27 per cent of them drop out of their studies for one
reason or another, according to figures from the Federation of German
Industry (BDI); in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's biggest state, up to 38
per cent leave their studies unfinished.
Parallel to the universities Germany has since the beginning of the century
had a system of vocational training offering qualifications from banking to
hotel management for those not wishing to go to university.
Each year about 550,000 German school-leavers sign apprenticeship contracts
with companies. Every German profession has its own training programme,
lasting two or three years, and all of the 500,000 mostly medium-sized
companies which take on apprentices must provide qualified instructors.
But participants in this programme are also beginning to wonder about the
costs. Employers spend DM40-DM50bn a year on training and there are growing
concerns that the system is also becoming too inflexible. And as German
industry sheds jobs in an effort to raise productivity companies often have
to turn away the Lehrlinge or apprentices who have completed their training
only to find that the jobs they were promised are no longer available.
Managers too are becoming increasingly aware that the German system, admired
for decades, may be losing its advantage over comparable systems abroad
which are more competitive and flexible. A survey conducted by the
Munich-based Ifo economics institute earlier this year, showed that 38 per
cent of companies think the German standards are slipping.
Mr Tyll Necker, the BDI president who steps down next month, has been a
particularly vociferous critic of the shortcomings of the further education
system.
He has argued repeatedly that the system must be better tailored to the
needs of industry and society in order to avoid a situation where up to 23
per cent of university graduates work in jobs where degrees are not
required. 'If society has to devote a large part of its resources in order
to educate people then it also has to have the right to ensure that there is
some sense to it,' Mr Necker said.
But the momentum generated by the heated discussions last autumn has all but
petered out. As part of plans to streamline the government, there are even
proposals to fuse the education ministry with the ministry of research and
technology, reflecting the low priority accorded to the reforms.
Advocates of the German system still say it produces more better educated
people per head of population than other systems. They may be right but
pressures associated with an ageing population and a lack of funds means
that much still needs to be done if Germany is to preserve its comparative
advantage in years to come.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (24): How Mannesmann got in first - Mobile
phone users are increasing by 30,000 a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jump in a taxi in Germany and D2 is often written in large blue lettering
across the car. Leaf through the many weekly news magazines and you will
find the same logo. 'It's my line,' is the English slogan that comes with
it.
D2 and the catchy jingle are the trademark of Mannesmann's mobile phone
business, the first private telecoms operator in Germany which started
operating commercially in mid-1992 and has signed up around 760,000 clients
since then.
About 30,000 clients a month are being won over to mobile phones and the
network expects to report sizeable profits for 1994 following investments of
around DM3bn.
It has, so far, been an unexpected success story with Mannesmann pitting its
skills against Deutsche Telekom, the soon-to-be privatised state-owned
telecoms operator which operates D1, the other mobile phone net.
Where Mannesmann led, others quickly followed. Veba, the energy-based
industrial conglomerate also based in Dusseldorf, has taken a stake in the
so-called E-plus network, alongside Thyssen which still makes a lot of its
money in steel.
Meanwhile RWE, the utility, has teamed up with Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank, to develop a corporate network, a sort of
alternative telecommunications network which would use the existing cables
belonging to utilities and other large companies.
Viag, the Munich-based industrial group, is also trying to work out how it
can get into the market while Veba recently announced that it was working
with Deutsche Bahn, the Federal railways, to use their rail infrastructure
as a basis for a corporate network.
In short, telecommunications has become flavour of the year in Germany, in
no small way thanks to Mannesmann which first took on the Telekom's
monopoly. But Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann's telecoms division, is
not content with taking on one mobile phone monopoly.
Over the summer Mannesmann and Mercury, the UK-based telecoms operator,
joined forces to challenge a decision by the German postal ministry which
wanted to award Germany's first in-flight mobile phone service to DeTeMobil,
the Deutsche Telekom subsidiary which operates the D1 network.
The court challenge is still in progress but Mr Mihatsch says it marks an
important turning point on the German telecommunications market. 'For the
first time Deutsche Telekom didn't get a service straight away,' he says
with an audibly sterner tone in his voice, reflecting the resentment of
constantly having to do battle with Telekom's monopoly.
Alongside Mannesmann Mobilfunk (MMO), the unit which runs the mobile
network, Mr Mihatsch has created Eurokom, a company which has amassed a
series of holdings in telecoms ventures across Europe, including stakes in
mobile phone networks in Spain and Italy and in companies specialising in
data transmission.
Mannesmann is now looking for partners across Europe with whom it can offer
D2 clients services across the continent, enabling them, for instance, to
have their phones repaired or exchanged.
Most importantly Mr Mihatsch intends to use the mobile phone net to carry a
variety of new services.
'You can buy more than just an Aspirin at the chemists,' he says in his
office in Dusseldorf. 'In the same way there will be different suppliers
offering different services.'
He is currently working on plans to couple the GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) standard with satellite technology and provide drivers
across Germany - and eventually Europe - with an array of services including
navigational aides and technology which would automatically pay motorway
tolls.
VDO, Mannesmann's automotive technology division, is working on the
so-called black box which would give drivers access to this catalogue of new
driving aides.
How soon the technology is available depends in part on political decisions
to privatise motorways but Mr Mihatsch is confident that within three years
the services could be available.
Alongside the new in-car services, Mannesmann is also lining up to take
advantage of the expected liberalisation of the telephone network in
Germany.
The competition from Veba and others who are toying with the idea of
corporate networks seems unlikely to pose much of a threat to Corporate
Network International (CNI), a joint venture that Mannesmann has entered
with RWE and Deutsche Bank, both leaders in their respective fields.
'In the end it is all about who has the customers,' says Alan Coats, an
analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, pinpointing CNI's outstanding
strength.
Mr Mihatsch expects 'heated discussions' before Telekom can be made to
relinquish its monopoly. Mannesmann may not want a sudden opening of the
German networks - there are some suggestions that this should happen as soon
as 1995 - before it and its CNI partners are ready.
'But you have to identify a milestone, and say that (liberalisation) would
happen within two years. Those of us who want to invest - and not just DM2.5
but hefty sums - need security with which we can plan.
Mr Mihatsch is loath to predict how many mobile clients MMO will pick up in
future. So many previous forecasts have got it wrong, he says, quoting a
1987 study which predicted that there would be 1m mobile phone users in
Germany by 2000, a slight misjudgment given that D1 and D2 alone already
have about 1.6m clients.
'The people compiling these studies at that time could not possibly foresee
the developments,' he says. 'Mobile phones were thought of as VIP products,
to be used by a few very rich people. Today in Sweden you have more people

turnover and profit.
