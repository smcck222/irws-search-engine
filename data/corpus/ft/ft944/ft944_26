Largest sale of the week was at Industrial Control Services, a control
systems company, Based in Essex, the group supplies equipment to the oil,
gas and petrochemical industries. Its recent final results reflected good
development and a strong order book. Yet, the shares have been
underperforming over the past year.
Two directors have sold stock. Peter Hall, the chairman and chief executive,
disposed of 550,000 shares and Brian Dodds sold 250,000, all at 120p. Both
remain substantial shareholders, on the board with Hall's holding accounting
for more than 9.2m and Dodds 1.2m.
Britton Group makes extruded polythene. Interim results, announced at the
end of September, reflected good growth, with earnings rising from 2.78p to
4.79p. Profits are forecast to grow by a factor of 4.3 in the next year.
Directors buying at this stage can be a positive indicator.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Star rating systems,
are they good or bad? - Critics have savaged them but their defenders are
equally passionate. Gillian O'Connor sets the scene for a heated debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two new systems for giving unit trusts star ratings are being introduced to
Britain amid a flurry of criticism. London Business School professor of
finance Elroy Dimson, and Peter Jeffreys, managing director of the widely
respected analyst Fund Research, are both vehement critics of the new
ratings, which are being published by measurement services Micropal and
Morningstar.
They are worried that the ratings will be treated as 'best buy' labels and
could also be used in advertisements to mislead the public. Dimson says:
'There is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these
rankings.'
The star ratings are based on risk-adjusted performance figures. These are a
more sophisticated version of the conventional performance tables, which
measure different trusts' total return over various periods of time.
The conventional tables take no account of the fact that some trusts take
greater risks than others and that their progress is, correspondingly, more
volatile. This volatility can be measured by statistical yardsticks such as
the standard deviation.
Both Micropal and Morningstar have their own methods of adjusting a fund's
performance for its risk. In very broad terms, such adjustments penalise a
very risky fund and reward one that is very steady.
The stars are intended to encapsulate the net risk/reward relationship.
Funds with the highest overall score get five stars; those with the lowest,
one. But statistics relating to past performance are of little use in
predicting how funds will do in future.
Dimson argues that risk-adjusted performance figures have no more predictive
power than conventional performance figures. Advertisements from unit trust
groups already use conventional performance figures as part of their sales
pitch.
The attacks on the star ratings took place at a recent FT Roundtable. Others
taking part were Chris Poll and Keith Sheffield, who run UK statistical
services Micropal and HSW respectively; James Coursey, who is UK editor of
Morningstar; and John Cuthbert, a freelance fund analyst. The Roundtable was
chaired by Barry Riley, investment editor of the FT. Edited extracts of the
discussion appear below.
POLL: The flaw in conventional five-year performance figures is that they
have only two common factors - what the price was five years ago and what it
is today, with nothing about what went on in between.
They do not give you the basis for any sort of qualitative evaluation
whatsoever. But people are using these figures to draw conclusions and make
recommendations.
At the end of the day, what do we all want? We want more people investing in
stock markets, either directly or indirectly through funds. And we want to
educate the public.
DIMSON: I don't know who 'we' is.
POLL: The unit trust industry.
DIMSON: But that is a million miles away from where the industry is. What
the industry does is to make promises of performance in which past
performance is extrapolated through to the future.
They build in part on data drawn from your services, making sometimes
implicit and sometimes explicit claims of the most outrageous nature about
the predictability of their returns.
They would be outrageous whether they take a price five years ago and a
price today or whether they take the period in between.
They would be outrageous whether they look at returns embracing data in
between or embracing volatility.
POLL: With commercialism, you're never going to stop people making claims.
SHEFFIELD: I'm not convinced that historical performance is even a relevant
starting point to future performance - partly because it fails to take
account of the market conditions under which we achieved that performance.
Historical performance tables have been useful in exposing the public to the
risks: the fact that some funds underperform others dramatically over
certain periods of time.
But you can't form total judgments from the collation of numbers. You need a
mixture of numbers and qualitative appraisal.
CUTHBERT: I find this argument bizarre. You are saying that you have this
historical world and you can't do anything with it in future. Doesn't this
imply that you can't pick good managers - or even that there aren't good
managers?
DIMSON: There is no dispute that there is a slight persistence in
performance at the bottom end: poor performers have slightly more than their
fair share of being poor performers in the following period. So, there is
something to be learnt from looking at the data. And it is appropriate for
individuals to know what's been happening to their unit trust.
But those are different functions from spotting a money manager who's going
to be better than all other money managers.
CUTHBERT: I think we may be missing something. We have a problem relating
past performance to future performance. But that does not necessarily mean
that we have a problem measuring managerial ability.
And if we can measure managerial ability - even though that process does not
have predictive content - it may still be rational to pick managers who have
shown more managerial ability than others in the past.
SHEFFIELD: I agree with some of your analysis, John. But I feel the
conclusions take us into dangerous territory. The danger is that a 'good'
fund manager will be expected to perform well in future.
RILEY: How should star ratings be used?
POLL: What we're trying to say by introducing star ratings is ' . . . in
addition to performance, is there another measure that will give an
indication of how that fund performs?' The star rating system says ' . . .
if you've got five, it's either an excessive performance and excessive risk
or medium performance with medium risk'.
We also spell out what the volatility is, separately. The star rating goes
out as part of a sheet on every fund which gives you a variety of
quantitative information. But the problem is that if you just put the basic
components of the star rating system down - the average investor won't
understand it.
We are not trying to say that the star rating system has predictive ability;
we are just trying to identify the characteristics of different funds.
COURSEY: It is important to make sure the star rating appears in context. We
have a statement that the star rating is an introduction, not a conclusion.
If you had a portfolio consisting only of funds with five stars and sold
them when the ratings went down to four stars, your portfolio would not
perform well.
SHEFFIELD: Do you put your customers (the unit trust management groups)
under any contractual obligation as to how they use your star ratings?
Because the advertisements will appear - as you know - saying 'Morningstar
five-star rating, Micropal five-star rating'. Do you explain that the star
ratings really must be related to other information?
POLL: We have a 20-page user guide which spells this out. Whether this is
going to be effective is a different question. Any star system is open to
abuse. Anything's open to abuse.
SHEFFIELD: Whatever you say here, the star ratings will actually be used if
you publish them.
POLL: But there is so much information published at the moment that is more
misleading - five-year performance tables and so on.
DIMSON: I feel you are all conniving. You are on your own side and so you
are on your customers' side.
There is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these
rankings. You need something like 25 years' data to conclude that someone
has superior capabilities which persist over time.
One can't say that star ratings based on three-year or five-year performance
are not helpful - people must have information that tells them what has gone
on in the past. But the implication that these are good-quality funds to
invest in for the future is overstated.
POLL: I'm not saying it is predictive, I'm saying it is informative.
RILEY: So, should we give up and say there is no connection between the past
and the future except for the dud funds?
POLL: What we are saying is that there is a balance between risk and reward
and there is a relationship. The star is not doing any more than
encapsulating that relationship.
DIMSON: I've heard the Consumers' Association explain the same thing. They
say: 'You look down this column and you can see how long the wash cycle is,
this one and the number of choices of different temperatures. You don't have
to look for the best buy'. But, in fact, they labelled it the 'Best Buy'.
You make it clear your stars aren't the 'Best Buy' . . . but it's terribly
tempting.
JEFFREYS: You would not dream of producing a star rating system based just
on cumulative relative performance, and risk-adjusted returns are no more
predictive than those. That's the killer.
DIMSON: All my Peps are in the Gartmore index fund. I put my money where my
mouth is.

place at the Financial Times on October 12.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Chapter and worse - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Whether consumers like anthologies as much as publishers, I rather doubt. I
suspect they either get bought by people who know nothing much about
whatever subject is being anthologised as presents for those who do; or they
don't get bought at all. From the point of view of the enthusiast, virtually
all anthologies suffer from the same incurable defect.
It lies in the combination of diversity and insubstantiality. A collection
drawn from 50 or more writers, representing different ages and traditions,
covering a hotchpotch of themes within the overall subject, is hard-pressed
to establish an identity of its own.
It becomes something to be dipped into; which, as often as not, means it is
relegated to the lavatory along with the Book of Lists and Edith Sitwell's
English Eccentrics. To grapple with the anthology is like being invited to a
feast and finding it consists of a vast array of bonnes bouches. One picks
and picks, and longs for red meat.
No pastime has stimulated better writing than fishing, and many are the
hands which have sought to scoop off the cream. There is one anthology alone
which triumphantly dodged pitfalls and, in doing so, became a classic in its
own right. It is BB's The Fisherman's Bedside Book, which was first
published in 1945.
Although BB did exploit the published legacy available to him - the work of
great men such as Sheringham, Skues, Farson and others - he did much more.
For one thing, he used a good deal of his own writing, which had not been
published and remains among the best there is. He also went to great lengths
to seek out the memories of anglers who had never dreamed of putting pen to
paper - such as J L Webb of Reading and Albert Buckley.
A variation on BB's approach is the collection of specially commissioned
pieces. A fine example is A Book Of Fishing Stories, edited by F G Aflalo,
which was printed in 1913 on gorgeous, thick, paper, and which has a
splendid Edwardian smack to it.
John Haslette Vahey's The Humane Angler, which came out in the 1930s, was an
early example of the cream-skimming genre, which has swelled to the point of
excess in recent times.
Each of these anthologies - with titles such as The Angler's Bedside Book,
The Angler's Weekend Book, The Angler's Companion - contains its gems. But
they all suffer from the fatal flaw, prompting a hankering for beef and two
veg, with apple crumble and custard to follow.
The latest to enter this overly congested ring is Jeremy Paxman, whose Fish,
Fishing And The Meaning Of Life has just been published by Michael Joseph at
Pounds 16.99. Let me say at once that, in my view, it is flawed in the same
way as most of its predecessors. In addition, the illustrations are poor,
the habit of identifying authors after the extracts is maddening, there are
too many chunks which are too short and too few substantial ones, and there
is too much mediocre verse.
The greatest virtue is that the editor's taste and my own are in general
accord (which, in view of the fact that I lent him a good portion of my
library, is not very surprising). He has avoided the mistake of being too
literary and including far too much boring stuff from olden days.
Paxman's own introduction is graceful and rather touching, and the first of
the mighty succession of titbits is a fine fragment of wisdom from the
American, Robert Traver, and an absolute cracker on winter chubbing by the
great Trent Otter, J W Martin. Overall, the verdict is that you non-fishing
present-givers may buy this. But, please, publishers: let there now be a
moratorium on fishing anthologies.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Property: New rules for old houses - Gerald Cadogan assesses
a fresh approach to England's historic environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may not have heard of PPG 15 but, if you own one of the 500,000 listed
buildings in England, or live in one of the country's 8,000 conservation
areas, you will ignore it at your peril.
In September, after many consultations and revisions to the draft version,
the Department of the Environment and Department of National Heritage issued
planning policy guidance note (PPG) number 15 on Planning and the Historic
Environment. This policy statement will guide local authorities on managing
listed buildings, conservation areas and historic landscapes. And that will
affect everybody who lives in them or nearby.
PPGs are not law, but they carry weight, telling district councils and
planning appeal inspectors what the important factors are in their
decisions.
The key element in PPG 15 is a presumption in favour of preservation,
welcome news for conservationists who had feared it would be lost in the
revision. Anyone who wishes to alter or demolish a listed building of
architectural or historical merit has to make a positive case to justify the
proposal and obtain listed building consent. The same holds for buildings in
conservation areas which may not be listed but are part of 'the familiar and
cherished local scene'. This surprising language marks a seachange in
official attitudes. Government is beginning to understand the intangible
value of the environment.
Local authority development plans should include conservation, and examine
how run-down historic areas can be revived by adapting old buildings; the
canalside regeneration of central Manchester is a good example.
PPG 15 recommends tourism and leisure as new uses and insists that
development must be sustainable.
'This is not spelt out enough,' remarks Neil Findon, of the Council for the
Protection of Rural England. The essence of the policy is not to sacrifice
things that people will value in the future for short-term and often
illusory gains. Councils are expected to cast a beadier eye over schemes
that affect the setting of listed buildings, which may be adjacent unlisted
buildings or high, bulky buildings some distance away that could 'alter
views of a historic skyline', says the policy statement.
It would be marvellous if this meant Oxford City Council would dismantle the
 -banal brown and gilt signs for pedestrians which diminish the city's
handsome buildings and destroy the scale of its streetscape.
Listed building controls will be tougher. The rationale that 'once lost,
listed buildings cannot be replaced' now includes damage by unsuitable
alteration as well as outright demolition. Indifferent minor works 'can
cumulatively be very destructive of a building's special interest'.
Councils should be flexible about how they apply disabled access and fire
regulations so as not to damage a building's historic character. Nor should
they be overly strict, if they give a grant for damp proofing.
The requirement for conservation areas is that councils now identify
important elements in each area - green verges, trees, buildings, street
flooring, pillar boxes, lamps and other street furniture. This will make the
case for designating new areas, and guide applicants and planners in keeping
up existing ones. For councils in the shires, which may have as many as 50
conservation areas, it will be an expensive task.
Gap sites in conservation areas need imaginative, high quality buildings. If
development proposals conflict with guidelines, there should be 'a strong
presumption against the grant of planning permission'. And trees may not be
cut down, lopped or topped, even if they do not have tree preservation
orders, without council permission. (This usually happens by default. Give
six weeks' notice of what you intend. If you hear nothing to stop you, then
proceed.)
PPG 15 details the procedures for listing and issuing building preservation,
urgent works and repairs notices. At the same time it reminds owners that
there is no specific obligation to keep the buildings in good condition,
'though normally it will be in their interests to do so.'
It does not mention relief from VAT which, thanks to the negative attitude
implicit in the law - contrasting with the positive approach of the PPG - is
possible for works that have listed building consent, because they alter the
character of the building, but not for the all-important regular clearing of
gutters or other maintenance. It explains also how to have a building
de-listed.
People developing buildings which might be listed can apply to the DoE for a
certificate of immunity from listing. Good for five years, it allows the
developer to work without disruption by spot-listing. If it is not granted,
the DoE normally lists the building forthwith, and listed building consent
rules apply.
Three groups of places do not have any special statutory protection, but
councils are urged to be extra vigilant about them: World Heritage sites,
there are 10 in England, such as Bath, the Tower of London, and Stonehenge
with Avebury; historic parks and gardens on the English Heritage register
and battlefields on EH's draft register.
Finally, PPG 15 introduces the public to the notion of seeing the country as
a man-made artefact - an historic landscape that reflects how people have
used it for centuries.
Conservation is as much about hedgerows that have been in place since Saxon
times as about 200-year-old listed buildings. Expect further announcements
on this theme from English Heritage and the Countryside Commission.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): No limits for Sky - Company in
the news / Christopher Price examines its flotation prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewers of BSkyB movie channels for the past two nights may well have found
some clues to the Pounds 4bn-plus flotation announced on Monday. Top Secret]
sat alongside Mr Billion, both of which could be applied to the biggest
listing to come to the market this year.
As with TeleWest last week, the method of valuation used by the group's
advisers has fuelled the heated debate over how the market should value
media companies. Much of their future worth lies in their potential roles in
the so-called multi-media revolution. And BSkyB's valuation relies on
matching its present subscription and advertising growth rates into the next
century.
With such an emphasis on what might be, BSkyB's 119-page pathfinder
prospectus contains surprisingly few financial facts with which to enlighten
potential investors. Instead, the report reflects the group's rise from
heavy losses to moderate profitability in its four-year history.
The number of subscribers to the group's nine channels, for instance, has
grown from 1.7m in 1992 to 3.6m in the year to end-September. Similarly,
profitability has improved enormously; operating losses of Pounds 47m last
year have turned to Pounds 170.1m profits this year.
Over the same period, revenues have risen from Pounds 379.5m to Pounds
550.5m.
With such scant hard information, however, the flotation has come in for
much criticism from commentators and analysts and put the company management
and Goldman Sachs, the lead broker, on the defensive. At meetings this week,
chief executive and managing director Sam Chisholm is said to have chided
analysts as 'sad, middle-class misfits'. When he found only three of the 50
analysts present subscribed to the station, he reportedly accused them of
being 'out of touch' with what the British people wanted.
Out of touch or not, there are several questions raised by sceptical
analysts over the issue. Chief among these is the contentious valuation
question. Goldman Sachs and the other brokers to the issue have used a
variety of methods to come up with the valuation range of Pounds 4.0bn to
Pounds 4.6bn.
None was willing to disclose details of its calculations but, privately,
Goldman is said to be forecasting profits of Pounds 889m for 2002.
Discounting back from there and assuming steady growth rates, this would put
the stock on a prospective p/e of around 20 for 1996 - a hefty 25 per cent
premium to the market.
BSkyB points to the ratings of companies such as Vodafone, arguing that the
mobile telecoms group faced questions of valuation and scepticism over its
likely growth rates when it floated - coincidentally, with 20 per cent of
the shares - in 1989. It came to the market eventually on a similar
prospective p/e to BSkyB.
Acknowledging these similarities, critics also point to significant
differences. For example, the revenue per subscriber for the telecoms group
is around Pounds 700, probably five times that of BSkyB. There is also the
matter of different products, customer base and the very different
industries the two companies exist in.
All of which underline the question of whether BSkyB (in which Pearson,
owner of the FT, has a 17.5 per cent stake) can maintain its present growth
rates - and thus justify the proposed rating. It is only three years ago
that its massive losses were making it the butt of national jokes and adding
to the crippling debt burden of its biggest shareholder, News Corporation.
Although the jokes have now stopped and News Corp is less geared, it would
be wrong to suggest that the initial resistance of viewers to the concept of
subscription TV has completely broken down. The Goldman Sachs profit
forecast for 2002 implies a subscriber base of some 11m, or getting on for
half of all television households - an optimistic figure given the vagaries
of the British viewing public.
BSkyB relies on its exclusive rights to sports events and films. Too heavily
for some critics, who point out that the cable companies will begin flexing
their growing muscles and bid for the same rights.
Not so, says Goldman, which forecasts that the cable companies and
broadcasters would be 'suicidal' to compete with each other in such a way.
The pricing of the issue has also attracted attention. Borrowing heavily
from government privatisations, share shops are being established and
registration encouraged as part of a Pounds 3m advertising campaign to
convert users (and potential users) into shareholders - a surefire way of
promoting customer loyalty.
But, unlike the government sales, there are no discounts for subscribers or
in the price for potential shareholders. BSkyB's plans to offer a lower
price to viewers were blocked by the stock exchange.
Nor will investors know the price of the shares until after signing their
cheques, although a price range of 233p and 268p has been set. A
book-building exercise with institutional investors, now under way, will
decide ultimately, with early indications pointing towards the 250-255p
level. Privately, Goldman is hinting that the minimum investment will be
somewhere over Pounds 500.
With concerns over both the valuation and the industry's future, investors
may consider the risks too high at this stage in the company's development.
Aptly, Thursday night's film schedule had a dark thriller: The Man Who Knew
Too Much. Investors may feel they do not yet know enough.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): British Steel - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt the spectacular profits momentum at British Steel will
continue as economic recovery in Europe gathers pace. But the six-fold
increase in interim earnings per share will not stop investors asking
whether now is the time to sell. The issue is whether the full cyclical
upswing in earnings has been discounted in a share price up nearly 30 per
cent against the market this year.
Higher prices and volumes will ensure that British Steel's pre-tax profits
will soon rise to beat the Pounds 733m achieved in 1989-90, the peak of the
previous cycle. The top of the current cycle is likely to be 1996-97, in
which pre-tax profits could amount to Pounds 900m, some 33p of earnings per
share. This far ahead, there is necessarily considerable imprecision about
such forecasts - perhaps profits will exceed Pounds 1bn. But assuming a
conservative outcome, the shares do not look cheap at nearly five times peak
earnings: that is not far short of the peak valuation in the last cycle.
Optimists argue that the recession due for 1998 or thereafter will be
gentler than the previous one. British Steel, for one, believes that steady
demand from Asia will offset the impact of downturn in Europe. If this were
to be the case, the shares could arguably command a higher rating now on the
basis that the stability and, therefore, quality of earnings was set to
improve.
However, the optimistic scenario ignores the woeful lack of progress in
eliminating subsidies and over-capacity from the European steel industry.
The shares are supported now by an above-market yield, but a re-rating would
be undeserved.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Unigate - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate's increase in its interim dividend was a tangible expression of the
group's confidence in the future. The mild optimism contrasts with near
panic before the new milk marketing regime took effect. Now that Milk Marque
is two weeks old, price rises of 2p a pint appear to have stuck both in
supermarkets and on the doorstep. The impact on Unigate's profitability is
unlikely to be quite so dire as feared. Sensing this, shares in both Unigate
and Northern Foods have risen sharply in the past fortnight.
The stock market reaction, however, under-estimates the scale of the
problems ahead. Unigate will not be able to recoup the full annual Pounds
40m increase in milk costs. Moreover, higher prices for home-delivered milk
may accelerate the decline of this high-margin business. In the long run,
Unigate will gain from sourcing more than half its milk from farmers
operating outside Milk Marque. But, initially at least, this milk commands a
premium price not yet offset by improvements in quality and reduced delivery
costs. Unigate will obtain better prices if it acquires Dairy Crest, which
would more than double its buying power.
Unigate will respond to the strategic challenges by implementing swingeing
rationalisation measures, giving rise to an exceptional charge far in excess
of the expected Pounds 10m hit to operating profits. This should make the
group fitter in the long term, but now the shares' main attraction is the
6.2 per cent prospective yield.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): UK generators - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government initially had qualms over allowing the electricity
generators to buy their own equity as part of its Pounds 4bn share sale next
year. The Treasury feared such a move might compromise its goal of wider
share ownership. But the Treasury's qualms were swept aside once it
appreciated how buy-backs should benefit the exchequer. By cancelling
shares, National Power and, possibly, PowerGen will enhance earnings per
share, so increasing the price the government can demand for its stakes.
That price should be further supported by the fact that there will be fewer
shares flooding the market.
From National Power's perspective, one cannot fault the principle of
reducing its equity. In fact, the company should be spending more than
Pounds 500m-plus to shrink its capital base. After the buy-back, National
Power will still be able to spend Pounds 1bn on overseas investment and keep
its gearing in the 20-30 per cent range. Another quibble is the method it
has chosen. By buying direct from the government, no shareholders will enjoy
a tax break. If, instead, it had issued a mega-dividend or bought shares
through a tender, some investors would have benefited from the tax credit.
Although the buy-back is positive for National Power, investors should be
wary of buying either of the generators' shares. Brokers who are keen to be
part of the Treasury's sale have in recent months been pumping out fat notes
singing the companies' virtues. Such one-way publicity has arguably already
inflated their share prices.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Laughing gas - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, British Gas was fighting tooth and nail to preserve its domestic
monopoly; on Wednesday, it welcomed the promise in the Queen's speech to
abolish that monopoly. The main reason for the change of heart is that Gas
has convinced ministers to create a level playing field when the market is
opened to competition. A demonstration of the new approach came next day
when Gas announced price rises for late-paying customers but discounts for
prompt-payers. Without such differential pricing, rivals would have been
able to concentrate on profitable prompt-payers, leaving Gas with
loss-making late-payers.
Of course, when the monopoly goes, Gas's market share will fall, but the
decline is unlikely to be rapid. If the development of competition in the
telecoms market is anything to go by, a largish discount will be needed to
convince customers to switch. But, given that all operators will face
roughly the same charges for wholesale gas and transportation - which
account for the bulk of total costs - rivals will struggle to undercut Gas.
The new competition will also give Gas an added incentive to cut costs. This
week's better than expected third-quarter results show the restructuring
programme is already containing costs; in coming quarters, they should start
to fall.
More worrying for investors is next year's review of Gas's transportation
price cap. The risk is that the regime will be tightened. But there are
opportunities, too. The regulator is considering replacing the price cap
with a mechanism for sharing excess profits with customers. That might lead
to sharper falls in bills. But, if Gas also improved its performance, the
quid pro quo would be higher profits.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: The pirates are boarding the slopes - Skiing /
Arnie Wilson sees the future of winter sport; it has a T-shirt and an
attitude and rides a snurfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have seen the future, and it is snowboard shaped. Of 21 people in the
queue for Lift 26, at Mammoth Mountain, California the other weekend, I was
the lone skier. The other 20 were snowboarders, wearing T-shirts and
sweatshirts with such messages as 'Snowboarding Is Not A Crime' and 'I Love
Animals - They're Delicious.'
I travelled up with one sporting a Red Baron board complete with Teutonic
red crosses and imitation cannon shell holes. On the slopes, boarders
outnumbered skiers by about 30 to 1. I felt like an interloper who had
strayed by mistake into the wrong side of town. I felt even more goofy than
a right-footed boarder.
It was the moment I knew was going to happen - but it came years earlier
than I expected. Within a decade some people in the skiing industry predict
that snowboarders will outnumber skiers, with 60 per cent boarders to 40 per
cent skiers.
But perhaps one should not read too much into this particular Sunday -
snowboarders traditionally come out to play early in winter, while skiers
wait for better snow conditions. And with insufficient snow on Mammoth's new
snow-board park, boarders were concentrated in part of the mountain usually
dominated by skiers. But it was a glimpse of things to come. Snowboarding is
said to be one of the fastest-growing sports in the west. Many resorts
welcome the inevitable: others are still agonising over whether to bow to
'progress' or ban them.
Tradition has it that snowboarding was invented in the early 70s by a
Hawaiian 'surfing freak' called Sherwin Popper. According to local legend,
when the Californian summer came to an end he decided to keep going by
building himself a surfboard designed for snow - a snurfer.
Twenty years later, in both north America and Europe, snowboarders represent
fresh blood for a stagnating ski industry. But they are also alienating some
of the more conservative skiers with their clothing, culture and
configurations. The very arcs described by a snowboard are not in harmony
with that of a ski. Collisions between skiers and boarders are inevitable,
even when no one is to blame. But boarders are always looking for things to
jump off, or get 'air' from . . . skiers much less so.
One of the most disturbing things that snow-boarders tend to do is jump out
of the trees like Exocets in a diagonal direction without looking before
they leap. It is usually up to the skier to be constantly on watch to avoid
a collision.
Skiers tend to be far more watchful than snow-boarders unless the boarders
are ex-skiers. Because of their stance boarders tend to have 'flounder
vision', seeing only 90` of their field of vision compared with a skier's
180`. Boarders might benefit from wing-mirrors so that when they leap into
skiers' path they can see them coming.
Most boarders who started out as skiers tend to be more considerate and
aware of mountain safety and etiquette (or shrediquette as it is sometimes
known to sneering boarders). But few boarders ever switch to skiing and
rarely have the awareness skiers seem to have. Many have come straight from
skate-boarding or surfing, and have little sympathy with rules and
regulations, even if they are designed for safety.
I have been knocked flying by snowboarders when I have been completely
stationery, and I have experienced dozens of near misses. One of the saddest
blemishes in snowboarding history happened two winters ago when a little
girl on the nursery slopes in Val Thorens is in the French Alps was killed
by one.
During the same winter, tempers flared between snowboarders and skiers at
Copper Mountain, Colorado, when some boarders 'buzzed' skiers, sometimes
knocking them over and even threatened members of the ski patrol. The local
sheriff had to be called in to defuse the situation.
Snowboarders are banned in some ski resorts, including Aspen, Colorado and
five of the biggest resorts in Utah. Yet many skiers are switching to
boarding - and not just in the 14-21 age group which dominates the sport.
Ken Hensler - a lifelong skier at Mammoth, California - volunteered to keep
one of his 22 grandchildren company when she was in tears during her first
boarding lesson.
'Michelle and I learned together,' he says. 'She was 13 and I was 60. I fell
and fell and fell, cracked two or three ribs and hurt my hands and knees so
much that I felt like quitting the first day. I was black and blue. So I
started boarding with a beach towel wrapped around me under my outer
clothing and made myself knee and hand protectors.'
But after the first day or two of agony the learning curve for a snowboarder
is much sharper than a skier's. Two years later, Hensler, the retired boss
of a carpet manufacturing company, was out on his snowboard for 130 days. He
has never touched his skis since. This winter he aims not to miss a single
day on the mountain - and even plans to learn to jump.
His moment of glory was being accepted by other snowboarders. 'When they saw
me they said: 'Here comes the legend]' Then I discovered what they meant by
a legend: anyone over 40 on a snowboard.'
Although I rode a chair with Ken and accompanied him down the mountain a few
times (I am uncertain whose reputation was most tarnished when we were seen
together). I resisted his attempts to get me on to a board. Much as I would
love to love snowboarders, they make me nervous. Perhaps in the next decade
we will not have to confront them; they will dominate what used to be the
ski slopes while skiers will be confined to special ski parks. Skiers like
me will be threatened species. Perhaps we already are.
The other day an English snowboarder and I became entangled as we moved off
from the top of the Beaver Run quad at Breckenridge. Both unbalanced, we
grabbed each other for an impromptu waltz. It was probably the nearest I
shall ever get to trying snowboarding for myself.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: A man-made winter - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. They are now in the US on the last stage of their
odyssey.
Watching winter take its grip on the Rockies is a slow and fascinating
process. It is like watching blossom buds opening in spring. Right now one
or two small petals are uncurling: in a weeks time, after Thanksgiving, the
ski season will be in full bloom.
Winter is often reluctant to help, it is man and his artificial snow who
curtail the blaze of glory that is the fall. Every year, ski resorts are
desperate to tell the world they have opened on the earliest possible date -
sometimes ridiculously early.
In its traditional battle to be first, Keystone pulled off a master-stroke
to scupper Loveland, its local rival. When Loveland announced it would open
at 9am on October 18, Keystone simply turned on the lights they normally use
for floodlit skiing and opened at 6am, offering free coffee and doughnuts.
Keystone's spokesman, Jim Felton gloated: 'I hate to put it in those terms
but they started it]' But is a resort really open when it has only one run
or one lift operating? It would seem so.
It seems perverse that skiers frantic for winter to begin rush to ski a mile
or so of man-made snow and yet completely ignore mountainfulls of snow and
hundreds of trails in late spring.
We are currently marking time in Summit County, Colorado where we have had
the luxury of choosing from half a dozen long trails in Keystone,
Breckenridge and Copper Mountain, we have been able to monitor winters
unfolding. One run (Born Free) open at Vail. One at Breckenridge (Columbia)
eventually followed by a second (Bonanza). It is all about getting your one
run open and then gradually, trying to get a second run open and possibly a
third.
Not that we have lacked real snow: there have been quite a few falls, but,
except for the storm which gave Mammoth Mountain 2ft in early October (and
then melted) none has been sufficient.
Meanwhile the talk is still of summer activities - particularly Llamas. At a
birthday party for a Forest Service executive, there was much discussion of
Llama Lunch Hikes. You ride the gondola with your llama to the summit of
Keystone Mountain and take a lunch and hike.
Said Boyd Mitchell, the mountain manager: 'Getting a llama into a gondola is
no more difficult than getting a horse into &amp; horsebox' he said. 'They enjoy
it. You can tell, because they hum.' Another guest, Marsha Colby chimed in:
'No, when they hum it means they're stressed.' Perhaps it is just as well
that winter is on its way and the subject of llamas can be deferred.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Gardening: Not everything in the botanic garden is rosy -
Roy Barnes compares two approaches to providing public access to open spaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I left Britain a week after the Cambridge University Botanic Garden
announced it would charge visitors on weekdays between March and October to
help cover its Pounds 1,200 a day maintenance costs.
The charges - entrance remains free on Wednesdays and for school parties -
were introduced on January 1 this year.
Shortly afterwards, I was walking through the high north-east section of New
Zealand's Dunedin Botanic Garden, admiring the native plants and trees, and
could not help thinking about the sad development in Cambridge.
Where I was walking, there is no perimeter fence, the public road leads
directly into the garden before dropping downhill beside the native bush.
There is no attempt, and apparently no need, to keep the public out, day or
night, and there are no charges to enter the grounds, the glasshouses, the
aviary (containing endemic and Australian birds) or the car park.
Everything, apart from the excellent cheap food, hot and cold meals and
snacks, served in delightful surroundings in the restaurant, is free.
Whereas in Britain most botanic gardens were established by private bodies
or individuals with a primary purpose of botanical research and education
and not as public parks, in New Zealand most botanic gardens are 'public
domains', set up for the 'benefit and enjoyment of the community at large'.
They have a combined botanical, amenity and educational function.
The Dunedin Botanic Garden's budget of Dollars NZ1.1m (Pounds 450,000) is
funded from local rates with some additional help from various commercial
and voluntary bodies.
Like all local authorities in the UK, Cambridge city council is required to
put the care and maintenance of its open spaces out to competitive tender.
The council's horticultural officer merely monitors the work of the
contractors.
And even if the local authority had the will, it clearly has neither the
funds nor the expertise to supply a free botanical information service to
the general public.
The Dunedin Botanic Garden also contracts out some of its work -
grass-mowing, litter control, path maintenance and plant propagation and
supply - but day-to-day control of the contracted staff's work is firmly in
the hands of the garden's own managers.
In addition, the administrators are obliged to provide a unified service in
which research, education and amenity go hand in hand, and this is an
obligation that they willingly accept.
One has a strong impression all over New Zealand that everybody wishes to
work for the common good. The land and its flora are the common heritage of
all the people and they wish to preserve it.
This could be a result of their history and geography - only 3m people in a
country the size of Great Britain - and a tradition so different from the
UK's, where the use of public land for private ends has fostered a different
view of things and where urbanisation has diluted familiarity with the
countryside.
The contrast between the two countries can be illustrated by the amount of
local involvement in the affairs of the Cambridge and Dunedin Botanic
Gardens. Both gardens have their 'Friends', who help with donations of cash,
production of publications, and some gardening chores.
But outside help goes much further in Dunedin than in Cambridge: the Dunedin
Bog Garden was established by the Friends; the aviary is financed by
donations from the Trust Bank Otago Community Trust, the Dunedin Rotary Club
and New Zealand Television; the Alpine House was rebuilt in 1986 with money
supplied by the Dunedin Amenities Society; and the new Herb Garden was paid
for and installed by the Otago Herb Society.
Every local specialist society helps with its speciality - the Dunedin
Dahlia Circle with the herbaceous borders, the Dunedin Rhododendron Group
with the marvellously extensive display of azaleas and rhododendrons. The
new historical rose garden was laid out in 1988-89 under the guidance of the
Dunedin Rose Society.
The Dunedin Botanic Garden manager says that when administrative costs,
salaries and payment for contracted works are deducted from the Dollars
NZ1.1m grant, the contribution of the voluntary societies becomes
'significant and invaluable to the success of this Botanic Garden'.
Cambridge University Botanic Garden does not contract out any work and,
except for minor tasks such as seed gathering by Friends, everything is
carried out by professionally qualified full-time staff or by
sandwich-course trainees from horticultural colleges under professional
supervision.
The superintendent has said that he does not see how amateur labour and
expertise, of the kind and to the extent that it is used in Dunedin, could
be incorporated into the work at Cambridge.
But sadly, even in Dunedin there are ominous creakings: the Dunedin Botanic
Garden Management Plan contains the sentence: 'The garden does not sit
easily with its classification as a recreation reserve.'
One senses that things may be changing not entirely for the better.
Throughout the country there are signs of change: motorways are beginning to
sneak out of the bigger towns; there is smog in Christchurch; and downtown
supermarkets and hamburger bars are appearing everywhere.
The government is urging 'modernisation', doubling the tourist trade very
five years or so; in some areas the local population is outnumbered by
visiting Japanese tourists and businessmen investing money and buying up
hotels (in one case a whole university).
One worries for them and hopes that they will be able to maintain the old
communal values that, for me, are wonderfully symbolised in the Dunedin
Botanic Garden.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Outdoors: And the winner is . . - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Car of the Year contest jury is out. Five self-congratulatory
advertising campaigns are being prepared. Four of them will have to be
binned when the result is announced early next month. This is a contest with
only one winner. The also-rans really do not count. There are just five
names in the frame this time. Last year there were 15. This is not due to a
dearth of new cars in 1994 but because the organisers of Car of the Year
have changed the rules.
Until now, the jury of nearly 60 motoring journalists (no, not me, which is
why I can say here who I think will win) has had to vote on every eligible
car. Some embarrassment has been caused when one or two of the less
desirable models failed to attract any votes at all. So, this year, the 19
original entries - or 22 if you count the Citroen, Fiat, Lancia and Peugeot
badged versions of the joinly developed Fiat / PSA multi-purpose vehicle -
have been whittled down to a short list of five. The 1995 Car of the Year
will be chosen from the Audi A8, Renault Laguna, Fiat Punto, VW Polo and
Vauxhall (Opel) Omega.
Among the exclusions are the BMW 7-Series, the first completely new Range
Rover in 24 years and, of course, the Fiat / PSA multi-purpose vehicle,
which I believe could turn out to be the most significant new model of 1994.
Which car will win? It depends on what impresses jury members most; large
cars with advanced technology, small ones with fuel economy or
medium-to-large ones offering top value for money.
If it is advanced technology, there can be no argument; it must be the Audi
A8. This large and shapely saloon is made almost entirely from aluminium
alloy and has either a 2.8-litre V6 with front wheel drive or a 4.2-litre V8
with quattro transmission and Tiptronic gear selection. (I have just spent a
couple of weeks with both A8s. They combine clever new thinking with
traditional luxury and are extraordinarily quiet).
The Punto and Polo are at the other extreme; small and inexpensive. Yet they
provide fuel-efficient personal transport with the refinement and comfort of
larger, dearer and thirstier cars. Punto is by far the best Fiat for years;
Polo is really a scaled-down Golf. VW's build quality is renowned but the
Punto is at least as well put together. Renault's front-wheel driven Laguna
has to be compared with the Ford Mondeo (last year's winner) whereas the
larger Vauxhall (Opel) Omega has rear wheel drive. It is similar in size and
layout to the Ford Scorpio.
In Britain, at any rate, the Laguna is priced below most of its rivals
though its equipment levels, comfort and performance are just as good. The
Omega looks much nicer than Ford's curiously fish-eyed Scorpio. It may well
pick up votes because the diesel version has BMW's superb six-cylinder
turbo-intercooled engine (with automatic transmission option) while the
diesel Scorpio is manual only and its engine is a beefy four-cylinder.
My money for Car of the Year 1995 would be on the Punto. It is a splendid
car - and also it is years since Fiat won the contest.
I think the Audi A8 will be runner-up, if only because of its advanced
aluminium technology. Not far behind will be the Renault Laguna, with the
Polo fourth and Omega fifth. The contest will be close. Any of the
short-listed cars is worthy of winning. In the end, it will depend what
turns on individual members of the jury.

BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting group is likely to raise around Pounds
810m, which represents 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital writes
Christopher Price. The company intends to use the money to pay back debt of
around Pounds 1.2bn.
The offer price is expected to fall between 233p and 268p per share, giving
the company a market value of between Pounds 4.0bn and 4.6bn.
UK private investors are to be offered 36.4m shares out of a global share
offer of 343m. US and UK institutions will be offered some 109m shares
apiece, with 88m assigned to investors outside the two countries. Of the
latter, 52m will be taken by Chargeurs, the French conglomerate, in order to
maintain its 17.5 per cent stake in the broadcaster.
BSkyB's other main shareholders, Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times,
and Granada, will see their similarly-sized stakes reduced after the float.
For small UK investors, a prospectus will be launched on November 25. Twelve
share shops have been established at various high street banks and
institutions at which interested investors can register to receive further
information. Alternatively, there is an information service on 0345 400700
(see next page).
Brightreasons, the owner of Pizzaland, became the latest new issue to abort.
Brightreasons had planned to raise about Pounds 35m from investors in an
offer that would have valued the group at between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m.
Shares in Hydro International, the maker of control systems for storm water
control and sewage separation, were priced at 80p, valuing the company at
about Pounds 10.5m. RAP, a distributor of industrial products such as hoses,
gloves, gaskets and uniforms, is looking to raise about Pounds 4.6m in an
institutional placing next month.
Stega Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company, hopes to raise Pounds 6.7m
net. It is making a subscription offer of 1.9m shares at 400p each,
representing 52.8 per cent of the company's enlarged equity and valuing the
company at Pounds 14.4m.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher offers were made this week as both the big take-over battles
continued to rage. Yesterday, British Aerospace raised its offer for VSEL,
topping the rival bid from GEC, while Browning-Ferris Industries increased
its share offer for Attwoods on Thursday.
BAe increased its offer from 2.727 to 3.3 of its shares for each VSEL share.
This was worth around Pounds 14.70 yesterday compared with GEC's cash offer
of Pounds 14. BAe increased its cash alternative from Pounds 11.40 to Pounds
14.
While this battle could have some way to go yet, BFI's hostile Pounds 391m
bid for Attwoods, the waste services company, is nearing its climax, writes
Peggy Hollinger. Shareholders have two simple choices in deciding which
company to back.
The increased offer from BFI of 116.75p a share is a mere 7 per cent higher
than the original bid, which valued the company at Pounds 364m. It is not so
generous that investors are likely to fall over themselves in accepting it.
Yet, this is a firm cash offer. It also includes the promise to pay, in
addition to the share offer, the proposed 3.25p dividend to shareholders who
accept the bid.
Attwoods is proposing a break-up plan which, it claims, will return better
value to shareholders. But it is unable to quantify the amount it will net
from a break-up.
Nor can it name potential buyers, although Waste Management International
has already declared its interest in acquiring the UK businesses.
The feeling from potential purchasers is that Attwoods resorted to the
break-up option too late in the defence to give it any real weight.
Shareholders will have to come up with their own estimates of what the
various businesses are worth. Then, they will have to accept that the
process will take time.
They will also have to be convinced in the next couple of weeks that
Attwoods has serious buyers lined up to carry out the break-up plan. Unless
it can do this, it is likely that the increased offer put forward by BFI
will win the day.
Last week's biggest bid came from Boots which, on Tuesday, launched a Pounds
500m offer - for its own shares, writes David Wighton. Private shareholders
were not invited to apply.
Through its stockbroker, Warburg Securities, Boots spent a total of Pounds
508m in the morning buying back 10 per cent of its shares at prices between
528p and 535p. The offer was only slightly more than the market price but
Boots was swamped with demand from institutions.
This is because such share buy-backs are very attractive to non-taxpaying
investors such as pension funds. In addition to the cash from Boots, they
should be able to claim a tax credit from the government of more than 110p a
share.
Although Boots could not make the offer available to private shareholders,
they should also benefit. Because the reduction in the number of shares in
issue outweighs the interest foregone on the Pounds 508m, the buy-back
should enhance Boots' earnings per share. That, in turn, should increase the
value of the shares.
The buy-back followed the announcement on Monday that Boots plans to sell
its prescription drug business to BASF of Germany for about Pounds 850m.
The deal will leave Boots with much more cash than it needs and an
inefficient capital structure. Although strategically sensible, it will also
dilute earnings, an effect which will be partly offset by the share
buy-back.
Analysts estimate that the two deals together will leave Boots with dilution
of around 3 per cent - and plenty of cash to pursue acquisitions in
over-the-counter medicines.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Buoyant glass-maker shines - The
week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY: The strong profit recovery at Pilkington, the glass maker, has
continued in the six months to September with analysts forecasting a figure
of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m before tax and exceptional items, up
from Pounds 30.5m in the first half of last year.
The improvement stems largely from increased capacity utilisation and some
price rises. The headline figure will be nearer Pounds 75m, including the
gain from the sale in June of its insulation business.
TUESDAY: After seeing promising first-quarter figures from Thorn EMI, the
music and rentals group, analysts are anticipating another encouraging set
of results. Jeffrey Harwood, leisure analyst at Robert Fleming Securities,
expects a 17 per cent pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 135m for the half to
September 30, against Pounds 115m.
Thorn has benefited from the bouyant state of the music business and is now
re-orienting its rental interests by moving into the burgeoning 'option to
buy' market.
TUESDAY: National Grid is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds
300m (Pounds 285m) when it reports results for the first six months. The
City will be looking for as much information as possible on the Grid's
flotation, which is expected in the middle of the year, but it could have to
wait some weeks before details are announced.
TUESDAY: Interim profits at Northern Foods are forecast at around Pounds
65m, down from Pounds 72.1m a year earlier, because of pressure on dairy
profits, and exceptionals. Any indication of Northern's ideas for
restructuring the dairy industry would be welcomed by analysts.
TUESDAY: Vodafone, the UK's largest cellular phone group, is expected to
report interim pre-tax profits in the Pounds 175m-Pounds 185m range, only a
few percentage points ahead of last year's Pounds 174.5m, as start-up costs
for overseas licences start to bite. Overseas losses could amount to Pounds
50m. The UK cellular market has proved buoyant, however, with surprisingly
stable pricing, and it is expected that the bare figures conceal substantial
underlying growth.
WEDNESDAY: Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group whose shares have been
weak over the past few months, is expected to report interim profits before
exceptional items of around Pounds 80m, little changed from last year. But a
modest increase in the dividend to about 4.2p (4.0p) is thought likely. The
City will be keen to hear if Courtaulds is managing to pass on its rising
raw materials costs, which accelerated over the summer.
WEDNESDAY: Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year
ended September of around Pounds 265m, against Pounds 223.5m a year earlier.
A recovery in cereal sweeteners and starches will be the main factor. A 1p
rise in full-year dividend to 14p is expected.
WEDNESDAY: Yorkshire Water is forecast to show a 12 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits before exceptionals to about Pounds 84m. The figures
will be overshadowed by restructuring provisions and accounting changes on
the treatment of infrastructure maintenance charges.
Shareholders will also be curious to know whether Yorkshire has been tempted
to follow the trend of higher-than-expected dividend payments. Forecasts are
for at least an 8 per cent increase to 8.2p, which could well be bettered.
WEDNESDAY: Granada Group, the broadcasting, leisure, rental and business
services group, is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to
end-September of at least Pounds 250m on Wednesday, up from Pounds 176m last
time. The second half will see the first full contribution from London
Weekend Television, of which Granada won control in February for Pounds
760m.
THURSDAY: After last month's upbeat trading statement, the City expects a
good set of interim results from retailer Storehouse.
Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of around Pounds 25m, compared with Pounds
11.6m last time, for the group which includes British Home Stores,
Mothercare and Blazer. Attention is likely to focus on how well the BHS
expansion programme is progressing.
THURSDAY: Allied Domecq is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 240m after exceptionals and Pounds 310m before, against Pounds
271m and Pounds 292m respectively a year earlier. A dividend increase of
around 6 per cent to 7.5p a share is likely.
Investors will be looking for more news on the integration of Domecq into
the group and on further recovery at Carlsberg Tetley, the group's beer
joint venture which lost market share last year.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Miners' dreams turn to dust - Nikki Tait
visits Lightning Ridge where the supply of opals has dried up in the
Australian drought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mounds of baked earth, about 10 ft high, are crammed between the gum trees.
It looks as if giant moles have burrowed through the bushland around
Lightning Ridge, the Australian outback town which produces most of the
world's black opal.
Bob Barrett, one of the 1,000-odd local miners, bumps his truck past a
particularly mountainous cluster and summarises the situation succinctly:
'About 200 truckloads of opal dirt there,' he says. 'No water, no wash, no
work'.
Australia's drought, one of the worst this century, is picking some
surprising victims. Most attention has focused on the farming communities of
New South Wales and Queensland, some of which are facing their fourth year
of failed crops. Local newspapers have been filled with pictures of cracked
earth and skeletal cattle. Ministers have shed their Canberra suits and
toured the region. Hundreds of millions of dollars of federal aid have been
promised.
But the miners of Lightning Ridge are a forgotten casualty. Their town, just
south of the Queensland-NSW border, last saw rain nine months ago. Already,
daytime temperatures are reaching 90`F (38`C), and what little water remains
in the surface catchments is evaporating fast. This means that the giant
cement mixers - called 'agitators' or 'agis' by the locals - which wash clay
away from the lumps of precious opal are largely dormant.
The inability to process opal dirt has brought torpor to the mining fields
themselves. In contrast to diamonds or gold, opal mining is still the
province of the individual prospector. Miners - many of whom have Irish,
Scandinavian, Serb or Croatian roots - simply turn up, peg a claim and start
digging. No one is allowed more than two claims at once, and the maximum
size that can be pegged is 50 metres square.
Technology has made few inroads. Because the gemstone occurs just below the
earth's surface, the extraction process has changed relatively little since
Charlie Nettleton sold the first parcel of black opal for Pounds 15 in 1903.
Normal practice in the Lightning Ridge fields - where most of the opal
occurs in random nodules, not seams - is to drill a 3ft diameter hole,
perhaps 60ft deep. The miner then scoops out underground tunnels at its
base, supporting his shafts with local pine trunks. The resultant dirt is
vacuumed or winched to the surface for washing.
At the best of times opal-mining is a raw business. Its safety record is
worse than that of the coal industry. Inadequate propping of underground
shafts is the main cause of fatalities.
Moreover, while a successful find can bring in millions of dollars, most
miners live in a state of perpetual optimism. Maxine O'Brien, who runs the
Lightning Ridge Miners Association, reckons that about 40 per cent of the
town's community is technically below the poverty line, subsisting from
trailer homes or temporary structures on the pegged claims. ('Permanent'
dwellings are not allowed). Another 40 per cent makes a 'reasonable' living.
Perhaps one-fifth gets rich.
Back in the pubs of Lightning Ridge, tales of Lady Luck's capriciousness
abound. Bob Barrett, for example, recalls the day when a fellow miner picked
up a chunk of opal dirt which was wedging the tyres of Barrett's truck. The
other miner split open the lump. Inside was opal worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Barrett, who did not get a cent, refuses to believe that the
block came from dirt he had dug up and discarded.
But then, at least, things were happening. Today, the inability to process
the opal dirt, coupled with a required weekly outlay of ADollars
500-ADollars 1,000 on diesel oil if a claim is being worked, means that many
miners have simply shut up shop, leaving their stockpiles of dirt to await
the rains. Only a few individuals, who know that they are working productive
shafts, are paying vastly inflated rates to rent the limited agitator spaces
attached to bore-fed dams. Production, estimates the LRMA, has fallen by
about 60 per cent.
This idleness is doing nothing to improve the strained relationships between
miners and farmers. The rural community tends to view the miners as a
degenerate bunch, gambling on the chance of a quick buck. Miners, for their
part, think the farmers are a selfish breed, pampered by politicians.
'The problem is not about water, it's about distribution,' says Dino, a
bearded bear of a man, mournfully surveying a muddy puddle which was once
Smith's Dam.
The miners argue that they should be given more access to bore water, from
the artesian basin, pointing out that annual opal production in Lightning
Ridge is worth around ADollars 50m. The value of the wool from the adjacent
shire is only ADollars 20m, they say.
Perhaps the biggest paradox is that this hiatus has not brought higher
prices - at least, for miners. Australia produces about 90 per cent of the
world's precious opals and Lightning Ridge is the main source of black
opals. These are stones with deep background colours and iridescent flashes,
whose individuality makes them the most highly prized by collectors.
But marketing is crude. Miners sell their smaller stones to travelling
middle-men, who rent rooms in the Lighting Ridge motels, posting buying
signs above their doors. As the steady supply of stones has dried up, so
have buyers' visits. Already, one auction house has seized the opportunity
to arrange a sale in Hong Kong next year, hoping to persuade miners to part
with some of their larger hoarded gems.
In Sydney, the story is different. Scores of opal 'boutiques' jostle for the
Japanese tourist trade. Sales opportunities provided by the drought are not
being missed.
Last Sunday, in one of the classier outlets by the Harbour Bridge, a German
gentleman was pondering a ADollars 8,000 gemstone. 'Opals are getting very
hard to replace - with the drought, we haven't got the water for polishing,'
urged the saleslady. Her information may have been inaccurate, but her
psychology was spot-on. He paid another ADollars 1,000 for a larger stone.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The messy holy war that threatens to split
Ukraine - Adultery, money and power divide the Orthodox church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday is no day of rest for Mikhail Pyatnitsky. For the past several months
on this day of worship, he has dashed about Kiev with his microcassette
recorder, listening to sermons and interviewing parishioners, in a desperate
quest for a suitable church.
'It's very confusing and I want to make the right choice,' Pyatnitsky
explained. Pyatnitsky is neither a religious fanatic nor on a personal
odyssey to discover his faith. He describes himself as comfortably Ukrainian
Orthodox, a branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the dominant faith in
Ukraine.
But he has a lot to be confused about. Just to pray at Christmas, the
average Ukrainian is forced to choose between three similarly-named, but
warring churches - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Kiev Patriarchy of the
Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
Each claims to be the legitimate church and denounces the others as
heretical pretenders.
The competition to win Ukrainian souls extends beyond scathing rhetoric.
Violence flared when a nationalist paramilitary organisation tried to
prevent the head of one church from entering his monastery. Monks claim they
have been beaten up. Old women bar cathedral doors to high priests.
Communities stage hunger strikes. Scandals have been exposed. Everyone, from
New Jersey clerics to the Constantinople See, from Kiev officials and the
Russian Patriarch, has taken sides.
Unlike neighbouring Poland and Russia, whose dominant churches serve to
unify, the Ukrainian church schism is another reminder that so little binds
together this fragile three-year old nation. Ukraine is split between
Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, between Ukrainian and Russian speakers, and
between its more nationalist west, which borders on Poland, and its
Moscow-oriented east, part of the Russian empire for more than 300 years.
The three churches encapsulate the deep internal divides between
Russophiles, pragmatists and nationalists in Ukraine. Each group wants its
world view to define the Ukrainian national identity. None wants to be left
out.
The struggle also exhibits how Ukrainian-Russian tensions are alive in
matters of spirit as well as in political disputes over the Black Sea Fleet,
nuclear weapons and energy supplies.
Things were much simpler under the Tsarist empire, when there was one
Russian Orthodox Church. Then dissidents, who wanted nothing to do with
Soviets, established an independent church. This Autocephalous Ukrainian
Church lived underground in Ukraine and practiced in Ukrainian communities
abroad.
Ukraine's independence in 1991 ushered yet another split when former
president Leonid Kravchuk encouraged the creation of an official Ukrainian
church to mark his nation's break from Moscow and to bolster his new state.
Not everyone followed. Many priests and congregations continue to heed the
Russian Patriarch, who refuses to recognise the independent Ukrainian
Church. The independent church of dissidents and diaspora managed to unite
with Kravchuk's rebels for a year until they broke off again last September
in a priestly squabble.
The Moscow followers still use the Old Church Slavonic language and
genuflect to the Russian Patriarch, whereas the other two churches conduct
their services in Ukrainian and make no references to Moscow. Otherwise
little distinguishes the practices of the three churches. White-bearded high
priests don similar black robes. Icons and pungent incense fill their
churches. The same ancient hymns are chanted and the same theology is taught
in their seminaries.
'I go to St Sophia's because no one makes a comment about my wife not
wearing a head scarf,' said Sergei Olyokhin, a 36-year old businessman, on
his way out of Kiev's main onion-domed cathedral. Olyokhin prefers the
relaxed atmosphere and blinking Christmas lights of the new independent
Ukrainian church, where his wife, Larissa, sported skin-tight denims, dangly
earrings and three-inch black pumps.
The Moscow branch's main church is crowded on Sundays with elderly women
lighting candles by the dozen. All are in modest dress and head covering.
Lidiya, a 62 year old woman, said the head of the independent Ukrainian
church, Metropolitan Filaret, 'doesn't have a religious bone in his body.
There is no God in his church. It's just a building.'
On the edge of Kiev's city limits is the humble church of Ukrainian
nationalists. Valentina and Oleksandr Cheshkova travel three hours to
worship at this white cossack house with raw wood and iconned interior. Why?
'I was illegally christened by a repressed dissident,' explained Valentina.
'I tried one of Filaret's services once, but it didn't feel right.'
Filaret is at the centre of the conflict. Many say he was close to the KGB
in the old days of the Soviet Union. Ukrainian government officials confess
that he is as active in politics as he is in piety.
In Soviet times, Filaret was the head of the Kremlin-controlled Russian
Orthodox Church of the Ukrainian Republic, when church officials were
'asked' to be informants and the brave observants were regularly dragged in
for KGB interrogations. Filaret made the three-man short list for the
Russian patriarch in 1990. He was not selected and when Ukraine declared
independence in 1991, he suddenly transformed himself into a nationalist,
realising his religious career lay with the independent state.
'We realised that an independent state needs an independent church,'
recalled Filaret in his ornate Kiev headquarters, where he once sat as a
messenger of the Russian Patriarch. 'Ukrainian sovereignty would be a farce
if 20m believers were subordinate to Moscow.
'But Patriarch Alexei (of Moscow) would not have it. He launched a crusade
to depose me and eventually had me defrocked,' Filaret said.
Just as Ukraine's leaders and the controversial Filaret were desperate to
escape Moscow's grasp, Moscow was loathe to lose Ukraine - the historical
and spiritual core of the Russian Orthodox Church.
The two Slav nations had been one church for more than 1,000 years since
Christianity took root in 988 at the famous baptism in Kiev's Dnieper river.
Sixty per cent of all churches of the Russian Orthodox faith were on
Ukrainian territory. An equal share of the Russian Orthodox clergy was
ethnically Ukrainian. Many were sent to Russia to run parishes. Ukraine
boasts five seminaries to train priests. Russia has only two.
To seal the break from Moscow, Filaret made a career-saving but unlikely
alliance with the Autocephalous Ukrainian church. Filaret had previously
denounced this diaspora church.
With Kravchuk's blessing, he joined the dissident church and established
Ukraine's first official and independent church in mid-1992. New Jersey
diaspora leader, Mystislav, was elected Kiev Patriarch. Filaret became
Bishop of Kiev, the second highest post.
The newly-appointed, highly-respected head of the Russo-based church was
forced to seek refuge in the fortress-like Kiev Monastery of the Caves, a
stunning gold-domed complex of ancient churches dating from the 11th century
overlooking the Dnieper River.
Filaret grabbed the treasury, residence and St Sophia Cathedral for Kiev.
There were scuffles and thousands of protesters, especially old women took
to the streets.
Kravchuk ordered Ukrainian television to broadcast his church's services and
ignore the pro-Russian church. But in spite of Ukrainian government support,
only about 3,000 of Ukraine's 8,000 churches have gone over to the Kiev
side. The others remain loyal to Moscow and maintain the Old Church Slavonic
liturgy.
In Dnipropetrovsk, on Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, the two Kiev
branch congregations have no church and have been conducting Sunday services
in the open air.
Ukraine's independent church is not recognised by Constantinople (Istanbul),
the Eastern Orthodox See, but the Kremlin one is.
Nikolai Zaboga, rector of the Moscow branch's theological academy, says he
wants to re-unite with the Kiev church, but first 'they must repent and
confess their sins for breaking away from the Moscow church. Naughty
daughters will never get a tomos' (the eastern orthodox grant of
sov-ereignty).
Until then, 'their blessings, marriages, christenings are useless and not
recognised by the canon,' he says.
Once the churches agree to unify, all sides say that Moscow might grant them
independence, paving the way for international recognition of the Ukrainian
church. For now the three leaders are unable to sit down at a negotiating
table together.
And so on each Sunday, Ukrainians remain divided in prayer and Pyatnitsky
wanders.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Self-analysis for Investors): First, take the
temperature - The opportunity might look good, but don't dive in before
doing Anthony Bailey's quiz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He is young, single - and he likes to live in the fast lane. At 28, this
whizzo accountant drives a company car and earns Pounds 48,000 a year, more
than enough to service his Pounds 110,000 mortgage. A good whack is going
into his pension plan, too.
When he hears of a small, go-go biotechnology firm coming to the stock
market, he is convinced it is worth a punt of Pounds 5,000 although he has
never bought a share before. His immediate boss, caught up by the
enthusiasm, puts in Pounds 5,000 as well.
When, six months later, the shares are trading at 70 per cent below their
launch price, young whizzo puts it down to experience. Not so his
45-year-old boss.
He has just received a letter saying the fees at his two sons' school are to
rise by 10 per cent. His wife has filed for divorce - and the chief
executive has summoned him for an interview. It is rumoured that the
Director of Human Resources will be there . . .
One investment, two investors. One disastrous investment, but only one
disaster-struck investor. The boss is in hot water. But things might have
been a shade cooler if he had first taken his own temperature as an
investor.
A self-examination along the following lines might have helped . . .
1. Excluding your home and pension plans, are your savings and investments
worth:
(a) Under Pounds 25,000.
(b) Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 75,000.
(c) Over Pounds 75,000.
2. Are you likely to be moving to a more expensive home:
(a) Within five years.
(b) Within 10 years.
(c) Not for at least 10 years, if at all.
3. What is most important when choosing investments?
(a) Safety.
(b) Diversification.
(c) Maximum returns.
4. When will you need to draw an income from your investments?
(a) Now or soon.
(b) In five to 10 years.
(c) Not for 10 years or more.
5. Which fits your attitude most closely?
(a) It is crucial to maintain the value of at least 90 per cent of my
investments.
(b) Capital growth is as important as capital preservation.
(c) Growth is the key to successful investing.
6. Do you have anyone depending financially on you:
(a) Now.
(b) Not yet, but I might.
(c) No - I am responsible solely for myself and likely to remain so.
7. A friend is leaving the UK to work abroad and is willing to sell you his
house at a bargain price. You are keen, but the maximum mortgage you can get
means you will have to raise an extra Pounds 10,000 yourself. Would you:
(a) Find it impossible to raise the cash, or get the money by selling all
your shares and unit trusts.
(b) Cash in some of your shares and unit trusts.
(c) Dip into your building society account.
8. Do you expect to retire:
(a) Within 10 years.
(b) In ten to 20 years.
(c) Not for 20 years or more.
9. Which cap fits you best?
(a) I can just about manage my rent or mortgage but do not have much spare
cash.
(b) I have a mortgage, am well covered with life insurance and belong to a
pension scheme - but have not built up substantial savings so far.
(c) My finances are pretty well shipshape. Income exceeds spending and I
have a reasonable spread of equity-based investments.
10. What is your approach to money?
(a) I enjoy spending it and it is something of an achievement if I keep my
credit card below its limit.
(b) I have limited savings and keep meaning to put some away in a Pep or
Tessa but can never quite afford it.
(c) I hope I will not ever run short: I think I have planned for most
contingencies.
11. The headlines report another big slide in share prices. If you owned
shares, would you:
(a) Ring up your broker and sell some.
(b) Do nothing except ring your broker to seek guidance and re-assurance.
(c) Ring your broker and place some buy orders.
12. Do you expect to need money to start up or expand your own business?
(a) Never.
(b) Possibly within the next five to 10 years.
(c) Not for at least 10 years.
13. Which statement best summarises your approach to managing your capital?
(a) The building society is the best home for spare cash because you know it
will not disappear down a black hole.
(b) The main reason to invest on the stock market is to maintain and improve
the real value of your spare capital.
(c) The stock market is attractive because it offers one of the few chances
to make some serious money.
14. Where do you stand?
(a) There is no point in hoarding too much money - you can't take it beyond
the grave.
(b) It would be nice to leave something to my friends, family or a charity.
(c) I have not worked hard all my life just to fritter away my assets. I
hope to be able to contribute to the long-term security of my children when
I die, or help out some dear friend, or leave my mark with a charitable
donation.
To calculate your score, see box.
HOW DID YOU SCORE?
Add scores for all odd-numbered questions to calculate your Risk Rating. Add
scores for even-numbered questions to get a Time Frame - how long you can
invest before you may need a cash lump sum or income. No points for each
(a), one for each (b) and two for each (c).
Risk Rating 0, Time Frame 0
This is the lowest possible score: you are a very cautious investor.
Furthermore, you are likely to need to spend all your money now or draw an
income in the not too distant future. Keep your spare cash on deposit or in
low-risk investments such as gilts.
Risk Rating 7, Time Frame 7
A medium Risk Rating means you can afford to put some of your money into
higher risk investments such as shares, though you may prefer to stick
mostly to blue chip UK companies. Caution is needed because you also have a
medium Time Frame - perhaps you will need investment income soon or have
specific lump sum spending plans. Some investments in lower risk bonds and a
good cash reserve are important.
Risk Rating 14, Time Frame 14
This is the highest possible score. It means that you are able to invest for
long-term growth. A large part of your portfolio should be in equities with
a good chunk in higher-risk areas, such as smaller companies and emerging
markets.
Risk Rating much higher than Time Frame
Either you have sufficient spare capital to take some risk on the
stockmarket or the temperament to take a bigger risk. But you should see how
this fits in with your Time Frame. If you have insufficient funds on deposit
to meet emergencies or if you know that you will need funds in the near to
medium future, take care. You could come a cropper if you are forced to cash
in equity-based investments when prices are low. Keep some cash reserves and
consider bond investments such as gilts.
Risk Rating lower than Time Frame
Perhaps you have not built up sufficient reserves to consider
higher-risk/higher growth investments - but try not to leave it too long
before you get a balanced portfolio. Or you could be the classic
over-cautious investor. Perhaps you keep bundles of tenners under your
mattress? Get a proper investment strategy - and don't be too afraid of
shares and unit trusts.
This is not a scientifically designed questionnaire,
but it may help clarify your priorities and what investment risk means in
your case. Then the question arises as to whether you have a properly
balanced portfolio. Does the way you have allocated money across three broad
investment areas - cash deposits, bonds/gilts and equities - fit with your
needs and temperament?

FT  19 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Ice-cream that binds the family -
Clive Fewins visits a Cornish dairy farm where the children strayed but have
come home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a bitter November evening and the westerlies are howling across the
Lizard Peninsula from the Atlantic. In the warmth of their old stone
farmhouse the Roskilly family's thoughts are turned to summer.
Halva - the Greek sesame seed-based confection - is the subject of the
conversation. Would it make a good ice-cream flavour? Rachel Roskilly thinks
it would. Together with sons Jacob, 31, Toby, 25, and daughter Bryn, 29, she
had been experimenting with halva, honey, nuts and their own milk and cream
for much of the day.
'It's a bit way out but its worth a shot next summer,' pronounces Roskilly,
59. No-one disagrees. Next summer halva ice-cream will be added to the 33
flavours that the family produces.
Father Joe Roskilly, 63, sits at the end of the table in his farmer's
overalls. He is silent, but under his shock of grizzled grey hair he is
attentive.
The cows that are the base of the family business are his main activity.
There are 90 prime milkers. A further 60 calves, yearlings and heifers
complete the herd.
He has been producing milk on the farm, 10 miles from Britain's most
southerly point, since he came there to work for his god-mother Esme
Bulkeley at 17. When she retired in 1959 she gave Joe the 40-acre farm.
Joe married Rachel in 1960. He has added 90 acres to the farm but not
strayed far from the Lizard. 'This year I have not been out of Cornwall.
There has just been too much to do,' he said. 'Rachel and I last had a
holiday when Toby was four.'
Hard work and money have not always gone hand in hand at Tregellast Barton
farm. Ten years ago Rachel and Joe were turning over barely Pounds 50,000 -
less than a fifth of what they turn over now.
'Although we had been making clotted cream since we married and doing
holiday lets in the outbuildings for 32 years, we realised that if the farm
was ever to support three grown-up children plus their possible families we
had to make it a lot more profitable,' Joe said.
They looked at ways of making more money from their milk, and also from
their Jersey cream, which had a good local reputation. Ice cream seemed the
best prospect.
'We ruled out ice cream in 1984 because small-scale equipment was not
available at the right price,' Joe said. 'But three years later, when we
were looking for a small pasteuriser with which to make whipping cream, we
realised that things had changed.
'Rachel and I invested Pounds 5,000 in a pasteuriser and a deep freeze,
convinced that making ice cream would help retain the childrens' interest in
the farm.'
At that time Jacob was back on the farm, having been to agricultural
college, Toby was doing his A-levels, and Bryn was an art student in London.
Jacob, whom the others regard as their 'business brain', was seized by the
opportunity to sell what he saw as a profitable by-product of the milk.
Rachel, who provides huge breakfasts and lunches for the family, three
full-time and many part-time helpers, relished the prospect of developing a
variety of unusual natural flavours.
Producing and naming such delights as Crabbers Nip, Hokey Pokey, Lovers
Delight, and the Bees Knees appealed to the whole family.
Two years ago Bryn, who had gained an MA at the Royal College of Art, was
tempted back to the farm by the prospect of her own stained glass studio.
Toby returned this year from a furniture-making course in High Wycombe to
set up a workshop.
Jacob's responsibilities include the family's ice cream shop in Falmouth,
plus all the production and distribution to shops, hotels and other outlets
all over Cornwall.
Last summer (1994) the family opened The Croust House, a 50-seater
restaurant serving coffee, cream teas, salads and other light lunches, as
well as all the ice creams and Rachel's home-made bread, scones, cakes and
jams. It also sells clotted cream, the Roskilly's fudges, mustards, chutneys
and furniture polish based on the wax provided by Rachel's bees as does the
farm shop at the other end of the yard.
'The Croust House is very labour-intensive and it is too early to say how it
is doing financially,' Joe said. 'But the conversion cost us very little as
we did most of the work of converting the former calf pens ourselves.'
Toby, who plans to run the Croust House as part of his furniture making
business, made all the tables and chairs, while Bryn made the startling
stained glass windows.
'Developing the Croust House has been possible only because two years ago we
invested Pounds 80,000 in a completely new computerised dairy unit, which
freed a lot of our traditional buildings for other uses,' Joe said. 'To do
the work we needed no additional loan to supplement our Pounds 24,000
working overdraft. We realised the new unit would free buildings so that the
family could return here to pursue their own interests if they wished. That
in turn was only possible because of our decision seven years ago to go into
ice cream in a relatively big way.'
The next project is a showroom for Toby's furniture in the former bullpen.
Again members of the family are doing most of the work.
'By the time that project is complete we shall have completed the picture as
I see it,' Joe said. 'But we could not have done it and be making the
profits we achieve without that crucial decision seven years ago to go into
ice cream. Together with the associated food lines it accounts for more than
50 per cent of our total current turnover of nearly Pounds 300,000.
'Although the dairy herd is the key to everything we do, I have always felt
that diversification makes farming more interesting and more fun than it
used to be. The younger generation can get bored by the routine of farming.
Diversification can help retain their interest when otherwise they might
have been tempted away from the countryside.' JB and GR Roskilly, Tregellast
Barton, St Keverne, Helston, Cornwall TR12 6NX. Tel: 0326 280479.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Over or under to France? - Stuart Marshall
takes his car on Le Shuttle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next time, will you take your car over or under to France? It all depends
whether you regard the actual crossing as a pleasure to be enjoyed or an
ordeal to be avoided.
Having at last made a trip with a car through the Channel Tunnel on Le
Shuttle, I can vouch for its speed. The 34 minutes it took from drawing out
of the English terminal near Folkestone to pulling up at the French one at
Sangatte, near Calais, beats even the noisy and uncomfortable Hovercraft.
The fact that the brightly lit, double-deck car-carrying wagon is rushing
along under 100 metres or so of water can be forgotten. Reality is
suspended. The train is so quiet and smooth riding at up to 100 mph (160
kph) one is hardly aware that it is moving.
Will the forecast of just one hour between leaving the M20 motorway and
joining the A26 autoroute be achieved by the average car driver? I reserve
judgment.
Four trains per hour are promised at peak travel periods. A one-hour
crossing will clearly be possible for motorists who drive into the terminal
just in time to catch the next train. But not if they just miss it. And most
certainly not if they arrive to find queues of cars waiting to cross.
Conceivably, they might have to wait up to an hour to drive on board.
Upper and lower decks are loaded simultaneously. The first cars have to
drive the full length of the train - well over 300 metres - but will, of
course, be first off. The day I went, disembarking was a much slicker
operation than loading. I would not like to find myself at the back of the
train, parked behind a car that would not restart after the crossing.
During the journey you sit in your car, with windows and sun roof open, to
catch frequent announcements in French and English. You can also hear them
on your car radio. Apart from walking up and down the carriage, the only
diversion is a visit to the lavatory - if you can find one. They appear not
to be signposted.
After walking through so many power-operated airlock doors between the
carriages that I lost count, and down the forward loading ramp, I found one
up a spiral staircase. A notice in French said it was under repair.
Eurotunnel is a fantastic engineering achievement. The terminals -
especially the colossal one on the French side - are like modern airports.
Will Le Shuttle - the vehicle-carrying train - be a commercial success?
Provided it is priced to be competitive with the ferries, I can see it being
a hit with motorists who live within 100 miles or so of Folkestone, are
short of time, hate sea travel and bring their own sandwiches and coffee.
Unless you suffer from acute claustrophobia, it must be a highly attractive
alternative to the Hovercraft.
Travellers from further afield may find little point in using Le Shuttle.
For them, the 75-90 minute Dover-Calais voyage by P &amp; O or Stena Sealink
superferry is the equivalent of a stop at a motorway service area. They can
have a proper meal, buy their duty frees, have a nap or stretch their legs
while they cross. Yes, of course, the actual crossing takes far longer than
it does by Le Shuttle. But the time passengers save by not having to stop
for a meal, buy their duty frees and so on will erode - even wipe out - the
train's main advantage.
The Dover-Calais ferries have so improved check-in procedures that they
offer what are almost 'turn up and sail' crossings outside summer peak
times. When the Monopolies and Mergers Commission allows P &amp; O and Stena
Sealink to pool their services - as it surely must next time they apply -
the situation will improve further.
Motorists heading for Brittany, the Atlantic coast of France and northern
Spain can spoil themselves by using my favourite, Brittany Ferries. A
nine-hour day crossing from St Malo to Portsmouth a few weeks ago was more
like a short cruise than a ferry trip. This immaculate and stylish ship has
a shopping arcade, a hairdressing salon, a children's playground and a
good-quality restaurant.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Market buoyed ahead of the Fed -
London / Buy-backs boost sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anticipation can prove more pleasurable than the real thing, and so it
proved with this week's long-awaited rise in US interest rates. Having
decided that a further tightening by the Federal Reserve would prove
beneficial to bond and share prices, London equity traders appeared to get
most of their celebrations in ahead of the event.
The FT-SE 100 gained 19.4 points on Monday and a further 40.1 points by
Tuesday's close, when the City still did not know by how much the American
rates would rise. News that the US authorities had gone for a
higher-than-expected increase of three-quarters of a percentage point kept
the market moving ahead on Wednesday, but profit-taking set in and the FT-SE
ended the week at 3131, up 55.1 points.
London's buoyancy was not just due to growing confidence that the Fed would
act. The equity market also benefited from a clutch of strong corporate
results and optimistic economic indicators which suggested that the UK is
continuing to enjoy strong economic growth, combined with low inflation.
Boots, the retailer, drew plaudits on Monday for deciding to sell its
prescription drugs business for about Pounds 850m to BASF, the German
chemicals and drugs group. The company had long been thought too small to
compete in the drugs industry, and analysts welcomed its decision to
concentrate on retailing.
Boots became even more popular the next day when it spent Pounds 508m buying
back 10 per cent of its shares on the stock market. This will boost earnings
per share, and helped alleviate any concerns that the company would do
something rash with the proceeds of its pharmaceutical disposal.
One should not get carried away with enthusiasm, however. In common with
other retailers, Boots is facing a very demanding market.
Although official figures said retail sales last month were slightly higher
than last year, the rate of growth has slowed and price competition remains
intense. Retailers are expecting a tough Christmas, with bargain-conscious
consumers spending carefully.
Another fillip to market sentiment came when PowerGen, the privatised
electricity generation company, raised its interim dividend by a whopping 27
per cent. PowerGen, which bought back 0.6 per cent of its shares earlier
this year, said it was considering further buy-backs but was keeping its
options open.
The government is due to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in both
PowerGen and National Power, the other listed generating company. National
Power said it would spend more than Pounds 500m on buying back 8 per cent of
its shares through the government offer.
A buy-back might not help the cause of wider share ownership, but it will
enhance earnings per share - and thus generate more cash for the Treasury by
increasing the value of its stake.
Another company to benefit from recovery was British Steel, which quadrupled
its interim dividend after seeing pre-tax profits bounce from Pounds 27m to
Pounds 159m. The group said second-half prospects were encouraging, with
steel demand in the UK and continental Europe expected to grow by about 5
per cent this year.
Most of the week's economic indicators were encouraging, with news of better
than expected figures for UK inflation, unemployment and public sector
finances. This must have been music to the ears of Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, as he puts the finishing touches to his November 29 Budget.
Clarke sought to calm concern that the US interest rate rise would lead to
an immediate increase in UK base rates, saying on Wednesday that 'at the
moment, we have things well under control'. But the odds on another
tightening of UK borrowing costs shortened again with yesterday's news that
the British economy is now growing at its fastest rate for six years.
One area of the economy that appears impervious to recovery is housing. A
survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the housing
market remained stuck in the doldrums, with home-owners keeping properties
off the market 'in a seemingly futile wait for meaningful house prices'.
The survey of more than 100 estate agents said less than 5 per cent of
agents in England and Wales reported price increases in the three months to
October.
Such gloom would not have surprised Roger Bootle, chief economist with HSBC,
who this week published a 70-page study arguing that we could be seeing the
end of the inflationary era. He believes the sustained moderate inflation in
the post-war world was due to several structural changes - such as increased
unionisation, industrial concentration and state ownership.
But many of the factors which produced the persistent inflation had gone
into reverse. He suggests the western world is approaching a new period of
prolonged low inflation.
A contrary view came from Bill Martin, economist with UBS, who says the
chancellor's plans for a steady economic recovery could be quickly
undermined. He says: 'Retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest)
is expected to breach the prescribed 4 per cent ceiling in the second half
of 1995, accompanied by a crisis jump to 10 per cent base rates as the pound
flounders.'
Is the UK economy really heading for a sustained period of low-inflationary
growth, or will lack of capacity in the economy lead to over-heating and a
traditional exchange rate crisis? The next week is bound to be full of
pre-Budget speculation. But the outcome of this more fundamental debate will
matter much more for UK equities than the exact timing of any interest rate
rise - here or in the US.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): There's reason for cautious
optimism - Gilts / Graham Bowley finds that good news on the economic front
has reinforced hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners of UK government bonds, or gilts, may well be wondering where the
next blow will come from after the rise in US short-term interest rates this
week. The increase, the sixth this year, was the latest attempt to dampen
future inflation in the world's largest economy, which is continuing to grow
strongly.
The first, in February, was a watershed, sending shock waves through the
world's financial capitals and leading to a bear market that has given bond
investors in all countries a painful lesson in how global the capital
markets have become.
Bond prices tumbled world-wide on fears that economic recovery in the US and
Europe would be inflationary and lead to sharply higher interest rates
around the world. The price of 10-year gilts fell by more than 19 per cent
from their highs in January, and yields rose by almost 3 percentage points
to a peak of around 9 per cent in September.
The UK gilts market was hit particularly badly, partly because the country's
economic recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow-Europeans and
partly because of the British authorities' poor track record in controlling
inflation.
The large size of the UK government budget deficit, and the enormous amount
of new gilt issues that this implied, also weighed heavily on investors.
Almost 10 months later, however, and the fears about inflation and higher
interest rates have yet to materialise. British base rates have edged
upwards, from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent, but this was received
generally as a well-timed move to head off future inflation. What is more,
the UK's 'economic fundamentals' are looking increasingly favourable for
gilts.
Economic data published this week reinforce the fact that inflation, at a
27-year low, remains subdued and that Britain's finances appear a lot
healthier than those of other European countries. It was for this reason
that gilts rallied this week despite the rise in US rates.
Many City analysts and fund managers believe, however, that this cannot
continue for much longer. 'Gilts have now gone a long way against the US
market and it is becoming very tight,' said Edmond Warner, head of strategy
and economics at investment bank Kleinwort Benson.
'That puts a big external constraint on gilts. It is becoming increasingly
difficult to ignore the US.'
Warner pointed out that the latest rise in US interest rates narrowed the
gap between the US and UK to a quarter point, the smallest margin for more
than six years. He thinks this now puts pressure on the chancellor of the
exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, to raise UK interest rates as early as Budget day
on November 29 rather than risk damaging the government's anti-inflation
credentials.
As ever, however, opinion is divided and some fund managers have a more
optimistic view of the direction gilts will now follow.
In particular, many believe Clarke will use his Budget to reaffirm his
commitment to a strong stance on public spending, which could see gilts
rally significantly.
David Kauders, a portfolio manager based in the west of England, with about
Pounds 22m under management for private clients, expects the bull market to
resume within the next six months as investors realise that inflation and
interest rates are set to remain low.
Many managers point to the extremely attractive returns gilts can offer the
long-term investor.
'Gilts offering a yield of close to 9 per cent should play a part in any
balanced portfolio,' said Tim Knowles, director of Fleming Investment
Management.
'There are good, solid reasons for being optimistic about gilts,' he added.
'The problem is that the shock to confidence this year has been so great
that it could take some time for this to be reflected in prices.'
Others echo this caution. 'Although we do not think inflation is about to
take off, we are holding off on gilts until after the next interest rate
rise, which we think will come soon,' said James Higgins, of financial
adviser Chamberlain De Broe.
Given the unpredictability of the gilt market this year, and the many
uncertainties that lie ahead, the wise investor could be the one who errs on
the side of caution.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Anyone for a nervous breakdown? -
Wall Street / After this week's events, Patrick Harverson finds that
something soothing is needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Gallagher, the head of trading at New York broking firm Oppenheimer,
puts it succinctly: 'It's absolutely crazy. This market needs some Prozac.'
As an assessment of Tuesday's events on Wall Street, this was not an
especially helpful comment. But as a vivid description of stock market
sentiment, it hit the nail firmly on the head.
Judging by the response of share prices to the latest interest rate increase
by the Federal Reserve, the market does indeed seem close to a nervous
breakdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 20 points immediately after the rise
was announced, then fell 40 before ending the session flat, only to jump
almost 19 the day after but fall 16 the day after that. A prescription to
calm everyone's nerves might not be such a bad idea at that.
This was certainly the kind of week designed to test nerves to the limit.
Trading on Monday was dominated by the expectation that the Fed would
announce a tightening of monetary policy after the Tuesday meeting of its
open market committee.
The solid gains in share prices on Monday reflected confidence that the rate
rise would be well-received by the bond market and would probably be the
last increase for at least this year, if not longer.
Tuesday dawned sunny and bright but investors' confident mood did not last
long because, when the Fed announced its rate increase early in the
afternoon, it managed to catch the market on the wrong foot.
It announced a larger-than-expected three-quarters of a percentage point
increase in two key short-term interest rates: the federal funds rate and
the discount rate, which moved from 4 3/4 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent and 4
per cent to 4 3/4 per cent, respectively.
The initial reaction from both stock and bond market was positive; the Fed
was seen to be taking tough pre-emptive action against inflation, and that
was good news. But it was not long before doubts began to set in.
Had the Fed moved too aggressively? Would the largest increase in the
discount rate since 1981, coming on the heels of five earlier rate
increases, slow down the economy too much? And was this really likely to be
the last tightening for some time?
The former question haunted the stock market which knows that, at some stage
in the next 12 months, the string of rate increases this year will begin to
take their toll on economic activity and corporate earnings.
Amid a deteriorating interest rate environment, the only support propping up
share prices this year has been earnings growth. Remove that earnings growth
from the picture and the market suddenly looks exposed.
The latter question troubled investors in bonds, who know that the severe
bear market in government securities will not end until the cycle of Fed
tightenings has peaked.
Few investors will want to buy bonds if they believe that more rate
increases are on the horizon - and the Fed conspicuously declined this week
to comment on the outlook for monetary policy.
(By contrast, when the Fed last raised rates in August, it hinted that its
policy was approaching a neutral position that would preclude the need for
further tightening. The subsequent unexpected strengthening of the economy
quickly made that judgment redundant and, ultimately, prompted this week's
move).
Although the mood on Wall Street had calmed down by Wednesday, aided by some
encouraging news on inflation (consumer prices up just 0.1 per cent in
October), Thursday's declines proved that the stock market remained
vulnerable. They also showed that stocks are still hitched to a bond market
bandwagon which continues to roll down the hill.
The rosy scenario being discussed before the Fed tightened this week was
that a sixth and final rate increase would finally bring peace to the
beleaguered bond market, ushering in a new era of stable bond prices.
This would allow a much-needed decoupling of stocks and bonds, leaving share
prices free to pursue their own course. There was even talk of a year-end
stock market rally that would return the Dow to the highs it enjoyed earlier
in the year.
The roses, however, suddenly do not smell quite so good. The bond market -
fearful that the Fed will raise interest rates again soon, possibly before
or at its next open market committee meeting on January 31 - shows no sign
of breaking out of its slump and share prices are unlikely to go anywhere
while bonds remain depressed.
The Dow now seems trapped in the 3,800 to 3,900 range where it has been
trading since mid-August - a depressing prospect for those who thought,
optimistically, that this week would herald the dawn of a new phase for the
stock market.
Gallagher was right: break out the Prozac.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Open season for speculators - In
the Pink / The outlook for commodities in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEC GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alec Gordon is commodities and energy editor of the Economist Intelligence
Unit
If 1994 was the year commodity markets woke up, then 1995 could be the Big
Breakfast - at least for speculators.
The attraction of markets in physical commodities, as distinct from markets
in bonds and other financial commodities, is that they move in cycles. Boom
follows bust and shortage glut in predictable, and therefore profitable,
succession. That's the theory, at least.
For most of the more important commodities in 1994, demand at last caught up
with supply. In some, such as natural rubber, the market had become so
depressed that productive capacity had been lost. The impact upon prices of
revived demand, when it came, was dramatic. In others, such as aluminium and
other base metals, the picture was obscured by exceptional flows of metal
from the former Soviet bloc.
The year 1995 will be one in which both supply and demand for most major
commodities will be rising. In most commodities, demand will be winning and
prices, although rising, will become more volatile.
This will be good news for speculators but bad for producers and consumers,
for whom volatility turns the serious business of commodity production and
consumption into something of a gamble.
Two factors will combine to destabilise markets. As prices revive, support
for price-stabilising commodity pacts on the part of producers will fade.
Of the old-style inter-governmental agreements, the International Natural
Rubber Agreement looks like being the only one to survive into 1995 with its
economic provisions intact. In short, the effects of government attempts to
dampen price movements will dwindle.
At the same time, attempts by the US General Accounting Office and other
government agencies to restrict and regulate the activities of so-called
hedge funds, which benefit from commodity price volatility, will fail.
This is because the funds are too protean, too big and too much part of
wider money-management operations to be readily controllable, however much
regulators across the world might want to try.
The funds operate through futures markets, which exist to provide insurance
against risk in commodity transactions arising from price volatility (as
well as a forum for speculation).
But do futures markets themselves cause volatility? An analysis of what
drives commodity prices suggests they do.
Conventionally, commodity prices are thought to be driven, at least in the
long run, by 'fundamentals' of supply and demand. There are other
fundamentals, such as lead times (longer for tree crops and mining, shorter
for annual crops) and substitution possibilities (high for fibres, vegoils
and natural rubber, low for beverage commodities).
This the market at its macro level, taking no account of the impact of
sentiment on prices and missing an important part of the picture. At the
micro level the dynamics are as different in commodity markets as they are
in physics.
Here, the long run ceases to exist and is replaced by the day to day. At
this level, commodity prices are not made by supply and demand. Instead,
they are made by traders responding to what they believe supply and demand
to be.
Even this is not quite right: from day to day, commodity prices are made by
traders responding to what they believe other traders believe supply and
demand will be at some point in the future.
So, sentiment or belief is what actually makes prices, not the abstractions
of supply and demand - real though these are. And, to a commodity trader,
volatility represents an opportunity as well as a risk.
Indeed, futures markets need volatility: with no price risk to insure
against, there can be no profitable insurance. The London futures market in
natural rubber died a few years ago for lack of business when prices were
stable.
Futures markets also need speculators, since it is they who provide the
liquidity essential to running the market (in a sense, they are the market).
Although speculators find it important to keep within the consensus, it is
equally important to trade as close as possible to the margin of that
consensus: to jump on - and off - bandwagons first. It is this need,
expressed collectively and backed by massive financial resources, which
swings prices.
The potential gap between market sentiment and fundamentals, between belief
(at the micro level) and 'reality' (at the macro level), varies inversely
with time.
Over the short term, where the gap is at its widest - and where a lot of
money is made and lost in futures markets - sentiment and market behaviour
are all-important. Here lies the opportunity for computers, and for rocket
scientists.
Computers are good at pattern recognition. They are already almost
unbeatable at chess and getting better all the time, and their use in
program trading has grown enormously. In fact, that growth prompts a
cybernetic prediction: as the patterns recognised become more incestuous,
program trading will itself become riskier.
Meanwhile, in the real world, the business of buying and selling actual
bales of cotton and bags of coffee will continue. This is the market
addressed by the Economist Intelligence Unit's world commodity forecasts
(WCF).
The WCF is aimed mainly at those involved directly in the production and use
of commodities, and at the medium and longer term. Because of this, it
misses much of the day-to-day change in sentiment; but it does aim to pick
up longer-term shifts in the balance of supply and demand.
Commodities in chronically short supply through much of 1995 are likely to
be coffee, most of the base metals, and natural rubber.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The last warriors, betrayed defeated, dispossessed: George
Monbiot investigates the destruction of the Maasai, their society and the
land they roamed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE MONBIOT

<TEXT>
Samson was tottering. As a senior elder, he was one of the men responsible
for blessing the community, and the more honey beer he drank, the stronger
his blessing was deemed to be. He had observed his duty with diligence.
Gaunt as a scarecrow, with mad red eyes, he staggered into my hut, demanded
for the third time that day to know who I was, announced that he was a
polygamist and a blaspheming heathen and collapsed on to my bed. A few
minutes later he sat up.
'This is the end for us and the end for everyone. The Maasai are finished.'
He fell back and immediately began to snore.
Samson was right on all counts. He is both a polygamist and a blaspheming
heathen and, as such, is the last in his line. The ceremony over which he
had just presided had, in effect, brought his own community to an end.
Throughout Maasailand, traditional life is ending so swiftly that, some
researchers claim, Africa's most famous surviving nomads will be reduced to
little more than tourist dancers within the next two years. The Maasai, who
once made their living by driving their cattle great distances across the
savannahs, are suffering a land privatisation so flawed and so fraudulent
that it has brought most of their 400,000 people to the brink of
destitution.
Their catastrophe began, as most African catastrophes begin, with good
intentions. Running down lions and killing them with spears, fighting other
tribes and other sections of their own tribe, stealing cattle and wives,
refusing to till the ground, the Maasai, who had overrun half of what is now
Kenya, were regarded by the first British officials as the antithesis of all
they sought to implant.
The administrators believed that east Africa would not become a God-fearing
and productive land until the Maasai were settled. At the beginning of this
century they confined them to just 10 per cent of the savannahs they once
occupied, then set to work to change the way they lived. To the Maasai, the
land was not theirs but God's. Elders would claim rights to use certain
places, but there was no outright ownership. The British saw this as a
prescription for disaster. They argued that if no-one owned the land,
everyone would exploit it as heavily as he could. Only by making every
herder responsible for his own patch could they prevent it from being
destroyed.
The British left Kenya before they managed to settle the Maasai. But, though
the tribe was no longer a threat to other peoples, the independent Kenyan
government upheld the policy, reasoning that nomadism was primitive and
unproductive. Recognising that the Maasai would not accept the outright
privatisation of their lands it started, in 1968, with an intermediate
stage, putting every community in charge of what it called a group ranch. A
small committee of elders was selected to manage each one.
Wherever external appointments have been imposed on self-governing people,
the newly powerful exploit their own communities, and the group ranch
committees were not slow to discover that they could do just as they wished.
They started to grab the best land for themselves, excluding the rest of the
Maasai.
Soon the ordinary people realised that if they too did not seize some land,
the greedy committee members would take the lot. The chaotic and inequitable
division of the savannahs that began in this way is now approaching
completion.
It is destroying everything that distinguished the Maasai as a people.
Over the last two years I have watched Samson's community falling apart. In
Enkaroni, close to the Kenyan border with Tanzania, I followed the passing
out ceremonies of the last warriors ever to be initiated. After six months
of festivities, they were dancing in a huddle of red ochre and beads when
Samson sent a man running towards them, carrying the horn of a kudu
antelope. He brought it to his mouth and blew four loud blasts.
Screaming, the warriors scattered. Four or five lost consciousness and lay
drumming their heels on the ground like the last spasms of the dead. They
had, one of them later told me, been overcome with grief and anger. The
sound, which traditionally brought their youth to an end, had also dissolved
the community, for warriors are the axis of Maasai life.
But the fury that all the young men felt was unfocused: they told me they
were not angry with anyone in particular, simply with the situation. This
was scarcely surprising, as the men who had sold them down the river were
some of the elders they had always been required to respect.
When the committee members had awarded themselves the best land, the other
people of Enkaroni had complained to the government. They were told that the
only option was to divide their ranch formally into inalienable private
farms.
But when, in 1987, the subdivision began, the villagers found that the
government recognised only the decisions of the committee members. Instead
of splitting the land equally, these people took even more for themselves.
One member bribed the others to let him have 4,000 acres; some ordinary
Maasai received as little as 10, and hundreds were left out altogether.
Travelling around Enkaroni, it is not hard to discover where the committee
members live. Red tiled ranch houses have sprung from the savannahs, with
new Land Cruisers or Mercedes parked beside them.
Traditionally the richest Maasai would distribute some of their wealth to
the poor, knowing that if, in this volatile environment, the tables were
turned, they could depend on the same generosity themselves. But these
Mercedes men, the wabenzias they are known in Kenya, no longer need the old
support networks, and feel they owe nothing to anyone. The rich people of
Enkaroni are becoming permanently rich and the poor permanently poor.
The division of the land has forced the Maasai to split into hitherto
unknown nuclear families. In a wind-stricken patch of thorn scrub Tepeney,
the mother of one of the warriors, complained that no-one came to visit her.
Before sub-division, people had arrived throughout the day, to exchange
news, take a cup of tea or ask for a loan. Now, she told me, it was every
family for itself, and she felt so lonely she sometimes believed she was the
last person left on earth. Yet she is among the more fortunate smallholders
for, seven years after the land was privatised, she still owns a dozen cows.
Nomadism evolved in east Africa because, during the dry seasons, the
customary pastures shrivel up, and the animals can only survive by migrating
to wetter places. Trapped on one plot, the cattle on many of the private
farms of Enkaroni died soon after the rains moved on. Their owners had to
sell up and look for work.
They were woefully unprepared. Most were illiterate and spoke only Maasai.
The wabenzi needed little labour, so the dispossessed moved to the towns.
In Kajiado, a small town 15 miles from Enkaroni, I found a handful of Maasai
who had used the money from the sale of their land to buy small businesses,
and hundreds who had no idea what to do with it. Every bar was filled with
men in red cloaks, with hoarse voices and shining eyes. Young men, deprived
of their role as guardians of the livestock, wandered the streets at night,
mugging people and breaking into shops. Government ministers sent lorries,
ferrying them to political rallies to beat up their opponents.
When their money runs out, many of the Maasai of Kajiado move north, seeking
work in Nairobi. They sink into slums like Kibera, where as many people live
in two square miles as in all of Maasailand, and one in 40 has a formal job.
Looking back over the history of the Maasai, it appears that the British
administrators misunderstood how they used their land. The lack of outright
ownership did not mean that the savannahs were uncontrolled. Every group of
elders regulated the areas they grazed: they decided who should be allowed
in and for how long. If people abused the land they were punished, for the
elders knew that anyone overexploiting it was exploiting them. Widespread
destruction began only when the Maasai were settled.
That there will never be sufficient employment even for those already living
in the cities is now axiomatic in Kenya. As the approaching completion of
privatisation coincides with a population boom, the effects of destitution
will be catastrophic. In 1994, for the first time in 30 years, Maasai
herders starved to death in southern Kenya. Yet, as the Maasai wobble, the
government continues to shove. In a quiet grove of fever trees beneath the
Ngong Hills, I began to find out why.
I met 'Amos' crouching between two trees. He told me he did not know whom he
had offended, but every time he showed his face he was arrested on public
order charges. He was one of 2,700 people in the community of Loodariak who
had been left off the registry when the land was divided. Their places had
been taken by 200 outsiders, registered as members of the community even
though many of them had never set foot there.
The people of Loodariak had petitioned officials at every level of
government, even waiting outside state house to waylay the president, but no
one would listen. They pooled all their money and hired a lawyer, but the
high court refused to hear their case. Now, Amos told me, they were left
with just one option.
'Let these people come. Let them come and say 'this is our land.' We are
ready for them. We are going to kill people here.'
Failure of the authorities even to acknowledge what was happening began to
make sense when, with the help of certain inducements, I was able to extract
the lands registry from a dusty office in Kajiado.
Among the new owners of Loodariak's territory I found the associates of some
of Kenya's most powerful people, including the maiden name of the wife of
the Minister of Land, Darius Mbela.
Mysterious manifestations of his wife's name had already caused problems for
Mbela. In 1991 he had almost been forced to resign when it was found on the
neighbouring community's registry. Mbela had claimed that his wife bought
the land, but lawyers uncovered memoranda he had signed naming people he
wanted included on the list. I visited Mbela, now minister of water, in a
weather-stained block in Nairobi.
He answered my general questions about privatisation with affability, but
when I turned to the case of Loodariak he became strangely terse. He told me
that his ministry was not responsible for the allocations, that he knew
nothing about his wife's registration, and the situation of Loodariak was
sub-judice and he did not wish to discuss it.
In Loodariak the new owners appear to be waiting for the price of their land
to rise before selling it on, but in the Rift Valley in western Maasailand
they have set to work to make it pay. Here the rainfall is just sufficient,
in good years, to allow them to plant wheat. Beside the road from Nairobi to
Narok I watched a tractor towing a plough through the grass sward. The
savannah flowers, the many hundreds of grass species, rolled over to expose
clean slabs of earth. For 20 miles I saw neither a house nor a human being,
simply a sea of churned soil. Some of the wabenzi here had seized as much as
30,000 acres. The ordinary Maasai were each left with insufficient land to
graze one cow. They could do nothing with these plots but lease them for a
pittance to the people who had taken the rest.
The soils here are shallow and fragile. After three or four years the
farmers abandon them. Recovery, if it happens at all, will take 40 or 50
years. Scanning the bleak horizon, I wondered where all the people had gone.
The answer came sooner and louder than I could have guessed.
Driving into Narok I saw a crowd leaning over the bridge, staring across the
basin of the river. The houses below them appeared to have exploded. Cars
were tangled in the branches of the bankside trees. A tree trunk transfixed
two walls of a shop.
The storm the evening before had been no worse than many that fell on Narok,
but soon after it broke the people heard a rumble in the surrounding hills,
and a wall of filthy water roared into town. Everything in its path was
swept away. Thirty-two bodies were found hanging from the branches of the
trees or rammed into the riverbank.
The Maasai pushed out of their pastures by the wheat farms had nowhere to
turn to but land too steep for the tractors to plough. With their livestock
and the displaced wildlife they crowded into the hilltop forests, consuming
the vegetation and compacting the soil. The rain had flashed off the
indurated ground. It brought to the people of Narok a final roar of despair,
as the nomads reached the end of their migrations.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Can Tories deal themselves a fifth ace?: Britain's two main
parties are plotting the next hand of electoral poker. Perhaps they have
something up their sleeves . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a wise old Conservative owl remarked over dinner this week, four aces
will be played at the next general election. Two are held by Labour. We know
what they are without taking a peek. They have a popular leader, and most
voters have had more than enough of the Tories. The two other killer cards
are in John Major's hands. His government will cut taxes, and fly the
Euro-sceptical flag.
That concludes your weekend executive summary of the current condition of
British politics. It will need changing if Tony Blair loses his magnetism,
as wise-owl thought the Labour leader was beginning to do in the debate on
the Queen's speech on Wednesday. We will have to think again if the
Conservative coalition really does break up over Europe, as opposed to
merely threatening such a disaster. Apart from that no other aces can be
found in either hand. None. Zilch.
Mr Major may remain prime minister, but he is not likely to regain the full
measure of authority associated with the office. Grandstand plays such as
his threat to dissolve parliament if a particular European finance bill is
lost demonstrate weakness, not strength. One fine day Mr Blair may produce a
few policies, and thus become vulnerable to attack, but he has so far shown
no sign of hazarding anything quite so foolhardy. Like the prime minister,
he is busy doing nothing.
In short, the outcome of a contest that does not need to be held until the
late spring of 1997 is unpredictable. We can see no further than two Labour
aces against a pair of Tory aces. Hold on. Poker in any variation is rarely
less than a five-card game. What about the 'feelgood factor?' Surely that is
a high court card, a king indeed?
Possibly. If people are fat and happy, secure in their jobs and confident
that their economic circumstances will improve they might stick with the
government. Yes yes. If you believe that two more years of steady growth
combined with low inflation will turn this traditional indicator Tory-wards,
go ahead and factor it in to your calculations.
Before doing so, consider a rather different equation, the feelTory factor.
This is nothing to do with allegations of improper behaviour. It is more
serious than that. Let me explain. Those of us who inhabit the fringes of
politics sometimes find themselves in a roomful of Conservatives. On other
occasions everyone standing around is, if not socialist, at least a
non-Tory. The two experiences are distinct, unmistakably different. It is
not only a matter of clothes, accents, champagne, or commonplace
manifestations of wealth or lack of it, but of what is said, and the manner
of saying it.
Conservative chambers contain laughter, politically incorrect phrases that
can offend, hints of harshness and cruelty. Labour salons can be serious to
the point of dullness, marked by ethnically sensitive use of language,
expressive of concern for this or that unfortunate group, sometimes tinged
with collectivist menace. The Tories are usually more fun. The tribunes of
the people are often nicer.
Evidence published this week suggests that many voters feel culturally
comfortable among Tories, in spite of their apparent distaste for the
government. The numbers are to be found in the 11th British Social Attitudes
survey, published by Dartmouth on Thursday. This is a collation of answers
to annual questionnaires sent to a random sample of some 3,600 people. Many
of the results are unsurprising, indicating that voters want social services
(paid for by other people's taxes?), public transport (but cars for
themselves) and so on.
The chapter that grabbed my attention is about the 'authoritarian
personality,' a concept invented in Berkeley, California soon after the
second world war. We need not detain ourselves with the historical
implications of that. What concerns us today is the set of responses to the
1993 survey. These indicate a general bias against libertarianism and a
rejection of values associated with the 1970s left.
Asked whether schools should teach children to obey authority, 88 per cent
say yes. Censorship of films and magazines is supported by 65 per cent.
Homosexual relationships are disapproved of by 64 per cent. Capital
punishment is thought right by 65 per cent.
By boiling down the answers to all 15 relevant questions Daphne Arendt and
Ken Young, the authors of this chapter, create a neat index of hard-nosed
attitudes. They conclude that 40 per cent of respondents have a 'most'
authoritarian world-view, with 12 per cent 'least' and the rest in the
middle. This is an improvement on 1989, when 50 per cent were placed in the
'most' category. As you would guess, younger and better-educated people are
more liberal-minded than their older or less-schooled fellow-citizens.
The key correlation might also have been anticipated, but it is nevertheless
stunning. Of respondents who identify themselves with the Labour party, some
30 per cent are marked with a 'most authoritarian' outlook. The equivalent
figure for self-identified Conservatives is 52 per cent. Chew over that for
a moment. It is an uncannily good fit with the ambience at Conservative
party conferences. It is the measure of the feelTory factor.
I suspect that Mr Blair understands this concept. He has positioned himself,
and possibly his party, against laxity in schools and in favour of families
run by two parents, one of each sex. He is famously tough on crime. Has he
got it right? The Arendt-Young account suggests a softening of British
attitudes in several important areas, notably welfare benefits. Others who
favour traditional attitudes long for order and security. Some accept that
neither can be guaranteed.
The prime minister comprehends the feelTory factor, but he overdid it with
'back to basics'. There is time to get it right. The party that aligns
itself with the values of the 1990s will hold three aces.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: From small fiddles to big abuses - The puzzle
is that Spanish practices have survived the Big Bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old Spanish practices, they are called, although they are not always old and
certainly are not confined to Spain. In the financial markets,
corner-cutting and kickbacks can be found almost wherever there are
money-making relationships and a lack of transparency.
Are such practices seriously corrupt, or do they represent a necessary
oiling of the markets' wheels?
Two examples have been highlighted in London this week. The City's biggest
fund manager, Mercury Asset Management, has decided to abandon so-called
soft commissions - a payment device whereby part of the commission on share
trades is rebated to a fund manager in the form of services or benefits of
various kinds.
MAM says it is responding to market pressure to move towards 'clean' fees.
It is not the first manager to make such a declaration, but it is in a
minority.
Separately, the Office of Fair Trading has published a provocative paper by
Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School on the cosy system by
which UK rights issues have for many years been underwritten. The deals are
syndicated to numerous sub-underwriters - essentially, the medium to large
investment institutions - at prices which have consistently earned the
fortunate recipients juicy profits (described more neutrally by the
professor as 'excess returns').
Both of these practices hark back to the cosier days of the stock exchange
when share commissions were fixed and competition was less intense. Soft
commissions gained popularity in London mainly as a way around the fixed
commission scale, so that institutions could get extra value from the
business they did.
Hoare Govett's DataStream electronic information system and Wood Mackenzie's
performance measurement service for pension funds - both usually 'softed' in
those days - were examples of innovation by brokers.
Sub-underwriting commissions were altogether murkier at that time and,
essentially, helped to finance the marketing muscle of the big new-issue
brokers. Reliable fund managers - those who would accept the dud issues as
well as the winners - were rewarded with a regular stream of almost
risk-free underwriting commissions.
The puzzle is that such practices have largely survived London's Big Bang
eight years ago. Fixed commissions were swept away and the big global
investment banks moved in.
The trouble is that the winds of change were not always unpolluted. Soft
commissions, for instance, are rife in many markets around the world, not
least in the US where the Securities and Exchange Commission has been
surprisingly relaxed about them, although imposing various conditions.
Britain's own Securities and Investments Board has been reluctant to be
tougher than the SEC. Interestingly, institutions such as MAM appear to be
moving ahead of the regulators.
Not everything about soft commissions is bad. They enable small brokers to
compete against big ones and they provide a channel for innovative products
and independent research services. But fund managers are also tempted to
charge what ought to be their own expenses against the fund. The client, in
effect, pays twice - and could be trading shares at the wrong prices, too.
Although resistance to soft commissions is becoming apparent in pension fund
management, where the clients are professional (or at least receive
professional advice), there is little opposition in, say, retail unit trusts
where the turnover of portfolios is often much higher than can be justified
by the quest for investment performance. Do the managers have a vested
interest in such churning? Presumably they do, and soft commissions may be a
factor.
Meanwhile, Marsh's report has touched raw nerves in the City of London. Not
just merchant banks and brokers but also institutional investors have
protested - an indication that the private investor has been the real loser
from being left out of the cosy sub-underwriting ring.
Of course, private investors count for little in the UK, where they only own
about 20 per cent of company shares. They are much more important in the US,
where the institutions are much more numerous and diversified, too.
There, the emphasis is on syndicating securities through a vast distribution
network. It is fairer but also considerably more expensive, which is a
reason why British companies may have tolerated the sub-underwriting system
in London.
London's institutional investors, for their part, have clung on to the
sub-underwriting system not primarily because they are greedy but because
they have seen it as a way of protecting the principle of pre-emptive rights
of shareholders. This has largely gone by the board in the US, where the big
investment banks call the shots.
In the UK, however, existing shareholders normally still have first call on
new shares, and cannot be diluted by company treasurers selling new equity
at a discount through the voracious distribution chains of investment banks.
Pre-emption is certainly a principle worth defending. But the UK's
institutional investors should surely be prepared to bid competitively for
sub-underwriting contracts to show that big shareholders are not gaining an
unfair advantage over small ones. Then, they would be supporting two
principles at once.
Markets are full of grey areas. If you scratch my back, perhaps I should be
ready to scratch yours. Many people feel nostalgia for the old City markets
where relationships counted for a lot and electronic auto-execution systems
were unknown. But small fiddles have a capacity to grow into big abuses. And
the fact is that oil for the wheels can turn into grease for the palms.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Inside the pyramid game - The respectable
name is multi-level marketing and the bait is unlimited income. But Bethan
Hutton finds that dreams can be shattered all too easily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The function room in a smart Kensington hotel is full of well-dressed,
well-groomed people. The buzz of conversation dies down as the first speaker
steps to the front. 'You are looking for people who are looking for
something,' he says.
Each person in the audience is urged to think about who might be recruited.
Each is told to make a list of them - with at least 100 names on each list.
'Don't pre-judge anybody,' exhorts the speaker. 'Put them all down. Everyone
you can think of.'
It sounds like an an evangelical recruitment drive but the meeting was
actually organised by a large international organisation called Amway (an
abbreviation of the 'American way'). And, rather than being some hellfire
gospel church, the talk is of presenting business opportunities, not saving
souls.
Neither does the speaker have the American twang you might expect. His name
is Bris Bovill, he describes himself as a Warwickshire farmer, and his
accent has the cut-glass tones of the English upper-class.
Bovill and his wife, Kerry, joined Amway 3 1/2 years ago. They started
selling cleaning products, toiletries and make-up to family and friends,
taking a cut on the selling price while recruiting people to become Amway
distributors themselves.
With Amway's multi-level marketing system - also known as pyramid selling -
the real money comes not from selling many products but from the commission
you earn on sales made by people you recruit and those that they recruit,
right down a long line.
Now, Bris and Kerry have reached the highest level on the pyramid. They have
become 'diamond distributors', people whose incomes can be well into six
figures. They recruited about 30 people personally but there are hundreds
more 'down-line' from them.
A recent edition of Amway's company magazine, Amagram, celebrated the
Bovills' achievements with glossy photographs of their farm in Warwickshire
and elegant house full of antiques. But these are not the trappings of
success with Amway; they were paid for with much older money.
'I didn't have any material goals,' says Bris. 'I think I had everything I
wanted. But, without the business, I would still be sitting on my tractor,
probably. I would have convinced myself I didn't want to travel.' Now, the
farm work has been contracted out so that the Bovills can concentrate on
Amway.
Yet, their success is exceptional. While Amway has about 33,000 distributors
in the UK, only a dozen are in the highest-earning 'diamond' class. For
most, Amway provides a little extra cash - but not enough to live on.
The unemployed or genuinely hard-up tend not to do well in multi-level
marketing schemes like this, either. They are too obviously needy, lacking
the panache and self-confidence to inspire others to join.
Bovill's spiel at the Kensington hotel illustrates the kind of needs Amway
aims to fulfil. 'What would you do with an extra Pounds 100 a month?' he
asks. The suggestions come back: a night at a Park Lane hotel, a day out at
the races followed by dinner, scuba-diving lessons, a new camera . . .
What about Pounds 1,000 a month? More diving lessons, holidays, investments,
a bigger house. One woman wants a horse to take eventing. These are not
people trying to make ends meet; they want to fund the little luxuries in
life - or, indeed, the larger ones.
Amway people always keep their ears open for new recruits. They make a
mental note of casual complaints at dinner parties about the size of school
fees, or not being able to afford a skiing holiday.
Talking business on social occasions is discouraged, but leads are followed
up with a telephone call a day or two later. 'I heard what you said about
school fees the other day, and I have an idea that may be of interest to you
. . . '
Then, a meeting is arranged to demonstrate the Amway business plan - a
complicated series of flip-charts with diagrams showing how you can build up
a business paying Pounds 45,000 a year from an initial outlay of Pounds 70.
Amway's is by no means the only business plan being demonstrated in living
rooms across the country. Companies selling water filters, costume jewellery
and security equipment are among those using very similar techniques.
Becoming an Amway distributor seems to be a cross between becoming an Avon
lady, a born-again Christian and a member of the Rotary Club. But all sorts
of sensible, respectable people are doing it. Amagram is full of them:
smiling couples - teachers, housewives, antique dealers, management
consultants, dentists - who have achieved pearl or ruby distributor status.
Yet, behind the happy faces in the company magazine lurk some less
heart-warming stories. Friends of Amway converts say it can take over
people's lives like a cult. Some become so obsessed that they eat, sleep and
breathe nothing else. They spend every waking moment trying to recruit new
people or working on their business plans. Their savings disappear on
motivational books and tapes.
Hints that perhaps Amway is taking up too much of their lives are met with
hostility. A few put emotional pressure on friends and relatives to buy
products or sign up as a distributor, just to help them meet this month's
target. Eventually, exhaustion and repeated rejections tend to shatter the
dream.
'This is not a get-rich-quick scheme,' Bovill tells his audience. Everyone
at Amway repeats that message. But when, in the next breath, they mention
unlimited potential income, people earning so much that they pay Pounds
150,000 a year in tax, trips to five-star hotels in Cyprus for top
performers - it is, perhaps, hardly surprising that a few 'people who are
looking for something' take it all too seriously.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Cabinet faces row on 4.7% rise planned for ministers: Trade
union leaders attack pay increase above level of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday facing a fresh controversy after stating that
it would propose a 4.7 per cent increase in salaries for ministers next
year.
Amid clear indications that public sector workers face another squeeze on
pay in the financial year 1995-6, the government said it would propose the
increase in ministerial salaries to parliament next week to make up for an
earlier freeze.
The pay increase for ministers, which is 2.3 percentage points above the
current level of inflation, was immediately denounced as unfair by trade
union leaders, coming at a time of public sector restraint.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public sector union,
accused the government of 'sheer hypocrisy', adding: 'It is unfair that the
government should penalise 5m public sector workers with a permanent pay
freeze and not lead by example with their pay awards.'
Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, also said that the pay increase
would make the government's public sector pay bill freeze 'even more
unsustainable'.
However, the government defended the increase for ministers, saying that it
would help their salaries to catch up. It also claimed that ministers and
MPs would still be about Pounds 2,000 worse off than they would have been if
old links with the civil service pay scale had been maintained.
The pay rise should mean that, effective from January 1, 1995, a Cabinet
minister's salary will rise from Pounds 64,749 to Pounds 67,819  - an
increase of Pounds 3,070.
Mr John Major's salary as prime minister should rise from Pounds 78,292 to
Pounds 82,003, an increase of Pounds 3,711. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of
the Commons, will submit an order to parliament on Thursday about raising
the pay levels, which also increases the income of the Opposition leader and
Opposition whips in the Commons and Lords.
However, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said he would be rejecting the
pay rise in a free Commons vote next week.
A spokeswoman for his office said: 'Tony Blair will not accept the increase.
He feels it is wrong to take up the increase at a time when millions of
others are having no increase at all.'
The Opposition could decide to exploit the issue, which comes in the wake of
allegations of political sleaze and cash-for-questions, and a resignation
following failure to disclose financial interests.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Girolami defends Pounds 9m package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Paul Girolami yesterday defended a Pounds 9.37m two-year package of
salary, bonuses and pension contributions at his last annual meeting as
chairman of Glaxo.
Sir Paul, who retired yesterday after 14 years at the helm of the
pharmaceuticals company, was questioned by angry shareholders about his
remuneration. The payments include Pounds 6.44m in pension fund
contributions, of which Pounds 2.05m result from his retiring two years
early.
Sir Paul, 68, countered his critics by arguing that the figure was an
arbitrary calculation. 'This so-called package consists of apples and
oranges. It consists of salary over two years, but why not make it 10 or 20
years?
'It is not a package, and includes payments made to the pension fund and not
to me. My pension is determined by my contract.'
Since Sir Paul stepped into the chief executive's shoes in 1980, Glaxo's
market capitalisation has increased more than 40-fold from Pounds 429m to
Pounds 18.8bn.
He transformed the group from a diversified also-ran into Europe's largest
prescription drugs company. In the year he took over the reins, the company
posted pretax profits of just Pounds 66m. That compared with Pounds 1.84bn
last year.
The Pounds 9.37m is equivalent to 34 hours of global sales of Zantac, the
anti-ulcer drug which is the world's best-selling medicine. Sir Paul's
marketing prowess is widely credited with the product's huge success.
At yesterday's meeting, Sir Paul also faced uncomfortable questions on
Glaxo's Pounds 115m provision for losses on its bond portfolio in the year
to June 30. The company warned it would incur a further Pounds 16m loss this
year and has since liquidated its Pounds 1.7bn portfolio and reinvested the
funds in bank deposits and gilts.
'We made a series of bad judgments. We got into the wrong bonds at the wrong
time and we got into so-called derivatives without understanding what they
meant,' he said.
In a trading statement, Sir Paul confirmed Glaxo's sales growth had slowed
in the first four months of the year, with the weak dollar contributing to
the slowdown.
'However, I am pleased to tell you that our new generation of products
continues to make a strong contribution to the group's results,' he added.
Sir Paul, who worked at Glaxo for 29 years, is replaced by Sir Colin
Corness, chairman of the building group Redland and the Nationwide Building
Society.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK fears Nato split over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government fears the deepening rift between Europe and the US over
the war in Bosnia risks provoking the most damaging breach in Anglo-American
relations since the Suez crisis nearly 40 years ago.
British concern over the diplomatic rift came amid reports that Serb
aircraft yesterday bombarded Bihac, the UN-designated safe area in
northwestern Bosnia, ignoring warnings of Nato retaliation.
Last night, the UN Security Council condemned the attack 'in the strongest
possible terms'. It is expected today to give Nato fighters clearance to
chase offending Serb aircraft and bomb them, if necessary, at their base in
the Krajina region of Croatia.
Mr Willy Claes, the secretary-general of Nato, said he believed the Serbs
had used napalm and cluster bombs in the attack on Bihac, and said the time
had come 'to act and give clear signals to the Serbs that this has to be
stopped'.
In spite of public reassurances that the dispute, provoked by the US
decision to withdraw from enforcing the arms embargo on the former Yugoslav
republic, is containable, British ministers are concerned it presages a deep
split in the western alliance.
Unless the disagreement is patched up at a meeting early next month of the
five-nation contact group on Bosnia, the UK government believes it could do
irreparable damage to Nato.
US officials reacted strongly to the criticism, accusing the Europeans, and
especially the French, of playing electoral politics by talking of a
transatlantic rift. 'If that's the way they genuinely feel about it, then it
could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,' a senior official said.
At a Franco-British defence summit in Chartres yesterday, Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, said the US embargo decision 'should not be
over-dramatised'. However, Britain and France were concerned that the US
move might encourage a gradual unravelling of the embargo.
Washington's unilateral action is already seen as a damaging precedent,
undercutting the solidarity of Nato at a critical moment for the alliance.
France believes the 'unreliability' shown by the US over the embargo has
greatly strengthened its case for independent European defence arrangements.
Further overt US support for Bosnia's Moslem government could force Britain
and France to withdraw their troops from the UN peacekeeping force in the
former Yugoslav province.
Clinton administration officials countered that their allies had known for
months the US would have to pull out of enforcement of the embargo as a
consequence of a law passed by Congress requiring the administration to
press for an end to the order.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Insurance brokers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in UK insurance brokers have performed woefully this year, down 20
per cent against the market. Continuing troubles at Lloyd's are but one
factor depressing sentiment. Margins are under pressure from all sides. The
weak US currency hurts, as a large proportion of revenue originates outside
the UK and is denominated in dollars. The industry is also suffering tighter
fee structures.
Brokers have compounded these problems through diversification - none more
so than Willis Corroon, formed in 1980 when Willis Faber of the UK merged
with Corroon &amp; Black of the US. That folly was exposed earlier this year
when Willis announced disastrous US results. It took until this week,
however, for Willis' management to bite the bullet. Though details of the
planned retrenchment programme were regrettably not spelt out, the Pounds
40m provision will wipe out the bulk of pre-tax profits for the current
year.
But Willis plans a welcome return to basics. Once the restructuring is
complete, the previous attractions of insurance broking may again become
apparent. Capital employed is minimal and brokers have traditionally paid
out virtually all distributable profits to shareholders. This came to a halt
in 1992 when Sedgwick halved its dividend. But Willis' restructuring may
presage an eventual sector-wide return to this desirable practice. Brokers
are not on the verge of becoming growth stocks. But a higher distribution
would limit the downside to investing in this maturing industry.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Inntrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Grand Metropolitan, the refinancing of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL) is
good but not ideal. Good, because GrandMet is to be repaid a net Pounds 332m
as a result of the tidying-up exercise and is set to shed day-to-day
management responsibility for the 50 per cent-owned operation. Far from
ideal, because GrandMet is not making a complete withdrawal from the pubs
business. It still has Pounds 212m of equity tied up in IEL and may have to
wait for three or four years before it can extract itself fully - probably
by means of a flotation - from what is no longer a core business.
It is just possible that an exit route will present itself before then.
Courage, the brewer which owns the other 50 per cent of IEL, is widely
rumoured to be up for sale. The precise intentions of Foster's Brewing
Group, Courage's parent, remain inscrutable but the IEL refinancing is a
small pointer to a possible disposal. Courage's willingness, along with
GrandMet, to inject Pounds 28m of fresh equity into IEL looks strange in the
light of Foster's questionable commitment to the UK market: unless, that is,
the investment helps sort out IEL's finances to the point where the whole
operation would look more attractive to a buyer. Sentiment towards GrandMet,
whose shares have underperformed by nearly 10 per cent in the past six
months, would improve if it could remove the IEL millstone from around its
neck sooner rather than later.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The odds of another rise in UK interest rates before year-end to prevent the
economy overheating shortened yesterday. The government revised upwards GDP
growth for the second quarter to 1.3 per cent and reported growth in the
third quarter of 1.1 per cent. That indicates the economy has been expanding
at an annual rate of more than 4 per cent, compared with Treasury forecasts
at the beginning of the year of 2.5 per cent. The last time the economy
expanded that fast was in 1988.
Those arguing against an imminent interest rate rise point out that the UK
economy is presently only 3.2 per cent bigger than at its peak in 1990, so
there should still be plenty of capacity left. Besides, inflation remains
subdued. On Wednesday, the government reported underlying inflation for the
year to October at a 27-year low of 2 per cent. Although unemployment fell
sharply, underlying earnings growth remained unchanged at 3.75 per cent.
Nevertheless, the gap between actual and potential output is closing. One
worrying feature of the GDP figures was that investment fell slightly,
meaning new capacity is not being created at the rate it should be at this
stage in the economic cycle.
The markets yesterday took the GDP figures in their stride, suggesting they
are reconciled to an interest rate increase sooner or later. The exact
timing will depend on whether the Chancellor is willing to risk the ire of
retailers by putting rates up before Christmas.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BAe blows its trombone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has a new toy: a 'flexible trombone'. That is the name for
the rights issue the company unveiled yesterday as part of its improved bid
for VSEL. It is called a flexible trombone because BAe will be able to use
to it raise anything between Pounds 178m and Pounds 535m, with the exact
amount depending on the extent to which VSEL shareholders opt for cash or
BAe shares. Moreover, if BAe increased its offer again, it would be able to
do so without going back to its underwriters for approval - though it would
seek retrospective permission from shareholders.
BAe's management is clearly happy blowing its new trombone. It means it can
make as much noise as GEC can, despite its rival bidder's huge cash pile. If
GEC ups its bid, so can BAe. The trombone also means that, if BAe fails to
win VSEL, it can still pocket the first Pounds 178m. That will come in
handy, since BAe will soon need to restructure its loss-making turbo-prop
business.
Whether BAe shareholders should be happy is another matter. Yesterday's
improved offer is near the limit of what is sensible. Because BAe will be
able to set its tax losses against VSEL's profits, earnings per share will
be enhanced by about 10 per cent in the first year. But if the cost of
buying the trombone is taken into account, the earnings enhancement will be
virtually wiped out. Moreover, in subsequent years, acquiring VSEL would be
roughly earnings neutral: the tax advantages would be balanced by the fact
that VSEL is a wasting asset. Once the industrial benefits of a merger are
taken into account, the bid probably just about stacks up. But if BAe seeks
to use its trombone to make a bigger noise, shareholders should plug their
ears.

FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks follow bonds
downward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equity prices added to Thursday's losses yesterday as programme buying
led to a sharp drop before shares came off their low point late in the day,
writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.79 at 3,815.26, .
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also fell, down 2.10 at 461.47,
while the American Stock Exchange composite dipped 2.09 at 444.04. The
Nasdaq composite was down 1.17 at 764.67. Trading volume on the NYSE was
357m shares.
The 30-year Treasury bond, which had held flat early in the morning, fell
nearly Dollars  3/8 shortly after the opening of the stock market and then
bounced back a little, posting only modest declines by late afternoon. At
one point the stock market slid much deeper falling more than 40
points-before recovering a little by the end of the day.
Shares in major cyclical companies were mixed in spite of the weak market.
Allied Signal fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 32 7/8 , Caterpillar shed Dollars
 3/4 at Dollars 55 5/8 , and Dupont lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 55 1/4 .
International Paper increased Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 71 7/8 . Dow Chemical
fell Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 66 after the Wall Street Journal reported that
a former subsidiary of the chemical company had distributed silicone breast
implants in non-US markets. The disclosure could mean the Michigan-based
company might have to contribute to the settlement of a lawsuit filed by
women who said they were harmed by the implants.
Shares in aluminium companies got a boost from news that they would increase
prices charged to producers of aluminium cans. At the close Aluminum Company
of America, a component of the Dow, had risen Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 83 3/4
, and Alcan Aluminium was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 . Kaiser
Aluminum was unchanged at Dollars 11 1/2 .
News that Amgen had bid Dollars 9.25 a share for Synergen boosted Synergen's
shares Dollars 3 21/32 at Dollars 9 1/32 . Amgen shares, however, fell
Dollars  3/16 to Dollars 56 7/8 after the company said it expected the
acquisition to reduce its earnings.
Southwest Airlines rose Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 after announcing that
it had reached a 10-year accord with its pilots that puts off any wage
increase for at least five years. Other airline companies saw their shares
fall: AMR, the holding company for American Airlines fell Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 50 7/8 and UAL, United Airlines' holding company, was down Dollars 1
at Dollars 93 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto share prices recorded losses in the wake of news from Wall Street.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 29.31 points, or 0.71 per cent, to
4,114.53, with losers over winners 480 to 242.
Volume of 49.63m shares with a value of CDollars 582.4m were down from
Thursday's 57.74m worth CDollars 699.8m. The TSE 300 lost 56 points on the
week.
Eight of the 14 sub-indexes were down led by gold, oil, industrial product
and paper stocks. Conglomerates, real estate and utility stocks made the
strongest gains.
Mexico
Mexican equities closed sharply lower as a result of foreign selling as a
result of Telefonos de Mexico's continued fall and the decline on Wall
Street.
The key IPC index dropped 36.1 points, or 1.46 per cent, to close at
2,429.11, slightly above its session low of 2,422.8.
Volume was 71.8m shares worth a total of 672.38m new pesos. Telmex A shares
fell 1.56 per cent and its L series shares were down 1.11 per cent, while
Telmex ADRs closed Dollars  5/8 lower at 50 5/8 in New York.

FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: France languishing from lack of
liquidity - A continuing poor performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is good for Renault is not necessarily good for the markets. The French
government may be congratulating itself on the apparent success of the
partial privatisation of the vehicle group this week, but the sale of these
shares may spell further bad news for the performance of equities.
Mr David Harrington, French markets analyst with James Capel in Paris,
estimates that upwards of FFr120bn in capital has been drained from the
markets by a record year of privatisations, rights issues and other public
offers - up from a record FFr89bn in 1993.
Renault, UAP, Credit Commercial de France, Elf Acquitaine, Paribas,
Michelin, Alcatel Alsthom, Peugot: the list is endless. It has sharply
contributed to the lack of liquidity on the market, which in turn has led to
further disappointing returns for investors.
The CAC-40 index has languished over the last few months, closing yesterday
at 1,926.50. 'Obviously France has been a disaster this year,' says Mr
Harrington.
'It's been one of the worst performing equity markets,' says Mr Piers
Butler, head of French equity sales with Smith New Court in London. He adds
thatinstitutions with a spread of investments across Europe had overweighted
their portfolios into France in the belief of good growth prospects, and
been disappointed. Mr Frederic Redel, strategist for the French market with
Societe Generale in Paris, argues: 'There has been under-performance since
the end of 1992.'
He says that the difficulties developed in two stages. In 1993, France
remained one of the few countries with a strong currency. The effect on the
exchange rate put pressure on domestic companies, causing sharp falls in
their profitability.
This year, the spread between OATs, French government bonds, and their
German equivalents dropped almost to zero. He stresses the influence of new
issues soaking up liquidity, and well as first-half profits which were
generally disappointing.
Mr Harrington points to other factors which he believes have dragged down
the market. He says that the French stock market lacks the cyclical
constituents of many other markets such as Germany, for example.
High up his list is also the growing cloud of corruption overhanging many
leading French companies. 'Several have had their ratings slashed,' he says.
'It may have stripped 25 per cent off the value of the CAC 40 companies.'
However, he thinks there may now be signs that companies are beginning to
recover from the criticisms. Much will depend on the willingness of the
government to push through reforms of the funding of political parties -
including, as suggested recently, the possibility of a complete ban on
corporate donations.
Looking forward, Mr Butler predicts the beginnings of recovery, partly
triggered by recent optimistic economic data. 'Some of the smart money seems
to be coming back in now,' he says. 'People are starting to think that
stocks look attractively valued.'
Mr Harrington is less optimistic. He says that in the short term the markets
will remain for traders rather than investors. 'There may be a trading rally
but I have longer-term worries about tax, the economy and unemployment,' he
says.
He predicts earnings per share growth for the CAC 40 companies of 38 per
cent this year and 36 per cent next year - back to more normal levels. Mr
Redel estimates that the CAC 40 index will reach 2,000 by the end of this
year, and 2,400 by the end of 1995.
The biggest uncertainty that most commentators highlight over the next few
months is the presidential elections, which are due in May but may be
brought forward through the tactics or advancing illness now affecting Mr
Francois Mitterand, the current resident of the Elsee Palace.
Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris, was the first serious candidate to
declare that he was running at the start of November, in a move which is
likely to split the political right. He shares membership of the Gaullist
RPR party with Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who is likely to
declare by January.
Meanwhile, opinion polls rate Mr Jacques Delors, the socialist president of
the European Commission until January, on a par with Mr Balladur. He is also
likely to run, and recently published a book which has been interpreted by
some as a manifesto, although he has not yet confirmed his decision.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, recently said that none of the
leading candidates would do anything to upset the current government's
programme of economic liberalisation. But some argue that Mr Chirac - more
than Mr Delors - remains a wild card who may yet threaten reflationary
policies.
Mr Harrington says the most important issue for the government will be to
appease the bond markets to ensure that they remain in line with those in
Germany, through an insistence on maintaining budgetary restraint. 'But what
is good for the bond market is not necessary good for the underlying economy
or for equities,' he says.

FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips as Hong
Kong recoups losses
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in Sony's share price, which affected the consumer electronics
sector, dampened investor confidence and the Nikkei index lost marginal
ground amid small lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index lost 34.01 to 19,302.56 after a high of 19,332.07 and a
low of 19,199.24, barely changed over the week. Share prices lost ground on
the morning session on selling by institutional investors and profit taking
by foreigners. A steep decline in Sony later prompted selling of other
high-technology shares.
Volume remained flat at 210m shares. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 4.14 to 1,523.47 and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.02 to 279.73. Losses
led gains by 476 to 448, with 235 issues remaining unchanged.
The ISE/Nikkei was down 0.02 per cent to 1,250.28.
Sony tumbled Y310, or 5.3 per cent, to Y5,480 on profit taking. Investors
were discouraged by Thursday's announcement of the company's writing off
losses which had stemmed from Sony Pictures Entertainment, former Columbia
Pictures.
Sony's decline affected other electrical stocks. Matsushita Electric
Industrial, which also owns a US film studio MCA, declined Y40 to Y1,540.
Sharp fell Y20 to Y1,780 and Toshiba retreated Y8 to Y708.
Mitsubishi Estate lost Y20 to Y1,050 on worries over the financial state of
the Rockefeller Group of the US, in which the Japanese group owns an 80 per
cent stake.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 11.93 to 21,455.96 in volume of 21.3m shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG managed to recoup part of its steep morning losses, having found
support just below the 9,400 level, after plunging sharply ahead of an
expected bank rates rise.
The Hang Seng index tumbled 90.84 to 9,427.44, against a day's low of
9,373.69, but was still 0.6 per cent higher on the week. Volume fell to
HKDollars 2.4bn from Thursday's HKDollars 2.88bn.
The Sino-British Land Commission's decision on Thursday to boost sharply
land supply was a further factor clouding the property market.
SEOUL finished lower in moderate trading on tight liquidity concerns but
late institutional buying of some primary blue chips recouped early losses.
The composite stock index lost 2.18 to 1,118.45, off a low of 1,113.02, for
a 0.4 p+er cent fall on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR encountered renewed retail buying which enabled most shares to
rebound although falls in core stocks dragged the composite index down 3.60
to 1,048.88, but still 1.8 per cent higher on the week.
Retail investors were reported to have bought second-line and speculative
stocks amid optimism that some favourable news would emerge from Malaysia's
dominant United Malays National Organisation's general assembly this
weekend.
SINGAPORE was easier on institutional selling amid worries that high US
interest rates would squeeze corporate profitability while strong October
trade data came too late in the session to influence trading.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.3 down at 2,354.67, but was
still 1.4 per cent higher over the week.
TAIPEI made headway on hopes of a technical rebound and bullish remarks from
the ruling Nationalist Party's business manager.
The weighted index added 52.83 to 6,350.71 in low turnover of TDollars
20.5bn, down 2 per cent on the week.
Textile shares led the advance on expectations of increased earnings from
polyester products, which are in heavy demand on international markets.
Shinkong Synthetic Fibres rose TDollars 0.8 to TDollars 28.70.
MANILA rose slightly as a technical rally, sparked by bargain-hunting in
Petron, reversed an early downtrend.
The composite index put on 8.76 to 2,912.86 for a 0.47 per cent loss on the
week.
SYDNEY was supported by industrials which offset weakness in resource
issues.
The All Ordinaries index dipped 0.4 to 1,922.0 in turnover of ADollars 490m,
off 1.5 per cent this week.
Among resource stocks, CRA fell 18 cents to ADollars 17.40 in active trade,
mainly on the exercise of ADollars 19 put options.

FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises on prospects for
budget passage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The continent's bourses found it difficult to sustain momentum in the face
of a variety of domestic factors.
MILAN adopted a brighter tone at the end of a difficult week amid growing
optimism over the progress of the 1995 budget through parliament and hopes
of a calmer political outlook through a broadening of the coalition.
The Comit index rose 5.31 to 643.59, also supported by comments from the
treasury minister, Mr Lamberto Dini, which held out hopes for lower interest
rates, if the budget was agreed in its present form.
The index was little changed over a week that, said NatWest Securities, had
seen the largest ever demonstration against the government and continued
with a series of confidence votes, which gave an idea of the difficulties
that the prime minister and his cabinet were experiencing.
'Although the political climate remains heated, we believe we are nearing an
end to this long and uncertain period,' said NatWest. 'With this in mind, we
would be quite happy to start turning more positive as most of the bad news
is now in the price.'
Gains were seen across the board with Olivetti rising L71 or 3.4 per cent to
L1,995 and Cir up L60 to L1,938.
Ferruzzi, L32 ahead at L1,369, continued to show gains in spite of the
official denial of rumours that it would be merged with Montedison, its
agro-industrial subsidiary.
FRANKFURT was pressured by the expiry of options, the Dax index off a
marginal 0.41 at 2,102.28 in official hours, and up 1 per cent on the week.
Mannesmann continued to benefit from Thursday's results, rising DM5.30 to
DM411.80.
Elsewhere, VW put on DM6.60 to DM460.00 marks on options expiry.
Financials eased slightly, with the results season due to start next week:
Deutsche Bank lost 80 pfennigs to DM757, Dresdner70 pfennigs to DM412.70,
Commerzbank DM3.70 to DM329.30 and Allianz DM16 to DM2,424.
Chemical stocks were also lower ahead of next week's results with BASF down
DM2.40 at DM312.60, Bayer down DM1.50 at DM343.60 and Hoechst down DM1 at
DM324. ZURICH edged higher in quiet conditions, with the firmer dollar
providing further support. The SMI index rose 5.6 to 2,606.5, little changed
on the week.
UBS commented that the week was again dominated by a marked improvement on
the currency front as the Swiss franc weakened further against the dollar
and the D-mark. The bank said it expected a further positive impetus on the
currency side although the stimulus from interest rates was likely to be
modest. In the coming week, dollar sensitive stocks would continue to
outperform interest rate sensitive shares.
Brown Boveri gave up Thursday's advance, losing SFr7 to SFr1,107, with the
nine month results from ABB proving in line with expectations.
Swiss Re registered shares, however, picked up SFr22 to SFr797 as demand
picked up after the recent profit-taking.
AMSTERDAM weakened as expiry of November options made itself felt. The AEX
index dipped 1.44 to 409.85, a week's rise of 0.5 per cent.
Philips headed the list of most active stocks, with some 2.7m shares traded
largely as a result of options expiry. The shares lost 80 cents to Fl 53.20.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, went against the trend, adding 20
cents to Fl 50.10 on better than expected third quarter earnings.
Begemann, the industrial group, which fell sharply on Thursday, put on Fl
1.10 to Fl 29.70 in strong local trade.
MADRID finished higher as some late buying overcame mid-session weakness,
with the expiry of the future contract boosting otherwise thin volumes.
The final quote of the general index was not available, due to technical
problems, but the Ibex-35 index rose 14.24 to 3,286.71.
Dragados climbed Pta45 or 2.4 per cent to Pta1,955 in response to Thursday's
results.
STOCKHOLM was led higher by Ericsson in a partial correction of Thursday's
losses, although prices came off midsession highs as the domestic bond
market lost earlier gains.
The Affarsvarlden index rose 6.10 to 1,506.50, for a 2.9 per cent rise on
the week.
Ericsson B rose SKr4.50 to SKr443, in turnover of SKr803m following
Thursday's SKr23 fall in response to its nine months figures. The share hit
a session high of SKr449 and a low of 432.
SCA B rose SKr1 to SKr115, following its nine months profit figures and
higher full year forecast.
Asea A fell SKr9 to SKr533, following the ABB nine months figures.

FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP restrained
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil major BP was restrained by news that the company had agreed to pay
Dollars 1.4bn to settle a dispute over oil and gas production and income
taxes allegedly owed to the state of Alaska.
Analysts said that after the payment was offset against US Federal tax it
would come down to around Dollars 900m which would be paid over three years.
The Dollars 300m a year bill has been allowed for and BP said it would not
affect earnings. However, it is likely to have an impact on gearing and US
dealers were offering BP stock as soon as the news broke. In the UK, the
shares dipped 1 1/2 to 425 1/2 p on turnover of 6.1m.
Rival Shell Transport held steady at 707p ahead of a presentation to
analysts and institutional investors in New York. The annual update is to be
repeated in London on Monday.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo slipped 2 1/2 to 612 1/2 p as the company said
at its annual meeting sales growth was weak and also disappointed those who
though it might spend some of its Pounds 2.2bn cash pile on shareholders.
The company said that the declining growth was a reflection of a weaker
dollar but there was some concern that it might have had a more fundamental
base. There had also been some speculation - fuelled by a news-wire report
yesterday - that Glaxo might either announce a share buy-back or special
dividend payment. However Sir Paul Girolami, the outgoing chairman, said
there were no plans for a buy-back which could cause problems with advanced
corporation tax.
Wellcome gained 3 to 663p ahead of a big conference on Aids in Glasgow. The
company has an Aids treatment known as Retrovir which has come in for
serious criticism.
Redland gained 8 to 487p in modest 1.4m turnover for a two-day improvement
of 12 as attention focused on the building materials group's high foreign
currency earnings.
With turnover inflated to 11m by a number of bed and breakfast, tax related
deals, housebuilder Beazer gained a penny to 136p.
A NatWest Securities recommendation earlier this week pushed United Biscuits
up 11 to 329p, in good trade of 3.2m.
Fans of Associated British Foods celebrated this week's EU decision to make
no change to production quotas for sugar. Its British Sugar subsidiary has
around 50 per cent of the UK sugar market and there had been fears of a less
favourable quota regime. The stock jumped 17 to 574p.
Recent bid speculation in Hazlewood Foods appeared to fade leaving the
shares 4 lighter at 120p. Sellers were also in evidence at Unigate which
reported good figures earlier this week. The shares eased 5 to 357p.
In the drinks sector, Greenalls advanced 15 to 433p, after Hoare Govett
reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker cited the improved terms of
the company's supply agreement with Whitbread among the reasons for its
positive stance. Whitbread, which reported interims on Thursday ended the
session unchanged at 551p.
Mobile communications group Vodafone, which earlier this week was within 6
1/2 of its 207 1/2 p high for the year, shed a further 6 to 208p in 3.6m
turnover as bullish stories about next Tuesday's interim results showed
signs of turning sour. Robert Fleming Securities issued a sell note.
Press reports that the four biggest Austrian banks were preparing to provide
against Eurotunnel debt in their 1994 accounts left the channel tunnel
operator 4 lower at 259p.
Media conglomerate Pearson shed 8 to 608p as NatWest Securities held
presentations to discuss a bearish thesis on the valuation of BSkyB, the
satellite group which is to be floated and in which Pearson has a
significant stake.
Publisher Emap eased 4 to 400p ahead of interim figures on Monday.

FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The VSEL takeover saga, one of the stockmarket's most widely followed
special situations, sprang to life with the submarine maker surging 77 to
1475p following a counter-bid from British Aerospace, which tumbled 19 to
446p on the move.
The market buzzed with speculation on a further round of bidding by GEC with
best bets among analysts centring on a move upwards to 1500p cash. They also
believed Sir Arnold Weinstock and his team would move soon - possibly before
the December 7 deadline for a statement on VSEL from the Office of Fair
Trading.
BAe's new offer, 3.3 shares per VSEL share. puts a value of just under 1472p
on the deal. It has backed this with a cash alternative that matches the
existing 1400p a share cash offer from GEC. Vosper Thorneycroft got caught
up in the bid fever, jumping 12 to 754p.
More than 8m shares in BAe changed hands but none of the other protagonists
was heavily traded. GEC improved 2 1/2 p to 288p in 3.2m turnover. Turnover
in VSEL was just 1.7m.
The first part of BAe's two-tier Pounds 535m rights issue to finance the
deal is priced at 390p, a comfortable 11 per cent discount to market levels
and right in line with the price set for BAe's last cash-call three years
ago.

FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness active on placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in spirits group Guinness jumped to a hefty 146m, probably a record
but certainly the highest total for a single day's trading in the stock for
7 years, after French luxury products group LVMH carried out its long
anticipated move to reduce its 24 per cent stake in Guinness by 4 per cent.
The sale carried out in the form of a bought deal was executed by UBS which
placed 72m shares at 457p, at a 2.5 per cent discount to the market, with a
variety of institutions. The placing was said to have taken around an hour
and the securities house is believed to have taken a turn of 4 1/4 p on the
deal to earn around Pounds 3m. It was thought to be one of the biggest ever
bought deals carried out by a single house.
This is the second time this month that UBS has executed a sizeable deal
having placed 78m new shares in Forte two weeks earlier.
Shares in Guinness relinquished 2 to end at 466p, while a two way pull in
hotels group Forte left the shares 1 1/2 lighter at 232 1/2 p.

FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures did little more than mark time in dull trading volume,
making few attempts to lead the cash market, either up or down, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3140 when pit trading came to an end, up
4 points. On the week the December contract has risen a net 62 points.
Volume was again flat with 10,236 contracts traded, against 10,522. At the
official 4:10 close, the premium to the cash market was 10 points or three
points more than fair value.

FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market bolstered by corporate
deals - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another burst of corporate activity, plus renewed gains in gilts, helped to
galvanise a London equity market showing signs of strain after a week of
outperformance against US and European markets.
The day's big events were British Aerospace's launch of a Pounds 535m rights
issue to help fund an increased offer for VSEL, the submarines maker and the
sale by LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer, of a 4 per cent stake in
Guinness. They captured the market's attention at the outset.
And UK fund managers refused to be panicked by a strong upward revision in
domestic gross domestic product for the third quarter, which some analysts
said increased the chances of an early move to higher interest rates in the
UK to help stifle inflationary pressures.
The FT-SE 100 index closed a net 3.5 higher at 3,131.0, extending the rise
on a highly successful week to one of 55.1, or 1.8 per cent. The
second-liners once again underperformed the leaders, with the FT-SE Mid-250
index finally 1.0 off at 3.575.6; over the week the 250 index has risen
39.1, or 1.1 per cent.
Mr Rob Buckland, market strategist at NatWest Securities, said the UK market
had overcome one hurdle in the Fed move to increase rates, but that he was
yet to be convinced the Fed had done enough to convince markets. 'The UK
market wants to go up but the US bond market remains the key. Mr Roger
Barker, equity strategist at UBS preached caution; 'The budget could contain
more dangers than positives for the market than it thinks,' he said.
There was general satisfaction around the City's dealing desks with the
recent sharp increase in turnover levels following the spate of special
one-off deals. Turnover yesterday expanded to 750.8m shares, with double
counting of LVMH's sale of a 4 per cent holding in Guinness accounting for
146m shares and another substantial series of bed and breakfast, or
tax-related trades at the outset responsible for over 32m shares.
The 100 index began the session around 5 points easier and looking queasy
after another uninspiring performance by Wall Street overnight; an initial
bullish response by the Dow Jones Average and Treasury Bonds to Tuesday's 75
basis points increase in the Federal Funds rate, has given way to a mood of
depression in the US with equities and bonds under persistent selling
pressure.
But with institutions said to have been queueing up to buy the Guinness
stock on offer - LVMH's move has been expected for many weeks - the market
quickly gathered itself and moved into plus territory as soon as the
placing, worth Pounds 329m, was completed. The deal was executed by UBS, the
Swiss-owned stockbroker, via a bought deal which was said to have earned the
broker just over Pounds 3m.
The timing, but not the content, of British Aerospace's increase bid for
VSEL came as a surprise - dealers said any move was not expected until next
week. GEC is now expected to return with a potentially knockout blow.
VSEL shares raced higher in anticipation of the gathering bid battle, but
Aerospace suffered from the fund raising move.
For the rest of the session the market was content to mark time, shrugging
off the poor opening by Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average was down
around 20 points shortly after trading commenced. Two hours after London
closed the Dow Jones Average was showing a fall of more than 40 points.
Dealers in London were not overly worried by the losses across the rest of
world markets: 'As long as gilts are ok we should be fine,' said a trader at
one of the big European securities houses in London.
The head of trading at one of the UK securities houses said he expected a
sell-off in the futures markets to attempt a sell-off on Monday.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday had a steady day on the foreign exchanges, helped by
some fairly friendly trade figures, writes Philip Gawith.
Although the September US trade deficit rose to Dollars 10.13bn, from
Dollars 9.68bn in August, this news was offset by the bilateral deficit with
Japan narrowing to Dollars 5.73bn from Dollars 5.8bn. Trade frictions
between the US and Japan have contributed significantly to dollar weakness
this year.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5539, from DM1.548, and at Y98.525 from
Y98.145.
In Europe, the Swiss franc came under pressure following market rumours,
which were denied, that the Swiss National Bank might lower interest rates.
It closed at SFr0.847 against the D-Mark, from SFr0.840.
Sterling gained little help from strong third quarter GDP figures, showing
the UK economy had grown, year-on-year, by 4.2 per cent (revised up from 3.6
per cent). It finished at DM2.4379, from DM2.4368, and at Dollars 1.569 from
Dollars 1.5742.
Renewed debate about Britain's relationship with Europe has contributed to
recent sterling weakness.
Analysts said the market was probably slightly long of dollars at the
moment, and this accounted for the currency's grudging upward progress,
despite a combination of supportive events.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, predicted a 'slow,
upward grind' for the dollar. But he added that 'the bottom for the dollar
may now be in place.'
He cautioned, though, that a lot of dollar bears remained in the market.
Those banks which remain bearish of the dollar - Swiss Bank Corporation and
Chase Manhattan are two - tend to base their view on long term structural
problems, concerning the balance of payments and fiscal policy, remaining
unresolved.
Bears believe that Republican gains in Congress, if anything, are a cause
for further fiscal alarm, while Japanese institutions are understood still
to be nervous about recycling their current account surplus into US assets.
Mr Cocker said the market probably wanted further data about the US economy,
confirming the Fed's success in slowing US growth and inflation, before
pushing the dollar higher.
Trade was fairly quiet, with traders happy to take profits ahead of next
week's Thanksgiving holiday. Only Monday and Tuesday will be uninterrupted
trading days.
In Europe analysts reported some attention returning to the Italian market.
Mr Peter Stoneham, analyst at Technical Data in London, said the lira looked
to appreciate as the 1995 budget neared completion.
'The only fly in the ointment, as far as Berlusconi is concerned, is that
his coalition party falls just short of an overall majority in the Senate
and it's possible that he will see some further budget delays.'
'Overall, the picture looks brighter, and if the Berlusconi administration
can reach agreement with the labour unions over pension reforms, expect to
see the lira appreciate to below the key L1020.50 level by the end of the
year.'
The fortnightly foreign exchange survey, conducted by IDEA, found currency
investors and corporates in overwhelming agreement that the lira was the
currency in which they were most underweight.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 350m shortage in UK money markets at
established rates. Three month money traded at 6 1/32 per cent.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gains all round at hectic
LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A hectic week at the London Metal Exchange ended yesterday with most
contracts holding on to the bulk of their gains.
Copper met with some profit-taking after the exchange announced a
substantial rise in warehouse stocks of the metal. In contrast, an
exceptionally large fall in aluminium stocks encouraged a fresh wave of
buying.
The copper market had been the leader of the upsurge, the three months
position soaring to a four-year high of Dollars 2,860 a tonne with a Dollars
100-plus advance on Wednesday. By yesterday's close it had retreated to
Dollars 2,827.50 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 145 up on the week.
Analysts saw good fundamental reasons for copper's recent strength. There
was concern, however, that a heavy fall could ensue when the investment
funds, whose buying has been a particular feature of this year's climb,
decided to take their profits.
Mr Ted Arnold, analysts at Merrill Lynch, said it would be reasonable to
expected a great deal of profit-taking by December 16 so that the funds
could include the benefits in their December-quarter results.
Another concern was that the copper market was being manipulated, a view
encouraged by the establishment recently of substantial premiums for nearby
delivery positions, a reversal of the normal situation. The LME was
monitoring the copper market more closely than usual, chief executive David
King confirmed this week. The exchange it has the power to intervive if it
believes a 'disorderly' market is developing.
The prospect of an exodus of investment fund money is also hanging over the
aluminium market. But with stocks continuing to fall rapidly as production
cuts agreed earlier this year work through traders do not seem unduely
worried. At yesterday's close the three months LME price was quoted at
Dollars 1,970.75 a tonne, only Dollars 8.25 below the four-year peak reached
in the morning, and up Dollars 116.25, or 6.4 per cent, since the end of
last week.
Dealers told the Reuters news agency that the aluminium market seemed to be
winding-up for an attack on its next overhead objective of Dollars 2,000 a
tonne.
Other notable performances at the LME this week were three months zinc's
push through Dollars 1,200 a tonne, for the first time in two years, and
lead's brief foray above Dollars 700 a tonne.
Nickel also did well. Though more than Dollars 100 below Wednesday's peak,
the three months price's closing quotation of Dollars 7,722.50 a tonne
represented an overall gain of Dollars 307.50. The price had fallen sharply
with copper on Thursday but rallied yesterday, despite the denial of early
talk that Russia's Norilsk plant, the world's biggest, was suffering
production problems.
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee prices tumbled to the lowest levels
since mid-August as the market responded to weakness in New York.
The January futures position ended yesterday at Dollars 3,280 a tonne, down
Dollars 72 on the day and Dollars 191 on the week. The price has now fallen
Dollars 320 since last week's official projection put the Brazil's frost-
and drought-hit 1995-96 crop at between 12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each),
broadly in line with market forecasts.
A trader told Reuters yesterday that coffee roasters appeared to be buying
at the lows, but added: 'They aren't willing to chase the market up'. On the
other hand, he said he had not noticed any evidence of producer selling.

The pepper market was somewhat quieter this week, mainly due to holidays in
various countries. Black pepper tended a little easier in light business.
White, however, especially for delivery to the US, remained steady. Supplies
in Malaysia and China are gradually drying up. This week, at a pepper
seminar in Kuching, Malaysia pessimistic estimates for Malaysian 1995-96
pepper production were issued. As carry over stocks of previous years have
been fully liquidated, when demand re-appears prices are expected to
increase further. Muntok white spot was quoted at USDollars 3,650 a tonne
and November/December shipment at Dollars 3,625, cif. Spot black pepper faq
was at Dollars 2,600 a tonne and November/December shipment at Dollars
2,575, cif.

FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Overseas demand boosts Honda's
first-half profit

<TEXT>
Honda, the Japanese carmaker, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first
half in spite of disappointing domestic performance. It was lifted by strong
sales in North America and Europe, cost-cutting measures, and the sale of
its stake in Rover, the UK carmaker.
This was the first time in four years that Honda was able to report a rise
in profits, the group said. The outlook for the second-half performance was
even better as car sales in Japan in the latter half were expected to
recover, it added.
In the six months to September, Honda enjoyed buoyant demand in the North
American and European markets which supported a 6 per cent rise in group
revenues to Y1,991.4bn (Dollars 20.3bn) from a previous Y1,874.8bn.
Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - more than doubled
to Y56.7bn from Y22.5bn previously, although the figure was helped by a
Y14.6bn gain on the sale of Honda's 20 per cent share in Rover, acquired by
BMW of Germany. Net income more than tripled to Y38bn from a previous
Y9.3bn, also helped by a Y12.8bn gain from the Rover sale.
In Europe, Honda's sales were supported by an increase in output of UK-made
Accords during the period and imports of US-made Civics. As a result, Honda
was able to maintain price competitiveness against other Japanese carmakers
in the region and became the only Japanese manufacturer to increase market
share in Europe, Honda said.
In the period from January to the end of October, 29 per cent, or 44,700
units, of the 153,500 vehicles Honda sold in Europe were manufactured in the
UK, it said. This figure would increase further when Honda started
manufacturing its European Civic model in the UK next year.
In contrast to its strong performance in North America and Europe, Honda
continued to suffer in the Japanese market during the period with unit sales
falling 5 per cent.
Honda forecasts full-year consolidated sales of Y3,991.4bn against
Y3,862.7bn, and net profits of Y60bn, against Y23.7bn last year and an
earlier forecast of Y52bn.

FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sweden asks world banks for
Dollars 5bn loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is asking international banks to lend it Dollars 5bn in one of the
world's biggest syndicated loans in this year.
The pricing on the five-year loan is extremely low, with a facility fee of
Libor (London interbank offered rate) plus 4 basis points and an annual fee
on the amount drawn of 4 basis points, making a total of 8 basis points over
Libor.
These are even keener terms than for a loan arranged by Chemical Bank for
Spain in the summer which was priced at an annual interest rate of Libor
plus 4.5 basis points and a facility fee of 4.25 basis points.
The loan for Sweden is being handled by Citibank and JP Morgan.
Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office,
said: 'Our biggest loan was the Ecu8bn deal in September 1992. This loan is
to repay maturing debt.' He does not expect the loan to be drawn on this
year.
Sweden, which according to Mr Crona has a borrowing requirement for calendar
1994 of SKr180bn (Dollars 24.5bn), is the world's biggest sovereign issuer
on international bond markets.
Bond traders yesterday estimated that a Swedish government eurobond would
need to be priced to yield close to Libor.
The market for syndicated loans has increased dramatically this year because
prices for loans have fallen as banks, which have rebuilt their balance
sheets, compete aggressively for new assets.
Gencor, the South African mining conglomerate, yesterday launched a Dollars
537.5m seven-year syndicated loan to pay for the purchase of Billiton, the
international resources company bought by Gencor from Shell in July for
Dollars 1.3bn.
UBS, the co-ordinating bank, plans to bring in banks which already have a
relationship with the company.

FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: LVMH sells 4% of Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group, has sold a 4 per cent stake in
Guinness, reducing its holding in the UK drinks company to 20 per cent.
The French group, which made a pre-tax capital gain of about Pounds 50m
(Dollars 82m) on the sale, said the move was in line with an agreement made
at the start of the year when the two companies restructured their
cross-shareholdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Guinness exchanged
its 24 per cent stake in LVMH for a 34 per cent holding in Moet Hennessy,
the LVMH cognac and champagne business.
LVMH said it had no plans to reduce its Guinness holding further. 'We are
merely completing the restructuring of our shareholding which we agreed in
January,' it said.
Some industry observers expressed surprise at the timing of the move. 'I
thought they might wait in the expectation of a strengthening in the
Guinness share price,' said one analyst at a French merchant bank. 'LVMH had
until next June to make the sale, and the beer and spirits markets may
improve with economic recovery.'
Sale proceeds will strengthen LVMH. Its net debts - about FFr15bn (Dollars
2.8bn) at the start of the year - will fall to about FFr4.6bn.
Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, has used the group's improved financial
position to launch a series of acquisitions. Following the conclusion of
January's agreement with Guinness, the French group took a majority stake in
Guerlain, the fragrance house, in a FFr1.9bn deal.

FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull privatisation
launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday launched the privatisation of Groupe Bull,
inviting candidates to submit offers to buy stakes in the loss-making
computer group.
A joint statement from the economy ministry and the industry ministry said
the government's objective was to give Bull a 'private, coherent and stable'
shareholding structure which would allow it to strengthen its industrial
strategy. The French government, which holds 76 per cent of Bull's shares,
is seeking to reduce its stake to a minority by early next year.
According to the statement, the principal of the operation is to establish a
majority shareholder or several significant shareholders, each holding at
least 10 per cent of Bull's shares. So-called 'partner-shareholders',
seeking an investment of less than 10 per cent, would also be permitted.
The sale is expected to be the most difficult so far in the government's
plan to sell 21 public-sector companies. Unlike previous privatisations the
computer group is loss-making. In the past three years it has incurred
losses totalling more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.8bn) and has required
subsidies of FFr11.1bn since the beginning of 1993.
However, losses have been curbed through a restructuring and cost-cutting
plan by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman in October
last year.
Under the terms of the offer, the potential investors should apply for a
stake in the company by December 9. The planned privatisation has already
drawn interest from potential investors. NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per
cent of Bull, has said it wants to increase its stake, while AT&amp;T of the US
is planning a joint bid for a stake of up to 40 per cent with CSEE, the
French electronics group. IBM of the US, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull,
has declined to comment on its intentions.
The operation is also expected to prove sensitive, pitting rival bids
against each other and involving a possible shift in strategy for the
computer company. The proposal from CSEE and AT&amp;T, for example, may involve
the shift towards systems integration and information services. AT&amp;T wants
to invest in Bull to gain access to the French telecommunications market.
France Telecom, which holds 17 per cent of Bull, has a monopoly on
fixed-line services.
Under the terms of the application procedure, details of which will be
announced today, candidates will submit proposals which include their
financing plans and industrial strategies. A first selection will then be
made after consultation with the privatisation commission, an independent
body which advises the government on the sale of public sector assets.
The remaining candidates will then have six weeks to proceed with a detailed
examination of Bull's condition, after which they may make an irrevocable
offer.

<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German trading and industrial group which nearly
collapsed as a result of controversial deals in US oil futures, yesterday
announced an increased net loss of DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.8bn) for the 1993-94
financial year and said it now looked with confidence to the future.
The preliminary figure compared with a loss of DM1.97bn for the previous
year to September 30.
Turnover was down to DM20.1bn from DM26.1bn as a result of asset sales and
withdrawal from unprofitable businesses.
MG Corporation, the US subsidiary responsible for the oil futures debacle,
incurred a pre-tax loss of DM2.9bn.
The company, which only survived after a DM3.4bn rescue package led by
creditor banks, repeated its expectation of a positive operating result for
the current year.
This should total well over DM100m. Its trade, plant construction, chemical
and financial services activities would all contribute to this result.
Bank indebtedness fell to DM3.1bn, which was matched by liquid assets, from
DM7.4bn at end-December 1993.
Metallgesellschaft again said the annual meeting next March would decide on
capital restructuring measures, but gave no details.
A reduction in share capital followed by a rights issue is one possibility.
The company said with the closing of the 1993-94 financial year, all visible
risks from its US subsidiary had been dealt with in the balance sheet. The
company has sold subsidiaries, shareholdings and property to strengthen its
finances.
In recent months, the way the oil futures contracts were unwound has been
the subject of a furious debate.
Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche Bank, a leading creditor and shareholder,
have defended themselves against claims by US economists that the method of
unwinding actually increased the losses.

<TEXT>
Greyhound Lines of Canada plans to move out from the languishing
long-distance bus business by forming a low-cost, no-frills airline.
The Calgary-based bus company, which operates the same familiar silver and
blue buses as its US counterpart but no longer has any direct corporate link
with it, is confident that an airline would complement its bus services.
For example, it would offer tickets combining bus and air travel. Greyhound
Canada is 69 per cent owned by Dial Corp of Arizona, which sold its interest
in Greyhound Lines, the ailing US bus company, in 1987.
Greyhound Lines this month avoided a second brush with bankruptcy by
offering a large equity stake to its creditors.
Dial, whose business centres on consumer products, said it was considering
disposing of all or part of its stake in Greyhound Canada to facilitate the
formation of the airline. Under Canadian law, foreign investors are limited
to a 25 per cent stake in a domestic air carrier.
Greyhound Canada said it had not decided how the airline would be
structured. It is seeking outside investors in both the bus and air
operations, and plans to lease up to 10 aircraft for domestic routes.
Canada's air industry is dominated by Air Canada and Canadian Airlines
International.
Greyhound Canada earned CDollars 8.7m (USDollars 6.44m) in the first nine
months of this year on revenues of CDollars 160.5m.

Honda, the Japanese carmaker, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first
half in spite of disappointing domestic performance. It was lifted by strong
sales in North America and Europe, cost-cutting measures, and the sale of
its stake in Rover, the UK automotive group.
This was the first time in four years that Honda was able to report a rise
in profits, the group said. The outlook for the second-half performance was
even better as car sales in Japan in the latter half were expected to
recover, it added.
In the six months to September, Honda enjoyed buoyant demand in the North
American and European markets which supported a 6 per cent rise in group
revenues to Y1,991.4bn (Dollars 20.3bn) from a previous Y1,874.8bn.
Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - more than doubled
to Y56.7bn from Y22.5bn previously, although the figure was helped by a
Y14.6bn gain from the sale of Honda's 20 per cent share in Rover, acquired
by BMW of Germany. Net income more than tripled to Y38bn from a previous
Y9.3bn, also helped by a Y12.8bn gain from the Rover sale.
In Europe, Honda's sales were supported by an increase in output of UK-made
Accords during the period and imports of US-made Civics. As a result, Honda
was able to maintain price competitiveness against other Japanese carmakers
in the region and became the only Japanese manufacturer to increase market
share in Europe, Honda said.
In the period from January to the end of October, 29 per cent, or 44,700
units, of the 153,500 vehicles Honda sold in Europe were manufactured in the
UK, it said. This figure would increase further when Honda started
manufacturing its European Civic model in the UK next year.
In contrast to its strong performance in North America and Europe, Honda
continued to suffer in the Japanese market during the period with unit sales
falling 5 per cent. The value of its Japanese car sales increased marginally
on a consolidated basis helped by the popularity of its imported cars and a
decline in inventories, but fell 5 per cent on a non-consolidated basis.
Motorcycle sales for Honda, which is a leader in the world markets,
increased moderately as weakness in industrialised markets was offset by
strong Asian sales.
Honda expects firm results in the second half on the back of improving world
markets, including Japan, a better product mix and continuing cost-cuts.
The company has recently introduced a recreational vehicle in Japan which
has seen strong demand.
For the full year, Honda forecasts consolidated sales to reach Y3,991.4bn
compared with Y3,862.7bn and net profits to rise to Y60bn, against Y23.7bn
last year and an earlier forecast of Y52bn.

<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan, the US bank, agreed to pay Dollars 363.5m for the custody
and other securities processing businesses of US Trust, reinforcing its
strong position in these markets.
The all-stock transaction will bring Chase about Dollars 237bn in additional
assets under custody. Of these, Dollars 127bn are held for institutional
investors for whom US Trust acts as domestic or global custodian; Dollars
74bn are assets of US mutual fund groups; and Dollars 36bn are held for
closed-end investment trusts.
The acquisition will confirm Chase's position as the biggest global
custodian of securities. With US Trust's 50 per cent share of the US
investment trust business, it will also become the biggest in this field.
Investors marked down the bank's share price on fears that the deal would
dilute earnings per share. Chase said it would counter this by increasing
its stock buy-back programme to purchase the same number of shares it issues
under the transaction.
Absorbing US Trust's securities servicing businesses will cost about Dollars
40m, but lead to annual cost savings of Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m
thereafter, Chase said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Competition likely to churn up and slim
down dairy industry - Higher milk prices will result in more added-value
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago, Britain's Pounds 8bn dairy industry was pitched into a new
competitive world when the government deregulated the milk supply market for
the first time in 60 years.
This has resulted in companies complaining bitterly about price increases
and threatening plant closures and job losses as profits are hit.
Unigate, which has already warned that the rise in milk prices would cut its
profits by Pounds 10m this year, said it might have to close more dairies to
compete.
Dairy Crest, the processing arm of the old Milk Marketing Board, recently
announced the closure of two dairies with the loss of more than 200 jobs.
Dairy Crest's own future is uncertain as speculation is rife about a
takeover bid from rival Unigate. The company is due to be sold by the
residuary body which was appointed to wind up the milk board's business, but
a stock market flotation has been put off indefinitely following the milk
price rise.
A match between Dairy Crest and Unigate would make strategic sense as it
would offer scope for rationalisation of low-grade butter/skimmed milk
powder plants and cheese making capacity which have been hardest hit by the
rise in milk costs.
A bid would be likely to attract the attention of the competition
authorities, however, as it would give Unigate almost 60 per cent of the
UK's butter-making capacity.
It is not just these two companies which must trim capacity: the entire
industry faces a pressing need to reduce output if it is to remain
competitive at higher milk prices.
Although dairy companies have shed many plants in recent years and cut milk
processing capacity by 60 per cent, they have not kept up with the rapid
pace of change in consumer buying patterns. Some dairy executives believe
there is still considerable slack in the business.
Consumers are turning rapidly away from doorstep milk deliveries to
supermarket purchases at a rate of 12 per cent a year, making many bottling
plants redundant.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative
which has succeeded the milk board, reckons Britain has twice as much milk
bottling capacity, twice as much butter/powder capacity and 30 to 40 per
cent more cheese making facilities than required.
The rise in milk prices which has raised raw materials costs by an average
of 11 per cent across the industry has eroded company margins to about 4 per
cent.
Some City analysts believe the industry's milk bill will rise by Pounds 350m
in the coming year, wiping out its entire profits.
Financial imperatives are likely to hasten rationalisation, but Mr Neil
Davidson, group executive at Northern Foods and current president of the
Dairy Industry Federation, the trade body, fears that if too much capacity
is closed there will be insufficient facilities to cope with seasonal peaks
in milk supply.
Milk cannot be stored for long and at certain times of year, when cows are
calving, output increases. The extra milk must be turned into a product with
a longer shelf life such as butter or skimmed milk powder unless it is to be
wasted. This is why much processing capacity can stand idle for long periods
in order to absorb peak supply when it occurs.
However, Mr Dare says the problem is not as great now as in the past.
Farmers have managed to iron out much of the seasonal fluctuation in milk
output in recent years - he says it is now plus or minus 5 per cent of core
product-ion.
Dairies have been slow to gear up to these changed market realities. To a
large extent, they are still thrashing out a strategy in the new competitive
world after having been cushioned for many years by the milk board's system
for rationing supply.
They have been late in recognising the need to add value to their production
and innovation has often been led by foreign competitors.
It will be much more difficult for companies to pass on higher prices for
undifferentiated products. Mild cheddar cheese, for example, is vulnerable
to replacement by lower-priced imports.
The industry must move rapidly to capitalise on its production of
higher-value value items which are less exposed to rises in raw materials
costs while rationalising commodity production to cut overheads.
Over the next three years there is likely to be a widespread shake-out in
the industry. But so far the dairies have laid their problems at Milk
Marque's door, resenting higher prices, and complaining to the Office of
Fair Trading about an abuse of its dominant power.
Further rationalisation in the industry would help counter Milk Marque's
dominance by establishing a small number of powerful buyers.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, reported
pre-tax profits of Dollars 266m for the third quarter. This was a 23.7 per
cent advance from the same period last year and was mainly due to
cost-cutting.
New orders jumped 33 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn, continuing the strong trend
established in the first half.
At the end of September, the group's order backlog stood at Dollars 33.3bn,
17 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Revenues in the third quarter were up 5 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn,
reflecting improving conditions in many markets.
For the nine months, revenues were up 1.2 per cent to Dollars 20.04bn and
operating profits advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 1.65bn.
Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said he was pleased the group had been
able to raise its operating margin in the first nine months from 7.2 per
cent to 8.2 per cent in spite of flat sales. Personnel costs continued to be
driven down by the shift of operations to low labour cost countries.
Pre-tax profits for the nine months were ahead 21 per cent to Dollars 874m.
The group said demand for standard products improved steadily, but
investment goods sales grew more slowly. The first signs of an upswing in
the order intake from continental European markets were visible.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Trombone changes bid tone - David Wighton
considers BAe's response in the battle for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing and funding structure for British Aerospace's increased offer for
VSEL may have taken City observers slightly by surprise. But few had doubted
that BAe would respond to GEC's rival bid. And few now doubt that the battle
has a long way to go.
The fight over VSEL is part of a wider struggle between GEC and BAe for
dominance in the UK defence business. For both companies the stakes are
high.
Although BAe's share price fell in response to the novel rights issue
yesterday, the general City reaction was that the company had significantly
strengthened its hand.
Not only has it matched GEC's cash offer and topped it with its share swap
terms, it has given itself the flexibility to raise the terms again if GEC
continues the bidding.
Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Securities, described the
timing and structure of the offer as astute. 'The bid had started to look
like a fait accompli but BAe has shown itself prepared to go head to head
with its major competitor. At least it will emerge with its reputation
enhanced.'
BAe's institutional shareholders also expressed support, although some took
the cynical view that the company thought it had little chance of winning
and had structured the funding to guarantee itself a Pounds 178m equity
injection if it failed.
BAe said the novel two-stage fund raising, known in the City as a 'trombone
issue', enabled it to compete with GEC on equal terms.
Under the terms of the original bid BAe offered shares worth about Pounds
12.60 per VSEL share with a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40, provided by
selling shares to institutions which were underwriting it for a fee.
If BAe wanted to increase the terms its advisers would have to go back to
the institutions to underwrite the cash alternative.
'The process makes you as visible as a herd of elephants to the opposition
who can see exactly what you are going to do,' said one of BAe's advisers.
But by raising money through an underwritten rights issue BAe can increase
the terms without going back to the institutions.
'We can act very quickly, very simply and very secretively,' said Mr Richard
Lapthorne, BAe's finance director. BAe argues the move puts it on more level
terms with GEC which plans to fund its bid from its large cash pile.
In effect BAe has asked its shareholders for a blank cheque. To give some
comfort to the institutions it has agreed to ask for shareholders' approval
before declaring a successful higher bid unconditional.
BAe's chances of success are partly in the hands of the Office of Fair
Trading. BAe has argued strenuously that GEC's bid should be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on competition grounds. GEC already owns
Yarrow, the UK's other big warship builder.
Some observers have suggested that if the GEC bid alone were referred to the
MMC BAe could have won control of VSEL with its original offer. However, BAe
said yesterday that it believed VSEL shareholders would now not accept less
than GEC's Pounds 14 a share, even if GEC was barred from bidding.
'Expectations have been raised,' said Mr Lapthorne.
He denied that the improved offer reflected an assumption by BAe that GEC's
bid was unlikely to be referred alone. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive,
even suggested that BAe's move might improve the chances of GEC being
referred by demonstrating that BAe's financial position was not an issue.
Another potential benefit of the improved offer is that it may allow BAe to
buy VSEL shares in the market. It cannot do so at a price above the value of
its share offer, which has prevented it making such purchases so far.
Yesterday VSEL shares closed at Pounds 14.88, just 16p above the value of
BAe's share offer.
GEC already holds 15 per cent of VSEL and cannot make further purchases in
the market under VSEL's articles.
Thanks to its tax losses and Pounds 100m of unrelieved advance corporation
tax BAe would pay no tax on VSEL's profits. It calculates that even at the
higher offer a successful takeover would enhance its earnings per share by
more than 10 per cent next year.
NatWest Securities believes that taking over VSEL would now boost its
earnings from 35.7p to 40p, compared with 42.4p under the original terms.
Other analysts believe the enhancement would be slightly smaller and that
the deal would actually dilute earnings thereafter.
However, most believe BAe would raise the stakes again in the likely event
that GEC continues the bidding.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet's involvement in Inntrepreneur
reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan and Foster's Brewing Group have refinanced Inntrepreneur
Estates, their British pub joint venture, and given it an independent
management in an attempt to improve its performance.
The partners remain joint owners, however, leaving unresolved the long-term
future of Inntrepreneur. GrandMet, keen to focus on its drinks and food
businesses, was thought to be seeking a buyer for its stake. 'The market is
disappointed that GrandMet has not made a complete exit,' an analyst said.
Its shares fell 2p to 408p.
Lord Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, said Inntrepreneur might be 'floated in
three or four years when it achieves its value. It does not fit our
strategy.' Meanwhile, Grand Met's financial and management involvement would
be reduced by the new arrangements.
Australian-based Foster's is known to be reviewing whether to sell Courage,
the British brewer through which it holds its stake in Inntrepreneur. With
20 per cent of Courage's output sold through the 6,000-pub estate, the City
saw the strengthening of Inntrepreneur as a prerequisite to any decision on
Courage. Courage's agreement to supply the estate expires in March 1998.
GrandMet has managed the joint venture since the partners pooled their pubs
in 1991. It has been criticised for running Inntrepreneur more like a
property company than a pub business. Some licensees have complained about
the terms of their leases.
'Whitbread and others have spent more time developing relations with
licensees than GrandMet has,' one analyst said.
The changes will bring Inntrepreneur's management 'closer to the lessee,'
said Mr Mike Foster, Courage chairman. 'It is about selling beer not just
bricks and mortar.'
Under the terms:
GrandMet and Courage will each convert Pounds 84.5m of interest-free loans
to Inntrepreneur into equity and inject a further Pounds 28m of new equity
into it.
An Pounds 800m main bank facility has been agreed with a group of lenders
consisting of National Westminster, Sumitomo, Chase Manhattan, Citibank and
JP Morgan. These have less restrictive covenants than Inntrepreneur's
existing loans.
Inntrepreneur will repay to GrandMet a Pounds 360m interest-bearing loan.
The freehold of 320 Chef &amp; Brewer pubs leased to Scottish &amp; Newcastle will
be transferred from Inntrepreneur to Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, for
an in initial Pounds 203m pending sale of the freeholds.
Inntrepreneur's pubs have been written down by a further Pounds 20m, or 1.4
per cent.
After the refinancing, Inntrepreneur will have net borrowings of Pounds 969m
and shareholders' equity of Pounds 424m. Analysts estimate profits of Pounds
40 to Pounds 50m pre-tax in its first year.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe will raise maximum Pounds 535m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is relying on a new trombone to help it win the fight for
VSEL.
Two-stage rights issues, nicknamed trombones, have become increasingly
popular as a method for funding bids since first introduced in the UK by
Kleinwort Benson, BAe's merchant bank.
Most recently, GKN used such a structure to fund its hostile bid for
Westland. The traditional method is to split the issue into a first tranche,
which is underwritten in the normal way, and a second tranche which only
goes ahead if the bid is successful.
This means that if the bid fails, the company is not left with much more
cash than it needs, which is likely to dilute earnings.
In BAe's case, Kleinwort has introduced a new twist, making the second
tranche not merely conditional but also variable. If the bid fails, BAe will
get only the Pounds 178m from the first tranche.
If it succeeds, BAe will get from the second tranche only the extra sum it
needs to satisfy those VSEL shareholders who opt for the cash alternative.
The maximum raised from both tranches will be Pounds 535m.
The mechanics are that British Aerospace shareholders will be able to
subscribe for one 'stock unit' for every three shares held with an initial
instalment of 130p.
A second instalment of up to 260p will be payable if the revised offer goes
unconditional. The units will then convert into ordinary shares.
Shares on which the second instalment is not paid will be forfeited, so BAe
is virtually guaranteed the second tranche money and only the first tranche
has been underwritten.
BAe wanted the first tranche to be as small as possible, but the Stock
Exchange would not allow it to be less than a third of the total. In
previous examples, the two tranches have been of equal size.
Mr Tim Shacklock, joint head of corporate advisory at Kleinwort, believes
the technique will be adopted by other companies in similar situations. 'I
have had a lot of people ringing up asking why nobody thought of it before.'
The costs will be based partly on the scale for rights issue and partly on
the system for underwritten cash offers.
BAe, which spent about Pounds 10m underwriting the first offer, faces
another bill of at least Pounds 10m, depending on the length of the bid.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ibstock makes Pounds 15m Scottish purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ibstock's move to concentrate on its core business of manufacturing building
materials was reinforced yesterday with the purchase, for up to Pounds
14.8m, of two Scottish brick companies, Centurion Brick and Scottish Brick
Corporation.
Ibstock, the UK's third largest brick maker, paid Pounds 9.05m cash and has
assumed about Pounds 5.5m in debt, which it plans to pay off immediately. It
may pay a further Pounds 200,000 on completion depending on the value of the
combined net assets. The previous owner was Law Holdings, a private company
with coal mining interests.
Centurion operates a factory at Tannochside, near Glasgow, producing 50m
facing and engineering bricks a year. Scottish Brick owns a mothballed
factory at Bishopbriggs, also near Glasgow. Ibstock plans to install a new
tunnel kiln at a cost of about Pounds 6m.
Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director, said Ibstock's 10 per cent share
of the UK cement market would rise to 13 per cent and that Ibstock would
become the largest producer and seller of bricks in Scotland.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hammerson pays Pounds 55m for French
shopping complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the property company which sold its Australian portfolio last
month for Pounds 250m, has started to reinvest the proceeds by acquiring a
shopping centre near Paris.
The company is paying Unibail, the French property group FFr459m (Pounds
55m) for the Espace St Quentin centre in the new town of St Quentin en
Yvelines, 20km south-west of Paris.
The centre includes 117 units amounting to 206,000 sq ft of retail space. At
the purchase price, the initial yield is 8.3 per cent. Hammerson sold its
Australian assets on an exit yield of 5.3 per cent.
Espace St Quentin was opened in 1987 and is 99.5 per cent let to tenants
including Benetton, Etam and Naf Naf. Annual net rental income is about
FFr40m, with rents linked to the level of construction prices and turnover
achieved by each store.
Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said: 'We believe there will be
opportunities to add value to this property by active management.'
Hammerson already owns eight French properties, but the acquisition marks
its first shopping centre investment. As in the UK, France now operates a
planning regime which discourages out-of-town shopping centres in favour of
town centre developments.
Mr Spinney said that Hammerson was looking for further acquisitions in
France.
'We are continuing to look at retail properties and will consider buying
offices but only in prime Paris locations with good specifications,' he
said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Visits to institutions raise RJB Mining's
fund raising prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining's prospects of receiving backing for its Pounds 914m bid for
British Coal's English mining regions looked brighter yesterday after a week
of institutional visits, in spite of doubts which have dogged the company's
plans.
Institutions said they were encouraged by the details revealed in meetings
this week, which have been published by the Financial Times.
One fund manager, who admitted he had been shaken by public doubts over
RJB's coal price and volume assumptions, said he left the meeting 'very
reassured'.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB, had given a 'very good
performance'.
Shareholders have sought comfort on at least two issues before giving their
support to the expected Pounds 425m equity issue: that RJB should be able to
pay off the debt it incurs - at present expected to be bank debt of about
Pounds 528m; and that price and volume assumptions are realistic,
particularly after 1998 when lucrative electricity generator contracts come
to an end.
On the first issue, institutions are believed to have received comfort over
the level of debt RJB will have to pay. In addition, institutions expect
capital investment to be half the rate of depreciation. This will free cash
flow to service debt.
On RJB's price and volume assumptions, institutions still vary. One said the
recent publicity would ensure close questioning when RJB presented its
proposals.
'Looking at the prices they hope to achieve, they seem a bit optimistic,'
the shareholder said. Volume assumptions also seemed a bit high. However,
the shareholder said he would reserve judgment until after the presentation.
Another shareholder dismissed the doomsday scenarios which have raised
questions about the volumes of coal that Mr Budge said he would be able to
sell after 1998. 'It is certainly not the case that on April 1 1998, when
the contracts end, the whole thing disappears up his backside,' he said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BFI disputes Attwoods break-up value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries yesterday claimed Attwoods' shareholders could
get as little as 56p or 88p in the break-up being presented by the UK waste
services company as its last-ditch defence to the hostile Pounds 391m bid.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI said his company's alternative illustration of
break-up values showed the tentative nature of Attwoods' proposals. 'It is a
very iffy proposal,' he said.
BFI has attributed a range of values to Attwoods' businesses which Mr Angell
described as being nothing more than a reasonable scenario.
It values the European waste business at Dollars 15.2m (Pounds 9.2m), the US
operations at between Dollars 340m and Dollars 500m, and the German business
at Dollars 56.8m. After deducting costs of the break-up and tax charges of
Dollars 30m, and debt and preference repayments of Dollars 264m, BFI
estimates Attwoods would net between Dollars 274m and Dollars 434.7m.
Attwoods dismissed the estimates. 'If they think those are the real numbers
it rather surprises us that they bid for us in the first place,' the company
said. The multiples used by BFI for valuing the US businesses were at least
half the market average, Attwoods said.
However, it appeared last night that BFI's increased offer of 116.75p per
share, plus a 3.25p dividend, had won over shareholders. One investor
criticised the break-up strategy as toothless. He said it put no value on
the promised return to shareholders.
'Cash today as opposed to promises tomorrow is a lot more attractive,' he
said.
BFI already has the support of Attwoods' largest shareholder, Laidlaw of
Canada. Laidlaw has agreed to sell its 29.8 per cent stake and 73 per cent
preference holding to BFI under the terms of the original offer.
Perhaps, not surprisingly, shareholders felt the offer, which had been
increased from 109p, was still too cheap.
'It was tough when we did not have another bidder,' said one institution.
'It means we were essentially bidding against ourselves.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Perpetual surges to Pounds 35.4m and sees
similar this year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On turnover almost doubled at Pounds 1.52bn for the year to September 30,
against Pounds 842m, Perpetual, the unit trust management group, reported a
strong advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 35.4m.
The result also reflected an increase in management fees and other operating
income from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 37.7m.
Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman, said that unless circumstances deteriorated
significantly, 'it would be disappointing if we did not match the reported
results in the current trading year'.
He expected management fee income to exceed comfortably this year's figure
but feared that sales revenue might decline.
During the year funds under management increased from Pounds 2.03bn to
Pounds 3.5bn with Pounds 1.32bn of net new money.
Mr Arbib said the company had again won a number of awards enabling it to
increase its share of the market. 'According to the latest industry figures
we have become the largest unit trust provider, measured by sales, in the
retail market.'
Personal equity plans accounted for 39 per cent of sales and over the last
six months Perpetual said it had the greatest share of the market.
It now has 200,000 clients with Pounds 1bn of funds under management.
Earnings per share came out at 92.38p (39.11p) or 83.48p fully diluted.
A final dividend of 25p (13.2p) is proposed for a total of 35p (15p).

Lincat Group, the USM-quoted designer and maker of commercial catering
equipment, is acquiring Imperial Machine Company (Holdings), a catering and
bar equipment manufacturer and supplier, for Pounds 6.1m.
The consideration is satisfied by Pounds 501,000 in cash and Pounds 5.62m by
the issue of 2.39m shares. It is also proposed that a dividend of Pounds
560,000 net be paid to the vendors.
In the nine months to August 31 IMC made pre-tax profits of Pounds 651,000
on turnover of Pounds 4.24m. Its net assets of Pounds 2.5m at end-August
will be reduced by the proposed dividend.
Following the acquisition, Mr Paul Bouscarle, managing director of IMC, will
join Lincat's board as chief executive.
Lincat also announced that it was applying for a full quote.

<TEXT>
The absence of losses from activities now disposed of and improved results
from several continuing businesses resulted in a return to pre-tax profit at
Thomas Locker, the general engineering group, in the half-year to September.
On sales of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.5m) from continuing businesses, pre-tax
profit amounted to Pounds 104,000. The previous first half saw a loss of
Pounds 329,000, including Pounds 200,000 from discontinued activities, on
total sales of Pounds 17.3m.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.2p, payable from earnings per share
of 0.15p (0.67p losses).
The company said that the profits turnround included Pounds 309,000 from the
elimination of losses from Associated Perforators and Weavers and Locker
Asia.

Benefits emanating from the Pounds 39m purchase earlier this year of a

underpinned the interim revenue account at TR Property Investment Trust.
Rises in rents and unfranked investment income, although partly offset by
increased administration expenses reflecting the larger portfolio,
contributed to a 28 per cent advance in attributable revenue for the six

Earnings per share, however, dipped to 0.61p (0.68p) on capital increased by

Chester Water reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 1.23m

Turnover was Pounds 3.08m, compared with Pounds 3m.
Profits were helped by the lack of non-recurring costs of Pounds 159,000
relating to the financial reorganisation when the company gained plc status,
a further reduction in costs in the core business and an increase in income

FT  19 NOV 94 / Fox goes for birdie: Murdoch's challenge to the golfing
establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rupert Murdoch is no stranger to upsetting establishments, as Britain's
tabloid-tormented royal family knows to its cost.
But this week it emerged that the Australian media magnate's Fox
Broadcasting plans to co-sponsor a Dollars 25m World 'Tour' for top golf
professionals. This marks as colourful and audacious an attack on entrenched
sporting interests as he has yet launched.
Supported by one of the world's top players, Greg Norman - called the 'Great
White Shark' for his flowing blond hair - Fox proposes to stage eight
tournaments (five in North America, one in Britain, one in Spain, one in
Japan) with top prizes of Dollars 600,000 per event and a Dollars 1m bonus
to the overall annual winner.
The development has sent shock waves through the game's governing bodies -
notably the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews and the
long-established Professional Golfers Associations (PGA) - and stirred dire
mutterings that the prestige of the Open championship and other events could
be damaged.
It is also likely to focus the spotlight on the controversial figure of Mark
McCormack, whose IMG group effectively controls, through management
contract, a third of the players targeted by the new Tour.
And for Murdoch's Fox television empire, which outbid CBS for the rights to
the NFC's American football package earlier this year, it could further
boost its ambition to become the fourth US network and wrest valuable sports
properties from its rivals.
In some respects Murdoch's move is reminiscent of Kerry Packer's 1977 swoop
on international cricket, which led to the famous Packer circus - of
floodlit games in pyjamas and all that - and transformed the shape and
character of the sport. Then, as now, the story leaked out (after a party
thrown by England cricket captain Tony Greig). Then, as now, the underlying
business issue was an Australian's ambition to exploit TV rights on an
international scale.
It is possible that professional golf will not be the same again, but in
other respects the Packer analogy is flawed. Unlike their cricketing
couterparts of 17 years ago, top golfers such as Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer
and Colin Montgomerie are fantastically well paid - even if some of the
professional journeymen who make up the numbers at tournaments and
consistently end up among the also-rans live in caravans or hire bed and
breakfast rooms. The stars whom Murdoch is courting have no obvious need of
his shilling.
Another difference is that Tony Greig, Packer's unofficial recruiting
sergeant, had most of the world's top cricketers signed up before news of
their defection hit the streets. This time, plenty of names are being cited
on the rumour mill but Norman apart, none has yet come out publicly.
This is not to say that a Murdoch circus is not in the making. The five
'Tour' bodies that administer the professional game around the world have
been remarkably successful in riding the golf boom of the last 20 years. The
European Tour's prize money has gone up from Pounds 500,000 in 1975 to
Pounds 28m today. But the dissatisfaction of some top players goes beyond
Faldo's recent criticism of the condition of some European courses, before
he headed off to play more in the US.
The issue for most of them - as articulated by Norman this week at his Shark
Shootout tournament in California - is not so much the money as a desire to
play each other more often. Trudging round international tour events, other
than the so-called 'majors', partnering a tournament no-hoper, is the good
club amateur's equivalent of playing with a 36 handicapper.
The scheme also makes commercial sense to Fox, since the fans are mainly
interested in what is happening to the handful of players who routinely show
up on the leader board.
Many of the 30-40 stars that Fox now hopes to cherry pick anyway believe
that the vast majority of unsung and unknown professional players have been
riding on their coat-tails. The PGA Tours in Europe and the US - which
represent all players and claim a wider responsibility for the 'orderly
progress' of golf - are both constitutionally and philosophically unable to
satisfy their wishes.
Battle lines are being drawn, with both PGA Tours vowing to protect their
jurisdictions against Fox incursions. But even the PGAs' 'conflicting events
rule' - which gives the authorities a say over which events contracted
players can enter - will count for little if Murdoch woos enough names.
IMG could be pivotal. The group's worldwide golf operations co-ordinator and
senior executive vice-president, Alastair Johnston, said from New York last
night that IMG had 'been approached by Fox in an exploratory capacity'.
He said each client would be counselled and each would have a different
perspective, 'but I can tell you now that the draft contracts submitted by
the organisers are entirely unacceptable. We couldn't approve them.
'We are not going to be bought,' he said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Surprising reversal of fortunes: The return to power of the
former communists - The fall of the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return to power at free elections of politicians with roots in the
pre-1989 communist past counts as one of the most fasci-nating aspects of
the post-Soviet world.
It is particularly remarkable because it has occurred in countries where the
rehabilitation of remodelled former communists might have been least
expected.
These include Lithuania, invaded by the Soviet army in 1940 and forcibly
incorporated with the other Baltic states into the Soviet Union. Last year
Algirdas Brazauskas, former communist leader, was elected president. His
renamed Democratic Labour party had previously trounced the constitutional
nationalists in parliamentary elections.
In Hungary, where citizens fought Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest in
1956, Mr Gyula Horn's socialist party, heir to the Communist party, won a
majority of seats in this year's parliamentary elections. And in Poland,
which had been in a state of semi-insurrection against communist rule for
most of the 1980s, Mr Alexander Kwasniewski's Democratic Left Alliance
(SLD), the Communist party's successor, is the largest party in the ruling
coalition.
Part of the explanation lies in the nature of the last communist governments
in these countries. They were led by pragmatic, nationalistic, reform-minded
leaders, permitted, even encouraged, by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
to embark on structural political and economic changes unthinkable under his
predecessors.
In countries such as Hungary in 1989, the younger generation of communist
leaders were people who had been doing deals and making compromises with
their citizens much like ordinary politicians for years.
The process was often corrupt and morally corrupting. It was summed up in
bitingly accurate jokes such as 'they pretend to pay us and we pretend to
work' or 'he who does not steal from the state robs his own family'.
For ordinary people, this involved trying to live a private inner and family
life and getting around the system as much as possible. For the leaders, it
meant conceding as much freedom to their peoples as Moscow would turn a
blind eye to, for the sake of peace and quiet.
This tacit compact between rulers and ruled, which involved millions of
ordinary citizens in moral and material compromises, was the main reason why
the revolutions of 1989 turned out to be mainly non-violent and surprisingly
lacking in vengeance.
Even so, the speed of rehabilitation of former communists has surprised even
those who have benefited. Hungary's Mr Horn fought as a communist against
the rebels in the 1956 uprising against the Soviet-backed communist regime.
While he could claim credit for opening the Austro-Hungarian border section
of the iron curtain as foreign minister in 1989, many were surprised to see
him back in power within five years of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
They were also surprised by Poland's Mr Kwasniewski. Five years ago, he was
one of the closest collaborators of Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Poland's last
communist prime minister during the round-table negotiations with Solidarity
that led to defeat for the communists in the subsequent elections.
But in September 1993, Mr Kwasniewski's SLD became the largest party in the
Polish parliament and part of the ruling coalition. Since then, he has been
stealthily working towards a realignment of Polish politics, bringing the
social democratic wing of the former communists into alliance with the
liberal free-market and centrist factions of the Solidarity movement to
create a stable, democratic centre/left party.
In much of post-communist Europe, the electoral success of the former
communists can be attributed - at least partly - to the failure of the
politicians who took power after the collapse of the Soviet empire. The new
politicians who have emerged from the rubble of communism were inevitably
inexperienced amateurs.
Most were dissident academics, intellectuals or artists, such as Lithuania's
Vytautis Landsbergis, a music teacher; Hungary's Jozsef Antall, a history
teacher; or Poland's Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a catholic intellectual and
publisher.
They inherited bankrupt economies, passive bureaucracies responding only to
commands, and a long wish-list of expectations. Widening income
differentials between the new entrepreneurs and the unemployed, old and sick
swiftly led to disillusion with change among significant parts of the
electorate that the former communists have been swift to tap.
The country that has proved most impervious to the blandishments of recycled
communists is the Czech Republic. Much of the credit for its swift
transition to a market economy goes to the political skill and economic
clear-mindedness of Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister since mid-1992.
Mr Klaus, contemptuous of what he calls 'irresponsible intellectuals' with
their hankering after a soft 'third way' between the rigours of capitalism
and the blandishments of socialism, hoisted the standard of balanced
budgets, low inflation and mass privatisation. Opinion polls indicate that
he and his party will probably return to power after the 1996 elections.
In addition to the problems of emergence from totalitarianism and collapse
of the integrated Soviet economy, many of the former communist countries
faced the difficult task of state-building. Millions of people who had been
subject to powerful empires - Hapsburg, Ottoman or Romanov - in
pre-communist days found that the collapse of the Soviet empire gave them
the opportunity of self-determination. Ukraine and Belarus in Europe and the
central Asian republics for the first time enjoyed independent statehood.
It is hardly surprising under the circumstances that the combination of
political inexperience, reawakened ethnic and cultural identity and economic
chaos overwhelmed most of the hesitant politicians and economic reformers
who bravely set out on the uncharted voyage of transition in 1989.
Neither is it surprising that the countries that have moved furthest and
fastest along the path to 'normality' are those with the strongest national
identities, the biggest middle classes and most developed economies in the
pre-second world war period. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic
states retained distant memories of independent national status and
democracy that had been snuffed out after the war.
The greatest problems remain in Russia and other states of the former Soviet
Union, which were heading for a form of constitutional monarchy before the
Bolshevik revolution in 1917. They have no democratic tradition to draw upon
in rebuilding their societies.
Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and three years after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, it is clear that the return to political
'normality' and reintegration into the world economy is the task of decades,
and probably generations.
This is the third in a series on the consequences of the fall of communism.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: An educational challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J G C LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'The old school lie' (November 10), John Authers's
comment, 'Parents place increasing weight on exam results', attracted my
attention. As parents who have sacrificed holidays abroad, etc, to finance
education, our aim has been to prepare our children for life rather than
just university entrance. My wife and I want our children to be successful
with their relationships with others as well as contributing with their
professional expertise.
As an employer I do not look for the candidate with the highest academic
achievement, I seek the candidate who will achieve the results I need. This
often requires a range of qualities, particularly those dealing with people
successfully - customers, suppliers, subordinates, peers and others.
May I challenge the FT to produce surveys showing the value of schools in
producing contributors to our community while at the same time leading
rewarding and happy lives.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: No wriggling out of Pergau refund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER BRIOTTAT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Utter contempt' (November 16), rightly condemned
reports that the UK Treasury is considering ways to wriggle out of the High
Court judgment that the decision to give Pounds 234m of aid to the Pergau
dam was unlawful.
The judges ordered the government to unravel the financial mess, and awarded
the World Development Movement the right to return to the courts if the
money is not returned in full to the aid budget.
The refund of this money, illegally spent on an uneconomic project, would
give a much-needed boost to an aid programme fully stretched to meet the
stated objectives of tackling poverty and promoting development. The amount
is, for example, twice as much as all British aid for water and sanitation
for the past five years.
It seems somewhat remiss that the foreign secretary, when faced with
vigorous opposition from his aid department to this uniquely large project,
did not take legal advice - especially since that possibility was considered
internally.
It is unforgivable that there should be any talk now of subverting the High
Court's judgment. The law deserves a little more respect. And WDM,
determined that justice shall be done, will not hesitate to return to the
courts if necessary.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Night of the big gamble: The competition implications of
today's UK lottery draw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The millions who sit down in front of their television screens tonight to
watch the first draw in Britain's new national lottery will not be the only
ones quivering with tension.
Football pools operators, bingo hall proprietors, betting shop owners and
managers of other gambling concerns are deeply apprehensive about the damage
their businesses could suffer as a result of competition from the lottery.
On Monday, they will begin examining their sales figures and assessing the
initial impact of a lottery that has sold over 30m tickets in its first
week.
The gambling industry and leisure analysts are unanimous about which sector
will suffer most. Mr Stephen Devany, head of public affairs at Ladbroke,
which owns casinos, the Vernons pools operation and 1,950 betting shops,
says: 'The pools give us the greatest concern.'
Mr Devany says the pools and the lottery are similar attractions: both
involve choosing numbers. While the pools are based on the outcome of
football results, few entrants think about the results of matches. Mr Devany
says that 90 per cent of pools players choose the same numbers every week.
There has been some cheer for pools operators in the run-up to the lottery's
launch. Legislation affecting the pools has been changed to allow them to
compete more effectively:
The minimum age for pools players has been lowered from 18 to 16.
Pools coupons can now be distributed through betting shops.
Coupons can also be distributed through retail outlets (while this went on
in the past, the law was unclear on whether it was actually allowed).
Under certain circumstances, the pools can roll over their unwon prizes from
week to week to build up a bigger jackpot.
Mr Devany says: 'We suspect the business will decline, but our job is to
make the decline the slowest possible.'
Mr Simon Johnson, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes that view
is optimistic. The decline of the pools 'is likely to be terminal', he says.
Pools players tend to be over 45 and are more likely to be men than women,
Mr Johnson says. While existing participants might continue to fill in their
coupons, younger people will find the lottery more attractive, he says. As
older pools players die, they are unlikely to be replaced.
Mr Johnson believes, however, that casinos will not be significantly
affected by the lottery. A visit to a casino is a social event - and a
relatively expensive one. The Pounds 1 required for a lottery ticket is
unlikely to deflect a serious gambler from visiting a casino.
Mr John Garrett, managing director of the Rank Organisation's recreation
division, which includes its casino operations, goes along with this view
but has been running some special promotions anyway to try to keep regular
customers' loyalty.
Members visiting Rank casinos have been asked to put their business cards
into a barrel. Tonight, cards will be picked out and winners will receive
prizes of up to Pounds 500 worth of national lottery tickets.
Of greater concern to Mr Garrett is the effect of the lottery on Rank's
bingo halls. Rank's research revealed that about 9 per cent of its bingo
players thought they might need to divert some of their spending from bingo
to the lottery.
Mr Garrett says that, in limiting the damage, his most important task is to
maintain the loyalty of his regular customers. In particular, he wants to
make sure they turn up at the bingo halls tonight rather than staying home
to watch the lottery draw. The winning lottery numbers will be announced in
Rank's bingo halls as soon as they are available. Some bingo halls will have
television screens showing the draw live.
Rank has also been giving customers its own version of the national lottery
card, with six numbers chosen for them. If their numbers match those drawn
by the national lottery tonight, they will win a prize of Pounds 100,000.
The amount seems tiny compared with the forecast lottery jackpot tonight of
Pounds 6m, but Mr Garrett says: 'If my punters win Pounds 100,000, they will
be over the moon.'
Mr Johnson says he expects betting shop businesses to be damaged in the
early days of the lottery, but predicts that they will recover. He thinks
some industry estimates of a 5 per cent fall in turnover are unduly
pessimistic.
A relaxation of betting shop restrictions should help to minimise the
impact, says Mr Devany. Betting shops are now allowed to remain open on
summer evenings. From the beginning of next year, they will be permitted to
have clear street-front windows, allowing passers-by to see the inside of
the shops. There will also be 12 days of Sunday racing next year.
Opinion over the effect of the lottery on amusement machines is divided.
While leisure analysts and machine owners say there is likely to be some
fall in business, they are putting their faith in a hard core of machine
gamblers who, they believe, are unlikely to change their habits.
Mr Garrett says Rank has been counting the customers going into its
amusement machine centres this week and there does not appear to be any fall
in numbers. He will only know next week, however, whether they have been
feeding fewer coins into the mach-ines.
While gambling businesses remain uncertain over the precise impact of the
lottery, they are unanimous on one point: the relaxation of the restrictions
on their industry does not go far enough.
The philosophy underlying UK gambling legislation is that operators must not
stimulate demand. This means, for example, that betting shops cannot be
listed in the telephone directory. Bingo companies can advertise, but the
advertisement may not carry the address of a bingo hall. Pools companies can
advertise in newspapers and magazines, but not on television or radio.
Leisure operators argue that the advent of the lottery has made nonsense of
the notion that people should not be encouraged to gamble. They say that the
government, as sponsor of the national lottery, has become the biggest
promoter of gambling, backed by a huge advertising campaign.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, acknowledged the force of some of these
grievances last week in a speech to the British Casino Association. He said
the ban on casino and betting shop advertising would be reconsidered. The
maximum number of jackpot machines would be increased in casinos, bingo
halls and members' clubs.
As they await tonight's draw, the gambling industries console themselves
with one thought: there will be millions more lottery losers tonight than
winners. They hope it will not be long before they can begin filling the
bingo halls, casinos and amusement arcades with disillusioned lottery
punters.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Verbal not oral agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J A G STONEHOUSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Without wishing to be pedantic may I point out that all agreements are
verbal? (Financial Planning, November 12/13).
The word verbal is derived from the Latin verbum meaning word, which can be
written or spoken. The true distinction is between agreements which are oral
and those which are in writing. This was pointed out to me very forcefully,
but courteously, some 40 years ago as a pupil barrister when attempting to
draft a pleading under the gimlet eye of a man who subsequently became a
very senior judge. It is a lesson in logic I have not forgotten.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Electronics can offer the opportunity
to achieve a deeper level of democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JAMES WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Virtually real democracy' (November 15), Joe Rogaly
highlights some of the undoubted dangers of armchair democracy. However, his
argument is based on the incorrect premise that electronic democracy is
inherently dangerous.
Surely the premise should be that, in a democratic society, greater
representation of the electorate is for the underlying good? This is not to
say that there are no dangers: the extremes outlined by Rogaly must clearly
be avoided.
Global interactive media offers enormous opportunity for the voice of the
individual to be heard. But, as important, it provides the channel through
which the individual can he informed and educated.
Not only can it give access to more information in the current one-way
format, but interactively, it allows users to pose questions and receive
answers, and make comments and air concerns. It also allows them to forge
associations nationally and internationally.
Surely an enlightened electorate and responsive global democracy is worth
striving for.
But the era of increased interactivity poses two main challenges to
government and the media. First, in the same way as governments of the 19th
and 20th centuries were faced with a widening of democracy, so the
governments of today and tomorrow must seize the opportunity of deeper
democracy. Second, the media will have a far greater responsibility to
inform the electorate and to shepherd information - but not to distort or
lead.
And, with information and the access to it increasingly synonymous with
power, the role of government will be to make sure this power is equitably
distributed.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Short contracts will not attract best
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY GODDARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The National Association of Pension Funds, in its zeal to correct a
wrong, has forgotten some of the reasons that originated long rolling
contracts.
I have little or no sympathy with under-performing directors who lose their
jobs because of incompetence or worse. However, what about directors who
lose their jobs because of ill health or unwelcome takeovers? Is it fair
that they suffer? I think not.
I worked in headhunting for more than 25 years at the highest level. No able
manager already running a successful business is going to consider a change
unless there is some underpinning of the risk. The potential loss of pension
rights, maturing stock options, bonuses and other fringe benefits cannot be
sufficiently compensated in a move by a large salary increase.
From time to time most companies need the infusion of a high-level manager
from outside and will seek such an individual in a very competitive market
place. Two- or three-year contracts have been part of the inducement for
individuals to undertake the risk.
In spite of careful selection, advice of headhunters and due diligence by
prospective candidates there is still a significant chance of the individual
and company not jelling.
I suspect that, in future, top managers approached about a change of job
only carrying a one-year contract, will feel the balance of risk has swung
too far the other way.

FT  19 NOV 94 / An unwelcome diversion: Ireland's political crisis could
hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven weeks after the IRA ceasefire, fresh uncertainty has descended on the
Northern Ireland peace process, throwing up the possibility of further
delays in the political negotiations to end the 25-year-old conflict.
On Thursday Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, was drummed out of
office, after allegations that he misled parliament over a controversial
extradition case involving a paedophile Catholic priest.
The resignation of Mr Reynolds has left Ireland under a caretaker
administration, while parliament tries to agree a new coalition. But the
absence of a government in Dublin has also left the delicate peace process
apparently frozen.
The crisis was triggered by opposition to the appointment by Mr Reynolds of
Mr Harry Whelehan, a former attorney general, as president of the Irish High
Court.
Mr Whelehan's former office is facing allegations that it delayed for seven
months the extradition of Father Brendan Smyth to face charges in Northern
Ireland of child abuse. Mr Whelehan has also been involved in other
controversial cases, including the investigation in 1991 into the misuse of
official export credits in Ireland's beef scandal. As attorney general, he
issued an injunction in the notorious 1992 'X-case' to prevent a 14-year-old
rape victim travelling to the UK for an abortion.
When Mr Reynolds persisted in making the appointment, the coalition between
his Fianna Fail party and Mr Dick Spring's Irish Labour party collapsed
after 22 months in office. Mr Reynolds resigned as prime minister before a
parliamentary vote of confidence that he would have lost. Mr Whelehan, the
cause of the crisis, resigned from his new office.
At one point, however, it seemed that the affair might have much more
far-reaching consequences. Mr Pat Rabbitte of the Democratic Left, told the
Irish parliament of documents that would 'rock the foundations of the
state'.
Rumours circulated in the Dail, Ireland's parliament, that the head of the
Catholic Church, Cardinal Cahal Daly, may have intervened on Father Smyth's
behalf - a rumour quickly scotched by the Cardinal with good humour.
Such was the massive public interest in the drama unfolding in the Dail,
even pilots on Aer Lingus flights felt obliged to provide their customers
with constant in-flight updates as the government teetered.
Dublin's troubles could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the
peace process. The UK and Irish governments have been locked in talks on the
framework document that will form the basis of future talks involving
Ulster's principal political parties. Ideally, this would have been
finalised before London begins the exploratory talks it has promised to open
with Sinn Fein before Christmas.
Some disruption to the timetable now seems unavoidable. Agreement between
the parties on a new coalition could be days, perhaps weeks away. If the
search fails, parliament will be dissolved and the country will have to go
to the polls. That would certainly require prolonged negotiations over a new
coalition before a government could be formed. It could be into the New Year
before the Irish are ready to push the peace process forward.
The composition of any new coalition could have wide ramifications for the
peace process. All the Irish parties are publicly committed to the process
and all have endorsed the Downing Street Declaration that was signed by Mr
Reynolds and Mr John Major last December.
However, it is widely believed in Dublin that Fianna Fail, a party formed to
oppose partition and the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, may be better placed to
persuade the hardline republicans of Sinn Fein to go along with a
settlement.
Mr Reynolds was criticised, even in Dublin, for being over-hasty in
embracing the Sinn Fein leaders, greeting Mr Gerry Adams, the party's
leader, with a handshake on the steps of Government Buildings less than a
week after the IRA ceasefire. However, Mr Reynolds argued that a bold
gesture was needed from Dublin to bolster the moderates in the movement.
Similar thinking was behind his idea of a cross-party Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation, which had its third sitting in Dublin Castle yesterday.
There are many officials in Dublin who feel it will be difficult in the
short term for a new government to achieve the sort of understanding with
Sinn Fein that Mr Reynolds and his top advisers enjoyed.
Such rapport may be hard to replicate with a government led by Fine Gael,
the main opposition party, a conservative party that is identified
historically as the pro-1921 treaty party. With Fianna Fail on the
opposition benches, Fine Gael might also find it harder to promote the
constitutional change that unionists in the North see as a central part of
any settlement.
Fianna Fail meets today to elect a new leader to succeed Mr Reynolds. The
two names put forward so far are those of outgoing finance minister Mr
Bertie Ahern and Justice Minister Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn. Under a new
leadership, Fianna Fail may be able to form a new coalition with Labour. The
policy programme agreed between the two parties as the basis for the
coalition that is now dissolved remains to be completed. However the bitter
taste of this week's events will not be easily swallowed.
The alternative coalition options may be no easier to put together. Fine
Gael, the main opposition party, could form a parliamentary majority with
Labour and one of the smaller parties. But relations between Mr Spring and
Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, are described as frosty.
Without an early resolution of the political uncertainty, however, progress
on the peace process is likely to be impaired.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Man in the News: A figure of frugality - Andre Middelhoek
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poring over European Union accounts is a pastime that Mr Andre Middelhoek
finds so gripping that he even makes a few hours on a Sunday afternoon for
the sport.
In the smart Luxembourg suburb of Heisdorf, he surrounds himself with papers
chronicling the minutiae of how the EU eats up around Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn)
of European taxpayers' money each year.
But not everyone is grateful for his diligence. This week, in his capacity
as president of the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main
financial watchdog, Mr Middelhoek caught the headlines with a report on
mismanagement, fraud and waste in EU spending.
Packed with examples of lax spending controls, in areas from building to
wine production, the 484-page annual report has raised the hackles of
officials at the European Commission. 'He is more a seeker of publicity than
of solutions,' said one senior European Commission official.
The 62-year-old Dutch economist, a former budget director in the Dutch
ministry of finance, has worked at the court since its inception in 1977 and
has been president since January 1993. His main aim has been to increase the
court's authority over the financial operations of the Commission and the
member states - and, according to a colleague, to 'show to European citizens
that someone is looking after their money'.
As a job, Mr Middelhoek's is close to impossible. No-one can say how much EU
fraud exists, he says, although experts reckon that between 2 per cent and
10 per cent of the budget is wasted either through poor controls or criminal
actions. But his task is made more difficult by the peculiarly unwieldy
nature of the court itself.
Although many observers believe it is meant to detect fraud, its remit is
'to monitor the management of (EU) funds and point out areas within this
field where improvements need to be made'. About half the EU budget is spent
on farm subsidies via the common agricultural policy - an area said to
involve some 70m cash transactions a year - while another quarter goes on
regional spending aimed at boosting the economies of the EU's poorer
countries. Monitoring these kinds of flows means scouring mountains of
paperwork, and interviewing hundreds of government officials from the member
countries who spend most of the EU's budget.
It is the court's 430 staff, roughly half of whom are professional auditors,
who perform this seemingly endless task. They aim to look at each main item
of the EU budget in reasonable detail every five years. In November the
court publishes its findings in its annual report, and every month or two it
publishes documents looking at specific issues, such as the cash spent on
tobacco farming or cotton.
What the court looks at, and when, is decided by a panel of 12 nominally
independent officials, one from each EU member state, who work full-time in
Luxembourg on renewable six-year contracts. They come from backgrounds in
law, politics or government service, and every three years they elect one of
their number as president.
The panel also draws conclusions on where things need to be improved, and
negotiates these changes. It is in this area that Mr Middelhoek's record has
been most criticised.
Combining the panel's disparate officials into a single efficient operation
has proved particularly difficult. The then British court member, Mr Jo
Carey, said two years ago that the institution often seemed like a
'rudderless ship'. Mr Middelhoek's efforts to improve matters through
sessions for strategic thinking have helped a little, although doubts remain
over the organisation's cohesion.
Although gifted with a sharp mind and unflagging energy, Mr Middelhoek is
also said to lack the diplomatic skills needed to win acceptance from the
Commission and member states for new procedures to control spending.
'Middelhoek's good at banging the drum about fraud and waste, but he's not
so good at establishing the relationships to start putting things right,'
said one EU official.
Officials at the court do not disguise that their relationships with the
commission are poor, and commission insiders suggest Mr Middelhoek's lack of
finesse has been responsible for much of this. He has, for example, had a
stand-up row with Mr Bruce Millan, the blunt Brussels commissioner for
regional aid, who felt he was being lectured.
Mr Middelhoek is unhappy that he has never had a proper discussion with Mr
Jacques Delors, the outgoing Commission president. But the absence of a
meeting is put down on the commission side to the court president's
prickliness.
Even Mr Middelhoek's supporters, though praising his dedication and his
ability to work for 18 hours a day, say the Dutchman can sometimes lose
patience with those around him. 'He's not always the most charming boy,'
said one.
Mr Middelhoek certainly does have a combative side, asserting that no EU
member state is keen enough to combat waste and mismanagement. His row with
Mr Carey was particularly bitter. In response to Mr Carey's comments about
the court's lack of direction, he said earlier this year: 'We have read it
all and say (rude noise).'
Mr Carey last year left the court, and is now involved in mediating between
the commission and member governments on disputes over agricultural
spending.
To many, Mr Middelhoek's qualities would seem ideally suited to a mission to
seek out impropriety and push for change. However, the last two years have
shown that, in his particular job, diplomacy is as essential as
determination.
Mr Middelhoek is in the van of those pressing the Commission to introduce
hefty fines on member governments that lack sufficiently tough spending
controls. Many would argue Brussels also needs to introduce more auditors
into its policy directorates to ensure cash is spent wisely.
Mr Middelhoek has just one year left in office to persuade the new crop of
commissioners that he is not just out to grab the headlines, but is also
working at solutions.

FT  19 NOV 94 / One more element of doubt: How London views this week's
events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is doing its best to play down the impact of the power
vacuum in Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. From London's
perspective, there is nothing to be gained by adding to the sense of crisis
that Mr Albert Reynolds's resignation has threatened to stir up.
Most leading Ulster politicians have come round to a similar position. Even
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, emphasised
this week that the peace process was 'bigger than any of us' - although he
warned of 'widespread concern' among nationalists about the effects of Mr
Reynolds's removal.
Mr Adams's choice of words was uncannily similar to that of Mr David Ervine
of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist
paramilitaries. According to Mr Ervine, 'this is a bigger issue than any
individual'.
Both moderate and hardline unionists have indicated that on balance they
think the peace process will gain from the fall of a prime minister whom
they felt was influenced to an uncomfortable degree by Mr Adams.
More important, they argue, is whether the IRA is ready to renounce violence
permanently. Many unionists remain unconvinced. Mr William Ross, the Ulster
Unionist chief whip, says: 'I have always been sceptical and I have seen
nothing in recent weeks or days to change my mind.'
However, the collapse of the Dublin coalition has added new elements of
doubt to a process that was already difficult. The piece of the jigsaw most
clearly in danger is the much-delayed joint framework document the two
governments have been striving to agree.
This document will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's
principal political parties. At its heart will be a constitutional trade-off
under which Dublin would remove its territorial claim to the province in
return for changes to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act enshrining
partition.
Speaking within hours of Mr Reynolds's resignation, senior British officials
said the two governments were 'close' to agreement. But this week's events
are unlikely to help the work of the so-called 'liaison committee' of
British and Irish officials who are working on the framework document.
The pace of progress on exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist
representatives - due to start before Christmas, provided the ceasefire
holds - may also be slowed. This is because the liaison committee has yet to
complete its work on developing a co-ordinated north-south approach to
decommissioning paramilitary arsenals.
The British government expects the handover of these weapons to be close to
the top of the agenda when these talks get under way. Unless the committee
continues to work while a new Irish government emerges, London may have to
start the talks before the liaison committee's report is ready. Officials
can pursue technical points in the absence of a government in Dublin, but
they will soon need fresh political direction.
Another imponderable is the personal chemistry between Mr Major and the new
Irish premier. While the UK prime minister and Mr Reynolds had their
disagreements, they seemed to be on the same wavelength. This was invaluable
in underpinning the peace process's credibility at moments when relations
between London and Dublin were strained.
London will be keen for Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Irish Labour party, to
retain a prominent role in the process. This would ensure an element of
continuity.
Although Mr Major has won plaudits for his handling of the peace process,
there was a growing feeling, even before this week, that time was beginning
to press. Events in Dublin have reinforced that feeling, but have also made
it more difficult for the two governments to respond to it.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The risks of euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like an errant teenager, the British economy has often promised to change
its ways, only to disappoint. Usually those in charge are themselves
deceived, before deceiving almost everyone else. This has now become the
main danger confronting the UK. As in much of the industrial world, things
economic have been going increasingly well. Maybe, as economists at the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank have argued, this is the end of the inflationary
era. But any policy-maker who acts on that assumption would be a fool.
Fortunately, Alan Greenspan, the cautious and wily chairman of the Federal
Reserve, does not fall into this category. By raising short-term interest
rates a further three-quarters of a percentage point this week, he and his
colleagues acted to slow the rate of expansion of the US economy to what
they believed, on the best available evidence, to be its sustainable rate of
economic growth. They may be wrong. But it was still the right thing to do.
If a policy-maker turns out to be over-optimistic, the economy will overheat
and inflation will rise to excessive levels. The costs of wringing inflation
out of the system, once forward momentum has become strong, are high and in
part irreversible, while the time required to do so is also long.
In the UK, for example, the price paid for the 13.8 per cent expansion of
the economy between 1986 and the second quarter of 1990 was almost four
years of recession and slow recovery, before output finally returned to its
previous peak level. Even in the third quarter of this year, GDP was only 3
per cent above its previous peak.
If, however, policy had been more cautious in the late 1980s, the expansion
might well have continued - or at least the subsequent downturn could have
been shorter and shallower. If, for example, economic growth had averaged as
little as 2 1/4 per cent a year since 1986, output this year would be 2 1/2
per cent greater than it now seems likely to be.
These considerations must guide policy-makers, not least a chancellor of the
exchequer framing a budget. He must not confuse the cycle with the trend. He
has also to keep his head, while all around are losing theirs.
Good news
Certainly, almost all the news is good. Gross domestic product grew 4.2 per
cent in the year to the third quarter, with 30 per cent of the expansion
generated by the improvement in net exports. Notwithstanding rapid economic
growth, the trade deficit on goods and services is estimated at less than 1
per cent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1994. Retail sales continue
to expand at a measured pace. They were up 0.1 per cent between September
and October and 3.1 over October 1993. The public sector borrowing
requirement in April to October of this year is already Pounds 7.2bn less
than it was last financial year.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell another 46,000 in the month to October
13, to 2.52m. It is 455,000 down from its peak in December 1992. With output
per head rising 6 per cent in the three months ending September 1994, unit
labour costs in manufacturing also fell by 1.4 per cent over that period.
Average earnings
The decline in unit labour costs partly reflects the slow rate of increase
in earnings. The underlying annual increase in whole economy average
earnings remained at 3 3/4 per cent in September, which is consistent with
achievement of the government's inflation target of 1-2 1/2 per cent by the
end of this parliament. That target has already been achieved, with retail
prices, excluding mortgage interest payments, rising just 2 per cent over
the year to October. This index is, in fact, no higher than in May. With
broad money provisionally estimated to have expanded over the six months to
October at an annualised rate of just 2.4 per cent, even monetarists will be
unable to detect the smallest danger of inflation.
It is always possible to find something to moan about: gross fixed capital
formation declined by 1 per cent over the last quarter. In all, however, the
picture is one of rapid growth with low inflation.
It is possible that it will stay so. Credit growth is slow because the
housing market has been flattened, partly by the decline in nominal prices
during the last recession. Consequently, monetary growth has almost
disappeared. The commitment to full employment is known by wage bargainers
to have gone. Unions are much weaker than before, as the cavalier way they
are being treated by Mr Blair's Labour Party demonstrates. Meanwhile,
greater competition within the economy seems to transmit disinflationary
forces into lower prices, not just into lower levels of output.
Hoping that this expansion will be different - longer, stronger and, above
all, less inflationary - than previous ones is reasonable. But that outcome
is not certain and must not be assumed in policy. Let policy-makers position
themselves to be pleasantly surprised. That way they also have the best
chance of ensuring both they - and the British people - actually will be.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Manufacturing investment shows surprise fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The level of investment by British manufacturers showed a surprise fall in
the third quarter of the year, official figures yesterday showed.
The drop disappointed industry groups and surprised economists who had been
predicting that investment, which has lagged behind the rest of the economic
recovery, would pick up sharply in the coming months.
Nevertheless, analysts yesterday pointed out that the quarterly investment
figures were volatile and prone to revision.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total capital spending of
manufacturing industry was Pounds 2.736bn in the third quarter of this year,
measured at seasonally adjusted 1990 prices.
This was 1 per cent lower than the second quarter and broadly unchanged from
the same period a year ago.
Most of the quarterly fall stemmed from a drop in the level of investment in
buildings and vehicles. New building work fell 7.3 per cent between the
second and third quarters, although it remains 11 per cent higher than the
third quarter of last year.
Spending on vehicles fell 12 per cent in the third quarter compared with the
second quarter, and remains 16 per cent below the third quarter last year.
Spending on plant and machinery, which accounts for three-quarters of
manufacturing investment, rose 0.8 per cent. It was barely different from
the levels seen a year ago.
On a sectoral basis, the main increase in investment in the quarter was in
the engineering, electronic, optical and transport sectors. Investment by
chemicals, metals and non-metallic mineral products companies fell.
Economists had expected that investment would rise sharply, given that the
corporate sector is increasingly cash rich and that recent surveys have
suggested that the recent strong manufacturing growth has started to create
capacity problems in some sectors.
The Engineering Employers Federation, which had been predicting that a surge
in investment would boost the UK engineering sector, yesterday admitted that
it was 'disappointed' by the figures.
Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the federation, said the figures could be
affected by the system of seasonal adjustment used, which reduced the third
quarter's real investment spending by about a tenth.
He said: 'The published figures are disappointing but it doesn't necessarily
mean that the upward trend in investment has run out of steam.'
Separate indicators yesterday suggested that companies were relatively
upbeat about future demand. Stocks held by manufacturers rose Pounds 181m at
seasonally adjusted 1990 prices in the third quarter, compared with a Pounds
26m in the second quarter.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Society home loans drop 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further gloom descended on the UK mortgage market yesterday with the release
of figures showing that new net mortgage lending by building societies
dropped by almost 30 per cent last month compared with September, to reach
its lowest level since February.
Statistics from the Building Societies Association showed new net lending at
Pounds 788m in October, compared with Pounds 1.11bn the previous month.
In contrast to recent months, when figures have not been encouraging but
have shown a slight rise compared with the same month last year, this is
lower than the Pounds 825m net lending undertaken by societies in October
last year.
While the drop may reflect fears about future interest rate rises, these
loans will have been agreed before the 0.5 of a percentage point rise in
interest rates during September.
The rise in mortgage rates in response to that may be a further depressant
factor which has yet to feed through.
The amount of net new commitments - which will translate into loans
undertaken in the coming weeks and so is a forward-looking indicator - fell
to Pounds 2.81bn in October from Pounds 2.97bn the month before. Although
the October level is higher than the same month last year, the drop between
September and October is greater this year.
The number of net new commitments - at 46,000 - was lower than in October
last year when it stood at 48,000.
New gross lending in October also slipped - by almost 9 per cent to Pounds
2.9bn, compared with Pounds 3.19bn in September - but remained above last
October's figure of Pounds 2.6bn.
Mr Peter Williams, BSA head of research and external affairs, said the
'disappointing' fall in net advances reflected the fears of interest rate
rises and uncertainty in the approach to the Budget. Even the subdued levels
of activity expected in the coming months could be put at risk by Budget
changes, he said.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the figures
for new mortgage approvals, when adjusted for seasonal variations, were the
weakest since July and were clearly showing the effects of the September
rate rise.
But Mr Rob Thomas, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, expressed doubt that
the interest rate rise had an immediate effect. He said more important
factors were uncertainty about the Budget and the cumulative impact of some
months without a clear injection of confidence in the market.
There was, however, better news for societies on savings with an
unexpectedly high net retail inflow of Pounds 871m in October - about 40 per
cent more than in October last year.
Statistics released separately by the British Bankers' Association showed
new mortgage lending by banks in October at Pounds 572m - below the recent
average monthly figure of more than Pounds 600m.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Dissident Tories attacked over PO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Martin, Conservative MP for Portsmouth South, hit out in the
Commons yesterday at Tory backbenchers who forced the abandonment of plans
to privatise Royal Mail.
During the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech he underlined his concern
about the effect their success 'could well have' on the direction of
government policy.
Mr Martin resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary, so that he could speak on the issue.
To nods of approval from some of his backbench colleagues Mr Martin
complained that the right policy and the right future for Royal Mail had
been 'scuppered' by the dissidents.
He said it should be left to Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs to argue that
free enterprise and the free market could not provide services in the public
interest.
Mr Martin said that Royal Mail required a great deal more money and freedom
to compete with domestic and foreign rivals. The crucial argument was
whether this could be done with ministers and civil servants deciding how
much money was required, or with private money raised through commercial
channels.
Mr Martin highlighted the success achieved by British Telecommunications
since it took control of the telecommunications network from the Post
Office.
While criticising the 'ridiculous salaries' paid to top executives in water
and electricity undertakings, he said that the overall success of
privatisation would help the Conservatives to achieve a further general
election victory.
During the debate Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced new
restrictions on the home leave privileges available to prisoners nearing the
end of their sentences, or on compassionate grounds.
Insisting the safety of the public had to be paramount, he said that, with
immediate effect, a much more rigorous risk assessment would be made before
any temporary release was permitted.
The new system was likely to lead to a cut of about 40 per cent in the
number of prisoners released temporarily.
Meanwhile the government hopes to secure an early change in the law
authorising confiscation of money and property acquired through criminal
activities in the six years before a conviction.
A bill to achieve this objective is in preparation and Mr Michael Howard,
the home secretary, told the Commons yesterday that it would have government
support if introduced as a private member's measure by a backbench MP.
The bill would also ensure that the confiscation order could not be avoided
by serving a term of imprisonment in default.
The ballot for the right to introduce private members' bills will be held on
Thursday.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Consumers boost GDP rise in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that economic recovery was being powered by export and investment
growth were dashed by yesterday's gross domestic product figures.
The breakdown of GDP from the Central Statistical Office shows that the
British consumer is still going strong. Consumer spending rose 0.5 per cent
between the second and third quarters and was 2.3 per cent higher than in
the previous year.
While recent retail sales figures have shown signs of a slowdown in high
street spending, the consumer has nevertheless been remarkably resilient in
the face of this year's tax increases.
Consumers contributed about a third of the 0.9 per cent third-quarter GDP
rise. Just under a half was due to the improvement in the trade position.
The hoped-for investment boom faltered as gross domestic fixed capital
formation fell in the third quarter - although it was still 2.3 per cent
higher than a year ago.
While the upward revision to third-quarter GDP had been expected, after
strong industrial production figures for September, the change in the
estimate of second-quarter growth from 1.1 per cent to 1.3 per cent was more
surprising.
The CSO said part of the reason for the rise was a jump in the estimate for
agricultural production, but the bulk of the increase came from the services
sector.
After allowing for all the revisions, GDP is about 3.2 per cent above its
previous peak and 7.1 per cent above the trough reached in the recession.
The revisions confirm earlier views, expressed by some of the chancellor's
panel of independent forecasters, that official figures had been
underestimating GDP growth.
There are three ways of measuring gross domestic product: output, income and
expenditure. The CSO found that the income and expenditure measures were
growing faster than the output indicator. Revisions have been made to align
the output measure with the other two.
This alignment is achieved by adjusting the stocks figure. So while the
statistics show a Pounds 925m rise in stocks and work-in-progress in the
third quarter, the biggest rise for five years, this statistic will be
treated with caution.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Clouds over the sunset regions: Why the funding system for
community care has hit coastal and rural councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a social services conference on the Isle of Wight two years ago Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, announced funding arrangements for
the reform of community care that even her critics admitted looked
unexpectedly generous.
Ironically, the Isle of Wight County Council this week became the first
local authority to have spent dry its community care budget, only two thirds
of the way through the financial year.
The island - where more than a quarter of the population is above retirement
age - is not alone in facing problems. Gloucestershire County Council, with
its care programme Pounds 1m in the red, started handling only emergency
cases from Tuesday. Other local authorities are likely to be in serious
difficulties before the end of the financial year.
The new community care system is intended to help elderly people and those
with handicaps live in the community rather than institutions, and the
councils in trouble are those in coastal and rural areas with big elderly
populations.
The government has no plans, at least at present, to make emergency funds
available to councils such as the Isle of Wight, which says it needs at
least Pounds 500,000 to keep community care services running until April.
But if more councils run into trouble in the coming winter ministers may be
forced to take emergency action.
Many local authority social services officials fear, however, that the
problems are not temporary but the first evidence that the financial regime
announced by Mrs Bottomley two years ago was not generous enough after all.
The immediate difficulties for authorities such as the Isle of Wight and
Gloucestershire arise from changes in the allocation of funds between
1993-94 and 1994-95. In the first year of the new system money was divided
between individual councils on a 50-50 basis which took account of
population structures - factors such as the proportion of elderly people -
and the number of residential homes in each area.
This benefited coastal and rural councils with large numbers of residential
homes but was disastrous for cities such as London, which have relatively
few homes but face heavy pressure on community care services. So this year
funding was calculated on population structure alone, to the disadvantage of
areas such as the Isle of Wight and Gloucestershire.
However, Ms Denise Platt, Association of Metropolitan Authorities
undersecretary for social services, regards the change in the allocation
formula as a red herring. She said: 'It has pushed the immediate pressure
from one part of the country to another. But the real problem is that the
volume of people seeking community care services is much higher than was
expected when the financial arrangements were introduced.'
This view was supported by Mr Deryk Mead, Gloucestershire's director of
social services, this week when he announced the county's financial crisis.
He said: 'We have had 18 months' experience of implementing care and the
number of people coming forward is far higher than was expected two years
ago. The government had attempted to devise a fair formula but now had to
recognise that things had 'worked out differently in practice'.
Local authorities blame 'cost shunting' by the National Health Service for
part of the unexpectedly high number of people seeking community care, with
patients who might have previously received long term nursing care being
referred instead to councils' community care services and budgets.
These budgets are still heavily concentrated on providing residential care.
Although the new system is intended to free funds for domiciliary care,
these new services are proving slow to develop in many areas.
Ms Platt said another factor was that the highly publicised community care
reforms had proved a victim of their own success. Elderly people were
exhorted to go to their local councils for community care assessment and had
done so.
Councils have powers to vary the criteria by which they define individuals'
care needs. The easiest way of making the available money go further is to
adopt tighter criteria.
But with so few councils in Conservative control, demanding more money from
the government is likely to prove a more politically acceptable option.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Growth of M4 at its lowest for a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual rate of growth in M4, the broadest measure of money supply, fell
towards the lower end of the government's target range in October, official
figures showed yesterday.
The Bank of England said M4, comprising bank deposits, bank lending and all
other forms of money, grew 3.8 per cent in the year to October.
This was the lowest rate for almost a year, and towards the bottom of the
government's target inflation for M4 of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent.
Measured on a seasonally adjusted basis, the annual growth rate was 3.9 per
cent.
The size of the drop yesterday surprised the City, which had previously
predicted an unadjusted annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. In September the
unadjusted annual growth rate was 4.8 per cent.
The key reason for the drop was subdued growth in the level of bank lending.
Total sterling lending by the main British banks to the UK private sector
rose Pounds 610m in October. Although this was higher than the very low
increase in September, it was below the previous six-monthly average of
Pounds 712m.
Borrowing by companies fell in the month as the corporate sector continued
to repay bank debts accrued before and during the recession. Manufacturers
repaid Pounds 233m in October and financial companies Pounds 341m.
Lending to the personal sector grew by Pounds 759m in October, a slightly
higher level than in the previous month. But although consumer credit rose
quite strongly, mortgage lending rose at a slower rate than in recent
months.
The Treasury said that another reason for the drop in M4's annual growth
rate was that the third tranche of British Telecom shares had depressed bank
deposits.
Meanwhile, corporation tax payments had been higher this October, compared
with last October, partly as a result of new initiatives to persuade
companies to spread tax payments throughout the year. The Treasury said the
drop in M4 suggested that companies had chosen to pay this corporation tax
through their deposits, rather than by taking on new borrowing.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Move to attract foreign companies to Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 400 international companies are being invited to the International
Investment Forum on Northern Ireland, to be opened by Mr John Major in
Belfast on December 13.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, is expected to address the
conference, which is aimed at boosting the number of foreign companies
investing in the province as part of the process of reviving its economy in
the wake of IRA and Loyalist ceasefires.
Tackling Northern Ireland's endemic high unemployment is seen as an
important part of the peace process. The province's unemployment rate - 12.7
per cent - remains about 3 percentage points higher than the national
average. Unemployment is particularly high among males in city centres such
as Belfast and Derry.
The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland says the province has
enjoyed one of its best years for foreign investment.
In the 12 months to March 1994 new investment totalled Pounds 505m, of which
Pounds 260m was new foreign inward investment. The inward investment created
2,300 new jobs net. The investment figure for this year should be higher
because of the controversial Hualon project from Taiwan.
The IDB believes that the province's violent image has deterred potential
investors. The conference will be told that a peaceful Northern Ireland
holds considerable attractions for foreign investors - with a highly skilled
workforce based on engineering industries and wage levels 16 per cent lower
than those in mainland Britain.
The IDB says land and property is considerably cheaper than in Great
Britain. It is able to offer a package of incentives which can include 50
per cent of start-up costs. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party, is expected to receive a rapturous reception
from the 600 delegates to the party's 24th annual conference over the
weekend.
His keynote speech is expected to cover the future of the peace process in
the next 12 months. Opening the conference at Cookstown, Co Tyrone,
yesterday, Mr Mark Dirkan, the party chairman, reiterated the SDLP demand
for a dual referendum on both sides of the Irish border on any political
agreement reached about the future of Northern Ireland.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Lilley hints at benefits boost for low-paid workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday indicated that improvement of in-work benefits for
the low paid would be the first priority for future reforms of the social
security system.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said the dispersion of
earnings power in the past two decades was the most significant social
problem facing western governments.
In what may foreshadow further measures in this month's Budget to make it
easier for the unemployed to take low-paid jobs, Mr Lilley said: 'Creating
and maintaining incentives to work has been at the centre of my review of
social security. They will remain there.'
In a lecture prepared for the Conservative Political Centre in Northern
Ireland, he said the widening of pay differentials between the skilled and
the unskilled was not only a main cause of unemployment.
In a marked shift in government rhetoric, he said the squeeze on earnings
power at the bottom end of the income scale had become intertwined with many
of Britain's social problems.
He said: 'It may play a major part in the break-up of families, the growth
of lone parenthood and a growing welfare dependency. It may even play a part
in explaining delinquency and crime.'
Mr Lilley stressed the widening earnings power of the skilled and unskilled
was an international phenomenon.
In countries with flexible labour markets such as the US and, more recently,
Britain, the impact had been to increase income disparities among those in
work. In other, less flexible economies, the biggest effect had been felt in
higher unemployment rates among unskilled workers.
Rejecting 'artificial' mechanisms to push up low pay - trade barriers
against developing countries, a national minimum wage or restrictions on new
technology - Mr Lilley said the long-term solution lay in improving the
education, training and skills of the workforce.
State intervention to make employers pay more would simply result in higher
unemployment. But better trained and more highly skilled workers would
command higher wages.
Mr Lilley said the immediate priority was to ensure that the interaction of
the labour market and the benefits system did not discourage the unskilled
from taking work. Employment provided a basis for the low-paid to improve
their marketable skills.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Maker of Reliant in receivership: Bad debts cripple Beans
Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beans Industries, the automotive component maker and manufacturer of the
three-wheeled Reliant Robin car and Scimitar sports car, has run out of
cash.
The directors of Beans on Thursday evening asked their bankers to call in Mr
Mark Hopton and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick, Birmingham, as
receivers.
The group's failure comes when demand for its products had increased to the
extent that it recently introduced overtime working at its car plant in
Tamworth, Staffordshire, and its engineering works in Tipton, West Midlands.
The receivers plan to sell Beans as a going concern.
Beans, founded in 1919, won a place in motor history with its pre-second
world war construction of a world land speed record holder, the Thunderbolt.
It acquired Reliant from the receivers in 1991 and produced a restyled
Scimitar in 1992. It was once part of the old British Leyland group, Rover's
precursor.
Mr Oldfield said yesterday that Beans had bad debts of nearly Pounds 2m
which had 'a dramatic effect on cashflow'. In the year to December 1992, the
last for which accounts are available, Beans had a turnover of Pounds 15.1m.
The debts date back three years and stem from the failure of AWD, the
Bedford truck manufacturer, and Leyland Daf Vans, both of which called in
receivers. Although these companies have since been resurrected, there were
not sufficient funds to pay unsecured creditors such as Beans. 'Beans had
been working for nothing,' said Mr Oldfield.
He added: 'The directors went to the bankers for more money. They were
unable to comply with the request.' Mr Oldfield refused to name the bankers.
The 1992 accounts show that Beans had long-term debt of Pounds 3.37m,
however.
Mr Hopton said he had received half a dozen inquiries from people who had
already been in preliminary talks with the company's management.
Beans is making up to 15 Reliant cars a week. Its 95 employees at Tamworth
also turn out five Pounds 15,000, two-seater Scimitars every week.
Beans' customers for automotive components include Rover, Automotive
Products and GKN. Yesterday both customers and suppliers telephoned the
Tipton works 'seeking comfort', as Mr Oldfield put it.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Beans' rundown of Tipton factory ironic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ironic that Beans' rundown Tipton factory shares space with Advanced
Engineering Systems, a Unipart subsidiary whose managing director, Mr Frank
Burns, controls both AES and its sister operation, Premier Exhausts - 1993's
'factory of the year', John Griffiths writes.
Even more ironically, Beans itself sold AES to Unipart two years ago - with
potentially life-saving trial contracts to supply motor components to
Toyota's Burnaston car plant in Derbyshire.
Machined castings and other parts for Toyota and Honda provide most of the
turnover at AES, which Unipart regards - with Premier - as its lean
manufacturing 'flagships'.
Mr Burns acknowledges that Unipart bought AES from Beans - which prior to
the sale also reconditioned engines for Unipart - solely because of the
Toyota contracts and the chance to start a long-term relationship with
Japan's largest carmaker.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Dorrell acts over dramatic freebies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the national heritage minister, has imposed strict new
limits on his officials' acceptance of free tickets to the opera, theatre
and cinema.
Whitehall insiders say the minister's ruling has fallen particularly hard on
the most senior mandarins. They are accustomed to being courted for funds by
the department's clients in the agreeable surroundings of Glyndebourne or
the National Theatre.
But Mr Dorrell, who told his officials some weeks ago that he wanted a
stricter regime, decided that the freebies were inconsistent with an
arm's-length relationship with the lobbyists.
His instruction coincided with the recent furore over political sleaze. It
followed a separate instruction earlier this year from Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary, banning civil servants from collecting 'air miles' while
travelling on official business.
The heritage department stressed yesterday that Mr Dorrell had not imposed a
blanket ban. Officials would still be permitted to accept free tickets if
their attendance at a particular event was directly relevant to a project.
But Mr Dorrell expects many more empty seats in London's royal boxes.

FT  19 NOV 94 / BR unveils range of fare rises up to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail and London Underground yesterday announced fare increases of up
to 5 per cent - double the rate of inflation - for millions of travellers in
the new year.
Passenger groups and opposition politicians condemned the rises.
On some BR routes where there is tough competition from cars, coaches and
the airlines there will be no fare increases. But on those where fares will
rise increases will be between 2 per cent and 5 per cent. Most BR fare
increases will take effect from January 8.
London Transport, which will raise fares from February 5, said Underground
fares would rise by an average 5 per cent although most bus fares would
remain unchanged. The price of Travelcards, which allow travellers to switch
between trains, the Underground and buses, will increase by up to 9 per
cent.
The Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, a national watchdog
representing rail passengers, said the overall level of increases was too
high and would deter passengers from trains.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, blamed the cost of rail
privatisation for diverting funds from improving the railways.
BR said the 25 regional train operating companies which played an important
role in setting fare levels had to raise more money to finance investments,
but they could not ignore competitive pressures.
The signal workers' strike last summer cost BR Pounds 200m. Before it
numbers of commuters and leisure travellers using the railway had started to
increase.
The new fares include:
Unchanged: InterCity West Coast's long-distance and sleeper fares, Great
Western's leisure fares and Scotrail's Strathclyde services.
No average fare increase: Train operating companies Anglia Railways,
InterCity Cross Country, InterCity East Coast, Merseyrail Electrics and
Regional Railways North East. Three per cent increase: Cardiff Valleys and
InterCity West Coast. Also Sussex Coast lines, North London, South Eastern's
suburban and Kent Coast lines and Solent &amp; Wessex.
Five per cent increase: Chiltern Lines, Great Eastern, London Tilbury and
Southend, Thames Trains and Thameslink.

Prosecutors in Scotland would be allowed to comment on an accused person's
silence under government proposals in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) bill,
foreshadowed in the Queen's Speech and published yesterday.
Labour last night attacked the proposal, saying it was contrary to the views
of the Scottish Office's advisers and had not been foreshadowed in the white
paper.
Mr John McFall, a Labour spokesman, said yesterday: 'The whole basis of the
criminal justice system in Scotland rests on the assumption that a person is
innocent until proven guilty. This is a fundamental attack on that
assumption.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / ICI criticises electricity prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the chemicals company, yesterday criticised electricity pricing
structures following a 60 per cent rise in prices it pays for power since
the summer. It said the Office of Electricity Regulation had failed to
ensure reasonably stable and competitive prices.
The Association of Independent Electricity Producers said the average price
in the electricity wholesale pool was likely to be within limits agreed
between the regulator and the two main generators. 'There is no reason to
believe that winter and summer prices should be the same,' it said.
ICI and other big electricity consumers which buy power directly from the
wholesale pool have for long campaigned for pricing structure changes. ICI
said yesterday its Cheshire-based chlor-alkali business faced bills of more
than Pounds 1m a week following the latest rises. Foreign competitors
enjoyed lower and more stable prices, it said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prison officers who refused to accept new prisoners into an overcrowded jail
were acting unlawfully, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice Keene said the officers at Preston prison had an 'understandable
anxiety' that a breach of the peace might occur, but he rejected their
argument that they had an overriding 'constabulary power' to disobey their
governor's orders to continue admitting new inmates.
In the highly regulated and disciplined atmosphere of a prison it was
essential that a governor's lawful orders, based on Home Office admissions
criteria, prevailed over the individual discretion of his officers, the
judge said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Five frontrunners for Hogg's No 10 job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Tyrie, a former adviser to Mr John Major and Lord Lawson during
their terms as chancellor, and Mr Nicholas True, deputy head of the Downing
Street Policy Unit, are emerging as strong candidates to succeed Mrs Sarah
Hogg as head of the unit.
Other contenders include Mr Michael Fallon, the former Conservative MP for
Darlington, who lost his seat at the last general election, Mr Alastair Ross
Goobey, chief executive of Postel Investment Management, the UK's largest
pension fund, and Mr Danny Finkelstein, head of the Social Market
Foundation.
Following a Queen's Speech which was widely seen as lacklustre, Conservative
officials believe the replacement for Mrs Hogg - who announced this week
that she would be leaving the job - will play a vital role in generating new
ideas in the run-up to the next election.
Mr Major's choice for the job, which involves planning the prime minister's
broad political strategy, will send an important signal about the direction
government policy should take.
Mr Tyrie, a shrewd and abrasive figure on the centre-right of the party, is
senior economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr True is one of the prime minister's principal speech-writers. Senior
Tories categorise him as a 'safe pair of hands', though some have blamed him
for the ill-fated 'back-to-basics' policy.
Mr Fallon, a committed supporter of the free market, would be a popular
choice among rightwing MPs, who argue that the policy unit must give the
government clear political direction.
However, he wishes to fight a seat at the next general election, which would
be incompatible with the policy unit post under Whitehall rules.
Instead, Mr Fallon might be more suited to the post of head of the
Conservative Research Department if, as expected, Mr Andrew Lansley quits
the position later this year.
Mr Ross Goobey, who was a Treasury adviser to Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, is the most heavyweight of the contenders. But there are doubts
about whether he would quit his lucrative job to join Downing Street.
Mr Finkelstein has been instrumental in the development of a number of
rightwing policies in recent years. His biggest handicaps are his youth  -
he is in his early thirties - and his past as a former parliamentary
candidate for the Social Democratic party. However, he has developed the
Social Market Foundation into one of the more impressive and influential
think-tanks in Whitehall, producing a stream of policy reports that have
influenced government policy.
'He has all the intellectual credentials, and would provide some much-needed
rigour,' said one Tory official.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Anglers hooked by permit sales at Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Something fishy is going on in the sedate world of freshwater angling.
Sales of rod-fishing licences are soaring. The National Rivers Authority has
sold more in the first seven months of the current financial year in England
and Wales than it did in the whole of last year.
By the end of October the NRA had sold 966,000 licences and exceeded its
full-year revenue target of Pounds 11.8m. In 1993-94 895,000 licences were
sold, raising Pounds 10.1m.
Is the pastime more popular? Or anglers more law-abiding? Is there another
explanation?
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, says he knows. He
attributes the surge to the fact that rod-fishing licences have been
available in 17,000 post offices since March. Before then anglers bought
licences from fishing-tackle shops.
He said: 'The Rivers Authority cannot believe their luck. The potency of the
network of post offices in growing a market is very significant.'
The NRA agrees that the increase is due to 'better distribution and better
promotion'.
It has also changed the licensing system this year, introducing more
short-term permits and splitting the annual licence, which used to cover all
species, into coarse-fishing and game-fishing categories.
With annual licences valid from the start of the fishing season on April 1,
the NRA acknowledges that sales are concentrated around that period.
Nevertheless, annual licences for 1994-95 - allowing the holder to fish
anywhere in England and Wales if local by-laws permit - are still selling.
The Post Office's right to sell the licences was approved by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in spite of opposition from Mr
Michael Portillo, the former chief secretary to the Treasury.
In an exchange of letters revealed last December Mr Heseltine is said to
have told his colleague to 'get your hook off my line'.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Labour attacks Major over EU finance bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused Mr John Major of playing games with the Commons by
allowing Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to open a debate on the European
Union finance bill a week on Monday.
As Labour's parliamentary strategists pored over the two-clause bill,
published yesterday, senior officials said Mr Tony Blair was 'surprised' by
a Downing Street announcement that Mr Clarke would open the debate.
Mr Major surprised rebel Tory backbenchers on Wednesday by threatening to
call a general election unless the bill was passed 'in all its essentials'.
However, both main opposition parties accused the government of causing
confusion by failing to clarify whether it would accept amendments to the
bill.
The confusion deepened in the Lords on Thursday when Lord Henley, defence
undersecretary, told peers that 'the whole bill must be passed without
amendment'.
Downing Street said Lord Henley's comments were in line with the prime
minister's announcement.
Labour officials said the party was considering abstaining on the second
reading unless Mr Major clarified the status of the vote.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, said: 'It looks like turning into
a charade aimed solely at providing John Major with the illusion of a
short-term triumph. If that is all it is, we will have none of it.'
If Labour did abstain, the Liberal Democrats would probably follow suit,
leading to a farcical situation in which Tory MPs would be whipped through
the lobbies to save the government while opposition MPs failed to vote.
Both opposition parties support the principle of the bill, which will raise
UK contributions to the EU in line with an agreement reached at the 1992
Edinburgh summit.
But Labour is concerned that it might be 'suckered' into opposing the bill
on the basis that it was an issue of confidence, only to be pilloried by the
Tories for inconsistency.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, increased the pressure
on the government to clarify the position by tabling a written question
asking Mr Major to list the essential elements of the bill.
He said: 'The official responses from the prime minister still leave many
questions unanswered. Parliament has the right to know exactly what these
'essentials' are before the key votes on November 28.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / Lobbyists force change: Gummer bows to pressures over powers
of Environment Agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday bowed to intense
pressure from environmental groups and made changes to the legislation
setting up the Environment Agency that will control pollution in England and
Wales.
He also announced the appointment of Lord de Ramsey, a farmer and
businessman, as chairman of the advisory body preparing the way for the new
agency. Lord de Ramsey is expected to become the agency's Pounds 50,000 a
year, part-time chairman.
Environmental groups were universal in their condemnation of the terms of
the bill when they were announced in Wednesday's Queen's Speech. They said
it substantially weakened existing powers by giving the agency 'aims' rather
than 'duties'.
Mr Gummer said there had been no intention to weaken the legislation and he
would amend the wording 'so as to provide a clear duty not simply to
consider conservation issues in relation to all the agency's functions but
to further conservation as appropriate'.
He refused, however, to budge on another matter of great concern to
environmentalists - a clause insisting that environmental regulation 'must
take proper account of costs and benefits'. Nevertheless, Mr Gummer said he
would ensure that this clause was not used by organisations to win more time
before having to comply with regulations.
Friends of the Earth said last night that it seemed as if Mr Gummer was
'giving back only half of what we had before' in pollution control powers.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said: 'We will be reassured
when the actual wording of the bill is published. The new agency and its
counterpart in Scotland must have a clear duty to further nature
conservation.'
The new agency will combine the operations of the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) with the Inspectorate of Pollution and various local authority waste
regulators.
Mr Gummer said the enabling bill would contain measures relating to
contaminated land and pollution from abandoned mines. An enabling power for
the preservation of hedgerows of particular value would be in the bill but
would not form part of the new agency's role, he said.
Mr Gummer welcomed the decision of Lord Crickhowell to remain chairman of
the NRA until the vesting of the new agency in April 1996. He suggested this
should reduce the 'problems of disruption' that might arise by the merger.

FT  19 NOV 94 / A balance of profit and nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Fellowes, 5th Lord de Ramsey, who is set to become chairman of the
Environment Agency that will control pollution in England and Wales, said
last night that the most important part of his new job was to establish the
credibility of the new agency with the public when public confidence in
politicians, businessmen and the media was at a very low ebb.
He had no doubt that the agency would on occasion cross swords with
government ministers and many others.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, recalled that as minister of
agriculture he had engaged in some robust debate with Lord de Ramsey, then
president of the Country Landowners' Association, whose members are
estimated to own half the privately owned land in England and Wales.
Lord de Ramsey, 52, who succeeded to the title 18 months ago, has been
described as 'the very model of a modern farmer-businessman'. His company
farms 6,500 arable acres at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire where his family has
been active in draining and farming the fens since the middle of the 17th
century.
He spoke proudly yesterday of the 1,000 elm trees on his estate, virtually
the last surviving in southern England, kept free of the killer Dutch elm
disease by surgery and injections of fungicide.
Instead of bulldozing old farm buildings his company has converted them into
light-industry workshops without changing the character of the village in
which they are situated. 'You need profits to keep this lovely landscape
looking as it is,' he said.
Lord De Ramsey said he would resign as a director of the Cambridge Water
Company and as president of the Association of Drainage Authorities, mainly
because of potential conflicts of interest, but this would give him more
time towards the 2 1/2 days a week he would spend on his part-time,
chairmanship. 'But I expect to have my weekends and holidays disturbed.'
He has still to make his maiden speech in the House of Lords where, while
president of the CLA, he sat on the cross benches. More recently he has
taken the Conservative whip.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Farmers may seek review of quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Farmers' Union is considering applying for a judicial review of
the way the government has handled the allocation of spare quotas for sheep
farmers this year.
Rationing of quotas has left some farmers in severe hardship, the union
said.
'We have taken independent legal advice and believe there is a case for a
legal challenge about the way the ministry has handled European Union rules
on the quota reserve,' said Sir David Naish, NFU president.
A union official said: 'We have a lot of members who are extremely annoyed.'
Farmers need a high enough quota from the government to cover all the
animals in their flocks if they wish to apply for EU subsidies.
The government retained some quotas to award to new entrants to farming,
producers expanding their businesses and others who felt disadvantaged.
But the Ministry of Agriculture was deluged with applications. By rationing
extra quota and awarding it chiefly to upland producers, the government has
left some 5,000 disgruntled applicants.
Mr George Dunn, rural economics adviser at the Country Landowners'
Association, said many were in genuine hardship and some would be forced out
of business.

FT  19 NOV 94 / New deal talks at Lloyd's likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling council of Lloyd's of London is likely to discuss next month the
possibility of a fresh out-of-court deal between lossmaking members and
professional agencies they are suing, Mr Peter Middleton, the insurance
market's chief executive, said yesterday.
He reiterated that he and Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, were prepared
to try to forge a new settlement offer - providing all sides believed it
worthwhile. But he warned: 'The amount of court activity at the moment,
involving Names and underwriters, suggests that we have not got that
agreement at the moment.'
His comments came amid speculation that Lloyd's leaders are stepping up the
pressure on groups representing Names and the 'errors and omissions'
insurers - out of whose funds successful claims for negligence would be paid
 -to start discussions. One possibility being floated is of separate
agreements being struck with different groups of Names.
The Court of Appeal is expected to rule next week on whether the E&amp;O
insurers should be forced to disclose how much cover was bought by the
Lloyd's members and managing agencies facing legal action. Figures on the
E&amp;O 'pot', which some estimates put at more than Pounds 1bn, give an idea of
the maximum size of a new out-of-court settlement.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Votes scheme 'not MP's baby': Tory 'family man' denies role
in home-sales policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MP yesterday insisted that he was not involved in any way
with the alleged Westminster City Council homes-for-votes scheme, the public
inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Barry Legg, MP for Milton Keynes South-West, has been accused by the
district auditor of being a driving force behind the scheme.
Mr Roger Toulson QC, opening the defence for Mr Legg, said: 'The long and
the short of it is that it was not his baby.'
In a provisional report the district auditor, Mr John Magill, had found that
Mr Legg was part of a triumvirate which controlled the London council in the
late 1980s and had guided the evolution of the 'disgraceful and unlawful'
scheme.
Mr Legg was Conservative chief whip on the council for seven years. The
other two members of the triumvirate were the then council leader Dame
Shirley Porter and her deputy Mr David Weeks.
The district auditor decided that the three, with seven other councillors
and council officials, deliberately sold homes to increase the number of
Tory voters in eight marginal wards in a scheme known publicly as designated
sales.
He is recommending that all of them should be surcharged for the Pounds 21m
he says was wasted.
In a written submission to the inquiry, the MP said: 'I accept that I was
present at political meetings at which targeting designated sales in
marginal wards was discussed. I personally never paid much attention to the
talk about targeting marginal wards because, for one thing, I regarded it
like much else as political rhetoric.
'As the proposed programme for designated sales was sound and justifiable, I
would not have regarded the hope of political advantage as making it wrong.
I cannot recall, and do not believe I ever knew, the criteria for selecting
properties.'
Mr Andrew Arden QC, for the group of Westminster residents who first lodged
the allegations, said it was 'not credible' that Mr Legg - a senior member
of the council - knew nothing of the alleged gerrymandering when many others
in the council were well aware of it.
Mr Legg replied that he was only a 'part-time councillor' since 'many
demands occupied my life'. He said he was company secretary and a board
member of Hillsdown Holdings during an 'extraordinarily busy time' and was
also bringing up a young family.
The inquiry was adjourned until Monday.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Mr Mugabe lets slip an unsettling aside: The whites' seizure
of Africa's wealth is too recent for blacks to ignore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was just one phrase in a four hour debate about 'indigenisation of the
Zimbabwe economy', but Robert Mugabe may come to regret it.
Some Zimbabweans, he suggested at a conference this week, are 'more
indigenous than others'.
When he went on to draw a distinction between what he called 'the indigenous
indigenous' and the merely 'indigenous', Zimbabwe's president made no
mention of colour.
But the delegates knew perfectly well what he meant.
The former are the 11m black Zimbabweans. The latter are the 100,000 or so
whites, some of whom proudly boast of being third generation 'white
Africans', but most of whom go back no further than the wave of immigrants
from post-war Britain.
Nearly 15 years after independence in 1980, the economic imbalance has
barely begun to be redressed.
The numbers of whites has fallen from the pre-independence peak of 275,000,
but those that remain still control most of commerce and industry, and about
80 per cent of the 4,000 commercial farms.
Judging by his wry smile, Mr Mugabe was fully aware of the Orwellian
undertones to his comment. Nothing he said, before or after, suggested that
he was threatening the white minority with second class citizenship.
Indeed, on several occasions, Mr Mugabe cooled emotions, arguing at one
point that the post-independence generation of whites would be more
integrated than their parents, and repudiating a speaker who - partly in
jest, it should be said - suggested it might be necessary to return to the
bush to win the battle for black control of the economy.
Furthermore, many of the speakers seemed not so much resentful of whites'
dominance of the economy, as critical of what they saw as the government's
failure to provide sufficient venture capital and management training
programmes for black entrepreneurs.
But Mr Mugabe's aside could nevertheless prove dangerous.
Whether he sanctions it or not, there is a danger that in the run-up to next
year's election, officials of the ruling Zanu-Zapu coalition may be tempted
to play the populist card in an attempt to divert attention from the
government's shortcomings.
Widely regarded as corrupt, with many senior army officials, ministers and
senior civil servants known to have enriched themselves through business and
property deals over the years, the ruling coalition is expected to win the
poll by default, such is the calibre of a fractious and poorly led
opposition.
It is a tactic that may well appeal to the hundreds of thousands of
frustrated youngsters in a well-nigh hopeless search for work, in an economy
where the pain of structural adjustment is more apparent than the benefits.
At least 20,000 workers have been laid off since economic reforms started in
1991. Every year more school leavers join the ranks of the unemployed.
Black resentment goes deeper than this, however, and goes to the very heart
of the country's creation.
The foundations of white economic power were laid barely a hundred years
ago, consolidated by victory in what the white settlers called a 'rebellion'
and what their adversaries saw as the first 'chimurenga' or war of
liberation in 1896-7.
In 1890 Cecil John Rhodes' British South Africa Company acted on its belief
that what is now known as Zimbabwe contained gold reefs as rich as South
Africa's Witwatersrand.
Promising each settler 15 gold claims and 1,200 hectares of land, it
recruited what most historians would call an 'invasion force' but which
white 'Rhodesians' to this day refer to as 'the pioneer column'.
Two hundred whites enlisted, and the expedition set out in June that year
from northern Bechuanaland (now Botswana), in the direction of what is today
Zimbabwe's Mashonaland province.
Three months later the British flag was raised on the site of Salisbury, now
Harare. Thus Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was born - but not without a fight for
supremacy.
The first of two battles between the settlers and the African people was
soon to begin.
On March 20, 1896, the Ndebele began their war ('umvukela') against white
rule, rising in the south; in June, the Shona people in the north followed
suit, launching their campaign, or 'chimurenga', and in one week killing 100
settlers.
But by the end of 1897 it was over, African spears were no match for
Europe's rifles. The last defenders held out in caves. Some were starved
into submission. Others died when sticks of dynamite were tossed into the
caves. The first chimurenga was over, but it was not forgotten.
After the first war for independence, the victors seized the spoils in a
process which continued into the 1950s.
Between 1908 and 1915 the company put 1.5m acres of the country's best land
into settler hands, establishing the pattern for today's white-owned
commercial farm sector.
Later, under the pretext of preventing overstocking on land designated for
'natives', cattle were impounded, more than a million head between 1946 and
1950, with many resold cheaply to white farmers.
The whites obtained mining concessions of questionable validity for
themselves. The whites who negotiated them may well have misled the local
chiefs about the significance of the concession documents they signed.
Meanwhile Africans were effectively coerced to provide the labour to develop
the concessions through the imposition of a compulsory hut tax, which most
were only able to pay if they worked in the mines.
As recently as the years after the second world war, more than 100,000
people were evicted from white-owned farm land.
Notwithstanding this background, the government has moved cautiously. But Mr
Mugabe, referring to the government's programme of land redistribution
through purchase of white farms (only a handful so far) can be forgiven if
there was an undertone of anger in his comment to the conference this week:
'We have to pay those those who seized it from us, though they did not pay
us.'
Some 70 years after the first chimurenga, the spirit of the time and the
leaders of the day were evoked when black Zimbabweans again went to war.
Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in November 1965, an
assertion of continued minority rule in defiance of Britain, was to prove
the signal for the second chimurenga. This time the settlers were defeated,
and deeply apprehensive about their fate as it became clear Robert Mugabe
had won the 1980 independence elections.
But the man vilified for years as a 'communist terrorist' was magnanimous
and compassionate in victory, appealing for racial reconciliation in a
speech that rescued the country from the risk of post election turmoil.
But the political victory has done comparatively little to alter the
structure of ownership of the economy. Nor, given the government's limited
resources, and the constraints of today's world, can the government do much
about it.
As Mr Mugabe wryly remarked during Wednesday's debate, times have changed
since the days of the first chimurenga: 'We are behaving like gentleman, and
acting gradually,' he said.
Zimbabwe's whites may not see it that way. Nor, one suspects, may foreign
investors. And as for the impatient black Zimbabweans, particularly the
disgruntled youth, they might argue that it is time their government stopped
behaving like gentlemen.
Either way, Mr Mugabe may be reflecting, he cannot win.

Political scandals in Spain spread yesterday from the ruling Socialist party
in Madrid to its Catalan nationalist allies in Barcelona where Mr Josep
Maria Cullell resigned as a member of Catalonia's government, the
Generalitat, after allegations of corruption. The development, which brings
to the forefront the simmering rivalry in Catalonia between the governing
nationalists, Convergencia i Unio and the local Socialist party, could
strain the alliance between prime minister Felipe Gonzalez and CiU leader Mr
Jordi Pujol, the president of the Generalitat. Mr Cullell stepped down as
the Generalitat's minister of public works amid newspaper reports that he
had pressured a town council into re-zoning and buying land owned by his
brother-in-law.

Brazil's navy is to buy seven warships from Britain for about Pounds 100m in
the second large arms deal between the two countries this year. Brazil is
buying four type 22 frigates and three river class minesweepers which the
British navy put up for sale earlier this year. The frigates, built between
1976 and 1980, are no longer needed following the post-cold war fleet
reduction. In January Westland, the UK helicopter maker, won a Pounds 150m
order for nine Super Lynx helicopters from the Brazilian navy.

<TEXT>
A ruling late on Thursday by Turkey's constitutional court forcing prime
minister Tansu Ciller to postpone crucial by-elections scheduled for
December 4 has increased speculation that she may call general elections in
the spring. The court's decision is a humiliating reverse for Mrs Ciller. It
accepted an appeal by the Islamic Refah party and threw out voting rules she
had devised to minimise damage to her True Path party. Sixteen of the 22
seats up for grabs on December 4 are in the south-east region, scene of
heavy fighting between security forces and guerrillas of the Kurdistan
Workers party. Mrs Ciller's voting rules would have allowed the
greatly-increased number of state employees in the region to vote but would
have disenfranchised the estimated 2m Kurdish villagers who have fled the
fighting. The 16 seats were vacated by Kurdish MPs evicted from parliament
in March to stand trial on treason charges. Their support has been
transferred to Refah, which was expected to win most of the seats,
endangering the coalition governments's thin parliamentary majority.

Accusations of truce violations from both sides in Angola's 19-year-old
civil war have put fresh pressure on the country's fragile peace pact. Just
ahead of the scheduled signing tomorrow of the pact in the Zambian capital,
Lusaka, the rebel Unita movement reported that government forces had ignored
a truce to attack and capture the rebel-held northern town of Uige. There
was no immediate comment from the government of President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos but it made accusations of its own that Unita forces had violated the
truce, declared on Wednesday night, with three attacks on government-held
towns. Leaders of several southern African nations are due to meet in Lusaka
today to discuss threats to the peace pact, which follows one in 1991 that
held for about 18 months.

The growth in Japan's money supply continues to be weak, constrained by the
decline in bank lending, weak corporate demand for funds and a firm monetary
policy. M2, or cash in circulation and bank deposits, plus certificates of
deposit, grew by a mere 2.4 per cent last month, by comparison with October
last year, the Bank of Japan announced yesterday. That represents a very
slight increase on 2.3 per cent money supply growth in September. The
weakness of monetary growth contrasts with previous recoveries, when an
increase in domestic demand coincided with a robust rise in liquidity.

Mr Michel Mauer, the French property developer under investigation for
alleged corruption, resigned yesterday as chairman of Cogedim. The company
said Mr Mauer, who is being investigated for alleged influence peddling in a
case involving illicit political financing, was stepping down for health
reasons. In an interview yesterday, Mr Mauer said the strains of the
investigation and his incarceration for 24 days had taken a toll.
'Physically and morally the ordeal tired me enormously,' he told Le Figaro.
Mr Mauer is one of several senior business executives under investigation
for alleged corruption and is the first to resign from his post. Cogedim, a
subsidiary of Paribas, the banking group, said that Mr Mauer was also
resigning his seat on the board. The case involving Mr Mauer concerns
alleged illicit funding of the Republican party, one of the largest

Hong Kong is to go ahead with plans to issue up to 10 new mobile telephone
licences, despite criticism from existing providers and analysts that the
move could lead to price wars and lower standards of service. The decision,
yesterday, follows a lengthy consultation process that began when industry
views were solicited in February. Hong Kong has no bars on foreign
ownership, and since the proposal to expand the market was first mooted, big
industry players from across the world have made exploratory trips to the
colony. More than 100 application documents were handed out after the
announcement. The telecommunications Authority will decide on the number of
licences to be issued.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banks in Hong Kong yesterday said they would raise lending and deposit
interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on Monday in response to the move
this week by the US Federal reserve to tighten monetary policy. Hong Kong's
dollar has been fixed against its US counterpart since 1983 and the
authorities had little option but to move official and bank rates higher to
preserve the link. On Tuesday the US Fed increased its Fed funds rate by
0.75 points to 5.5 per cent. The colony's new bank rate will be 8.5 per cent
 -the highest level since late 1991. The Hongkong Bank said it will raise
residential mortgage costs to between 10.25 per cent and 10.75 per cent. The
prospect of higher borrowing costs unsettled the local stock market where
share prices were marked down sharply, in spite of the widespread
expectation of an imminent rate hike. The Hang Seng index ended 90.84 lower
at 9,427.44 on turnover of HKDollars 2.43bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian trades unions said they might abandon a planned general strike after
the defeat of a government plan to trim pension costs. Opposition forces on
Thursday joined forces with the Northern League - a member of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi's coalition - to defeat the government's pensions measure
in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house). The defeated measure would have
cut the cumulative entitlement to pensions to 1.75 per cent for each year of
a worker's salary from 2 per cent starting in 1996.
Next year's austerity budget, designed to reduce the budget deficit by
L48,000bn (Pounds 19bn), has brought relations between unions and government
to their lowest point for a decade. Unions called a general strike for
December 2 to protest against the government's plans to trim the budget by
reducing pensions spending. But on Friday, Sergio D'Antoni, head of the CISL
union grouping, hinted the unions could call off the strike if the
government accepted their proposals to modify stringent pension reform
proposals.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Kenya central bank to halt widespread fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Bank of Kenya is introducing new banking regulations, including
the vetting of directors and managers of commercial banks, to prevent the
recurrence of fraud and other financial malpractices which robbed it of
hundreds of millions of dollars last year.
The Kenyan parliament is expected to approve amendments to the banking act
next week which will allow the central bank to scrutinise the 'moral and
professional suitability of persons proposed to manage or control financial
institutions'. The bank will have the power to withdraw a bank's trading
licence if it is not satisfied.
Another amendment aims to end the practice of 'insider lending' - through
which the owners of some Kenyan banks help themselves to cheap credit - by
lowering a bank's maximum permitted exposure to a single borrower from 100
per cent of shareholders' capital and reserves to 25 per cent.
Mr A Wanguria, director of the central bank's supervision department,
believes the reforms will bring more professionalism to Kenya's financial
sector.
'Twenty-eight banks have failed in the past 10 years,' Mr Wanguria said.
'They all had weak boards of directors, who knew little about banking. There
was also a lot of mismanagement, insider lending, and few of the banks were
properly capitalised.
'If we want a stable banking system,' he said, 'we must start by ensuring
that the board of directors, main shareholders and managers of banks are
competent professionals.'
The central bank recorded a net loss of 4.5bn shillings (Pounds 42m) in the
financial year which ended in June 1993, partly as a result of making large
unsecured loans to three local banks which have since been liquidated.
Known as 'political banks' for their ties to influential Kenyan politicians,
the banks had acted as conduits for government funds to ensure support for
the ruling Kanu party in the run-up to the 1992 general elections.
After the elections, the 'political banks' ran into severe liquidity
problems, and used their influence to obtain irregular credit from the
central bank.
Mr Micah Cheserem, who took over as governor of the central bank after the
losses were incurred, is still trying to recover some 6bn shillings of
monies owed to the central bank.
Not only were the loans unsecured; Mr Cheserem believes there was also a
conspiracy to defraud the bank. Senior treasury and central bank officials
are under investigation. The owner of one of the banks liquidated last year
is in detention awaiting trial.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Japanese institutions forsake the world's investment markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's life insurers, among the world's largest institutional investors,
and once the most aggressive in pursuing investment opportunities overseas,
put almost no money into foreign securities in the six months to the end of
September, a leading industry official said yesterday.
Mr Takahide Sakurai, chairman of the Life Assurance Association of Japan,
said life insurers had poured all of the net increase in their assets during
the period into long-term domestic fixed interest securities, loans and
yen-denominated public and corporate bonds. They had also transferred money
from short-term funds into those instruments.
Mr Sakurai's remarks confirm unofficial reports that the insurance
companies' have continued to abstain from investing abroad so far this year.
That abstention has been a principal factor in the strength of the Japanese
yen in foreign exchange markets.
In the first half of the current financial year, which ends next March, the
life insurers' total assets increased by about 7.5 per cent from a year
earlier, Mr Sakurai said. But while domestic stock investment was 'neutral',
there had been almost no overseas investment.
In the 1980s, as Japanese savings increased rapidly and the insurance market
was liberalised, life insurance companies invested heavily in overseas
securities. Between 1986 and 1990, their holdings of foreign securities
quadrupled, reaching Y17,800bn (Pounds 112bn), more than 15 per cent of
their total assets.
Since then, following heavy losses on both fixed interest and equity
investment, mainly as a result of a rising yen, they have scaled back their
investments abroad, and for the last three years have been repatriating
funds. This year their portfolio of foreign securities is expected to fall
to close to 10 per cent of their total assets.
Mr Sakurai said the life insurers, who will report their half-year results
later this month, would not see an early recovery in their earnings.
'We still can't see the brightness in the economy', so often referred to in
official government economic reports, he said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arafat on ropes as peace process comes under fire: Bloodshed
in Gaza Strip prompts growing fears of Palestinian civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's violence in the Gaza Strip has underlined the growing crisis in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and raised the threat of a Palestinian
civil war.
The simmering tension between Mr Yassir Arafat's authority and his Islamic
opponents erupted into full-scale bloodshed, raising serious doubts about
the stability of the self-rule experiment.
Palestinian police yesterday were forced to open fire on anti-Arafat Islamic
demonstrators illustrating the extent to which the Islamic opposition has
become a real challenge to the authority of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation on the streets of Gaza.
Political observers believe Mr Arafat is on the ropes with the fragile
political support base for the peace agreement eroding daily. Palestinians
are losing faith in a process which shows no sign of addressing their
grievances - the end of Israeli occupation of Palestinian land; right of
return of Palestinian refugees and improvement in living conditions.
Hours before yesterday's clashes, Mr Terje Larsen, UN under-secretary
general responsible for Palestinian territories said: 'If there is no change
immediately, there will be more killing more blood ..My assessment is that
both the peace process and the legitimacy of the Palestinian authority are
losing ground day by day and the reason is that nearly nothing has been
delivered on the ground.'
Instead of trying to shore up Mr Arafat's rule, Israel continues to
undermine the PLO leader, fuelling the opposition. A partial closure of the
Israel-Gaza border remains in place, preventing thousands of Palestinians
travelling to jobs in Israel.
The peace process is at least nine months behind schedule and Israel shows
no recognition of the danger of further delay in handing over the still
occupied West Bank to Palestinian rule. Palestinian prisoners remain in
Israeli jails months after Israel promised to release them and Israel is
forcing Mr Arafat to go to war with the Islamic extremists by linking
further progress in peace negotiations to a crackdown on Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, the two main Islamic Palestinian groups.
The failure of the peace process to meet Palestinian grievances has created
a fertile ground for Mr Arafat's Islamic critics who are increasingly
confident and determined to meet his crackdown by force. They successfully
portray him as a 'poodle' of Israel doing its dirty work.
Israel refuses to accept the Palestinian view that there is no military
option against Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Although Gen Nasr Yussuf, the
Palestinian military strongman, has been spoiling for a fight with the
Islamic opposition, Mr Arafat's political advisers have warned against a
conflict that could erupt into civil war with no guarantee of victory. Both
groups are well disciplined and maintain small tightly knit underground
military wings willing to carry out suicide attacks in the name of Islamic
glory.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad are bound to exploit yesterday's shootings by Mr
Arafat's security forces, using them to accuse the Palestinian leader of
acting as an instrument of Israel's security agenda. They are also likely to
strike back, further escalating the tension and violence.
Israel's refusal to honour the timetable and the commitments of the peace
accords is also fuelling division inside the PLO and Mr Arafat's Fatah
faction. This week's PLO executive committee meeting in Gaza was attended by
only eight of the 18 members. Two of the most senior Fatah officials - Mr
Farouk Kaddoumi and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the architect of the peace agreement -
refused to attend and are increasingly critical of the implementation of the
deal.
Mr Suleiman Najjab, one of the PLO executive committee members who refused
to attend the meeting, said a majority favour a review of the entire
experiment, given Israel's refusal to implement the accords.
Israel will welcome yesterday's events as a sign of Mr Arafat's willingness
to confront extremists, but the dangers of its policy are apparent. Israel's
apparent determination to force Mr Arafat into conflict with Islamic groups
could irretrievably weaken the PLO and leave Israel with no other partner to
negotiate with but Hamas and Islamic Jihad which oppose a Jewish state.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Argentina bans new public spending for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All new spending by the Argentine public sector for the rest of 1994 stopped
yesterday following a presidential decree banning all expenditure that had
not already been approved.
The Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 793m) that the measures are expected to save will
be used to pay pensions and Christmas bonuses to Argentina's 3.2m retired
people. The cuts - said to include a virtual ban on travel and on the
signing of new government contracts - will enable Argentina to finance its
social security deficit without the need to borrow, according to Mr Domingo
Cavallo, the economy minister.
Earlier in the week, Mr Cavallo had threatened to unleash 'savage' budgetary
cuts if Congress failed to pass legislation requesting emergency funds and
incorporating measures to curb future social security payments. Signs that
Congress was unlikely to pass this legislation quickly prompted Mr Cavallo
to act.
He said cuts were necessary 'to offset the excess spending of this year'.
With only 43 days of 1994 remaining it is 'safe to assume that money not yet
spent is not now needed or that, if it is required, it can wait until
January 1', he said.
Mr Cavallo blames the deterioration of the fiscal account, which showed a
deficit for the third quarter - the first in more than two years - on a
spate of court decisions backing pensioners' claims for higher payments,
undermining government attempts to uncouple pensions from indexes of
historic inflation and current wages. Without such adjustments, officials
say, the pensions system faces bankruptcy.
Some feel the Economy Ministry is exaggerating the significance of pension
payments to mask spending laxities. Mr Cavallo admitted to visiting foreign
investors recently that he was deliberately raising the stakes in order to
persuade cabinet and Congress to accept cost-cutting legislation. 'If I say
that the deficit is manageable then everyone will come to the ministry
asking for more money,' he said.
In emphasising fiscal problems to a domestic audience, Mr Cavallo risks
alarming foreign investors. Last month, Argentina had to pay 350 basis
points above US treasury bond prices for a sovereign five-year bond issue, a
sign that international confidence in Argentina has waned.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Eminence grise at World Bank goes
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank's eminence grise is leaving to join JP Morgan, the Wall
Street bank.
Mr Ernest Stern, one of the World Bank's three managing directors but long
regarded as the real power behind the throne, will step down at the end of
January to join the bank formerly headed by Mr Lewis Preston, now his boss
at the World Bank.
His successor is expected to be American, maintaining an informal
geographical balance among the three managing directors. Mr Sven Sandstrom
is a European, while Mr Gautam Kaji, who will take over at the beginning of
next month from Mr Attila Karaosmanoglu as the third managing director, is
Indian.
A name is understood to have been submitted to the World Bank's board of
directors but not yet approved.
Mr Stern's empire at the Washington-based World Bank includes south Asia,
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as treasury, controller
and budget functions. He also chairs the loan committee.
But his influence has long been thought to spread much more widely, through
a network of proteges in the organisation and his role as the institutional
memory of the World Bank.
'It would be difficult to describe adequately the breadth and depth of his
impact upon this institution,' Mr Preston said yesterday.
That influence has made him a target of environmentalist groups, which have
criticised the bank for what they see as inadequate attention to
environmental questions in its lending and support for damaging structural
policies in the developing world.
'One could think of a lot of hopeful things happening with some fresh and
more open people,' said Ms Korinna Horta of the Environmental Defense Fund,
a Washington environmental group.
A development economist, Mr Stern was brought into the World Bank by Mr
Robert MacNamara, who built the institution up in the 1970s. In charge of
operations from 1978 to 1987, he helped shape the Bank's lending policies
and its move from project loans into lending for structural and sectoral
programmes.
He was twice tipped to move to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, first on its creation and then when Mr Jacques Attali resigned,
but on both occasions chose to stay in Washington.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Electric utility deal extends trade in pollution credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two US electric utilities yesterday signed an agreement to trade pollution
credits, which for the first time places a market value on reductions in
emissions of carbon dioxide.
Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in Arizona, will exchange 25,000
tons of sulphur dioxide emissions allowances for 1.75m tons of carbon
dioxide reductions from Niagara Mohawk Power, which supplies electricity and
gas in northern New York state.
Sulphur dioxide emission reductions are mandated by law, and a market system
has been set up to allow utilities which exceed their reduction targets to
trade the surplus. Emission allowances are currently trading between Dollars
143 (Pounds 87) and Dollars 160 per ton.
Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, however, is a voluntary commitment
that only a handful of utilities have made to the department of energy as
part of a programme to meet the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit agreement to
reduce emissions to their 1990 level by 2000.
Yesterday's deal, sponsored by the Department of Energy, sets a rough value
of Dollars 2 a ton on reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
The deal provides for Arizona Public Service to transfer 25,000 tons of
sulphur dioxide allowances, which it does not need because the installation
of new scrubbers has cut its pollution well below target, to Niagara Mohawk.
The New York utility will then donate the allowances to a non-profit
organisation to be permanently retired, and claim a tax deduction of around
Dollars 1m on the charitable gift. That money will be spent on further
projects to cut carbon dioxide pollution in New York state and outside the
US.
A direct donation of Niagara Mohawk's carbon dioxide reductions would
probably not have been allowed as a charitable deduction because there is no
defined market value for greenhouse gas reduction.
Arizona Public Service expects not to have to emit the extra 1.75m tons of
carbon dioxide, but plans to keep the reductions as an insurance policy in
case energy demand grows.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Deep-freeze for Canada's ice hockey: A salary dispute which
has brought the sport to a halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the eighth Saturday in a row, millions of Canadians will be at a loose
end tonight. They would normally be glued to television watching Hockey
Night in Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's most popular
programme.
But the North American ice hockey season has yet to start. Owners of the 26
US and Canadian teams which make up the national hockey league (NHL) locked
out the players on September 30 after failing to persuade them to accept
curbs on their rocketing salaries.
No settlement is yet in sight, despite numerous meetings between the owners
and the players' union.
The season may be called off altogether if there is no breakthrough within
the next three or four weeks. A similar pay dispute forced the cancellation
of part of this year's baseball season, as well the world series baseball
championship.
While the labour dispute may be an annoyance for fans, many businesses, big
and small, are counting more tangible costs.
Molson, the diversified brewing group whose entertainment subsidiary
produces Hockey Night in Canada and which owns the champion Montreal
Canadiens, estimates that it will lose CDollars 10m-CDollars 11m (Pounds
4.4m-Pounds 4.9m) in operating profit, even if a shortened season starts on
January 1. The loss would double if the entire season is cancelled.
Among other public companies with a stake in the dispute are ITT, the US
conglomerate which owns the New York Rangers through its interest in Madison
Square Gardens, where the Rangers play their home games.
Walt Disney owns the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, one of several teams in
California and Florida which have helped ice hockey to migrate in recent
years as far south as the Sun Belt.
As with the baseball strike, TV revenues have been among the heaviest
casualties. The NHL, which has been struggling for years to gain exposure on
US mainstream television, recently signed a Dollars 100m, five-year deal
with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network.
The dispute will need to be resolved soon if Fox's first hockey broadcast,
the annual All-Stars game, is to go ahead as scheduled on January 21.
The players are also big losers. Their union estimates that its members
earned a total of around CDollars 500m last year. Several stars are in the
CDollars 2m-CDollars 3m a year bracket.
Finding another job has not been easy. One Anaheim player is publishing a
children's book. The St Louis Blues' goal-tender has started flying lessons.
Another player has signed up for a financial-planning course.
Most people's sympathy, however, lies with neither greedy owners nor
overpaid players, but rather with the thousands of entrepreneurs - hot-dog
vendors, souvenir pedlars and taxi drivers, for instance - who have lost a
big chunk of their livelihood and have little to fall back on.

FT  19 NOV 94 / DC may face federal rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The federal government may be forced to take over the virtually bankrupt
District of Columbia, according to reports circulating in Washington.
The hardest evidence of such a prospect came in a television interview aired
on Thursday night with Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, the DC delegate to
Congress. She advised city employees who qualify for a job buy-out 'to take
it and run, you're playing with fire'.
The Washington Times also reported that the General Accounting Office,
acting at the request of two Democratic congressmen, had begun a review of
the history of previous examples of federal rescues of financially strapped
cities, including the precedent of New York in the mid-1970s.
Among several options under consideration by the independent federal agency,
the newspaper said quoting the GAO, were a complete federal takeover of the
city's affairs or the appointment of a federal board of directors to oversee
civic finances.
Mr Marion Barry will return as mayor in January with virtually no cash in
hand and with little choice but to pursue even harsher budget-cutting
measures than those instituted by the outgoing mayor, Ms Sharon Pratt Kelly.
Even with such measures, it is considered certain DC would need to raise
money on the capital markets, where it enjoys little confidence, or ask the
federal government for assistance.
Among Ms Kelly's proposals - and the subject of Mrs Norton's reference  -
are incentives to city employees to take early retirement. This programme is
now calculated to save Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.5m), well short of the Dollars
140m original target.
Compounding DC's problems is the uncertain relationship between Mr Barry,
whose three previous terms in office are generally seen as having wrecked
city finances, and the new Republican Congress. Mr Newt Gingrich, the likely
next Speaker, has already proposed abolishing the House district committee
which, under the Democrats, had proved a sympathetic, if often critical,
forum for the mayor and city council.

FT  19 NOV 94 / US trade gap widens as exports fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A slowdown in US exports in September helped push the US merchandise trade
deficit from Dollars 14.1bn (Pounds 8.5bn) in August to Dollars 14.6bn, its
second highest level since 1987, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Exports of goods and services declined during the month, dropping from
Dollars 59.9bn in August to Dollars 59.7bn. Merchandise imports also
declined slightly - from Dollars 58.2bn to Dollars 58.1bn, and service
imports rose from Dollars 11.4 to Dollars 11.7bn.
Although economists attribute the growing deficit to macroeconomic factors,
members of Congress will seek to use the trade gap as ammunition to attack
the Uruguay Round legislation when it goes to a vote later this month.
Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat and an opponent of the Gatt
deal, yesterday called a press conference to complain 'the current trade
strategy is producing lost jobs and lower incomes for American workers.'
The US Chamber of Commerce said exports to US partners in the North American
Free Trade agreement were growing at a rate of 14.4 per cent.
'Unless the Congress gives the US and world economies a shot in the arm by
passing that Gatt Uruguay Round Agreement, future trade data reports will
just be more of the same,' the chamber said.
The Clinton administration has made exports the centre of its economics and
trade policies. While exports of goods jumped by 9.9 per cent in August,
they have declined in two of the past three months.
Exports of semiconductors, computers accessories and telecommunications are
booming - up almost 22 per cent in last year - but imports of these products
grew at a rate of 26 per cent.
The deficit with Japan showed a rare decline, from Dollars 5.8bn to Dollars
5.4bn, as imports of cars and car parts declined by Dollars 1.2bn. Japan and
China still made up the bulk of the trade deficit although their share over
the past year has shrunk from 70 per cent to 63 per cent.
Most economists expect an improvement in the trade gap next year. In a
commentary, Merrill Lynch said: 'Countries like Germany and Japan are
emerging from a period of economic malaise and should continue to grow. That
global pickup in economic growth rates will allow US exports to rise while
our domestic demand slows.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / Argentina bans new public spending for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All new spending by the Argentine public sector for the rest of 1994 stopped
yesterday following a presidential decree banning all expenditure that had
not already been approved.
The Dollars 1.3bn that the measures are expected to save will be used to pay
pensions and Christmas bonuses to Argentina's 3.2m retired people. The cuts
 -said to include a virtual ban on travel and on the signing of new
government contracts - will enable Argentina to finance its social security
deficit without the need to borrow, according to Mr Domingo Cavallo, the
economy minister.
Earlier in the week, Mr Cavallo had threatened to unleash 'savage' budgetary
cuts if Congress failed to pass legislation requesting emergency funds and
incorporating measures to curb future social security payments. Signs that
Congress was unlikely to pass this legislation quickly prompted Mr Cavallo
to act.
Mr Cavallo said cuts were necessary 'to offset the excess spending of this
year.' With only 43 days of 1994 remaining it is 'safe to assume that money
not yet spent is not now needed or that, if it is required, it can wait
until January 1,' he said.
Mr Cavallo blames the deterioration of the fiscal account, which showed a
deficit for the third quarter - the first in more than two years - on a
spate of court decisions backing pensioners' claims for higher payments,
undermining government attempts to uncouple pensions from indexes of
historic inflation and current wages. Without such adjustments, officials
say, the pensions system faces bankruptcy.
Some however feel the economy ministry is exaggerating the significance of
pension payments to mask spending laxities in other areas. Mr Cavallo
himself admitted to visiting foreign investors recently that he was
deliberately raising the stakes in order to persuade cabinet and Congress to
accept cost-cutting legislation. 'If I say that the deficit is manageable
then everyone will come to the ministry asking for more money,' he said.
Such arm-twisting is not without its dangers. In emphasising fiscal problems
to a domestic audience, Mr Cavallo risks alarming foreign investors. Last
month, Argentina had to pay 350 basis points above US treasury bond prices
for a sovereign five-year bond issue, considerably more than expected and a
sign that international confidence in Argentina has waned somewhat.

FT  19 NOV 94 / BP to pay Dollars 1.4bn tax to Alaska
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday ended a long-running tax dispute with the state
of Alaska by agreeing to pay Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 850m) in back taxes.
The settlement ended a dispute which had clouded relations between BP and
Alaska, one of its most important operating locations. BP's fields on
Alaska's North Slope account for about 40 per cent of the company's
worldwide output.
The dispute centred on oil and gas production taxes paid by the company
between 1979-91 and its 1978-88 state income taxes.
It arose over different interpretations of wellhead prices and the cost of
transporting oil. The state contended that BP and other companies operating
in Alaska, such as Arco and Exxon, understated wellhead prices and
overestimated transportation costs, thus lowering their tax liability.
Mr Walter Hickel, Alaska's governor, said the agreement represented an
'equitable resolution of all significant tax disputes between the company
and the state.'
It is thought that Alaska's original claim against the company was as high
as Dollars 3bn.
BP declined to comment on how much tax relief it might qualify for, but US
analysts said it should receive substantial federal tax relief on the
Dollars 1.4bn settlement. That could cut BP's net payout by more than half,
to around Dollars 630m.
Company officials said adequate financial provisions had already been made.
They predicted that the settlement would not affect BP's profits.
The settlement calls for BP to pay Alaska in three instalments. A payment of
Dollars 700m is due at the end of December. Two further payments of Dollars
350m each are due at the end of 1995 and 1996.
The company said other terms were confidential. It had obtained a limited
waiver to announce that a settlement had been reached.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer warning on Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, warned strongly yesterday
against rushing towards European monetary union before a joint monetary
policy had been worked out and full central banking independence achieved.
He was speaking the day after Mr Giovanni Ravasio, the European Commission's
director-general for economic and monetary affairs, had held out the
possibility of Emu as early as 1997. Mr Tietmeyer said: 'I am convinced that
monetary policy integration in Europe can only be the outcome of a lengthy
process.'
The struggle to devise the best monetary policy strategy and the right
instruments to implement this 'could prove to be even more difficult and
time-consuming than the preparations for issuing banknotes and coins,' he
warned in a speech to a Frankfurt banking congress.
He said satisfactory monetary results could not be obtained without proper
independence for the future European central bank - it was indispensable to
have 'not only theoretical but also a far-reaching degree of actual
independence'.
The Maastricht treaty does not call for central banking independence until
stage three of Emu. However, Mr Tietmeyer said it was 'crucial to enhance
the independence of national central banks at an early stage.'
The Bundesbank and the central banks of France and Spain are independent,
while the Bank of England is subject to government control. Others are under
varying degrees of government influence.
The European central bank's independence could not be achieved at short
notice, he said.
On monetary policy, he criticised suggestions that an all-European, or
transnational, monetary target should be set now, in stage two of Emu. The
technical and institutional pre-conditions did not yet exist for an early
switch to a common monetary policy. Opinions on future policy also differed
widely.
Mr Tietmeyer was speaking in the week of the first council meeting of the
European Monetary Institute (EMI) at its new Frankfurt headquarters. One of
its tasks is to recommend by the end of 1996 what type of inflation or money
supply targets should be pursued by the future central bank to achieve price
stability.
The EMI's goal is to produce a 'turnkey' European central bank that could
begin operating as soon as Emu receives the political go-ahead.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday supported
the objective of European economic and monetary union, but said the
timetable laid down by the Maastricht treaty for a single currency was
invalid, while Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, claimed the question of
a single currency did not arise at the moment.

FT  19 NOV 94 / New world order going badly wrong: Bruce Clark and Chrystia
Freeland explain the dispute on handling the war in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian crisis, which the US, the European powers and Russia have tried
to resolve collectively under the aegis of their international contact
group, has been the most prominent laboratory for the new post-cold war
world order.
Judging by harsh comments from senior British officials, who said yesterday
that US-UK relations were more strained than they had been since the Suez
crisis, the experiment is going badly wrong.
The catalyst for the dispute was the US decision last week to withdraw
unilaterally from enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia. This decision
was broadly expected and its immediate consequences are limited.
But some European officials, notably in France, see the US decision as more
than a gesture. It could be a declaration of support for war as a means of
ending the conflict by punishing the Serbs and allowing the Bosnians to
reclaim lost territory.
In contrast with this morally-imbued American position, Mr Charles Dick,
director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in Sandhurst, says that 'if
you are a western European government you might prefer some sort of
stalemate, no matter how unsatisfactory, to an escalation of the fighting.'
In Europe, these clashing objectives have given rise to 'a strong fear that
the US is trying to push the European forces in Bosnia into playing a direct
role in the conflict', according to one European expert. He said the
Europeans were concerned that the Americans, who have not committed any of
their own forces, 'are willing to support the Bosnian government down to the
last French or UK soldier'.
In addition to specific concerns about their own troops, the Europeans are
also accusing the US of violating the transatlantic modus vivendi
tentatively established after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
'Since the end of the cold war, we've talked about sharing responsibility,'
said Mr Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'The
Americans said that there might be situations in which the Europeans would
play a direct military role on their own.
'But even though the Americans don't have troops in Bosnia, that hasn't
prevented them from telling the Europeans what to do.'
The US administration stresses that it still respects the ban on arms
supplies to Bosnia. The government will neither send arms to Bosnia itself
nor allow US citizens to do so.
However, European officials fear that the current official US stance is
consistent with some discreet assistance to the Moslem and Croat forces,
aimed at encouraging them to overcome distrust and fight together.
Alarm bells rang in European foreign ministries last month over a report in
the New York Times of a mission to Sarajevo by retired General George
Galvin, a senior US officer.
Mr Gojko Susak, Croatian defence minister, said the US mission would be
helping to forge a joint Moslem-Croat army.
US policy statements present Croat-Moslem co-operation as something which
could form either a building block for a settlement, or the basis to pursue
war against the Serbs.
Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassador to Croatia, has termed Croat-Moslem
co-operation an 'alliance between two victims of Serbian aggression (which)
has made those two victims better able to deal diplomatically, politically
and militarily with that aggression'.
US policy-makers say they want to see Serb nationalism hemmed in for reasons
that go beyond Bosnia; they are worried by the prospect of an even bigger
standoff between Serbs and Albanians. By contrast, European diplomats fear
that stepping up pressure on Serbia by easing the arms embargo on Bosnia
could lead to an escalation of the conflict.
'If you get a Bosnian army with Croat allies making real progress then the
prospect of the war escalating has got to be on the cards,' says Mr Dick.
'It would be difficult for Belgrade not to be drawn in and then you're in
danger of a Balkan war.'
These fears have given European diplomacy - particularly that of France and
Russia - a different focus.
It aims at promoting reconciliation between Presidents Slobodan Milosevic in
Belgrade and Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb, in the hope that between them, they
could bring the situation in Bosnia under control.
France brokered a secret meeting between armed forces chiefs from Belgrade
and Zagreb in September. Moscow, for its part, has sought to boost the
authority of President Milosevic and rebuild Serbia as a bastion of Russian
influence.
Russia successfully insisted that Mr Milosevic should be rewarded for
severing ties with the Bosnian Serbs, and it now wants him to be offered
even greater rewards if he fully recognises Croatia.
The US is committed to the territorial integrity of Croatia, and it has
pressed the Serbs who control one third of that republic to settle with
Zagreb. However, it fears any approach to this problem which involves
boosting the status of Mr Milosevic.
Fear of antagonising the Russians, with their strong historic and cultural
ties to Serbia, is another source of European objections to the US decision
to withdraw from the arms embargo. The Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, reiterated fierce Russian criticisms of the US move yesterday in
Paris when he told reporters: 'All of us share anxiety over military
developments in Bosnia and object to resolving the Bosnian problem by
force.'
But many western observers believe that for the time being Russia is too
weak to take action matching its verbal protests. 'The Americans appear to
be calculating that Yeltsin will not respond,' Mr Eyal said, 'and, for now,
they are probably right.'
However, with outside powers pursuing at least two separate strategies in
Bosnia, analysts fear that the rival approaches could become disastrously
entangled.
In mid-January, Croatia must decide whether to renew the mandate of the UN
peace-keepers on its territory. If it does not, that will be a signal that
it intends to retake by force the land which it has lost to the Serbs.
Diplomat see this as a real possibility.
Amid confusing signals from the main capitals, Mr Tudjman might conclude
that he can win out both ways: the US will support his forces - as long as
they are fighting within their own republic - while Russia restrains Mr
Milosevic.
If that calculation then proves wrong, an almighty war will ensue.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Yeltsin backs reform and austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday expressed strong support for economic
reform in Russia and for the first time publicly endorsed the austere 1995
draft budget, which is seen by many economists as a prelude to a full
stabilisation plan but which ran into fierce parliamentary opposition
earlier this week.
'Our financial policy is determined by the draft budget - it is tough, but
it is necessary in our conditions,' he said.
However, Mr Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, fighting for his political
life after allegations of corruption in the military, later launched an
emotional attack on the 1995 budget, saying its proposed spending cuts put
the army 'under threat'.
'For the sake of the country's security think about this budget. Ask
yourself - do we need an army? If so, it is a sin to keep it in poverty and
half-starved,' he told the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
Mr Yeltsin's continuing adherence to economic reform had appeared in doubt
after a recent ministerial reshuffle which had promoted both conservatives
and reformers in roughly equal measure. But Mr Yeltsin said the new cabinet
members would strengthen reform, highlighting the contribution of its two
leading proponents.
Mr Yeltsin described Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the new economics minister, as a
'top-class professional with a market outlook' and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
former privatisation chief who was appointed first deputy prime minister, as
a man who would not take a 'single step away from reforms'.
But Mr Yeltsin acknowledged the trauma that economic reform was producing in
Russia. 'If they say that for an individual moving house is equal to a fire,
then for a country reforms are like a typhoon,' he said.
Mr Grachev said military funding was running at about half the Rbs37.7bn
(Pounds 7.3bn) planned for the full year. He said the cash shortages had
resulted in 2,600 young Russian officers leaving the army this year.
Russia could attract more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 36bn) of foreign
investment in its energy sector if the country's legal and tax regimes were
more flexible, US and Russian experts told an industry conference in Moscow
this week.
Feasibility studies for several giant development projects have already been
conducted by foreign companies but many will never be realised unless there
is a more predictable and stable investment climate, western executives
said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Flexibility urged on energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia could attract more than Dollars 60bn (Pounds 36bn) of foreign
investment in its energy sector if the country's legal and tax regimes were
more flexible, US and Russian experts told an industry conference in Moscow
this week.
Feasibility studies for several giant development projects have already been
conducted by foreign companies but will never be realised unless there is a
more predictable and stable investment climate, western executives said.
'There is simply too much uncertainty and confusion at present,' said one US
oil company director.
The conference, organised by the Russian Energy Ministry and the US Energy
Department, attempted to resolve the legislative and fiscal difficulties
obstructing foreign investment.
Mr Yury Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, said progress had been made
and it was recognised that 'strict rules of the game' had to be applied. US
representatives held out hopes that fresh legislation concerning foreign
investment in Russia's underground resources could be introduced into the
Russian parliament as early as next month.
Such legislation would face a tough passage, because of the political
sensitivities involved, but sources close to the Energy Ministry suggested a
presidential decree could be used to break any legislative impasse.
Foreign oil companies complained that one of the main deterrents to
long-term investment was the ambiguous legal position of oil ventures, given
the overlapping jurisdictions of administrative and commercial law. At
present, licences awarded by the Russian authorities to develop energy
reserves fall under administrative law, which cannot be challenged in
international courts. Western oil companies prefer production sharing
agreements (PSAs), common in other parts of the world, which would be
subject to international arbitration.
Russia's confusing tax regime, the potential threat of an abrupt termination
of production rights and the absence of a workable system of dispute
arbitration were also cited as stumbling blocks.
Some western oil executives privately expressed dismay at the bureaucratic
delays they had encountered over the past few years and doubted that new
legislation could be swiftly implemented.
'There is still no national consensus in Russia on how they should exploit
their energy resources,' said one western executive.
Mr Bill White, US deputy secretary of energy, urged Russia to reform its
investment legislation speedily, saying an international race was under way
to supply the increasing demand for oil. 'The countries which encourage that
investment and are first will be able to sell their production on an
economic basis and those that lag behind will not,' Mr White said.

FT  19 NOV 94 / US Congress told of choices in re-arming Bosnian forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has provided Congress with 'theoretical models'
by which the Bosnian army could be re-armed but accompanied them with
warnings of the dire consequences of such a policy being implemented
unilaterally by the US.
The options, which have been fully discussed with diplomats from Nato
countries in Washington, are legally required under the terms of the
Nunn-Mitchell Act of last autumn. Members of Congress were also briefed on
them this week.
The act laid out a timetable for the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia,
failing Bosnian Serb acceptance of a peace settlement. However, it had been
rendered temporarily and partly moot by the decision of the Bosnian
government last month not to ask for an end to the arms embargo for another
six months.
The three principal options, ranging from the minimal to the maximum, are:
Lifting the arms embargo, but not supplying arms from US government sources.
Instead private weapons sales would be authorised.
What is known as 'light' US supply, costing about Dollars 400m (Pounds
244m), and mostly confined to small arms and anti-tank and anti-artillery
missiles, together with some training of Bosnian army personnel.
The 'heavy' option, worth perhaps Dollars 5bn, would place few limits on the
nature of the arms supplied and would involve heavy training in use.
But a Pentagon spokesman emphasised that these options were only being
presented because of the legal obligation and 'to point out the serious
implications if they are implemented'.
Western diplomats agreed. One said administration officials had been at
pains to stress that the options only embraced 'theory', and there was
little difference of views between the Pentagon and CIA and European
ministries of the consequences in the Balkans and for Nato and the UN
peacekeeping presence of re-arming the Bosnian government.
Congressman Newt Gingrich, the likely next Speaker of the House, said
yesterday he was opposed to any substantial reconstruction and military aid
to Bosnia on budgetary grounds, adding: 'It's largely a European problem.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / All cordial at UK-French summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHARTRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of France and the UK yesterday capped a harmonious summit by
declaring their joint intent to persist with peacekeeping in Bosnia and by
acting to co-ordinate their air forces in future peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations.
They took their expected decision to set up a small planning unit of five
officers from each air force with the long name of the 'Franco-British
European Air Group'. Based at the Royal Air Force base at High Wycombe under
the initial command of a French air force general, the unit's task will be
to draw up requirements and procedures for joint peacekeeping actions.
But UK prime minister John Major also went further than the French had hoped
by agreeing to set up with France a study of possible UK participation in
the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), an ambitious project for a new European
military transport aircraft on which Paris sets great store.
Mr Major separated this move from the immediate issue concerning that 'part
of our (Lockheed) C130 fleet which is very near the end of its operational
life'. The option here was to either refurbish these aircraft or to buy some
of the newer C130J models, he said.
He said the FLA study with France was 'without commitment' to Britain's
eventual decision on its longer-term military transport plans. But 'we need
to see if our economic and military interests can coincide, and if they do
we can proceed together' with other Europeans.
Deliberately focusing more on their mutual defence and foreign policy
interests and less on more divisive internal European Union issues, UK and
French leaders found it easy to reach agreement. But President Francois
Mitterrand went out of his way to say that, measured by past Franco-British
summits, yesterday's had taken place 'in the best climate for several
years'.
At a concluding press conference, Mr Mitterrand and Mr Major both seemed to
see the European Union's planned constitutional conference in 1996 in
remarkably similar terms. The French president said the 1996 conference
'should concentrate on securing the achievements of Maastricht, before
passing on to fresh territory', while Mr Major said he did not believe it
would be 'a great leap forward'. Mr Mitterrand leaves office next May and he
sees Maastricht as part of his legacy.
Clearly anxious not to rouse Eurosceptics' susceptibilities at home, Mr
Major stressed that yesterday's new defence moves were 'not some startling
innovation, but a natural development of longstanding co-operation' between
France and the UK. However, the High Wycombe command is the first joint
military organisation between the two countries. It may one day extended to
'our European partners', UK and French defence ministers said in a
communique yesterday.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Ahern leading Fianna Fail race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The likely shape of Ireland's future coalition may become clearer today when
Fianna Fail, the senior partner in the outgoing coalition, decides on a
successor to Mr Albert Reynolds, who resigned as prime minister on Thursday.
Two candidates have so far declared themselves: outgoing finance minister Mr
Bertie Ahern, the clear favourite, and outgoing justice minister Mrs Maire
Geoghegan-Quinn.
Mr Reynolds' resignation followed the withdrawal from government of the
Labour party, junior coalition partners. Mr Dick Spring, Labour's leader and
deputy prime minister, accused Mr Reynolds of misleading the Dail, Ireland's
parliament.
The row began with Mr Reynolds' appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan as
president of the High Court, a move bitterly criticised by Labour.
Under fire from Labour and opposition parties, Mrs Quinn offered her own
resignation on Wednesday night. It was turned down by Mr Reynolds.
It is widely expected that if Mrs Quinn won the nomination, Labour would
look elsewhere for a new alliance with one of the opposition parties,
leaving Fianna Fail to go into opposition.
The politicians have until Tuesday to agree a new government, after Mr
Reynolds decided not to seek parliament's dissolution but to try to forge a
new alliance between the existing parties. If he is unsuccessful a general
election will have to be called.
Mr Ahern represents Dublin. Once known as 'anorak man' because of his dress
sense, he is respected in business circles for his management of the
economy.
A former chief whip, he is the party rank and file's favourite to succeed Mr
Reynolds. As a former trade union official, he earned a reputation as a
negotiator, a skill which could be useful if Fianna Fail is to form a new
alliance.
A meeting of the parliamentary members to select a leader was adjourned on
Thursday after news that Mr Whelehan had resigned.
Mr Reynolds is expected to submit his resignation as party chief at today's
meeting. He had been expected to announce he was stepping down earlier but
is understood to have delayed the decision in a bid to influence the
succession. He is said to favour Mrs Quinn.
Mrs Quinn represents Galway West. She has won a reputation for competent
handling of the difficult justice portfolio, despite a recent slip-up over
the release of IRA prisoners, which she quickly had to cancel after the
murder of a Newry postal worker in Northern Ireland.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Serb jets bombard 'safe area' of Bihac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serb aircraft yesterday bombarded Bihac, the UN-designated safe area in
northwestern Bosnia, ignoring warnings of Nato retaliation, a UN spokesman
said.
The air attack came as Serb troops, backed by forces loyal to Mr Fikret
Abdic, the renegade Moslem leader, tightened a noose round the Bosnian
government Fifth Corps in Bihac.
Nato, which is policing a UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, could not confirm the
attack. Bosnia's mountainous terrain makes it difficult for radar to detect
air attacks.
The UN has threatened to call in Nato air power if Bihac was attacked. Its
Security Council was due to meet last night to discuss the attack.
In Sarajevo, meanwhile, the Bosnian Federation assembly building was hit by
a guided missile yesterday as the UN commander in Bosnia was snubbed by the
Serbs in attempts to have them discuss the city's security crisis.
As the military situation in and around Sarajevo deteriorated further and
threw into doubt the future of an uneasy truce that has prevailed since
February, the UN said Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic had refused demands
for a meeting.
The jets that attacked Bihac are believed to have taken off from nearby
Udbine, Croatia, claimed by Serbs as part of their 'state' of Krajina.
Krajina Serbs have joined Mr Abdic's forces in the counter-offensive
launched by Bosnian Serb forces.
The increased involvement of Krajina forces casts a long shadow over
international efforts to restore relations between Zagreb and Knin, the Serb
stronghold in Croatia.
It plays into the hands of those Krajina leaders who are close to their
Bosnian Serb counterparts. They hope to scupper any deal that President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia reaches with Croatia.
Despite intense pressure from Mr Milosevic, Krajina leaders yesterday
rejected a proposed agreement on forging economic links with Zagreb on the
grounds that it was tied to the question of Krajina's political status.
It dashes hopes that the Krajina assembly will today approve the agreement
to restore water, power and fuel links between the breakaway Serb state and
Croatia.
International mediators have been pushing for an agreement, hoping to
isolate the Bosnian Serb leaders who rejected a peace plan.
As the fighting continues - and despite a blockade from Mr Milosevic - the
Bosnian Serbs appear even less inclined to endorse the plan that would
divide Bosnia between them and the Moslem-Croat alliance.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Gaza killings threaten peace: 12 killed and 200 injured as
violence erupts between PLO and Islamic extremists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GAZA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
At least 12 Palestinians were killed and 200 wounded in the Gaza Strip
yesterday in the worst internal violence since the establishment of
self-rule in May.
The first bloodshed between Palestinian police and Islamic extremists marks
a dangerous escalation of the conflict between the Palestinian Liberation
Organisation, which controls the police, and the Islamic extremists in the
self-rule areas.
Palestinian observers warned increasing confrontation could spark civil war.
'Israel is placing more obstacles and pressures on the Palestinian authority
and is pushing it towards civil war,' said Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the
PLO political department.
The shootings come amid warnings from PLO officials and western diplomats
that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is in danger of collapsing.
Hours before yesterday's clashes, Mr Terje Larsen, United Nations
under-secretary general responsible for Palestinian territories, said: 'If
there is no change immediately, there will be more killing, more blood. . .
My assessment is that both the peace process and the legitimacy of the
Palestinian Authority are losing ground day by day and the reason is that
nearly nothing has been delivered on the ground.'
Witnesses said the violence began outside a Gaza City mosque during Friday
prayers. Palestinian police took loudspeakers off a truck being prepared for
a rally of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and the Islamic Jihad
groups which oppose the Israel-PLO peace accords. Supporters then attacked
police with stones and bottles. After warning the crowd to stop, police
opened fire at close range with automatic rifles.
Sheikh Ahmed Bahar, a leading Hamas activist who gave the Friday sermon,
appealed over loudspeakers to police to cease fire. 'Stop shooting your own
people or else you will pay a high price,' he said.
Sporadic fire was exchanged between police and Islamic gunmen all day. A
Palestinian policeman was among the dead.
Hundreds of relatives gathered outside Gaza's Shifta Hospital, shouting
slogans against Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO and head of the
self-rule authority, whom they dubbed a 'traitor' and a 'collaborator'.
Police arrested about 300 Islamic militants and posted sharp-shooters on the
roofs of buildings.
The violence follows increasing tension between Mr Arafat and a resurgent
Islamic opposition which has challenged his authority on Gaza's streets and
aimed to sabotage the peace process.
Mr Arafat, under pressure from Israel to crack down on extremists
responsible for recent attacks on Israel, has twice ordered the police to
arrest scores of activists and said he would not tolerate unlawful activity.
He has banned illegal weapons but Islamic groups openly defy him.
Police said later they had been acting on information that armed Islamic
Jihad activists were planning a rally after Friday prayers. They said they
had been provoked into confrontation. Officials said Mr Arafat had given
orders to security personnel to act firmly and 'respond severely with armed
militants no matter what the results'.
Hamas, calling the shootings a 'massacre', urged its supporters to defy the
police.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Battle for VSEL intensifies as BAe raises bid to Pounds 560m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace raised the stakes yesterday in the battle for VSEL by
increasing its share offer for the nuclear submarine-maker to about Pounds
560m. This is some 5 per cent above GEC's rival cash bid. BAe also raised
its cash alternative to match GEC's Pounds 14-a-share offer.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said the new offer was designed to put
it on level terms with GEC before the Office of Fair Trading decides whether
to refer the bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
'We will now be able to get back to the real commercial and competition
issues,' Mr Evans said. He denied that the timing of the offer reflected
BAe's view of the likelihood of GEC's bid being referred, estimating the
odds at 'about 50-50'.
Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance director, added: 'We were advised that it
was very unlikely that we could buy VSEL for less than Pounds 14 a share
even if the GEC bid was referred.'
Most analysts believe GEC will return with a higher bid, possibly before the
OFT's decision, which is due by December 7.
'GEC has to come back even if it means overpaying,' said Mr Sandy Morris,
engineering analyst at NatWest Securities. 'BAe is making an aggressive move
into GEC's patch.'
GEC said that it would make 'an appropriate response' to the revised offer
in due course while VSEL recommended that its shareholders take no action.
The cash alternative for the new BAe offer will be funded by a novel
two-stage rights issue at 390p, which will allow BAe to increase the offer
again without having to renegotiate its underwriting. If it did raise its
offer further, BAe said it would seek shareholder approval before sealing a
successful bid.
Even if BAe's bid fails, it will raise Pounds 178m from the first tranche of
the issue. The second tranche, which is conditional on the offer succeeding,
will raise up to a further Pounds 357m, exactly matching any extra funds BAe
requires to meet the cash alternative. BAe said Pounds 178m was the lowest
fixed amount it could raise under such a scheme and denied suggestions that
the structure of the deal was designed to strengthen its balance sheet even
if the bid failed.
VSEL has a cash pile of almost Pounds 300m and some observers have described
BAe's bid as a 'disguised rights issue' to broaden its narrow asset base.
BAe said at the higher offer, VSEL would still enhance earnings by more than
10 per cent next year and it would not lead to any dilution 'for the
foreseeable future'. VSEL's shares rose 90p to Pounds 14.88, about 16p above
the value of BAe's 3.3 for 1 share offer. BAe's share price fell 19p to
446p. GEC's rose 2p to 287.5p.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Faster economic growth fuels rates concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy grew at its fastest annual rate for six years in the third
quarter, indicating that the recovery is far stronger than the Treasury or
City had predicted.
But the pace of growth revived fears that Mr Eddie George, the governor of
the Bank of England, might push for a further increase in interest rates
before the end of the year.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that gross domestic product
grew at a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent between the second and third
quarters, up from its earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent.
Since figures for earlier quarters were also revised upwards, the result was
that third-quarter GDP was 4.2 per cent higher than in the same period a
year ago. The last time the economy grew at such a pace was in the fourth
quarter of 1988.
Even if the economy fails to grow at all in the fourth quarter, GDP for the
calendar year 1994 will be 3.7 per cent higher than in 1993. At the start of
the year, the Treasury forecast and the City consensus was for an increase
of just 2.5 per cent.
Most estimates are that the long-term growth rate of the UK economy is
between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. This year's rapid growth means that the
so-called output gap - the difference between actual and potential output -
is narrowing fast. Economic theory suggests that inflation will accelerate
sharply once the output gap disappears.
September's increase in interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent
was partly spurred by evidence of faster-than-expected economic growth.
While economic statistics published earlier this week, notably on inflation
and retail sales, had appeared to rule out an imminent rate rise,
yesterday's GDP figures might persuade the governor that quick action is
needed to slow the pace of growth.
The GDP figures also weakened hopes for an investment-led recovery, in which
the consumer took a back seat. Investment actually fell in the third
quarter, while consumers' expenditure was responsible for about a third of
the GDP increase.
Nevertheless, other figures published yesterday painted a mixed picture of
consumer confidence. Although consumer credit rose in October, mortgage
lending faltered following the interest rate rise in September. The Building
Societies Association said net advances, which take into account loan
repayments, fell significantly to Pounds 788m in October, down from Pounds
1.14bn in September. This was the lowest level since February.
The broad measure of the money supply, M4, was also sluggish. The Bank of
England said yesterday that M4 had grown by 3.8 per cent in the year to
October, the slowest rate for a year.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Counter voice - Making fun of fashion is no
longer fun because everybody's doing it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It should no longer surprise anyone that fashion can have its own way with
history. Last month's Milan collections plundered the teenage innocence of
1950s Americana - pink satin preppy blouses, marabou powder puffs,
rhinestones and sequins - and gleefully married it to a sleazy 1970s catwalk
soundtrack (Barry White, Roxy Music and Gloria Gaynor) without so much as a
second thought.
It is not only textures and fabrics which today's designers feel able to mix
and match, it is entire decades and sensibilities, all helping to give a
'feel' to a new collection; and in the Italy of the 1990s, crocked by
corruption and cynicism, what better way of brightening the national mood
than this panchronistic explosion of fun and glamour?
Fashion is far from unique in this regard; the history of art in Western
culture is a long, interminable cycle of stolen ideas, fads and hommages to
distant cultures. Music and literature, too, frequently refer to their own
histories. But fushion's recycling of past glories is distinguished by the
sheer speed of reinvention. Technological innovation and the demands of the
mass media enable a trend to bloom, wither and die in less than 12 months.
Some, it might be said, do not even deserve to last that long. When
designers first raided the 1970s, barely 20 years after the original
version, many observers could hardly believe their eyes; this, after all,
was the decade which taste forgot, the era of tragic haircuts,
sprained-ankle footwear and flapping loons, its garish ghastliness captured
exquisitely by Clodagh Rodgers and her hot pants strutting their sorry stuff
at the Eurovision Song Contest. Surely they could not come back?
The answer from the streets was: why ever not? For as the style nightmare
has been enthusiastically relived over the past couple of years, it has
become increasingly apparent that traditional notions of good and bad taste
simply do not apply any longer; indeed, that the very notion of bringing
aesthetic judgment to bear on how we look is being satirised by the new
generation of plunderers. Looking good has taken a back seat to making fun.
It seems that in fashion, as in so many other areas, the post-modern
sensibility, revelling in the fragmented and the multi-focal, mocking
seriousness with its unrelenting tone of playful irony, has taken over. Good
taste is yesterday's phrase (prompting the thought that it may itself come
back into vogue tomorrow); but for the moment, anything goes.
No figure has better encapsulated the triumph of the post-modern, ironic
outlook than Franco Moschino, the Italian designer who died in September.
Where his contemporaries bedecked their garments with accessories or
carefully modulated patterns, Moschino instead chose self-mocking slogans:
'Waist of Money' flouted one waistline; 'A Shirt For Fashion Victims Only'
teased another.
Needless to say, the joke comes expensive, but it is not clear who is its
perpetrator and who is its victim. Those wearing the garments can reassure
themselves that they are 'in' on the jest, but that is not how an outside
observer might see it. Certainly the quest for beauty, the traditional aim
of all who work in the visual and design arts, is being endlessly deferred
in a bewildering, multi-layered comic conspiracy.
Moschino's supporters have applauded his work on the grounds that it brought
much-needed fun to a business which had become full of itself. In this
respect, today's post-modern viewpoint mirrors the camp sensibility that
exerted such an influence on earlier generations' tastes.
In her powerful essay Notes on Camp, written 30 years ago, Susan Sontag
spoke of the 'love of the exaggerated, the 'off', of
things-being-what-they-are-not', which can also be seen in much of today's
fashion.
Sontag quoted approvingly Oscar Wilde's observation that a doorknob could be
as admirable as a painting, as a shrewd anticipation of the 'democratic
esprit' of camp. Both of them would surely have joined Moschino in poking
fun at the po-faced, high-blown pretentions of haute couture.
And yet, there are differences between the social context in which Sontag
wrote her essay and that of today. In putting forward an intellectual
justification for camp, Sontag emphasised its role as a counter-balance to
the pervading mood of moral seriousness. 'Camp is a solvent of morality,'
she wrote. 'It neutralises moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.
'Camp taste is, above all, a mode of enjoyment, of appreciation - not
judgment. Camp is generous. It wants to enjoy.'
In the US of the early 1960s, when Notes on Camp was written, one would
surely have taken Sontag's point. Here was a society heaving with the strain
of cold war politics, still grieving over the brutal assassination of its
president, and forced to reassess its core values after the civil rights
marches and the challenges they posed to the country's constitution.
It was an intense time, and Sontag's celebration of Wilde, of witty
hedonism, of Camp's 'comic vision of the world', were in sharp contrast and
relief to the earnest mood of passionate debate which dominated the country
(as was the growth of Pop Art and the sillier counter-cultural movements of
the decade's later years).
It is hard to detect any of that moral gravity in today's prevailing
climate. In the US and Europe, post-modern politics, philosophy and art,
basking in ambiguity and relativism, dancing on the graves of the century's
dominant ideologies, have undermined the desire for morally committed
debate.
Camp, irony, playfulness have become the norm - no longer are they suspended
in a balance against the more stolid virtues of moral certitude and
argumentative rigour. Fun works best as an antidote to solemnity. The very
last thing we need in 1994 is to chuckle knowingly at a funny frock on the
catwalk. If society-at-large cannot be serious, perhaps we might look at the
masterful cut of a sumptuous fabric to take the lead

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: The route of the suit - The man's suit
today may seem impervious to fashion's whims, but it has taken two centuries
of nipping and tucking to shape. James Ferguson traces its evolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES FERGUSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Concise History of 20th Century Costume comes to be written, the
chapter on men could be distilled into one word. Suit. What the doublet and
hose were to the 16th century, the periwig to the 17th, cocked hat to the
18th and frock coat to the 19th, so the business suit will be to the 20th: a
symbol for its age.
The first office suit - the 'lounge' or 'suit of dittoes' of the 1880s - was
originally tweedy country wear for the man of means. This was an adaptation
of the workwear that the lowly bumpkin had been toiling in for a good
hundred years. Slowly it started sneaking into town, mingling with the frock
coat, and by 1900 every clerk was wearing one. It was as drab a costume as
there had ever been. Fashioned from sagging, sweaty serge, the jacket was
fastened so high that the shirt to be seen at all - required a
throat-slicing, four-inch-high, starched linen cylinder of a collar, jamming
the head into the era's equally uncompromising black bowler hat.
Men's fashion is rarely a sprint - it's a long-distance event, and the
lounge suit was no slouch. Having developed from the sporting and military
garb of the early 19th century, it turned out to have hidden stamina. It
just needed getting into shape.
The legs in particular had to be worked on. Trousers, or pantaloons, had
replaced kneebreeches in the years after Waterloo and had settled into the
19th century foot-strapped and braced, harnessing a man like a horse. But in
about 1880, spats on shoes appeared and creases were introduced on to the
sides of trousers. Then turn-ups came in, inspired by sport - ever the R&amp;D
department of men's fashion - where men were rolling up their hems to avoid
the mud on race tracks. And, finally, the invention of the trouser press in
the 1890s allowed full-length front and back creases and turn-ups proper.
So, by 1910, modern trousers were up and running.
Next, the jacket, which had too much flab round its middle. In 1912 a
post-Edwardian Scissorhands discovered that two vertical darts, one above
each hip pocket, did what the horizontal waist seam had been doing for the
frock coat and morning coat - that is, gave it shape. Now, bespoke tailors
could render the jacket elegant enough for their top-drawer clients, whom
everybody else would surely follow. The lounge suit was in business.
It soon shouldered aside the morning coat, which had already jostled the
frock coat on to the sidelines of posh weddings, horse races and pompous
state occasions. (The frock coat has since been reduced to funeral wear,
while the morning coat turns out gamely for Ascot and costumey weddings.)
Even the star of evening events, the tail coat, found itself elbowed into
head waiterdom by that lounge for lounge lizards: the dinner jacket.
By the 1920s pleats had been developed in trousers, giving the front crease
somewhere to go and enabling quantities of cloth to be folded under the
waistband. Consequently, Oxord bags were invented in 1924. They helped blow
away the fust of the 19th century, and their width influenced fashion for
the next 30 years.
The English drape, which had an acreage of material 'draping' from the new,
broader-shouldered jacket, arrived early in the 1930s. Peaked lapels, narrow
hips and wide, tapering trousers in confident chalkstripes or Glenurquhart
check contrived against nature to bless the wearer with a V-shaped manliness
to help defy the Depression. Edward VIII, then the Prince of Wales, wore it
to perfection, and where the prince led, Hollywood dandies - Astaire, Gable,
Cooper, Grant - followed. So powerful was the influence of the celluloid
celebrities that the English drape had become the American drape by the end
of the decade.
Then came the second world war. The US emerged in winning form. Confident as
hell, the all-American male swaggered out of it even more manly, rolling his
super-wide, extra-padded gaberdine shoulders, rubbing his hands together and
looking forward to an endless summer of profitable world domination. But a
few icy gusts from the cold war in the 1950s put paid to that idea. He
withdrew into a Brooks Brothers grey flannel suit - a buttoned-up,
button-down, Ivy League corporate man.
In the UK in the post-war ration years, only two sections of society could
afford to dress up: toffs and spivs. The spivs went directly for the
Technicolor American look, a strictly new money concoction of wide-boy
shoulders, big lapels, lots of drape, hand-painted ties and Al Capone
two-tone shoes. It was flash, brash and bought for cash at Cecil Gee's shop
on the Charing Cross Road. At the opposite, less colourful end of the social
spectrum, former Guards officers went to Savile Row for a long, narrow,
nipped and tucked interpretation of Edwardiana, complete with bowlers,
carnations and canes. Both styles faded away when rationing was stopped, but
they revealed the beginnings of two enduring influences: a love affair with
the US and the first stirrings of nostalgia.
The most significant style of the 1950s, however, looked only forward. It
emerged from Italy's post-war ricostruzione, which grabbed the attention of
the young. This was the Italy of coffee bars, Lambrettas and sharp haircuts.
Suits, as pioneered by the Roman tailor Gaetano Savini Brioni, were edited
to the limit: shortish jackets, sloping natural shoulders, narrow trousers
without pleats or turn-ups and horizontal pockets, like jeans. All very
novel, but, more importantly, made in lightweight materials: silk shantung
or mohair. From now on the heavyweights would struggle. The Italians had
burst on to the men's fashion scene, and they have since been front-runners.
In the late 1950s, the French designer Pierre Cardin set about replacing the
squatness of the Italian suit with a longer, cylindrical, fitted look, and
it was this that became the standard silhouette of the 1960s. Lapels all but
disappeared from vented jackets; skimpy, low-hipped trousers hung shy of
shoes. In the age of youth, grown men were letting their hair down and
wearing boys' suits. Worse was to come: by the early 1970s, beneath artfully
teased feather cuts, they were wearing girls' suits. The exaggeratedly
waisted jacket with deep vents, no shoulders to speak of, aircraft carrier
lapels and dangerously tight trousers flaring out over a pair of brown and
cream platform boots, looked as laughable as it reads.
Back in the office, there was a particular black and pale grey mohair Tonik
cloth which looked snappy on a 17-year-old in 1967, but seemed like greasy,
overcooked Bacofoil by 1978, on a 40-year-old.
The Hirondelle-bottle silhouette of the 1970s was discarded amid the
infighting between preppies, punks, rockabillies, Sloane rangers and a dozen
other clans. But of all these factions it is perhaps the yuppies who most
summed up the spirit of the 1980s - with an aggressive, inverted wedge-shape
silhouette, small slicked head, big shoulders (new money again), big chests,
no vents, loose pleated trousers, with turn-ups and let's-get-to-work
braces. Something Italian, like Armani, something bossy, like BOSS. There
was no messing with the American loafers or the Brooks Brothers shirt, but
the Hermes tie with the witty motif showed, hey, a sense of irony.
There is no doubt that the suit will see the century out, and probably the
next one, too. Reviled, revered, revived, revamped, unstructured,
deconstructed, oversized and understated, it is currently being slimmed down
and softened up in the Edwardian manner: archaic but evocative in blackish
Cheviot. Whatever fashion dictates, it will have said it all before.
Nevertheless, if you want to look your best and remain totally invisible at
the same time, wear a suit.

<TEXT>
the glamour-puss is back. Here comes the femme fatale, a dead ringer for
Gianni Versace's Cyber Princess, teetering on her vertiginous heels, all
dressed up in a languid, bias-cut slip of a dress and an elegant string of
pearls. It is a look that only truly comes into its own at night, and it
needs the make-up to match.
A full, red mouth is the hallmark of this winter's face. lf you buy nothing
else, buy a red lipstick. Reds, as every woman knows, come in many shades,
and the rule of thumb is to take time and trouble to find the one that suits
your mood: rich, vibrant and glossy for when you're feeling vampish; the
barest of lip stains for when you want to show some restraint; or a deep
vermilion for when you want to throw caution to the wind. For the
faint-hearted, deep reds can be diluted with lip balm. For the bold and
confident, a lip liner should be used first - to create a perfect lip shape
and then the chosen red should be applied with a lip brush. There are shades
of red for every skin tone.
Go for a dramatic look in the evening. Draw a smoky line inside and outside
the edge of the eye. For the really daring, coloured eyeshadow - even bright
China blue, until recently a definite no-no - looks new and fresh.
Every cosmetic house worth its lip gloss has come up with the foundations,
the blushers and the colours that this winter's face requires - at a price.
You could spend as little as pounds 29.70 at the least expensive house or as
much as pounds 219 on the basic essentials for the new haute chic look.
Here, we chart the price of the look from four cosmetic houses.

<TEXT>
This winter, the fashion wheel has turned - decisively. From the glossy
pages of the world's most authoritative fashion bibles to the windows of the
smallest high street store, a new sort of woman is being celebrated. Out go
shapeless shrouds and dreary shifts. Out go combat boots and pale faced
waifs. In come shapely curves and clothes that flatter, high-gloss make-up
and well-groomed tresses. Womanly fashion is here again. It is quite all
right - essential even - to be grown-up.
The best, the most creative, of its designers have perceived, almost before
it happened, a shift in the zeitgeist. Fashion, as sensitive a barometer of
social change as any mainstream art, is functioning as it should.
A society grown tired of the swankiness of the 1980s, exhausted by the
confusing images of the early 1990s and weary of the drabness of grunge is
more than ready for something new.
With the worst of the recession behind us and a renewed sense of optimism in
the air, it is time to dress up again, time for artifice, time to practise
the age-old arts of seduction and, above all, time to have a little
light-hearted fun.
Nowhere is the new-style glamour more evident than after dark, and then it
comes in many guises. Sometimes it emerges tongue-in-cheek, sometimes it is
straight parody and sometimes just sheer knock-out beautiful. Everywhere
there are references to glamour's golden age, the heyday of Hollywood and
the celluloid sirens with their permanent waves, painted nails and faces.
At other times, it plays with covering up beautiful women in traditional
men's clothing, reminding us irresistibly of Marlene Dietrich in The Blue
Angel, or Katharine Hepburn in Sylvia Scarlett, or Yves Saint Laurent's
hard-edged tuxedos of the 1970s.
For dedicated followers of the fashion scene the old glamour standbys are
there: the sheer stockings with short, short skirts, the stiletto heels with
mannish trouser suits, the careful grooming, the deliberate air of artifice.
Most importantly, the look this winter is one that each can adapt to her
own. Here, on these pages, are some of the many ways to get all dressed up
when you have somewhere to go.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Where the Dickins is Mrs Jones? - Major
department stores have lost many of their traditional customers. In an
attempt to boost business, they are now spending large sums on image,
service and fashion.  Will it work?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain's large department stores have a problem. There they are, purveying
a vast array of goods, floors upon floors of food halls and labels,
treatment rooms and restaurants, pianos and clothes, clothes, clothes, but
where does Mrs Jones prefer to shop? The small specialist store.
Brand identity, personality, call it what you will, is what department
stores seem to lack. Ask Mrs Jones to describe what sort of a personality
the average store has and the answer is bland, anodyne, faceless. The few
perceived as vivid characters are the ones that are doing well.
In a casual survey polled for this article, the most robust personalities on
our high streets turned out to be Marks &amp; Spencer, which came first, with
the Gap, Jigsaw (although a slight weakening was detected in the past year),
Joseph, French Connection (going from strength to strength), Harvey Nichols
(still up there but looking shaky) and Liberty as strong contenders.
First to establish a powerful personality in the high street was Next, under
the guidance of George Davies. So strong was its brand identity that
shoppers, even if led blindfold into one of its branches, were able to
recognise it as a Next store.
The Next initiative marked a big change in retailing. Until then most
retailers had paid only lip service to the notion of display and shop
fittings as effective selling tools. 'Next got everybody off the fence,'
says Stephen Marks, chief shareholder and founder of the French Connection
and Nicole Farhi labels. 'It imprinted design across the high street and
re-educated the public.'
Bigger retailers were soon spurred into action, and many industry observers
believe that it was the Next example that provoked Marks &amp; Spencer to update
its image and achieve the excellent results we see today.
The department stores were slower on the uptake. Until relatively recently,
according to Meg Gilmore, marketing director for House of Fraser, they did
not see the smaller chains and specialists as competition. 'The stores were
terribly complacent; they thought that selling everything under one roof was
enough.' But by failing to establish distinctive personalities they were in
danger of becoming the faceless giants of the high street or, even worse, of
not surviving into the next century.
By the end of the 1980s the figures, certainly, seemed to throw doubt on
their ability to pull through. There had been a decline in the number of
department store outlets, a fall in their share of total retail sales and a
below-average growth in turnover.
Research carried out by House of Fraser at the turn of this decade must have
made depressing reading for executives at all the major store groups, not
just House of Fraser. It revealed that most women could not tell one
department store from another and believed that 'they all sell the same
thing'.
The effects of the recession have been felt by department store retailers in
several ways, the most critical of which was the softening of the housing
market and a consequent decline in the sales of household goods. This,
combined with the upsurge in discount specialists such as factory outlets
and warehouse clubs, has spurred many of them to concentrate on other areas.
The most obvious solution was to expand their sales of fashion.
Fashion has not, in the past 30 years anyway, been a marked characteristic
of the department store personality. The youth quake of the 1960s encouraged
the rise of the small specialist boutique, while department stores were
traditionally seen as the preserve of the mature customer. The last thing
that radical youth wanted was to shop where their mothers did.
In a sense, not much has changed. House of Fraser's main target group is
women over the age of 35, and statistics show that the number of people in
the 33-54 age band will grow by 1.5 million in the next five years. What has
changed are the aspirations and attitudes of that shopper. The mature
shopper of today is the radical of yesterday. Fashion, rather than clothing,
is important to them.
As Stephen Marks points out: 'The consumer is far more sophisticated and
aware now than at any time in the past 30 years. The Clothes Show has huge
audiences. Why? Because everybody's interested in fashion. When even Marks &amp;
Spencer does windows that are fashionable, you have to realise that
attitudes have changed.'
That change has forced department stores to take a long, hard look, perhaps
for the first time, at the competition from the smaller specialist shops. It
is that group which, in the UK anyway, has pioneered the most sophisticated
aspects of modern retailing, such as creating a pleasant environment for
shoppers, improving display and shop fittings. Display is now seen as so
important, particularly by the store groups, that it is dignified by the
title of 'visual merchandising'. Harrods now has an artistic design
director.
Joseph Ettedgui, owner of the Joseph shops and Joseph Tricot label, and
considered by his peers to be the most prescient retailer in Britain, has
long understood the commercial wisdom of display. He believes that the
recession has finally brought home its importance to the stores. 'The big
retailers are becoming much more aggressive and are now looking at areas
which they once thought were absolutely unnecessary, like shop fittings,
display and style in general. When business is good, people sit back but
when it's bad, it forces them to decide on a firm policy.' Certainly, if
financial outlay is anything to go by, then the department stores are taking
a very firm line indeed.
Selfridges has earmarked an investment of pounds 50 million over the next
four years in an effort to become what the parent company, Sears, describes
as 'the best and most exciting department store in Europe'. As work has only
just begun, that remains to be seen but the expense wtll include structural
changes to improve both the look and the layout of the store, to make it
easier for customers to find their way around. Plans include the creation of
'worlds', or specialist shops within a shop. These are described as areas in
which particular merchandise, such as sports goods or children's clothing
and toys, will be grouped.
The result should be better laid-out stores with a wider choice of
well-priced merchandise. As a further inducement to their customers, the
stores are also offering several competitive services: monogramming linen
(at Harrods), for example, free delivery, offpeak concession parking and,
most importantly, fashion consultancy. This is a free service for women, no
matter what their income, who do not have the time to shop. They simply
telephone the store and ask for some outfits to be assembled by an expert,
or 'personal shopper', for them to choose from. It is an idea imported from
the US, but one that has, according to one international executive, lost
vigour in translation. She says that most of the personal shopping
facilities in the UK are 'pretty pathetic', perhaps because the British
woman is more tentative in demanding service than her confident American
counterpart.
'The most important service the department store can offer in the 1990s is
to make shopping easier,' says Meg Gilmore. Account-holding customers at
House of Fraser who spend more than a certain sum a year now get a gold
card. This entitles them to use an exclusive lounge where they are served
free tea and coffee by special 'hostesses' and can read newspapers and watch
cable television.
But what about attracting new customers? During the past seven years, House
of Fraser has invested pounds 50 million refurbishing existing stores and
pounds 30 million on new units. Another pounds 23 million is allocated for
refurbishing 16 more stores over the next few years.
The group has recently spent pounds 3.5 million on its London flagship,
Dickins &amp; Jones. Mindful of the importance personality plays in the retail
market of the 1990s, it decided to restore the Regent Street fascia and
halls to the look and atmosphere of the original 1928 building. This meant
getting rid of all the modernising changes since then Understandably, the
group is vague about the amount of money it spent on the store in the 1960s.
'The money that has been poured into that place in the past 10 years to get
nowhere is frightening,' says one industry observer. The press release,
issued when the new plans were announced, quotes from some literature of
1928: 'Only the best of merchandise demanded by Dame Fashion finds its way
into the salons of Dickins &amp; Jones.' The release says, with commendable
honesty, that 'the store had almost lost this original spirit and clarity of
vision'.
Andrew Jennings, managing director of House of Fraser, describes the two
types of customers he hopes will be attracted to the new store: 'Ms Dickins
and Mrs Jones'. Neat as the phrase is, it hardly excites the imagination.
Dame Fashion, outmoded as she may be, sounds a great deal more compelling.
And so, alas, does the original shop. The new, improved Dickins &amp; Jones
looks lovely; it is undoubtedly a more efficient place in which to shop, but
it is soulless. No amount of marble or signs or smart light fittings can
give a place atmosphere, and although, as Meg Gilmore quite sensibly points
out, you cannot sell atmosphere, it is nonetheless atmosphere that sells.
Conversely, Liberty has achieved an upsurge in popularity of late and is
regarded, by those people who are seriously interested in buying fashion, as
the most exciting department store in town. It is perhaps an unfair
comparison because neither Ms Dickins nor Mrs Jones would necessarily enjoy
the more outrageous brand of merchandise that Liberty now stocks, but the
store shows a strong and distinctive personality behind the buying policy.
It has not been glossed up for the 1990s; some of the stairway carpets are
distinctly shabby, but what it lacks in razzmatazz, it makes up for with
sheer shopping excitement.
What was once an acreage of Tana lawn blouses and shirt-waisters has been
handed over to the likes of Issey Miyake, Workers For Freedom, Betty
Jackson, Flyte Ostell and Vivienne Westwood. These are labels that are
bought by other stores, too, but the difference in Liberty is the manner in
which the collections have been edited; there is a sense that the senior
ladies' fashion buyer, Angela Quaintrell, has taken what is considered by
most to be a commercial risk, to buy those parts of designer collections
that best describe the designer's own vision. Many store buyers,
particularly if they are tied to a policy of central buying for a group,
tend to edit a collection down to the most commercial and saleable items,
thereby giving a designer floor in a store a blander, homogeneous feel.
In the end, it is not fixtures and fittings that give a shop personality
(although they undoubtedly act as beacons of introduction) but the products
on sale. The decline in Next's popularity is an obvious example. When George
Davies was removed as chief executive in the late 1980s, the emphasis on
style and quality went with him. This was a commercial decision and one,
from the figures, that appeared to make sense at the time. However, the
short-term advantage is not always of long-term benefit. Next was soon
reduced to a shadow of its formerly robust character. The fixtures and
fittings remained the same but its product became insipid.
A somewhat different cause is having a similar effect at Harvey Nichols. The
problem there is a legacy, inherited from the 1980s, of viewing designer
labels as rich currency. They are, but only if well invested. An aggressive
campaign to attract the best designers to sell in that store has meant that
much of the selling space within the store is devoted to concessions, or
shops within shops. It is a set-up that designers and manufacturers
particularly enjoy and, during the 1980s boom, when international designers
could call the shots, was one of the few ways in which to guarantee the
store an exclusive deal. Joseph Ettedgui, who has shops within shops in both
Harvey Nichols and Liberty, explains the attraction of this sort of
retailing.' Before we had our own shops within shops, the store buyer might
place an order of about pounds 20,000. Now that we have been able to create
our own Joseph environment, with our own sales people in place, we take
something like pounds 15,000 a week, or pounds 780,000 a year.'
The store also benefits, partly by association with the prestige of the
label, but also because they take a guaranteed percentage of profits and act
as a landlord taking rent. The longer-term disadvantage - and many in the
industry privately consider it to be a crippling one - is that by allowing
too many concessions, a store loses its personality. A research document
from House of Fraser, outlining the manner in which the group should move
forward into the 1990s, is acerbic on this point:'If the department store
fills itself with concessions it is no longer in the business of retailing.'
As an interested observer points out: 'When a store becomes too dominated by
concessions you are no longer buying the handwriting of the store; you are
buying the hand-writing of the label. You are losing in essence, the
strength and personality of the chief buyer; you are losing the authority of
the store.'
Consumers now take for granted what were once considered luxuries: a
pleasant environment, sophisticated display and flashy fittings. Stephen
Marks, who has recently opened expensive new flagship stores for French
Connection in Regent Street and Nicole Farhi in Bond Street, is blunt in his
assessment of what makes for successful retailing in the 1990s: 'The bottom
line is that if you have a good product and it is good value, then the
public will find you. If you then make it easy for them to buy it by
presenting it well in a nice environment, you will do good business.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: That old black magic - Nowhere is it more
true that 'you are what you wear' than at formal evening occasions. Get it
wrong and you risk being deeply embarrassed. John Morgan deciphers the
correct dress code and etiquette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MEN'S EVENING WEAR is a funny thing. If it is right, nothing is more
attractive, distinguished and handsome. But if it is wrong, it can make the
wearer look irredeemably naff, uncomfortable or vulgar, or possibly all
three at the same time. Problems arise not only from laziness and ignorance,
but from an inability to understand that evening dress has a set of
conventions.
Knowing when and how to break the rules is the secret to getting it right au
soir. The use of colour is something many men get wrong. When an invitation
says black tie, it should be taken literally. Unless you are wearing a
smoking jacket, stick to the monochromatic purity established by Beau
Brummell at the beginning of the 19th century. Coloured bow ties
(particularly tomato-red ones) are the worst offenders and should be left to
badly brought-up school boys. Gaudy waistcoats are less grim, but best
avoided.
Dinner jackets and evening tails must be blue-black, not ordinary black,
which can take on an unfortunate green tinge in artificial light and lend
its wearer a rather mouldy appearance. The cloth should be a plain worsted
barathea. Fancy cloths are, as Hugh Holland of Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury
says, 'fine for East End villains and club bouncers, but not for gentlemen'.
He is also damning about white dinner jackets. 'These seem to find favour
with motor traders and certain City types (ex-motor traders).' I think they
look fine in the tropics.
The classic cut for a dinner jacket is single-breasted with double-breasted
(peaked) lapels, but most men seem to prefer jackets with a double-breasted
cut. These should fit the body closely and not have pocket flaps or vents
(Hackett's jackets have a good shape). The correct button configuration is
button one, show two; this gives an elegant hour-glass shape and exposes a
generous tranche of lapel facing. Lapels can be faced in black ribbed silk
or satin (the former is more distinguished). Buttons should be covered in
the same cloth as the lapels.
Trousers, modelled on old military styles, should be tapered, with one row
of braid and never with turn-ups.
Cummerbunds look passe these days. They can also be awkward to wear. I shall
never forget seeing a fat, inebriated main ending up with one around his
chest, looking as though he had on a large velvet bra. More and more men are
wearing evening waistcoats again. These should be made of a light, rich silk
that matches the facing of the jacket. They can be V-shaped or
horseshoe-shaped and should have covered buttons.
Shirts and collars may cause problems for the uninformed. These should be
white and have marcella or knife-pleated fronts. I adore the cotton voile
evening shirts from Budd Shirtmakers, although, as Sara Haydon of Hogg Sons
&amp; JB Johnstone, points out, 'they are best avoided by fat men with hairy
chests, as little is less appealing than simian sproutings from soft cotton
voile'. Collars should be turned down. Wing collars, including the
horrendous variety that come attached to shirts, should never be worn with a
dinner jacket. Shawl collars are starting to look acceptable again,
particularly on double-breasted jackets.
The right accessories make or break a evening outfit. It goes without saying
that the bow tie must be a real one, in silk barathea or ribbed silk, not
satin or velvet. Studs and cufflinks should not be flashy and preferably be
period pieces (Bentley &amp; Co) and Longmire of St James's have an elegant
selection). Shoes, either pumps with grosgrain bows or whole-cut (without a
cap) lace-ups with silk ribbon, have to be patent (Edward Green and
Cleverley both sell excellent ones). Socks ought to be knee-length and made
of silk.
Evening clothes, like any others, are subject to ever-changing fashions and
social habits. Often casual clothes of 'one generation become the formal
ones of the next. My grandparents would have considered a dinner jacket only
a semi-formal evening attire and would have been confused by the recent
fashion for wearing velvet outside your own house. But, today, richly
coloured velvet smoking jackets are to be seen in country house parties
across the land, particularly in Scotland. 'North of the Border, most men
wear them. I saw a brace of Dukes looking splendid in their grandfathers'
smoking jackets at a recent dinner party,' says Rory Wolfe Murray of'
Buckleigh. The Nehru jacket is also a popular innovation and is an ideal way
of wearing a shirt with no bow tie.
Hiring evening dress is questionable, perhaps the only exception being white
tie, which is still required kit at the grandest official functions. It is
worn with matching trousers with two rows of braid, a white marcella
waistcoat, a boiled tunic shirt with a starched front, a detachable stiff
collar and a white bow tie. White silk scarves are naff and wristwatches
should never be worn with white tie.
Whether you choose to wear black or white tie, do not mix up their elements.
It is not smart to be over-dressed and it is rude to outshine your hosts. It
could be argued that when it comes to dressing successfully for the evening
it is true indeed that manners maketh man.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Princess without a realm - A princess by
birth, Olga of Greece is as comfortable leading the life of an art student
as being a member of the cosmopolitan circle of royalty. Jane Mulvagh talks
to her about how she reconciles these different worlds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Princess Olga de Grece says her name in America, people think she is a
perfume. 'Attitudes to royalty depend on where you are,' she says. 'In
America no one really gives a jot. In Europe, on the other hand, which has a
history, of royalty. People give you more of their time because they're
curious about you.'
In her own land, her rank would be unrecognised because in 1974 a referendum
was passed stripping all the royals of their titles. However, even if she
wished - and she does not wish it Olga could not escape the lustre of royal
birth. So how does a girl who is handsome, clever and rich conduct herself
in the two very different worlds of being a student and a princess?
She knows that sometimes she is invited to a party 'just because of my name.
This gives me the chance to meet interesting people whom I wouldn't
otherwise come across'. The duality of her different lives amuses her.
'Obviously I am the same person and don't change when moving from one world
to another. I look at any experience from a distance, taking a step back
from it.'
She admits to exploiting her title on occasion to help a charity. But she is
glad that 'unlike the English royals, I don't have duties and obligations
and I haven't had to live a courtly life. I get the best of both worlds. On
the one hand, I live like a student in a studio in New York, and on the
other, I go to royal parties and interesting events.'
As the daughter of Prince Michael and Princess Marina and cousin of the
exiled King Constantine, Olga has enjoyed a privileged youth, spending her
first six years in her homeland. In 1977 her father's interests - he is a
historical novelist and her mother is a sculptor - took the family to Paris,
which has become their main home. 'I feel totaly Greek but since I have not
lived here for years, except for spending summers on Patmos, I somehow feel
out of touch with contemporary Greece.'
Being the product of a morganatic marriage, Olga believes that her
upbringing has been 'a nice balance between the artistic world of my mother
and the traditional royal values of my father'. She had a cosmopolitan and
multilingual education in England, France and America and went on to study
history at Princeton, then industrial design at Parsons School of Design in
New York and now she is about to start a post-graduate course in
architecture.
Olga takes care to behave like a modern royal, modern in the sense that she
carries her background with aplomb into her contemporary life. At the same
time she does not hide her heritage, 'though an older friend of the family
did explain that in the 1970s it was much more uncool to be a princess than
it is right now, in the 1990s'.
Apart from being a princess, Olga's beauty must help to keep the invitations
flowing. Some profiles cry out to be immortalised on canvas or in marble;
hers is so precise in line, her ivory complexion so faultless, that artists
and photographers alike are struck by her presence. Like a peregrine falcon,
her black-eyed and sharp-beaked features and unflinching directness of her
gaze suggest a triumph of composure over youthful anxiety. At 22, she has
the still beauty of a Sumerian sculpture or - a princess.
How does she feel about using this exiled rank to gain advantage in the
modern world? She concedes that her name helped her get her summer job at
Ettore Sottsass's architectural practice in Milan. 'But after that you have
to work twice as hard for people to take you seriously. Both my parents had
a hard time winning respect in the professional world.'
Olga is indebted to Sottsass because 'in his huge open-plan office I saw all
the elements of design - architecture, graphics, industrial design - and I
reaised I wanted to create in 3D.' Now, in her spare time she sculpts
brightly coloured clay objects, such as teapots, candlesticks and vases,
which are reminiscent of the pneumatic figures that Nikki de Saint-Phalle
used to do in the 1970s. Family friends started ordering them and so she set
up a small production line.
Apart from art and design, 'the other thing I absolutely love with a huge
passion is space' not terrestrial acres but the stars and the moon. When she
applied to Princeton she wrote that she wanted to major in 'a course that
does not exist - Lunar Architecture. Amazingly enough they accepted me,
which gives them some credit for imagination] You look up into the stars and
realise how small you and the earth really are and how vast this subject
is.'
After graduating she applied to National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration
(NASA) to work on The Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence Project. 'It
was a new Project started two or three years ago. Sadly, they only needed
qualified scientists and there were no odd jobs going.
'My love of space is not necessarly a physical thing. I would think twice
before zipping into a space shuttle and going to the moon but, one day, I
hope to be able to contribute to space research. As a designer and architect
there's not much one can do yet but, in time, they'll need architects on the
moon.'
She may not be going to the moon but Olga does travel a great deal and every
Christmas her father takes the family on a cultural journey to India, Bali
or Russia to familiarise them all with other cultures. But Olga confesses
that she finds constant travel unnerving. 'I am not one of those people who
likes to keep travelling all their lives without settling.' Instead she
feels great sympathy with the Russian novelist Goncharov's character
Oblomov, 'because he just lies in bed all day. It's so wonderful. You can't
do that any more, that belongs to a bygone era. His whole life was passed
away in bed - it's something I'd love to do. Nor can you behave with the
decadence of Huysmans's hero in Against Nature.'
In her dress, Olga says she always strives for simplicity which she enlivens
with a sense of drama. At five foot, nine inches tall, Olga's womanly figure
would overpower frills and folderols, while her sense of visual drama
prevents her from taking refuge in the safe option of a little black dress.
'I simply don't want a little black dress. My wardrobe isn't composed of
things that are useful for all occasions. It would probably make my life
easier but I'm never tempted to buy such things.'
Instead, her high-impact taste favours clean lines, Zurbaran's (the Spanish
devotional painter) colours - vermilion, terracotta, pewter, Prussian blue,
lemon yellow - and real jewels. I asked her what she would like to have in
her wardrobe and she did not hesitate. 'A huge pearl necklace - real, of
course; a huge embroidered dress, not something you would wear ever day -
perhaps like one of those Medici women in a Bronzino portrait; and generally
things that you can't find in shops.'
When she does shop, she favours Jil Sander's Germanic minimalism and Prada's
simplicity and shoes by Chrstian Louboutin, who recently named a pair of
Louis-heeled satin mules after her. Evening gowns are made by her friend
Maria Synder in New York. By day she creates a counterpoint to her
femininity with white shirts, buff suede jeans from Joseph and black
polo-necks. By night, think Old Master paintings in rich dramatic shapes and
Florentine richness and you've got the picture.
Feminist-motivated androgyny is anathema to Olga. 'I'm definitely for
enhancing your femininity; there's no reason to hide it. You might as well
use it.'
As to political feminism, she is somewhat ambivalent. 'I am so used to
living in New York where being a feminist can often imply that you're rather
militant about it. But I'm of a new generation. I'm happy with the
advancement and, thankfully, I'm a beneficiary of all those doors that have
been opened by others - but I'm definitely not a militant.'
Olga is a pragmatist and carries herself with composure and a maturity
beyond her years. Her composure is rooted in her affection for the Orthodox
church and her belief in God, combined with worldly realism. Her charm,
which wins invitations as much as her royal blood and arresting beauty, is
her teasing mirth and her ability to enliven any group of people she is
with. Olga has an attractive serenity, a quality I noticed when I first met
her aged 18. It lends her the aura of a modern and playful caryatid.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Fashion Focus - At the Paris spring/summer
1995 collections, the FT conducted its annual survey. Brenda Polan
elaborates on the results

<TEXT>
Humanity is notoriously torn between the comfort of the familiar and the
thrill of novelty. And even for the most susceptible (and experienced)
followers of fashion it is not unusual to perceive a conflict between
creativity and wearability. The great leaps of imagination which give us new
and appropriate ways to dress have all initially found their dismissive
opponents before gaining complete acceptance and supplanting all that went
before. We often need a little period of adjustment. In fashion-speak it is
called 'getting your eye in'.
This helps to explain why many of the industry experts who participated in
the Financial Times survey of the Paris collections for spring/summer 1995
voted one designer most creative but intended to buy their wardrobe from
another.
On the strength of October's showings, Jean Paul Gaultier was acclaimed, by
a substantial margin, the most creative designer of the season. In second
place was Britain's Vivienne Westwood, followed, fairly closely, by her
compatriot, John Galliano, the Japanese designers, Issey Miyake and Rei
Kawakubo of the Comme des Garcons label and then by the two Frenchmen,
Claude Montana and Christian Lacroix. The picture is slightly confused by
the admirers of Karl Lagerfeld. His own-label range, Lagerfeld, placed
eighth and his collection for Chanel tied with Lolita Lempicka for ninth
place, but, if you add up his percentage points, the number of experts
naming him most creative is the same as those nominating Galliano.
Interestingly, it was Lagerfeld's Chanel collection which was considered far
and away the most likely to be copied by the lower echelons of the fashion
industry worldwide. It was also the collection most likely to attract the
experts' hard-earned pennies. In this category Vivienne Westwood tied for
second place with Christian Dior (unranked for creativity), Jean Paul
Gaultier came sixth while, in between, was Lolita Lempicka (ninth in the
creativity ratings), and Chantal Thomass, a hardy survivor from the early
1980s.
If respondents appeared to neglect the designers who had shown the previous
week in Milan and London (and they could hardly take the Americans, who were
to show at the beginning of November, into consideration) then that is
because Paris is still the influential heart of fashion. With admirable
Gallic ruthlessness, Paris seduces the most imaginative of the rest of the
world's designers on to its schedule, gathering them to its otherwise stony
bosom with tenderness and passion. To watch the officers of the Chambre
Syndicale, the French industry's governing body, leading a standing ovation
for Issey Miyake is to understand that in Paris the nationhood of talent
takes precedence over nationalistic concerns with export figures.
When Denise Dubois, the achingly, 'Frenchly'-elegant head of its press
office, gazes with misty-eyed pride at a bowing Vivienne Westwood clad in
one of her own rigid bustles, you understand that a different kind of
chauvinism is at work. The great fashion innovators, whatever their place of
birth, belong to Paris.
The atmosphere of excited anticipation, of euphoric pleasure or desperate
disappointment which characterises these shows is unique to Paris. And when
Paris comes up with a season like this one, so full of drama, triumph and
disaster, beauty and perversity, passion and magic, even the accomplishments
of the Milanese faded into memories hard to revive. So when one interprets
the figures from this survey and discovers only minimal mentions for
designers showing in Italy and London, one has to offer them the comfort of
an explanation.
In the first FT survey (conducted in March during the Paris collections for
autumn/winter 1994), Giorgio Armani topped the polls for commercial success
and long-term influence, but for creativity, (the focus of the current
survey), he came eleventh. Ahead of him were Westwood, Miyake, Gaultier,
Yohji Yamamoto, Kawakubo, Galliano, Martin Margiela, Romeo Gigli, And
Demeulemeester, Karl Lagerfeld and Jil Sander.
So what do the great creative designers of the mid 1990s have in common that
impels even those who would not wear their product to acknowledge their
pre-eminence? I recently asked one of the brighter supermodels, Kate Moss,
to name her favourite designers. She dutifully mentioned Calvin Klein, her
biggest employer, and added Westwood, of course, and then her face lit up
with that wicked litile grin which so devastates photographers. 'And John
Galliano because he's always got a story. John tells you a story, like
you're the romantic young widow of a very rich older man and you've just
come back from the funeral and all the other mourners have gone and suddenly
you can't stand being alone in your empty mansion and you hit the town in
your widow's weeds. And you can be someone. It's so great ..'
It may not always be that well thought out, but many of the great creative
designers have a story. They are not actually costuming a mini-drama of
their own creation but instead they evoke a mood, a moment, an identity
which finds a response in the way women, at that moment, imagine themselves.
Jean Paul Gaultier, for instance, started his carnival of a show by
presenting what appeared to be a potted history of 20th-century dress, from
Edwardian sugar-icing elegance to space-age micro-dresses. But, lo, we were
not, after all, in a museum but in a Hollywood wardrobe department. And as
the carousel music sped up, Gaultier's heroine, heavily-lidded,
glossy-mouthed and nightclub pallid, reappeared in an archivist's nightmare
of chronologically mismatched pieces, dissolving the process of logical time
and inspiring chuckles of delight from his audience.
Of course, to women who just want flattering, sensible, smart clothes, this
can all seem overly cerebral, elitist, pretentious and precious. But out of
a joyous exercise such as Gaultier's come the new shapes and
textures,combinations and contrasts which will define the moment and dictate
what we all wear.
Fashion does not always achieve such vitality. The times must demand it
before the designers can feel a need that must be answered. In the mid 1990s
we are lucky (or not, if you don't give a damn and love your shellsuit) to
have so many extraordinarily creative designers in fashion. Chanel may have
had Schiaparelli as a despised companion and rival in experiment, but Dior
had to go it alone and Yves Saint Laurent risked his sanity before a
generation of designers accepted his creative lead.
Today, there is a comradeship of creativity. Westwood, Galliano, Miyake,
Kawakubo, Lacroix, Yamamoto, Margiela, Marongiu (when he is on form), Ozbek
(ditto), Mugler and Lagerfeld all approach their craft in an analytical,
deconstructionist way, using the work of all their predecessors as a
springboard for ideas. Their points of focus differ, of course. Westwood may
explore extreme historical concepts of female beauty, styles and aspects of
dress, such as the bustle, or cleavage-contorting corsetry that caricature
women's 'Erotic Zones' (the title of her show). Yamamoto may compulsively,
deconstruct the kimono, the garment his nation wore, unchanging, for
centuries, and then reconstruct it in stunning and startling marriages with
aspects of western dress. Miyake may push the beauty and functionality of
fabric beyond all boundaries, reconciling comfort, flattery and
breathtakingly magical effects in defiance of the limits of the possible.
But whatever their focus, they all simultaneously expand our understanding
of the past as expressed through dress and enrich our present with amusing
and beautiful choices for getting dressed tomorrow.
Even Karl Lagerfeld, most copied and, it appears, most coveted, is an
irreverent deconstructionist. He is best known for deconstructing and
reconstructing (in a manner that many deem extraordinarily vulgar) the
life's work of Coco Chanel. For those of us who hero-worship Chanel, thc
vitality of the result is clouded by a frisson of lese majeste but as Karl
himself said to a packed lecture hall at the Sorbonne, 'My taste is so bad,
it is good.' Well, sometimes. What his poor taste expresses is a healthy
dissent from the stale, the safe, the overly respected. In the late 1980s,
Lagerfeld used his licence at Chanel to pander to the status-hunger of the
times while simultaneously, mocking it. He broke every rule the sober-sided
Coco ever made. This demonstrates that making an icon of the century's
greatest fashion iconoclast was a pretty silly move - even if she, in her
later years, would have approved of the accolade.
It is, however, the authority of the Chanel name, the icon-quality, which
makes Lagerfeld's line so imitated and so covetable. Within the narrow
confines of the fashion world, Lagerfeld has an impressive track record;
outside it, Coco's name still sells and sells. The glamour conjured by her
name still comforts, still reassures.
Which is what we need now. So, as the emphasis of fashion turns once more
towards formality, glamour and the joy of a little light-hearted,
self-conscious role-playing, the truly creative designers move in from the
fringe to oust the more conventional designers from centre stage. And this
season, as the FT survey shows; the man who summed up the spirit of 1995 was
Gaultier, and the woman was his posy, red-lipped, spike-heeled drama queen.

For this Survey we canvassed the opinions of an international cross-section
of fashion editors, buyers and industry specialists attending the recent
spring/summer 1995 collections in Paris. They were asked to rate the
designers for 'creativity', and the collections they fund 'most promising',
'most covetable' and 'most likely to be copied'.
For our Top Ten lists we scored the number of votes for each designer as a
percentage of the number of respondents. There was surprising consensus of
opinion within different age groups and between nationalities despite slight
variations. Respondents in their 20s put Gaultier, Westwood and Galliano at
the top of their lists for 'creativity', with Miyake in fifth place,
meriting only a third of Gaultier's score, while those in their 30s and 40s
put Miyake on top, with Galliano and Gaultier close behind. Men and women
alike thought Gaultier the 'most creative' but women placed Miyake a
decisive second while men ranked him fifth. Perhaps surprisingly, the French
rated Westwood the 'most creative' (with Gaultier a close second), while the
British reversed the order (but only by a few votes).
In the category of collections 'most likely to be copied', Chanel's strong
lead reflected an overwhelming French vote, although only the British
respondents had another candidate for the top slot (Westwood). There was
also a broad unanimity about the 'most covetable' collections with Chanel,
Westwood and Dior leading the pack.

Urkaine's parliament took steps yesterday to compel the separatist Crimean
peninsula to accept its rule. It rescinded a host of Crimean laws declared
in violation of the Ukrainian constitution and backed the action with
limited economic sanctions. This is the fourth ultimatum this year and
follows the failure of Crimea's parliament to meet a deadline to comply with
Ukrainian law. Despite calls to close the Crimean parliament and rescind the
republic's autonomous status, voiced loudly by nationalists, the
conservative Ukrainian parliament put off those decisions until later. The
vote marks the latest volley in the dispute between Kiev and Crimea which
has been raging since the Soviet Union's collapse left the predominantly
Russian Black Sea region within Ukraine, to which it had been transferred in
1954.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK and France to set up air defence unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of France and Britain are today expected to unveil a new planning
unit to co-ordinate use of their air forces in peacekeeping missions.
Greater defence co-operation will be the main theme at today's one-day
summit meeting in the city of Chartres between the two countries, which have
otherwise found it hard to find much common ground on other issues of
European integration.
Prime Minister John Major and several other UK ministers will be holding
some six hours of talks with the French side, led by the ailing socialist
President Francois Mitterrand, now in his last year of office, and by
gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur who shares many of Mr Major's views
on European Union institutions, though not on most of the policies those
institutions should carry out.
On defence, however, there is a communion of interest between France's
ambition for a strong EU defence effort and the UK's desire to play a
positive role in foreign and defence policy discussions in advance of the
EU's 1996 constitutional conference that may pit London and Paris against
each other on other issues.
Underscoring their countries' diplomatic partnership, Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, will
breakfast in Paris tomorrow with their Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, to discuss the situation in Bosnia, following the US decision to
drop out of enforcing the arms embargo.
The air planning unit will only initially involve about a total 10 officers
from both air forces. But it is part of a broader defence dialogue which has
involved contacts between French and UK rapid deployment forces, and a
continuing discussion of nuclear doctrine between Europe's only two atomic
weapon powers. The Anglo-French nuclear working group is not, however,
tackling anything as far reaching or sensitive as joint nuclear submarine
patrols or missile targeting.
On joint arms projects, France will be keen to press the UK to join it and
other Europeans in building the Future Large Aircraft, a new troop transport
designed to give European armies the capacity to project power overseas. UK
ministers are still weighing whether to join the FLA project or to go the
traditional route of buying Lockheed transport aircraft from the US again,
and they will be keener to review progress on the trilateral Horizon frigate
project with France and Italy.
Both France and the UK are ready to help African states with peacekeeping
missions, and one idea is that France focus on better equipping and training
two or three francophone African countries, and the UK do the same with some
anglophone countries.
Reuter adds from Paris: While Britain, Washington's most faithful ally in
Europe, did not join the Franco-German inspired European army corps,
officials on both sides say close political and military co-operation in
Bosnia and concern at a perceived US drift towards disengagement have
brought Britain and France, western Europe's main military powers, closer
together. 'The British were up to now extremely reticent about European
defence co-operation. Now it seems we can progress together,' a French
official said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / EU sets deadline for telecom liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU member states last night set a strict deadine of January 1, 1998 for
completing the liberalisation of alternative telecommunications
infrastructures.
At a meeting in Brussels, industry ministers from the 12 EU members and the
four due to join at the beginning of next year agreed on the deadline by
which alternative infrastructures such as cable TV, road, rail and energy
networks must be opened up to competition.
But a further five-year delay to 2003 was granted to Spain, Portugal,
Ireland and Greece.
The EU move will allow companies offering telecom services a much greater
choice of network provider, and should lower prices within Europe's still
highly regulated telecommunications sector.
The decision falls short of Commission ambitions to press ahead with
liberalisation of infrastructures next year. A number of countries -
Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Austria - were wary of moving so
quickly, arguing that the necessary frameworks were not yet in place. The
main advocates of swift liberalisation were the UK, the Netherlands, Germany
and France.
Brussels has made rapid deregulation of telecoms a priority in the belief
that competitiveness of European industry relies on efficient, cheap and
advanced communications services, which currently lag behind what is on
offer in the US and Japan.
Services other than basic voice telephony have already been liberalised. The
problem is that in most member states, service providers are obliged to use
the traditional, largely monopolistic, telephone networks.
Only in the UK are networks entirely liberalised, with service providers
free to build their own if they desire.
The opening up of infrastructures to competition in 1998 will coincide with
a shake-up of voice telephone services. Under a previous ministerial
agreement, member states are not obliged to liberalise voice telephony
before then.
Meanwhile, the competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, said he may try
to speed up liberalisation by using special powers to open cable TV networks
to competition before 1998. He has proposed that the Commission force
governments to end restrictions on cable TV networks under Article 90 of the
Rome Treaty, which allows the Commission to take action without a vote from
ministers. This move is unpopular and it is not yet clear whether the
Commission would support Mr Van Miert.

FT  18 NOV 94 / GM files lawsuit to block recall of 6m trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors yesterday filed a lawsuit against the US administration and
Mr Federico Pena, transport secretary, in an effort to block a forced recall
of an estimated 6m of its pick-up trucks.
The US's biggest vehicle maker had threatened the action last month, when Mr
Pena first said he planned to push for the recall. GM turned down a request
for a voluntary recall made by the US transport authorities 18 months ago.
The company's legal action marks an intensification of the fight over the
vehicles, which critics say are liable to burst into flames when involved in
side-on collisions.
GM said yesterday it had filed a complaint in the federal court for the
eastern district of Michigan against Mr Pena, the US transport department
and the national highway traffic safety administration, on whose research Mr
Pena based his recall decision. The suit seeks an injunction against the
recall, and a declaratory judgment overturning the decision.
Mr Thomas Gottschalk, the carmaker's general counsel, said the complaint
'directly challenges the secretary's position that he can disregard federal
motor vehicle safety standards and retroactively require the redesign of
older cars and trucks which unquestionably met the safety standards and
which perform as safely or more safely than most other vehicles on the road
today.'
Ford and Chrysler have joined GM in criticising Mr Pena's decision. The
three carmakers argue that the attempted recall throws US car safety
standards into confusion, since it applies to vehicles which passed federal
standards when they were sold.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Setback for Russian budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL

   Moscow
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian government attempts to win approval for its austere 1995 budget were
dented yesterday when Mr Mikhail Zadornov, parliamentary finance committee
chairman, said the proposals were unacceptable in their present form. 'The
forecast and estimates. . . . are not realistic,' he said during
parliamentary hearings. Voices have already been raised against the budget's
severity, and the balance of support for radical reform within the
government is itself unclear following the reshuffle of senior ministers.
Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the new economics minister, defended the budget, saying
conditions were ripe for a new stage of reform, given that the decline in
industrial production was bottoming out and the growth in savings provided
the opportunity for investment. He stressed the government's commitment to
producing economic stabilisation next year, predicting that inflation would
fall from 270-280 per cent forecast for the current year to 70 per cent in
1995. He would also press for tax cuts for industry next year, presumably on
the basis that a lowering of the rates may encourage greater compliance.

FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking triggers small setback
in equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market ran into the expected bout of profit-taking
yesterday, but was also slightly unnerved by an uncertain showing from
gilt-edged securities and a general round of weakness across international
markets.
The weakness across European markets spread to Wall Street, which opened on
a lacklustre note and continued to lose ground after London closed, when it
was showing a fall of 24 points on the Dow Industrial Average.
The FT-SE 100-share Index finished another lively session 19.0 lower at
3,127.5. The second line issues were much quieter and more resilient than
the leaders, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settling a net 6.2 down at
3,576.6.
Dealers described yesterday's action as a 'consolidation' rather than a poor
performance, pointing out that the FT-SE 100 had risen more than 70 points
since the start of the week and in the face of a steep rise in US interest
rates.
'Although there was a flurry of selling in the late afternoon, it never felt
as if the market was going to crack on the downside,' said one leading
trader.
He added that the London market would probably continue its consolidation
phase today but that short term the outlook remained positive. 'I feel we
will make good progress next week and we could well test the 3,200 level,'
he said, although he noted the strong resistance in the market as the
Footsie moved above 3,155 on Wednesday.
That view was mirrored elsewhere. A technical analyst at one of the big UK
integrated houses pointed out that volumes in futures trading on the two
sharply advancing days this week were more than twice the level of
yesterday, indicating that the momentum factor was strongly on the upside.
The FT-SE 100 opened marginally easier and made a half-hearted attempt to go
better, reflecting Wall Street's resolute performance overnight. The move
quickly ran out of steam, however, and share prices slipped away as news of
stagnant retail sales in October, confirming similar evidence from last
Monday's Confederation of British Industry survey, filtered into the market.
Analysts said sentiment had been additionally affected by the latest
political unrest in the government which resulted in the prime minister
threatening to call a general election unless the Euro rebels in the Tory
party came to heel.
Thereafter there was virtually no respite for the market, with prices
drifting back, ignoring intermittent bouts of support, and then moving
decisively lower as US markets lost ground.
The dollar was seen as the main cause of the weakness on Wall Street,
falling sharply in spite of another batch of economic data pointing to
deflationary pressures in the US. The fall in US housing starts and a
surprising decline in the Philadelphia Federal Board index bemused analysts.
Turnover yesterday was well down from the buoyant levels of Tuesday and
Wednesday, reaching 702.6m shares, with non-FT-SE stocks making up a high 65
per cent of that total. The 702m was inflated, however, by a long list of
bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deals, which accounted for turnover of
well above 60m shares, or getting on for 10 per cent of the total.
The merchant banks with big market operations were among the best performers
yesterday. SG Warburg, the UK's flagship investment bank, raced higher
again, but closed well off the day's top as dealers said the rise was more a
reflection of the break-up value of the bank and a strong push by one
leading broker, rather than any substantial takeover rumours.
Builders merchants were the market's biggest casualties as Meyer
International caused widespread gloom in refusing to increase its interim
payment and preaching caution on second-half prospects.

FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Willis rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover talk in the insurance broking sector refuses to go away and
yesterday saw Willis Corroon, one of the sector leaders, move ahead 8 to
146p in spite of a sharp slide in interim profits.
Once again, the word among the dealers was that HSBC, the Hong Kong bank
which until earlier this year had a 6 per cent stake in Hogg Group, was
interested.
Speculation has been fuelled by the recent takeover of unlisted Jenner
Fenton Slade. However, there was also a boost from a Willis statement that
it would reduce costs by Pounds 30m without hitting earnings. The group is
expected to sell property and make staff cuts. HSBC shares fell 7 to 755p.
Elsewhere in the sector, bid talk also surrounded CE Heath, 8 higher at
248p.
Electricity generator National Power was one of the day's strong market
features after the group surprised the market with news of a share buy-back
scheme.
The shares closed 7 ahead at 511p as the market celebrated the announcement
that National Power intends to buy back between 6.5 and 8 per cent of its
share capital when the government sells its remaining 40 per cent stake
early next year.
The news, which came with publication of better than expected interim
profits, had not been expected until after the government sale.
However, there were reports of concern among several institutions about the
tax implications of the move.
Sentiment was also dampened in some quarters by the 16 per cent rise in the
dividend, which paled alongside the 26 per cent increase offered by PowerGen
earlier this week. Powergen put on 3 at 564p in trade of 4.3m shares.
High street bank Barclays fell 12 to 604p after Morgan Stanley moved to
'hold' from 'buy'. The US house left its current profits forecasts unchanged
but argued that the recent outperformance prompted by heavy switching within
the sector had left the shares fairly valued.
News that pharmaceuticals group Glaxo is to strengthen the warning on the US
packaging for its new Asthma drug Serevent affected the shares, which shed
10 to 615p. However, most of the weakness reflected profit-taking on a
slight dip in the dollar, and rivals Zeneca and Wellcome retreated 14 to
851p and 12 to 660p respectively.
A large block of Fisons shares traded at well below the underlying market
price caused some nervousness, but it was seen to be nothing more than a
tax-related deal and the shares recovered to close a penny ahead at 127p.
The buy-back spotlight moved to retailer Argos. The shares advanced 3 to
357p, with volume just short of a million shares, as whispers that the
company will announce such a scheme began to circulate.
The stock was also said to have been favoured by institutions looking for a
home for cash received from the sale of Boots stock earlier this week. Marks
and Spencer, 2 ahead at 412p, was also said to be a safe haven for such
proceeds. Profit-taking in Boots saw the shares slip 2 1/2 to 514 1/2 p.
J. Sainsbury was said to have benefited from recommendations from UBS and
James Capel. The shares appreciated 4 to 424p.
BTR remained active, turning over 9.7m shares as a major securities house
attempted to offload a large line of stock. The stock ended 8 cheaper at
306p.
Hardware and car components maker FKI was number two in the day's active
stocks list. Turnover soared to 8.9m as the shares first fell then recovered
smartly on confusion with the exceptional items within the interim results.
They closed 5 higher at 167p, with the market finally settling for a
positive view, centred around FKI's claim to dollar-play status with 70 per
cent of turnover arising in the US.
Turnover in leisure group Ladbroke rose to 10m (including a single block of
8m) as the other side of a tax-related deal was executed. The shares moved
against the market trend to finish 4 up at 161p.
Better than expected interims from Whitbread prompted a number of forecast
upgrades - NatWest Securities raised its forecast by 5 per cent to Pounds
260m. However, expectations that the brewer will soon announce a corporate
deal, perhaps the acquisition of Courage from Australian group Foster's,
overshadowed the stock, which ended 3 lighter at 551p.
Smith New Court was the day's main seller of Allied Domecq. Smith downgraded
earnings expectations by 2 per cent for the current year and next year, and
moved to a 'hold' from a 'buy' stance. The shares fell 11 to 600p.
Disappointing figures from Hardy Oil &amp; Gas saw the stock drop 9 to 141p.

FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders crumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials and construction shares, one of the stock market's more
visible Cinderella sectors, ran up against further negative news following
disappointing interims from timber specialist Meyer International and
cautious annual meeting statements from housebuilders Barratt Development
and Raine.
Meyer tumbled 44 to 359p. The company's interim profits fell short of
analysts' estimates but it was the warning about a second-half squeeze on
sales that triggered the sell-off.
UBS reduced its estimate of full-year profits from Pounds 56m to Pounds 55m
and, more significantly, came down to Pounds 67.5m from an earlier Pounds
72.5m for next year. Other builders merchants suffered in the backwash.
Plumbing groups Wolseley and Travis Perkins fell 12 apiece to 778p and 288p
respectively.
In spite of a 16 per cent rise in final completions for the first four
months of this year, Barratt eased 6 to 173p as the market focused on what
the annual meeting had to say about generally weak housebuilding margins.
Raine retreated 4 to 47p and Beazer slipped 5 to 135p.

FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical margin fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals group Courtaulds fell sharply after a leading agency broker turned
cautious ahead of interim figures due next week, highlighting the surge in
raw material prices.
Spot prices for the chemical used to make acrylic fibre has risen by almost
50 per cent since the early part of the year, and wood pulp, which is the
basis for about a third of Courtaulds' sales, has doubled.
Courtaulds buys materials on a less volatile contract basis, but James Capel
said spot prices are an indicator of the general trend. Analyst Mr David
Ingles commented: 'This margin pressure is real and we have to get over that
before we can be more positive.' The shares fell 14 to 450p.

FT  18 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved lower, but there was little real sense of
direction to the session and trading volume was low, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was standing at 3,136 when pit trading came
to an end, down 16 points, eroding some of the advance of 79 points recorded
over the previous three days.
At this level the premium to the cash market was 9 points, while the fair
value premium was just above 7 points.
Trading was mostly uneventful. Two-way business was thin at best and dealing
sizes narrowed sharply. Contracts dealt tailed off steeply from the high
levels of the previous two sessions.
Volume was 10,522 contracts, but more than 3,000 of these were pushed
through in the final 30 minutes of official trading. Some 16,000 lots were
traded on Wednesday, while Tuesday's number came close to 20,000.
The fitful nature of the day was reflected in a trading arc of 40 points,
with the December contract fluctuating between a low of 3,125 and a best of
3,165.
Traded option volume also declined, moving down from Wednesday's 56,430
contracts to 30,506. FTSE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for less than
20,000 lots.
HSBC was the most active stock option with a modest 800 lots, followed by
Barclays and Vodafone.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: European trading volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European trading volumes declined in October in spite of a 1.2 per cent
improvement in the FT-Actuaries Europe index. The fall was a continuation of
the trend seen in September, writes Michael Morgan.
And, says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, international investors
were apparently becoming as blase as their domestic counterparts, as
witnessed by a 3.7 per cent drop in shares traded on Seaq International in
London, after a 1.9 per cent rise in September.
There were, however, exceptions to the theme. In the Netherlands, domestic
volumes climbed by 32.3 per cent in October, accompanied by a 2.8 per cent
rise in the index. The volumes increase, says Mr Cornish, can partly be
explained by the reorganisation of the domestic stock exchange at the end of
September and, he notes, Dutch volumes on Seaq fell by 12.5 per cent during
October.
Swiss volumes were also winners, expanding by 19.9 per cent on strong
international interest, signalled by a 28.4 per cent rise in Swiss shares
traded on Seaq.
At the other end of the scale, UK volumes contracted by 10.3 per cent to the
lowest level since June last year, in spite of a 2.6 per cent share price
index gain. 'The institutions seem to have been sitting on their substantial
store of cash, rather than putting it into the domestic market,' comments Mr
Cornish.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow mirrors gyrations in bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices mirrored the ups and downs of the bond market yesterday
morning, before falling firmly into negative territory by the close, writes
Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 17.15 off at 3,828.05. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 2.04 to 463.56, while the American
Stock Exchange composite shed 2.26 to 446.13 and the Nasdaq composite
slipped 3.80 to 765.84. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 323m
shares.
At one point the market was down 36 Dow points before coming off its lows
later in the afternoon. Early morning news from the Commerce Department that
housing starts fell by 5.2 per cent in October momentarily boosted bond
prices, towing equities along, but neither market proved able to sustain the
upticks.
Later in the morning the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a
decline in its index of business activ-ity for the month of October. This
news, however, failed to cheer the markets, which drew pessimistic
conclusions from a sub-index that showed an increase in prices paid by
manufacturers.
Investors mainly remain unsure about how to interpret the wave of economic
data that has been reported over the past two weeks. There is also
uncertainty about the implications of the Federal Reserve's decision on
Tuesday to increase the target Federal Funds rate to 5 1/2 per cent.
Although the monetary tightening was somewhat more aggressive than expected,
the Fed left the door open for another rate increase late this year or in
early 1995.
Campbell Soup moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 , surpassing its
previous high for the year of Dollars 44 1/4 , after reporting record
first-quarter earnings. Operating earnings at the soupmaker increased by 16
per cent from the same period last year.
Hewlett-Packard also rose after reporting stronger than expected
fourth-quarter results, gaining Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 100. Net revenue in
the US was up 20 per cent from a year ago for the California-based
computermaker, while net revenue from abroad rose by 26 per cent. Hewlett's
strong results initially pulled Adobe Systems up by Dollars 1 1/2 before the
stock fell to end Dollars  3/4 down at Dollars 34 1/2 . Hewlett is the
biggest customer for Adobe's Postscript software.
Hilton Hotels jumped Dollars 10 to Dollars 67 7/8 after announcing that it
had retained Smith Barney to study the possibility of selling the company,
or spinning off one or more of its businesses.
Genentech declined Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 after a report yesterday
morning that nearly a dozen executives at the biotech company had sold large
stock holdings since July.
Exxon put on Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 61 after a court agreed to a plan to
settle part of a suit filed over the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Other oil
companies also posted gains: Mobil firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 84 3/4.
Canada
Weakness in US and Canadian bonds set the tone for equity markets as Toronto
stocks posted losses in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index was in negative
territory from the opening and closed near the day's low with a fall of
27.90 at 4,143.84. Declines outpaced rises by 465 to 273 after volume of
57.7m shares.
Financial markets have been reeling since the US Federal Reserve lifted
short-term rates on Tuesday, with some believing the rise will choke
economic expansion.
Eleven sub-indices were down, led by pipeline, gold, industrial products and
oil stocks. The real estate, transportation and utilities sectors rose.
Golds fell 1.48 per cent.
Venezuela
Shares in Caracas recovered from early losses to close higher for the first
time in more than three weeks.
The recovery was led by Electricidad de Caracas, and the Merinvest composite
index added 2.18 or 1.8 per cent at 122.30, with Electricidad up 10 bolivars
at 224 bolivars.
Electricidad had fallen from a level of above 330 bolivars last month,
largely due to the announcement of a Dollars 65m one-for-six share
subscription.
Brokers remained cautious, pointing to the low trading volume.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Focus remains on outlook for
US interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve's move on Tuesday to raise short-term US interest rates
remained at the top of the agenda yesterday.
NatWest Markets commented that the move was a step in the right direction,
representing 'a serious attempt to rein in an economy that is continuing to
exhibit strength well above its longer term trend rate of 2 1/2 per cent'.
However, it continued: 'While the Fed has assuaged immediate market fears
that it is underestimating the inflation risks that the continued strength
of the economy poses, it may have to do more to gain the bond market's
respect.'
James Capel suggested that the rate rise 'is likely to be the start of a
more aggressive tightening phase by the Fed, rather than a signal that short
rates are close to their peak'. A further increase of 25 basis points could
come before Christmas, Capel added, if economic data continued to show signs
of strength.
FRANKFURT, back from a day's holiday, lost ground in the official session
and saw the decline accelerate in the session after hours.
The Dax ended with a decline of 8.06 at 2,102.69, seeing this widen to
2,091.94 in the Ibis session.
Research from Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, forecast that there would be no
year-end rally in German equities; and given that industrials had been
trading on 18 times prospective earnings, a downgrading of optimistic 1995
forecasts might be expected because of underlying domestic economic
weakness, rising commodity prices and a strong D-Mark.
Mannesmann put on DM5.00 at DM406.50 after reporting a 9 per cent rise in
nine-month sales, helped by strength in the telecoms sector.
In contrast, Volkswagen retreated DM5 to DM455 after reporting that losses
in the first nine months had fallen. Nomura noted that the strength of the
company's recovery would start to show through in 1995 and 1996, while also
benefiting next year from the launch of three new models.
PARIS took to Renault as the car maker made its debut, closing the day at
FFr184.90, against the offer price of FFr165. But aside from this the market
overall was weaker, the CAC-40 index off 22.67 or 1.2 per cent at 1,927.53.
Turnover rose to FFr4.5bn, while volume in Renault was above 9m shares.
Although Peugeot lost FFr7 at FFr812, traders did not necessarily attribute
this to switching into the newly listed car maker - Renault being seen as
adding further robustness to the sector. Michelin declined FFr1.90 to
FFr215.60 in line with the trend, and Valeo FFr1 to FFr280.
MILAN continued to be buffeted by politics as the government ran into
further problems in winning parliamentary approval for its budget plans. The
Comit index fell 2.13 to 638.28.
However, Mr Sushil Wadhwani at Goldman Sachs retained a bullish view of
Italy on a one year basis, while accepting that the market still faced bumpy
patches in the months ahead. 'Obviously there is a lot of nervousness, but
there is also a realisation that the economic mountain has to be climbed,'
he said. Mr Wadhwani noted that the market was historically cheap and viewed
further weakness during periods of volatility as buying opportunities. He
forecast a rise in the Comit index to the 750 to 770 level over the coming
year.
Ferfin gave up an early lead to finish L10 lower at L1,337 and Montedison
slipped L25 to L1,212 as the group denied speculation of a merger as part of
the restructuring programme.
ZURICH failed to find direction, with the mood dampened by weaker bonds and
the easier dollar. The SMI index settled 8.5 lower at 2,600.9.
Swiss Re, however, picked up SFr5 to SFr775 as recent profit-taking by
speculative buyers subsided. CS Holding bearers fell SFr18 to SFr532, below
support at SFr545, amid rumours that the bank wanted to increase its stake
in Swiss Re and planned a capital increase to finance the move.
Brown Boveri picked up SFr5 to SFr1,114 ahead of today's nine-month figures.
Analysts forecast a 22.5 per cent increase in nine-month group earnings and
a further surge over the next two years as European economies picked up. UBS
bearers eased SFr6 to SFr1,200 and the bearers were SFr9 lower ahead of next
Tuesday's crunch shareholders' meeting.
Holderbank dipped SFr11 to SFr1,057 on profit-taking after the recent strong
gains. Merrill Lynch, which recommended the stock, saw the price at SFr1,200
over the next 12 months. The investment bank believed that peak earnings
were not in sight for the group in 1996 for two main reasons: Holderbank was
extending its geographical network in emerging countries every year; and
Europe was awakening now and it still represented nearly 50 per cent of
sales.
DUBLIN continued to shrug off political developments and the ISEQ overall
general index marked time after Wednesday's strong gains, adding 0.34 at
1,841.05. Mr Robbie Kelleher at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin noted that in
recent years the markets had taken the view that what ever combination of
parties formed a new government the economic policies to be pursued would
remain unchanged. During the current hiatus, international investors, who
had become increasingly important to Dublin's performance, had taken the
same view.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Industrials spur S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial shares led a rally in Johannesburg as strong local institutional
demand took most blue chips higher. The industrial index advanced 61 or 1
per cent to 6,911, bringing its gain over the week to 2.6 per cent.
The overall index was 43.2 better at 5,941.6, while the gold shares index
picked up 22.4 to 2,189.3, helped by an improvement in bullion.
Dealers said that a weaker financial rand also contributed to more positive
market sentiment.
In the chemicals sector, AECI led the gains with a rise of 13 per cent or R4
to R34. Analysts remarked that the group had been lagging behind the rest of
the sector recently.
Southern Life, the country's fourth largest insurance group, put on R1.25 at
R35.25, while Barlows, the engineering conglomerate, advanced 75 cents to
R35 following results last week.
Dealers said that speculation about poorer than expected second-half diamond
sales and troubles in negotiations with the Russian government set diamond
group De Beers against the trend, receding 45 cents to R99.45.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index mildly
firmer after narrow fluctuations
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range on selling by overseas investors,
and buying by dealers who covered their positions after computer problems at
the Tokyo stock exchange, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed 29.91 up at 19,336.57 after moving between
19,372.67 and 19,284.76. Overseas investors were net sellers for the eighth
consecutive trading day. Analysts said foreign fund managers were securing
profits ahead of the close of the business year in December. Buying orders
placed in the afternoon by domestic institutions provided underlying
support.
Volume came to 210m shares, against 256m. Activity remained light due to the
lack of fresh news. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 2.11
at 1,527.61 and the Nikkei 300 firmed 0.54 to 280.75. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 7.83 to 1,252.69.
Overseas investors sold steels, while arbitrage buying and purchases by
individuals of machinery stocks supported share prices. The brief breakdown
of the stock exchange's computer in the morning session had minimal impact
other than triggering buying by dealers due to the lack of prior activity.
Mitsubishi Estate, a property developer which owns 80 per cent of the
Rockefeller Group, of the US, fell Y50 to Y1,070. Reports in the US that
Rockefeller Center, a member of the Rockefeller Group, could default on its
mortgage payment discouraged investors. Mitsubishi refused to comment on the
reports.
Seiyu, the supermarket chain, weakened Y100 to Y1,200 on reports that it
would bail out its affiliated consumer credit company. The retailer said it
had not yet decided on providing financial aid.
Higher raw metal prices supported mining and non-ferrous metal stocks.
Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y7 to Y941 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting
added Y6 at Y439.
Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, resisted selling by overseas
investors and finished Y1 firmer at Y386.
Speculative buying supported Hoya, an optical and electronic equipment
maker, which climbed Y50 to Y2,490. Kayaba Industry, an auto parts maker,
rose Y21 to Y663.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 34.75 to 21,444.03 in volume of 70.9m
shares.
Roundup
Tuesday's US interest rates rise was still having some effect on the region.
HONG KONG was led down by interest rate-sensitive property stocks. The Hang
Seng index declined 73.96 or 0.8 per cent to 9,518.28. Turnover decreased to
HKDollars 2.8bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 3.6bn.
Among property issues, Cheung Kong dropped 70 cents to HKDollars 37.20, Sun
Hung Kai Properties 50 cents to HKDollars 57.75 and New World Development 40
cents to HKDollars 25.20.
Local retail interest rates were expected to rise after today's meeting of
the Association of Banks.
SINGAPORE saw institutional interest in leading blue chips, and the Straits
Times Industrial index put on 11.47 at 2,357.97. Brokers said a 50
basis-point increase in interest rates by the United Overseas Bank was
largely discounted.
SEOUL was supported by a late spurt of institutional buying. The composite
index added a net 1.88 at 1,120.63, having rallied from a day's low of
1,115.39.
Citizens National Bank went limit up, gaining Won1,000 at Won24,000, while
Shinhan Bank set a record volume with 853,880 shares traded, and moved
forward Won500 to Won24,100.
TAIPEI was easier as turnover dwindled amid continued nervousness regarding
the outcome of next month's elections. The weighted index slipped 48.90 to
6,297.88 as turnover dropped to TDollars 19.5bn, the lowest level since
TDollars 19.0bn on October 21, 1993.
Stocks linked to the Hualon group, which had risen in recent sessions,
retreated on profit-taking: Hualon Preferred receded TDollars 2.40 or 4.9
per cent to TDollars 46.60.
MANILA made a modest gain of 2.65 in the composite index to 2,904.100,
largely on a rebound in PLDT shares of 2.7 per cent, spurred by its Dollars
1 rise in New York overnight. The mining sector shed 43.6 to 5,250.9 on
profit-taking.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its losses as profit-taking wiped out most of the
gains made earlier in the week. The composite index dipped 10.67 or 1 per
cent to 1,052.48. Volume was a thin 102m shares.
Granite Industries dominated activity, tumbling MDollars 1.30 to MDollars
6.40 in volume of 15m shares. Granite said it planned to acquire timber and
hotel assets which would result in a reverse takeover of the company by
Malaysian businessman Ting Pek Khiing.
SYDNEY ended sharply lower on continued bearishness over rising bond yields.
The All Ordinaries index fell 17.9 to 1,922.4 in turnover of ADollars 550m.
BHP finished 8 cents down at ADollars 18.96. NAB dropped 32 cents to
ADollars 10.36 in spite of a bigger than expected rise in the final
dividend.
WELLINGTON closed higher, but was off its best level for the day. The
NZSE-40 capital index gained 10.18 at 2,048.21, after touching 2,054.99.
Telecom put on 5 cents at NZDollars 5.44 ahead of going ex-dividend on
Monday.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US dollar slips as benefit of rate increase
fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange markets took a post-Fed breather yesterday as the
after-shocks from Tuesday's rise in the Federal Funds rate started to fade,
writes Philip Coggan.
The US dollar lost some more of the gains it made in the wake of the 75
basis-point rise in rates, which was higher than market expectations.
Neither US economic data, nor a report from Germany's 'wise men' saying
there would be no further rate cuts, had much impact on the market.
Sterling managed a slight rally, with the trade weighted index finishing at
79.8 from Wednesday's 79.7. Against the dollar, the pound edged up in London
to Dollars 1.5742 from Dollars 1.5713, although against the D-Mark it eased
a shade to DM2.4368 from DM2.4371.
Overall, the pound is well down from its recent trade-weighted peak of 81,
which came after a strong rally from below 79 following September's increase
in base rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent.
Yesterday's weaker than expected UK retail sales data appeared to confirm
the impression left by Wednesday's mass of economic statistics - that an
imminent interest rate rise was unlikely.
Short sterling continued its recent rally, with the March future rising 5
basis points to 93.00 and the December contract up 4 basis points to 93.73.
Nevertheless, analysts still think the markets are overest-imating the
potential for an early rate rise.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said: 'The retail
figures were another nail in the coffin of the interest rate bears. People
are not now expecting the authorities to raise interest rates ahead of
Christmas.'
The pound has also been affected by political uncertainty arising from Prime
Minister John Major's battle with Eurosceptics over the increased UK
contribution to the European Union budget.
Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank, said: 'Against a background of
higher US interest rates, sterling has come off quite substantially. If
there is to be capital flow from Europe to the US, sterling is more likely
to suffer than a hard currency like the D-Mark.'
However, Mr Burke felt that an upward revision to the GDP data, published
today, might take some of the shine off interest rate optimism and give
support to sterling.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe,
believes the pound can climb above DM2.50, once the European Union Finance
Bill is passed and the Budget is out of the way.
Yesterday's varied economic data - October housing starts, the latest weekly
jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed index - seemed to have little effect
on the dollar. Against the yen, the US currency eased to Y98.145 from
Wednesday's Y98.38 close, while it slipped to DM1.548 from DM1.551. It ended
in New York at Y98.325 and DM1.5524.
The German independent council of economic advisers, known as the five wise
men, predicted an average exchange rate of DM1.60/Dollars in 1995, implying
a dollar rebound from current levels.
Yesterday, the dollar was not helped by the weaker Treasury bond market. The
30-year bond dropped around  3/4 point in early trade and ended  3/8 down.
JP Morgan's Mr Persaud said: 'The key condition for the dollar to recover is
for US investors to feel more comfortable buying Treasury bonds.' At the
moment, he believes 'the market is genuinely uncertain whether the Fed has
done enough; but ultimately the market will conclude that the Fed has
injected credibility into monetary policy'.
However, Mr Charles Ranald, managing director of the foreign exchange
analysis group Forexia (UK), said charts indicate that the US currency is
heading down towards DM1.53 in the short term. After a period of
consolidation at that level, he thinks it will then move to DM1.50 and
below.
The Irish punt took the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime
minister, in its stride, finishing modestly higher against the D-Mark at
DM2.396, from DM2.386 on Wednesday. 'Nobody really believes that a new
government would alter the shape of economic policy,' said Mr Cunningham at
UBS.
The Bank of England gave the UK money markets Pounds 825m help in two
tranches, having forecast an Pounds 800m shortage. Overnight rates traded
within a range of 5 to 4.25 per cent.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Copper market collapse
possible next year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices will collapse at some point - possibly between June and August
next year - when investors run out of confidence, and the fall might last as
long as six months, suggests the Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy
group.
'At that time it may seem to many that the boom is over,' says Mr Peter
Hollands in his latest Copper Briefing Service newsletter.
He expects prices to peak in the second quarter of next year, as that
quarter is usually the strongest period for copper consumption. BME
estimates that in the April-June period next year the western world copper
supply deficit will rise to 75,000 tonnes from 35,000 tonnes in the first
three months. 'Accordingly, we expect the second quarter of 1995 to see high
copper prices - Dollars 1.35 a pound (Dollars 2,975 a tonne) on average.'
However, present price levels are already anticipating these promising
fundamentals, says Mr Hollands.
'Nevertheless, we expect a firm period through to around May 1995, but we
expect to see investment funds selling heavily into this price peak.'
BME says it is hard to tell at present whether the copper boom will end in
the second half of 1995. But in both 1995 and 1996, production of refined
copper will grow at twice the rate of consumption growth - 6 to 8 per cent
compared with 3 to 4 per cent. Consequently, in 1996 there will be a supply
surplus of about 105,000 tonnes.
Mr Jim Lennon, metals analyst at Macquarie Equities, points out in his
latest market commentary that the investment funds which have been so
influential in metals markets in recent months moved into these markets
partly in reaction to a collapse in the US bond market. Metals were viewed
as a natural hedge against interest rate and inflation rises.
He adds: 'When US growth starts to slow and the bond market starts to rally,
this could be a signal for the funds to switch out of metals - this seems
unlikely before the second quarter of 1995.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuadoreans spring banana
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to widespread expectations, Ecuador - the world's largest exporter
of bananas - has this year shipped more of the fruit than ever before.
By the end of the first 10 months, exports had already reached about 2.69m
tonnes, exceeding the 1991 full-year record of 2.65m tonnes. For the year as
a whole, the country is expected to break the 3m tonne mark.
Though first-half exports already indicated a recovery over last year's
slump, the new figures come as a surprise, as EU restrictions on banana
imports were expected to impact more heavily on Ecuadorean sales. Yet
Ecuadorean banana exports to the EU actually rose by 35 per cent between
January and October of 1994.
Industry experts say that the EU restrictions even benefited Ecuadorean
exporters. Following the July 1993 regulation, commercial licences have been
conceded to European importers and distributors who can now choose freely
among suppliers of the tropical fruit.
Mr Jose Riofrio, head of marketing for bananas in the ministry of
agriculture, says European importers chose Ecuadorean bananas because of
their price advantage. While its Central American competitors sold bananas
at Dollars 5.20 a box, Ecuador offered its product at Dollars 4.50.
In addition, Ecuador's Noboa Group has an enormous advantage over its
competitors, because for years it has been well established in Europe with
its own distributors in key markets of the continent.
Consolidating its position as Ecuador's leading banana exporter, Noboa now
claims 41.5 per cent of the country's total market, with sales to the end of
September reaching Dollars 217m.
Ecuadorean bananas also penetrated the Spanish market for the first time in
decades, ironically entering into competition with Spain's former colonies,
which were to benefit by EU Regulation 404.
However, aggressive marketing strategies outside of the EU were the main
reason for record sales this year. Countries such as Lithuania, Bulgaria,
the Ukraine, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria bought considerable amounts of
Ecuadorean bananas. Despite significant growth, Ecuador has not managed to
improve the efficiency of its production. A government programme offering
Dollars 140 a hectare for conversion to other crops has eliminated some
15,000 ha. But according to Mr Riofrio, at least another 15,000 ha need to
be phased out in order to boost the country's low efficiency rate.

'optimise' production
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The joint venture partners in Porgera, the large gold mine in Papua New
Guinea's Enga province, have agreed to go ahead with an expansion of
associated processing facilities, in an effort to 'optimise' gold production
and keep production costs as low as possible.
The expansion will cost about 90m kina - slightly more than ADollars 100m at
the current exchange rate - and should be completed by the first quarter of
1996.
The expansion involves increasing the project's milling capacity, providing
an increased oxygen supply for the autoclaves, adding process water storage
capacity at Waile Creek dam, and increasing power generation capabilities.
The joint venture partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields, Highlands
Gold and the PNG government - said that the work should maintain Porgera's
cash production costs at under USDollars 200 a troy ounce. This, in turn,
should allow the mine to process more lower grade ore later in its life.
'There is also the possibility of further underground resources being
identified that can be economically exploited,' the partners said this week.
'Particularly encouraging is the potential to mine higher grade narrow veins
of mineralisation, both inside and outside the pit shell, which are not
currently considered part of the reserve.'
Porgera is one of the world's largest gold mines. Its production has dipped
recently, but in the last financial year gold production still amounted to
1.17m ounces, down 70,000 ounces on the previous 12 months.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU and Greek officials to meet
over cotton frauds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission officials are to meet representatives of the Greek
agriculture ministry next week in an effort to resolve a long-running
dispute over allegations of fraud in the Greek cotton industry.
The Commission is trying to persuade Greece to repay up to Ecu120m (Pounds
94m) in respect of cash handed out under the common agriculture policy to
cotton farmers for crops that Brussels believes may have never existed.
An official from the Greek cotton board, the semi-independent organisation
that oversees payments to farmers, has commented: 'Greece accepts that fraud
occurred and will pay a fine but not as much as the Commission has asked.
There'll be a bargaining process.'
At next week's talks in Athens, the Commission officials will discuss with
the agriculture ministry the question of fines for 21 owners of cotton gins
(processing plants) who are accused of colluding with growers to inflate the
figures for cotton processed in 1991-92.
As part of efforts by Brussels to crack down on fraud in the European
Union's agriculture budget, an auditing team from the Commission is to visit
gins and cotton growing areas in Greece every three months to check on
cotton board procedures.
It has been alleged that Greek cotton farmers inflated their production
figures by up to 10 per cent in 1991-92, gaining up to Ecu50m in subsidies
to which they were not entitled.
The discussion over how much cash Greece should repay is linked to
Commission efforts to settle disputes over the EU budget for 1991.
Agricultural spending, which accounts for roughly half annual EU spending of
about Ecu70bn, encompasses easily the biggest area of reported EU frauds.
Commission officials believe that Greece was lax in enforcing controls over
cotton payments early in the 1990s but that since then the position has
improved. In particular, the Greek government introduced extra checks on
purchases of processed cotton last month, when harvesting of this year's
cotton crop started.
As a result of favourable weather in September and October, this year's
cotton harvest is forecast to reach a record 1.2m tonnes, up from just under
1m tonnes last year.
The Commission has started checks on possible misuse of EU subsidies related
to payments for taking beef into storage in 1992. In that year, the
Commission handed out Ecu2.3bn to farmers who could not sell the meat
conventionally on account of a general surplus and health scares over bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or 'mad cow disease'.
Commission officials believe that up to Ecu100m of this cash may have been
handed out wrongly, either because of lax checking procedures or fraud. They
are planning to open discussions with member governments on this issue in
the next few months.
The inquiries will focus on Ireland, which received Ecu575m in beef payments
in 1992. Other countries whose farmers received large sums when beef was
taken off the market in that year were France, which received Ecu550m;
Germany (Ecu480m); Britain (Ecu245m); and Italy (Ecu230m).
In recent years, the EU's beef mountain, which reached 395,000 tonnes, worth
Ecu1bn, in September 1992, has come down virtually to nothing as market
conditions have stabilised.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scope seen for more sugar price
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World sugar prices could break through their recent 4-year highs if supply
tightness continues, in spite of recent price corrections, according to a
review of the market by Czarnikow, the London brokers.
'The market has been expecting some sort of correction so it's not
surprising that prices have been easier over the last couple of days. But
there is a fundamentally tight situation and scope for that picture to
tighten further,' said Mr Neil Meader, analyst at Czarnikow.
Key consuming countries such as China, India and Russia are likely to have
to source much of their supply from the international market next year
following shortfalls in their own production. Czarnikow has marked the
Chinese crop down from 6.54m tonnes to 6.3m tonnes this year with a further
drop expected next year.
Czarnikow believes that China will be turning to the international market
for 1.4m tonnes of its raw supplies which will have an important influence
on market behaviour next year.
'By the third quarter next year, these consuming countries will be facing a
gap between the new crop and the old one,' said Mr Meader. 'If they all buy
on a spot basis there will be a massive block of purchasing hitting the
market at the same time.'
Czarnikow estimates that world production in 1994-1995 will reach 111.9m
tonnes, which marks an increase of roughly 2m tonnes over the previous
season, but is not enough to make up for a rise in consumption to 115.5m
tonnes next year. For this reason, the broker believes there will be a
drawdown from world stocks of 4.2m tonnes over the coming crop cycle.
The European Union sugar reform was unlikely to have any effect on the world
market, Mr Meader said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower coffee consumption
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Roaster Kraft Jacobs Suchard, part of the Philip Morris group, expects world
demand for coffee to drop to 92m bags (60kg each) in 1995 from an estimated
95m this year as higher roasted coffee prices curtail consumption in both
eastern and western Europe, reports Reuters from Paris.
'Eastern Europeans will suffer mainly in 1995 from the impact of current
roasted coffee price hikes,' Mr Roland Monica, general manager for the
group's beverage division, told a news conference here.
Lower world demand should in turn allow for some rebalancing of the market
and put pressure on prices, he said.
Mr Monica said the group hoped prices could ease by the end of 1995. But he
suggested that green coffee prices, which rose quickly after frost then
drought hit the Brazilian crop, were unlikely to return to the low levels
seen beforehand.
'Coffee prices cannot return to 50-60 cents a pound . . . Coffee producing
countries must have decent living conditions,' he said. Only 'decent' prices
would encourage planters to invest, he added.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard predicts that roasted coffee consumption in Europe
could decline 2.7 per cent in 1994 to 1.015m tonnes. It expects German
consumption to fall 4 per cent but stabilise in 1995 because German roasters
were prompt in passing on green coffee price rises to customers.
But French consumption is expected to fall 6 per cent next year after easing
by 0.5 per cent in 1994 because French roasters delayed most of their price
rises until the end of the year.
Consumption is seen dropping 3.3 per cent in Poland and 16.4 per cent in the
former Czechoslovakia this year.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Auction prices fluctuated only narrowly this week, with the Australian
tendency slightly firmer, taking the market indicator 5c higher to 795c/kg.
New Zealand and this week's Bradford sale of Scottish wool showed mixed
changes, with some British carpet categories definitely dearer but the
market in general no more than firm, The main factor affecting prices was
currency, with the US dollar rising after the interest rate rise. Close
connection with the currencies of the main wool producing countries means
that major international wool users are paying more. The added price
increases related to currency is not helping the flow of trade. Longer term
wool supply and demand calculations continue to stress the likelihood of
shortages in the earlier months of 1995, and maintain a firm view of the
price outlook.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (6): Commercial life returns - A guide to
Riga for the business visitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riga has changed greatly in the 1990s. Its beauty had been hidden and
decayed; it was comfortless for the traveller; and the points of contact
were grimly official. Independence has not yet brought it wealth, but it has
begun to open the city up as local and foreign entrepreneurs revive its
commerce and cafe life.
The city is fuller with restaurants, bistros and cafes than any other in the
former Soviet Union. The old town streets are now bright with newly-opened
shops and eating places. Its culinary traditions were damaged by the Soviet
period but have not disappeared. If there is nothing of the first rank,
there are, nevertheless, places to eat which are pleasant and generally
quiet.
Hotels are reasonable and courteous. The two big Soviet era hotels - the
Riga and the Latvia - have been substantially remodelled and offer basic
business services. For luxury, there is the Hotel de Rome, just on the old
town's borders.
The city has retained orchestras, an opera house (currently under repair) a
musical theatre and many cinemas, which mainly show US films. It has some 20
museums including a splendid motor vehicle exhibition which includes one of
Leonid Brezhnev's many cars. The Riga Circus is one of the oldest permanent
shows in the world and has very funny clowns and great trapeze and balancing
acts. The animal acts are indifferent.
All the main countries have embassies in Riga and all appear anxious to
assist the visitor who wants to do business. In addition, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and USAid all have active offices and programmes. The European
Union's Phare programme is particularly active.
The Latvian Development Agency is the government institution created to
assist the business visitor. It publishes a Latvian Business Guide, an
Export Directory and a monthly newsletter called Business with Latvia. It is
a good place to start. It will soon have new offices, but its present
numbers are (3712) 288842 phone and (3712) 282524 fax, and its enquiries
manager is Ms Maira Vesmane.
The government has created a department for working with foreign donor
organisations, headed by an energetic young minister, Ms Indra Samite. She
has developed a National Indicative Plan, which seeks to order ministries
and departments' priorities and to make them communicate their needs to the
donors. Initial assistance was often misdirected and even harmful -
especially grain credits, which were given to prevent a supposed famine
which was never remotely likely. This must now be repaid.
Latvians are used to speaking other peoples' languages: nearly all speak
fluent Russian, and many speak some German or English. French and Spanish
are less known. Interpreters are available through hotels.
The airport, until recently a wreck, has been partly modernised and is
adequate. Latvian Air operates a range of services; SAS, Lufthansa, Finnair
and CSA each have several flights weekly; Aeroflot is less evident, but
still runs flights to and from Moscow, as does the new Russian airline
Transaero (which has a Riga-London flight). Taxis usually run on a meter but
some do not, and tend to overcharge.
The main religion is Lutheran, followed by Russian Orthodox. There is a
large colony of Old Believers. The Roman Catholic community is large enough
for the Pope to have made a visit. There is an Anglican Church, and a
synagogue in the old town attests to what had been a large Jewish community,
while a vast memorial at the concentration camp outside Riga and the mass
graves in the forests show what happened to a large part of that community -
and to thousands of Latvians, Russians and others.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (7): Nationalist parties' appeal increases
 -Society / relations with the Russian-speaking minority remain a matter for
concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest issue in Latvia over the past three years of its independence
has been the intertwined themes of its ability to establish independence
from the former Soviet Union, the success of its efforts to secure the
removal of the remaining Russian divisions from its territory and the
construction of a relationship with its large Russian speaking minority,
most of whom are not yet full citizens of the state.
Many Latvians, especially ministers and leading officials, say they find
concern in the western media on this issue alarmist, a view held strongly
by, for example, Ms Indra Samite, minister for external resources. A Latvian
American who settled in Latvia three years ago, she says she has never been
able to square the headlines with the tranquillity of the real situation.
This points to a real and important misconception, if not quite the one
which Ms Samite and her colleagues have in mind. It is true that, since
January 1991 when Soviet special forces opened fire on and killed Latvian
protestors in Riga, no blood has been spilled, all demonstrations have
become smaller and neither Latvian nationalists nor Russian secessionists
make much of a splash on the political scene.
The headlines were often overdone but they point to a continuing and
potentially tormenting problem for the Latvian state - how a stable state is
to be built in a country where a large minority do not speak the majority
language, do not share the culture, were part of the colonisation of the
country and at least acquiesced in the repressions it suffered after the
war, and may constitute a potential 'fifth column' for a future Russian
expansionist leader.
Although this concern has no present means of expression, it is not to be
wished away by reference to the present calm. It will require vigilance and
active policies if the calm is to remain.
Firstly, if the issue is dormant in Latvia, it has not been in so Russia. Mr
Boris Yeltsin has several times raised in international forums the issue of
the suppression of ethnic Russians' civil rights in Estonia and Latvia,
while Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has talked of 'ethnic
cleansing' in these two Baltic states.
A survey of attitudes among Russian military officers undertaken earlier
this year by the German Friedrich Ebert foundation found that they
considered Latvia to be the country most hostile to Russia - including the
US, Germany and Turkey. Earlier this month, Mr Sergei Baburin, the strongly
nationalist Russian politician, visited Riga to speak to a Russian society.
Latvia's independence is officially recognised but, it seems, still resented
and its attitude to Russians feared and distrusted.
Within Latvia, matters look different. No Latvian city of any size has a
Latvian majority - reflecting the huge (in relative terms) shift of Russians
to the urban centres of Latvia after the war, when the state was embedded
into the Soviet system. In Riga, Russian is heard more often in the streets
than Latvian, and although it has been three years since independence, it is
the Latvians who are expected to switch to Russian when the need arises, not
the reverse.
Yet, the Latvian parliament in summer passed a citizenship law which will
allow all but those Russians suspected of crimes against the state to seek
naturalisation as full citizens over the next five or six years. It seems
that the new government - fearful of being excluded from the European Union
if it clings to previous legislation restricting the numbers of new citizens
to 2,000 a year (ensuring that Russians were naturalised slowly, if ever) -
has accepted that the 'occupiers' can be citizens.
This causes resentment: the parties of the nationalist right, which appear
to be increasing their appeal, still demand the 'three Ds - de-occupation,
de-colonisation and de-Bolshevisation', according to Mr Nils Muisnieks, head
of an ethnic study centre financed by the Soros Foundation. Mr Lauris
Gondars, a leading theatre and film director, says that in the cultural
sphere, 'the Latvians and the Russians have their separate worlds and they
do not really touch'.
However, says Mr Muisnieks, the accord between Russians and Latvians is
real. 'There really is a low level of conflict, and the interesting question
is why? I think one of the reasons is that the non-Latvians are like many
immigrants: they are politically passive, and economic rights are what
matter to them.
'Many Russians have benefitted from the growth of the financial sector and
the growth of corruption: corruption has mitigated the ethnic problem. If
you want to stay and you haven't got a passport you can buy one: if you need
a piece of paper saying you are proficient in Latvian, you can buy one.
'The rhetoric is noisy - but look at how many mixed marriages there are (one
in five, more than in any other former Soviet republic). Besides, the
Latvians are now in government, in culture, in the country: the Russians are
in finance and industry - so you don't have economic competition.'
Ministers tend to see the issues less cynically. Mr Valdis Birkavs, the
foreign minister, says that the Russians now see the country as more
pleasant to live in than Russia, while Mr Maris Gailis, the prime minister,
points to the lack of ethnic-based politics as a triumph of Latvian
tolerance and civilisation.
Yet, though their pronouncements are much more moderate than the sharpness
of some of their Estonian colleagues' relations with the Russians, there
remains among ministers and politicians a wariness at official level at
least - a wariness which the rise of Russian nationalist politicians in the
past year has done everything to sharpen.
The best guess is that the calmness in this crucial relationship will hold.
If next year sees a steady trickle of Russians being registered as citizens,
if the marked trend towards Russian-speaking children being sent to Latvian
schools in order to learn the language continues, if Russian rhetoric
remains merely words and the Latvian nationalists are likewise satisfied
with speeches, then the two communities can probably live in peace, if not
in total harmony.
Latvia's traditions - as the rich history of Riga shows - are those of a
multicultural state, where German, French and Russian were all spoken as
much as Latvian in earlier years, before it came in from the country to
become the language of the nation.
When Latvians have grasped again the reins of state power, they will need to
re-fashion that multicultural heritage in new conditions if they are to
avoid the communal backlash which other states, less fortunate and less
tolerant, have experienced at the end of empire.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (5): The sweet smell of success - Latvijas
Finieris / Business case studies - Progress by Latvian companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latvijas Finieris, a manufacturer of wood products and furniture, is quite
clearly a success. Its managing director, the taciturn and shrewd Mr Juris
Bikis chose to lease his company jointly with his fellow managers, under a
system which allows them to buy the plant in stages from the state.
Until the late eighties it had served the Russian market, with more than two
thirds of its output going to the east. Ten per cent of these sales were
then re-exported to western markets through a centralised system 'which
meant we knew nothing about them, not where they went or what was paid for
them,' says Mr Bikis. Quickly grasping that the world was changing, Mr Bikis
and his colleagues took effective control of the company and began making
changes. Russian orders fell back substantially in 1990-91, and workers had
to be laid off. They went in search of new markets - and found them in
Britain, Finland and Scandinavia, forming joint ventures in the first two of
these to aid marketing.
Exports now account for 95 per cent of output, which has risen steadily
since 1992. The number of workers has risen to 1,700 - about the same as
before the downturn in orders. The company, housed in three adjoining
plants, has its head office in crumbling post-war buildings but inside young
men and women sit at computer screens and handle the orders in several
languages.
'It has been difficult,' says Mr Bikis. 'We had to implement very rapid
changes. We worked as a team, otherwise we could not have done it. We are
now getting young people especially trained for our needs. We make an
agreement with a technical institute that when they first enter, they sign
up with us. When they come out they are already trained.
'We created a marketing department where we had none before, and we sell
through our own shops and to other companies. But we sell only our own
brand: we won't make brands for other people.
'Capital is the most difficult thing to obtain. The risk is thought too
great by most of the banks so we use our own profits as far as we can.'
Laima
All around the factory, the air is heavy with a chocolate smell. Laima is
one of the best known names in Latvia, famous for its dark bitter-sweet
chocolate, made in Riga for 120 years. The plant was sold by its
Latvian-Jewish owners before the war - and was then taken over by the state,
in whose hands it has remained until now.
It became, once again, a share-issuing company last year - with over a third
of the capital owned by the workers and the managers, another third by a
Latvian company, Avellat, 20 per cent by the state and the rest by pension
funds. Mr. Janis Zvanitajs, the general manager and the moving spirit behind
the plant, says the management changed the way the company was run three
years ago when it was clear that inflation was shooting up and previous
markets were being closed.
Not only did markets disappear, however. The centralised supply system which
had ensured all the necessary ingredients were more or less reliably
assembled and despatched also went. As a result the company had to secure
its own sources of supply - and made a disastrous contract with Uganda for
cocoa, the non-delivery of which nearly ruined it.
With its protected markets removed, the company began to experience
competition in its own domestic market as well. 'The Poles are strong in the
confectionery market, says Mr Zvanitajs, 'and there is a big Lithuanian
plant with. which we have to compete. More than 20 companies sell their
chocolate brands here - including all the main ones, such as Mars and
Rowntrees.'
Laima fought back on the same grounds as the foreign companies: it
introduced its own chocolate bar, a tangy, unusual tasting candy called Miks
which tastes quite different from the Mars-Snickers products. The company is
now capitalised at Lts1.9m and employs 650 workers - 450 at its central Riga
factory and 200 more at various shops and depots which it runs throughout
the country. 'We have received many proposals from foreign companies: I
think every one of the companies you could think of in our business has been
here for talks. But we don't want to team up with anyone yet.
'The shares are still in the hands of the workers and the state. That can
change, but not until it becomes more clear to us what we want to do, and
then we'll think again'.
Lattelekom
Among the most radical moves the Latvian state has made is to hand over its
telecoms service to a foreigner. Though Lattelekom, the monopoly supplier of
the telephone service to Latvia for at least the next 20 years, is still 51
per cent state-owned, the 49 per cent which is owned by the UK's Cable &amp;
Wireless and Telecom Finland provides much of the expertise, the capital for
new equipment - and the managing director, Mr Gavin Jeffery.
The joint venture came into being at the start of the year. Western partners
have invested Dollars 160m in equipment and cable, satellite dishes and
switchgear - to provide a basic network for subscribers. This investment is
enough for a three-year installation programme: thereafter, modernisation
will be financed by earnings.
It will be, Mr Jeffery agrees, a delicate business. Subscribers have to
apply for a new line, as if they were applying for a phone for the first
time. They will then be charged for local calls (they are currently free, as
was the case throughout the former Soviet Union) before any improvement in
service arrives.
Lattelekom, because it is at the heart of the state provision and run by a
foreigner, is an obvious target for nationalist politicians. 'There
certainly is suspicion of foreigners coming in and running the company,'
says Mr Jeffery. It's partly a linguistic thing - the people we work with
had to speak Russian for 50 years, now they have independence and they have
to learn to speak English because foreigners arrive.
'But the Latvian government has tried to make the transition as smooth as
possible. There's a clause in the contract which says there will be no
redundancies for three years - which gives us a chance to plan how to
minimise the effect on staff.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (4): Agriculture sets the pace -
Privatisation / The industrial structure poses problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation to date has been acknowledged as slow: the challenge the
government has set itself is both to speed it up and give it a strong enough
institutional and popular base to sustain the process through what will
inevitably be a tough period immediately ahead.
The industrial structure of Latvia was, if not hostile to privatisation,
certainly discouraging. Agriculture was largely collectivised, with
individual plots being very small. The country's industrial base was heavier
than that in the other two Baltic states - reflecting in part a longer
industrial tradition than either Lithuania or Estonia, especially round
Riga, the main Baltic city. And it was more dependent on the Soviet Union
for both supplies and markets, and less able easily to switch.
Latvia has also received a higher proportion of Russian immigrants than its
two neighbours since the war and many of these were concentrated in the
industrial enterprises - as workers and as managers. Parts became and remain
non-Latvian enclaves.
The first privatisation efforts were directed at agriculture. From 1992, the
land, hitherto largely collectivised, was split up into small plots, with
the intention of encouraging a healthy smallholding class. However - as the
figures for agricultural production show - the initial effect has been to
cause production to decline sharply - as some 200,000 new proprietors
struggle to produce, battling with a lack of appropriate machinery, with
plots of an uneconomic size, and with insufficient surpluses to buy grains
and fertilisers.
At the same time legislation giving former owners the right to reclaim land
held by them or their families before the Soviet occupation, while
justifiable both as a moral right and as an encouragement to active
ownership, has further complicated landholding. It has also handed over land
in many cases to absentee landlords and further fragmented the countryside.
'You have thousands of proprietors, many of whom can now only produce for
themselves,' says Juris Paiders, editor of Dienas Bizness, the main Latvian
economics paper. 'It means that you have actually taken land out of the
market, not put it in.'
In the rest of the economy, privatisation was handed over, in the first
place, to the ministries which had, in the Soviet period, commanded the same
enterprises, regulating their behaviour, appointing their management and
passing on the plans and demands from Moscow. Municipalities were given the
responsibility for shops and small businesses.
The latter privatisation, normally the easiest to achieve in post Communist
economies, has gone ahead rapidly, especially in Riga's City centre - where
the streets have been transformed by newly restored shops selling imported
and native products and by a rich array of cafes and restaurants. There is a
high proportion of joint ventures, with partners coming especially from
Scandinavia and Germany.
The decision to hand over to the ministries control of the big
privatisations has proved, however, a decentralisation too far and too soon.
Privatisations were achieved, but went largely to existing management which
brought in financial partners without effective oversight. The law provided
that managers could lease their plant and buy it over a set period of years.
Many are now doing this, though the collapse of production in the last two
years has meant that they are doing so with great difficulty - especially
where, as in many cases, exports went to the Soviet Union.
The traditional jewels of Latvian industry - such as the VEF electrical
plant and the RAF small bus plant - were transformed from leaders to
laggards overnight, and are now struggling to make themselves attractive to
investors.
The previous government led by Mr Valdis Birkavs (now the Foreign Minister)
decided last year to restructure a process clearly seen to be failing - and
set itself the target of privatising 75 per cent of all state property by
1996.' I want to speed up the privatisation process,' says Mr Maris Gailis,
the present premier. 'There are worries that it will lead to high
unemployment because it will demand more efficiency and there will be fewer
bureaucrats, but we can do more in retraining. The problem was that many of
these people worked under 100 per cent control of the state and the
Communist Party. Now they have to realise that success comes only through
their efforts.'
Instead of a decentralised approach based on the ministries, the government
decided to set up two institutions - a Privatisation Agency to put into
effect the privatisations themselves, and a state property fund to manage
the existing state portfolio. These are new bodies, and as yet untried.
Mr Janis Naglis, the general director of the privatisation agency, appears
anxious to hurry - 'we must do this fast. If we were to prepare everything
scrupulously it would take us 100 years - we simply have to get it going.'
Still, he has to work with several problems at once: firstly, there is no
free sale and transfer of land; secondly, there is as yet no securities law
and there is no functioning stock exchange - though an exchange is being
prepared; and thirdly, the citizens all have vouchers issued some two years
ago but as yet have nothing to spend them on.
Breaking through this circle of problems will inevitably bring some rough
decisions. The way of doing so, developed by the government, Mr Naglis and
the relatively large numbers of foreign advisers including those paid for by
the European Union's Phare programme, the international financial
institutions and USAID, is to put on the market, starting from this week,
some 44 companies which have been more or less prepared for the market, and
to invite international tenders for them.
As well as being offered to foreign investors, these companies will also be
open to voucher privatisation on the part of Latvian citizens - though it
appears to be unclear what proportion of the companies will be offered to
foreigners and what proportion to domestic investors. The new executives in
charge of the project are young and energetic, but conscious of an uphill
struggle before them. 'When I talk about privatisation to foreign
companies,' says Mr Uldis Vitolinsh, head of the Latvian Development Agency,
'they have an image of two things - mafia and national conflicts. Wherever I
go the first question is always: 'What problems do you have with the
mafia?''
Though the vagueness of Latvia's privatisation programme is a problem, it is
also an advantage - according to Mr Andrew Baldwin, a consultant working
with the EU's Phare programme. 'It is fortunate it has not chosen any
particular prescription of privatisation. It can move forward in a more
flexible and better-managed way than before.'
Foreigners can take 100 per cent of an enterprise by law - though many will
wish to retain a substantial Latvian shareholding, as those involved in the
5000 joint ventures do. (One third of these have Russians as the main
foreign partner).
The agencies, and their foreign advisers, are now working with a number of
Latvia's more attractive companies to make them ready for the market. These
include the large Latviya Hotel; the Solo-Riga piano plant; the Latvia
Shipping Company; and the creation of a joint venture between a Latvian
airline and SAS, the Scandinavian carrier. Other companies, especially in
the agrarian and wood business (where exports have been growing strongly)
are also likely to be attractive.
The hard pounding which the state's economy has suffered since independence
has depressed living standards and hit exports, as in other former Soviet
republics. However, the pounding has had perverse benefits: it has been a
testing school for revealing which enterprises have a core of real potential
and a management team able to survive in chaotic conditions. And it has also
shown that the economy, unlike Estonia's, will probably remain partly
oriented towards Russia.
Thus, Latvia has much to gain from success in Russia. Where now its banks
are a conduit for Russian flight capital, they can also be a means through
which successful Russian companies can establish foreign affiliates, and
reach out to Europe - especially if and when Latvia becomes a full member of
the EU.
Latvia's selling point of being an intermediary between west and east has so
far been two-edged. With greater transparency and a determined attack on
crime it could work to its advantage, with the Russian and the Latvian
privatisation programmes dovetailing.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (2): After a severe crisis, hopes are high
for a better future - Economy / The first three years of independence have
seen hard times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The severity of the crisis which has existed in Latvia's economy is evident
from the fact that manufacturing output has more than halved.
In every sphere where the country did well in Soviet terms - production of
electrical goods, buses, railway wagons, wood products, leather goods - it
has suffered contractions of up to two thirds compared with former
production levels.
The economy is in the end about the well-being of the people within it and
by the crudest measure of that, the death rate, Latvia also does poorly.
Life expectancy has sunk (as it has, but usually by more, elsewhere in the
former Soviet Union), over the past two years - largely because men are
dying almost three years earlier than they used to at a little over 60.
The first three years of independence have been hard on the people: it gives
the dwindling band of pro-Soviet enthusiasts who still turned out earlier
this month (in their hundreds now rather than their thousands) to mark the
anniversary of the October revolution at the spot where the statue of Lenin
used to stand, something with which to tarnish the achievement of the
creation of the new state.
Reforms, too, are benefiting the growing middle class, but not, so far, the
general population.
The restitution of pre-war property has created overnight a rentier class
which can live comfortably on the proceeds of their properties, especially
if they can be let to businesses.
The privatisation of services, including medical services, has meant that
doctors and dentists, traditionally very badly paid, can now command high
fees quite openly, where previously they resorted to asking for 'presents'.
This has allowed the standards of service to go up - but, as Maija Dukate,
head of Riga's largest (private) dental clinic admits, 'it doesn't look so
good if you're on a pension of 30-odd lats a month'.
The hardship and the figures are not a matter of dispute: interest must now
focus on whether or not the headline last week in one of the business papers
 -'The Worst is behind us: now it gets better' - is likely to be true, or is
merely a reflection of a hopeful government looking for re-election.
Mr Maris Gailis, the prime minister, said confidently: 'We will see growth
next year of between 3 and 5 per cent in the economy and we also think we
will keep inflation down to around one per cent a month.' (It is presently a
little above that).
In part, the prime minister's confidence derives from an increasingly
popular view that the decline in the Latvian economy has reached the bottom.
In part, it also reflects a belief that the strict financial regime imposed
by the Central Bank with the acquiescence - sometimes grumbling - of the
political leadership has laid the basis for real non-inflationary growth.
The country's finances have been the most unambiguous success the Latvian
leadership has enjoyed.
The Bank is independent, with its chairman - Mr Einars Repse - and its
council appointed by parliament but thereafter not dismissable for a six
year term. In 1992, it lifted most restrictions on foreign exchange,
liberalised interest rates and introduced the 'Latvian rouble' at a floating
exchange rate.
In October 1993, the Bank brought in the lat, a purely Latvian currency.
This was not tied to any national currency but in 1994 was brought into line
with the IMF's SDR (special drawing right) unit. The currency reforms
brought down an inflation rate of close to 1000 per cent a year in 1992 to
about 35 per cent last year, and it is forecast to fall to about 24 per cent
in the current year, and to half that figure in the next.
The lat, the face value of which is the highest of any of the post-Soviet
currencies, appears to have successfully inserted itself into the national
economy - playing the role taken rather earlier by the kroon in Estonia, as
at the same time a symbol of sound money and independence.
Mr Ilmars Rimshevics, the young deputy governor of the Central Bank, says
that there is pressure from the government and from manufacturers.
'Many of them think we are too independent, but so far the success we have
achieved in inflationary terms has shown that we are on the right course,'
says Mr Rimshevics.
Success has been achieved not only in introducing the currency: the bank has
also re-organised itself by shedding most of its branch network, creating
from some of the former branches a new commercial bank, Unibank, and selling
others to independent banks.
It has also sought to extend a network of regulations, one result of which
has been that 10 banks have lost their licences.
Of the hot money said to be coursing through Latvia's financial system, Mr.
Rimshevics says carefully that 'a lot of the capital coming into Latvia is
from the east (Russia), and there is not much information about it. If we
did get some information that it was illegal we would of course co-operate
with the authorities in investigating it'.
Mr Rimshevics also says that the Bank will probably soon wind down the
programme with the IMF which has served it so well - though he says that 'a
memorandum with the IMF would probably still be useful to us at this stage'.
He is confident, too - unlike his counterparts in Russia - that foreign
banks can only assist the banking community in Latvia through competition.
The Central Bank has no intention of keeping foreign banks out of the
country - though so far only one bank has been issued a full licence and one
other bank given permission to open a representative office.
Mr Andris Piebalgs, the finance minister who professes himself as strict a
monetarist as any central banker, says that he is going to insist on another
very tight budget in the coming year - with a total income of Lts940m, of
which only Lts40m-50m will be financed by a deficit.
At the same time he is presenting a new tax code to the parliament, which
would bring the high rates of profit tax down from between 35-65 per cent to
a flat rate of 25 per cent - the rate also set for income tax.
He is a little more cautious than the Prime Minister, forecasting 3 per cent
growth for next year - but says that an annual inflation rate of 11 per cent
for 1995 'looks more or less real'.
He sees clearly enough that his country's producers and exporters are still
suffering, that life as a pensioner on Lts31 a month is very hard, that
teachers and civil servants are getting by on little more - all in the midst
of a city in which wealth for the fortunate is clearly exploding. 'But to
loosen up now is to lose everything, and we won't do it,' he says.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (3): Squeezed between two blocs - Foreign
policy / An innermost wish to be part of the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Baltic countries will never again be forced against the innermost wishes of
their people into any relationship with the Russian state; but they would
themselves be foolish to reject close and co-operative arrangements with a
tolerant and non-imperialistic Russia which genuinely wished to overcome the
unhappy memories of the past and to place her relations to the Baltic
peoples on a basis of real respect and disinterestedness.'
George Kennan, the US diplomat whose analysis of the post-war Soviet Union
showed much (but not enough) of his country's foreign policies, produced few
better insights than that. More than 40 years after it was written in 1951,
it provides a consensual framework for the conduct of a Latvian foreign
policy seeking to consolidate a national security which it still sees as
fragile.
If there is an 'innermost wish' at the core of the policy, it is manifest in
a national consensus, which sees Latvia's future as within Europe and,
specifically, within the European Union. To achieve that, it - with its
neighbours, Estonia and Lithuania - struggled determinedly to escape from
the failing Soviet Union. Unlike the other Soviet states which largely
received their independence as a result of the Soviet collapse, the Baltic
states took their statehood first - and in doing so, greatly hastened that
collapse.
The anti-Sovietism, and anti-Russian feeling which that long-suppressed urge
produced is now being consciously modified into the offer of a civilised
neighbourliness - an offer which has yet to be fully taken up by a Russia
still raw over the loss of empire, even though President Boris Yeltsin, more
than any other leading Russian politician, gave the Baltic states the space
within which to regain control of their nationhoods.
'We are between two big blocs still,' says Mr Valdis Birkavs, the Latvian
foreign minister.
'Our only guarantee of security is strengthening ourselves, not from the
military point of view but in sticking to the right policies and making
ourselves attractive to investment. The Singapore, or Hong Kong, of the
Baltic, if you like. That is the only guarantee now - not one provided by
the west.'
Mr Birkavs has been the dominant figure in Latvian foreign policy for the
past 18 months - as prime minister until the coalition that he led fell
apart in the summer and then as foreign minister in the re-formed coalition
from September. As prime minister, he suffered the loss of Mr George
Andrejevs, then foreign minister, whose links with the KGB were revealed:
the resignation strengthened Mr Birkavs's grip on foreign policy. Still the
chairman of his party - Latvian Way, the main coalition partner as in the
last government - he remains the leading strategist in the development of
his country's delicate geo-political niche.
The disengagement from Russia has been - apart from an eruption of violence
by Soviet special forces in Riga in January 1991 - peaceful, if fraught.
This year, an agreement on the withdrawal of the remnants of the once
numerous army contingent was initialled in March, signed in April and
finalised in August - leaving the Skrunda radar base as the one remaining
Russian military base.
Economic disengagement has been less complete, but is impressive. From an
almost total dependence on the markets of and supplies from the Soviet Union
 -largely Russia - Latvian foreign trade is now 50 per cent oriented to the
west. 'We could,' says Mr Birkavs, 'make our entire orientation to the west
and, as it were, shut up our borders with Russia. But it would be bad for us
and bad for them. We face west but we also want the best relations possible
with our neighbours. A successful and democratic Russia is our best hope.'
Though Russia is at the centre of Latvia's 'ostpolitik' it does not define
it. Successive Latvian governments have striven to develop independence and
strengthen relationships with Ukraine and Belarus - there are substantial
Ukrainian and Belarussian communities within the 40 per cent of the
community which is Russian rather than Latvian speaking - and with the
Central Asian states of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
The engagement with Europe has been over the past year a similarly rapid
process. In February, the government signed Nato's Partnership for Peace
programme, designed in part to provide a halfway house for states such as
Latvia, anxious to strengthen military alliances with the west while
allowing the Nato member countries to reassure Russia (also a member) that
it was not being surrounded by a military bloc.
In late spring and summer, in a flurry of activity, Latvia initialled an
agreement for associate partnership with the European Union; negotiated and
signed a free trade agreement with the EU and passed an amended citizenship
law - which by scrapping the system of small quotas of resident non-ethnic
Latvians allowed to take citizenship each year - cleared the way for full
membership of the Council of Europe.
Like the other two Baltic states, Latvia benefits from the patronage of the
other Baltic countries which have been since the war securely in the western
ambit - especially Germany and Sweden: Mr Carl Bildt, the latter's former
prime minister, has been a strong champion of the three states'
independence. Writing in the current issue of the journal International
Affairs, Mr Bildt says that 'the security of the Baltic nations needs to be
assured by integration with the institutions of the west. The
neo-imperialist forces in Russian political life must be contained by the
process of democratic reform and partnership in international co-operation.
If we succeed, it augurs well not only for the stability of this part of
Europe but for Russian policy towards the rest of the world as well.'
For Mr Birkavs, the achievements of this year must be followed, he says, by
a period in which 'Latvia prepares herself for full membership of the EU. We
must no longer demand that Europe does things for us: we must make the
reforms that will allow us to be a full partner.'
Much has been achieved quickly - for three main reasons. First, Russia has
been acquiescent because it had a democratic-minded president and because it
has been too weak to be anything but acquiescent; second, the main world
states which had never recognised the Baltic states' incorporation into the
Soviet Union moved quickly once they felt they could to bolster
independence; and third, because political forces with at least the tacit
support of most the bulk of the Latvian population have remained in power
and have been able to speed along a range of important agreements. But there
is internal opposition: it has come in the first place from the powerful
agricultural lobby, whose political voice, the Farmers' Union party, pulled
out of the Birkavs-led coalition because it could not get stiff tariffs to
protect farm produce - and that because the government was determined to
bring customs policy in line with the Gatt and EU requirements. It remains a
serious lobby - one which is increasingly vocal.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (1): Now the real work must begin -
Following its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, the
fledgling Baltic state of Latvia stands a good chance of flourishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<TEXT>
Latvia is the middle of three strongly contrasting Baltic states. Like the
other two - Estonia and Lithuania - it was trapped after the war, until
1991, in the Soviet Union: it can now reasonably believe that this will have
been its last imperial cage.
Occupying a middle position in geography, between Lithuania to the south
west and Estonia to the north east, it also lies between the other two in
population (2.6m people to Estonia's 1.6m and Lithuania's 3.7m) - and, so
far, has been in the middle, too, in its efforts to reform its economy:
leading the more conservative Lithuania, but not yet showing the growth and
investment achievements of Lithuania.
Yet, so much has been done. The visitor to Riga, the 'Paris of the Baltic,'
now emerging from its Soviet dinginess again to deserve that name, sees a
city of newly-opened shops, cafes and galleries, matching Budapest or
Prague. The signs of suddenly acquired wealth are evident, as are those of
construction and reconstruction.
After the nervousness of the first years of independence - its statehood was
declared in August 1991 - a social consensus appears to be holding and
strengthening. Governments have come and gone, but each re-iterates its
adhesion to democratic norms, to market principles and to European
integration, without serious challenge to any of these.
The threat that the large Russian-speaking population - some 40 per cent of
the whole - would remain disaffected, mutinous and unable to integrate has
substantially lessened as the attraction of Latvia over Russia has grown
more evident, as a citizenship law is passed permitting gradual integration,
and as the hostility of the just-before and just-after independence years
gives way to an acceptance of each other under a re-arrangement of political
power. Growing wealth will aid that.
The Soviet past recedes. Few, even in the late 1980s at the beginning of the
struggle for independence - at first thinly disguised as support for a
radical version of the then Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev's
perestroika policy - believed that Latvia could again secure the independent
status it retained shakily between the two world wars.
Now the memory of the achievement of independence fades enough to permit
grumbling that the new life is harder than the old - a grumbling which will
not, however translate itself into serious opposition to the government's
course.
There are parties of the left, and the equal rights movement lays an accent
on the present effective exclusion of most of the Russian speakers from full
voting and many civil rights, because they have not attained citizenship.
But in broad terms, ethnicity has receded from political life, not
strengthened within it. Few now believe that, having achieved independence,
it is in constant question.
The issue is rather the need to ingrain that independence into every facet
of government policy and national life. The geopolitical environment in
which Latvia finds itself is one where that goal is seen as being most
likely to be achieved through three parallel movements: towards acceptance
by the European Union; towards a competent, democratic and secure statehood;
and towards a well-functioning market system. In what remains of the century
 -given peace and stability - its governing class believes it can gain much
of that.
The difficulties have ceased to be of the kind which might threaten the
fledgling state, though they remain as testing for the new political elite
as they are trying for the patience of the population.
Latvia is better placed than almost any other former Soviet state to use its
independence to create the foundation for democratic and market development
but its first governments hesitated, then introduced inadequate and hastily
drafted economic legislation, feared internal and external backlash and
opened up the country (probably inevitably) to a wave of crime and
corruption which, though not of the intensity and threat of that in Russia,
is nevertheless alarming in its scope.
A new beginning is now being attempted - but parliamentary elections are
being held within the year and even Mr Maris Gailis, the Prime Minister
talks of a period of consolidation, not of radical reform.
The political parties reflect the interests and views of a largely urban
intellectual and technical stratum who see the pro-market reforms and
conformity with European norms as their best hope. However, the political
parties have few members and none can govern on its own.
Latvian Way remains the largest grouping - but its need to change coalition
partners when the Farmers' Union deserted the coalition in mid-summer left
the country without effective government for two months and now means that
all policies have an electoral edge to them.
The Latvian Way coalition is centrist and moderately nationalist but the
more overtly nationalist parties to its right have recently taken control of
Riga city - where more than one third of the country's population lives -
probably reflecting more a dissatisfaction with lowered living standards
than a desire for a harder nationalist stance. It represents a warning to
the government, nonetheless.
Latvia's agriculture, an important part of its production, employment and
exports, has suffered in the short term from privatisation. The state and
the collective farms were often inefficient - but they were embedded in a
functioning system of supply and distribution which has not yet been
remodelled.
That experience has damaged the concept of privatisation as a whole, though
a more potent cause has been the decision to allow ministries to privatise
the companies for which they were responsible at their own speed - a
strategy which meant that many did nothing, others allowed corrupt practices
to flourish and others still were privatised by financial and other
interests widely believed to be penetrated by, or to be front organisations
for, organised crime.
Nevertheless, many companies with apparently good prospects - the Laima
chocolate company and the wood products and furnishing company, Latvijas
Finieris are oft-cited but still impressive examples - did privatise
themselves with existing management taking over the reins of power and
grappling with the rocky conditions of post-independence Latvia as best they
could.
The outstanding success of the past two years has been the introduction of a
currency - the Lat - as stable as any in Europe. Latvia stayed with the
rouble immediately after independence, then moved to a Latvian rouble in
1992 and introduced the Lat last year, pegged to the International Monetary
Fund's special drawing rights.
Under Mr Repse, a non-economist appointed by the parliament for a
six-yearterm as governor, the Central Bank was turned into an institution as
independent as that under Mr Siim Kallas in Estonia - though without the
taint of scandal which deprived Mr Kallas of the premiership of his country
in succession to Mr Mart Laar.
However, the strong Lat has resulted in exports becoming high-priced and
this has forced manufacturers to pay more attention to securing improvements
in productivity and quality, but at a cost.
The rash of small banks which appeared in 1990-1992 has given the country
the edge in the Baltics in banking and financial services - the Baltic
Switzerland is one metaphor often employed, if sardonically.
Many of these banks, however, have acquired the reputation of being a
conduit for flight capital from Russia, and the trade they finance is often
illegal, at least at the Russian border.
Business in the former USSR is a rough game, and Latvia is far from the
worst. Its banks provide income and employment but they also deter, because
of their reputation, the serious foreign investor fearful of becoming mixed
up in illegalities of which he knows nothing.
These are central issues for the state which it can neither ignore nor
finesse. As it celebrates the national independence it announced on this day
74 years ago, Latvia can be more certain than for decades - perhaps at any
time in its past - that its independence is well founded. The country will
grow, and it has a high chance of flourishing. But for that, as its leaders
increasingly recognise, the real work must start now.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries unable to shake off bearish
mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasuries fell across the maturity spectrum yesterday as the market
proved unable to shake its bearish mood, in spite of some positive economic
data.
By late in the session, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  13/32 at 92 7/8
, yielding 8.132. At the short end of the market, the two-year note fell
3/32 to 99 7/16 , to yield 7.169 per cent.
Labor Department figures showing a 5.2 per cent decrease in housing starts -
well below economists' expectations - briefly lifted the long-bond by nearly
 1/3 point early in the day.
While weather was a factor in some markets, analysts interpreted the data as
a sign that higher interest rates were beginning to affect house building.
Nevertheless, the market proved unable to rally as traders tried to use the
rise in prices as an opportunity to sell.
Mr Doug Burtnick, a senior fixed-income analyst with Thomson Financial
Services, attributed the market's failure to take heart from a report from
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, indicating slowing business
activity for November, to bearishness and confusion in the market.
There is uncertainty in the wake of the Fed's increase in interest rates
Tuesday. The increase was greater than expected, but the Fed still left the
door open for a future increase later this year or early in 1995.
'It's a bear market scenario. The uptrades are laborious and the downtrades
are like throwing rocks out a window,' Mr Burtnick said. 'People really
don't know what's going on, they see the market tumble and it's
disconcerting without any news to trigger it.'
He added that investors are also worried about over-supply in advance of
next week's auction of two-year and five-year notes that will take place in
a week shortened by the Thanksgiving holiday.
European government bond prices fell further yesterday, although UK gilt
prices continued their recent out-performance compared with other markets,
slipping only slightly.
Mr Mark Cliffe, international economist at Midland Global Markets said:
'There is disappointment in the markets about the rather poor response in
the US towards the Fed's tightening.'
Gilts started the day well, lifted by retail sales figures which suggested
there was little chance of an increase in UK base rates this year - sales in
October rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent, below market
expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise.
However, gilts were pulled back by falls in US Treasuries and bunds and by
late in the day the December long gilt future had moved down  11/32 to trade
around 101 25/32 . The yield spread over bunds tightened by 4 basis points
to around 128.
Mr Jeremy Stretch at NatWest Markets said today's revised figure for the
third quarter GDP might have an impact on gilt prices.
'An upward revision should not undermine the market unduly. If it is on the
back of increased investment and manufacturing production, it will not be
too worrying,' he said, adding that he believed there was unlikely to be a
change in UK base rates until the first quarter of next year.
Mr Stretch said political uncertainty arising from prime minister Mr John
Major's difficulties over the UK contribution to the EU budget were not yet
an influence on gilts, but added: 'There is no doubt that will come into
play in the weeks to come.'
German government bonds slipped and the December bund futures contract
traded around 89.83 late in the day, a fall of 0.32.
Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody said the expected release of money
supply figures next week was likely to be the next influence on the market.
The yield on Italian government bonds rose by 9 basis points to 12.14 per
cent on increased political worries.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Banks selling derivatives
'not aggressive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks are not overly aggressive in selling derivative products, according to
a new survey by a US risk management consulting firm.
Eighty senior corporate finance executives from multinational corporations,
mainly from US and Europe, respond-ed to the survey conducted by Irvington,
New York-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting. Only 12 per cent of those
respondents believe banks are too aggressive in their marketing.
All respondents use derivatives to manage their currency exposure, either
through hedging or other techniques, 95 per cent of respondents 'managed'
their interest rate exposure in the same way, while approximately 30 per
cent 'managed' their energy and commodity exposures.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Dollar issues feed continuing demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another wave of US dollar bonds swept the eurobond market yesterday, feeding
continuing investor demand for dollar paper. While retail investors are said
to be keen buyers of two to five-year bonds, institutional investors were
reported to be moving down the yield curve into the 10-year sector.
'Following the latest US rate hike, a lot of people expect the long end to
perform better as the curve flattens,' said one dealer.
However, some warned that the weight of new supply might lead to saturation
of the market. 'There has been enough volume to satisfy what demand there
is, but if there is much more I fear the market's underwriting capacity
could come under strain,' said another trader.
Japan's Electric Power Development Company made its eurodollar debut with
Dollars 300m of 8 1/8 per cent five-year bonds, priced to yield 23 basis
points over the five-year Treasury note, via IBJ and JP Morgan. While some
said the pricing was rather generous for a government-guaranteed issuer,
most dealers welcomed the terms of the deal.
'It was well priced and well handled - they did the right thing given that
they're not that well-known,' said one dealer.
Since the EPDC plans to return regularly to the dollar sector, 'it was
strategically important for the issuer to do a deal which was
well-received,' said one of the lead managers. After the bonds were freed to
trade, the yield spread tightened slightly to around 21 basis points over
Treasuries.
Capitalising on demand for medium-dated paper, L-Bank issued Dollars 400m of
8 per cent five-year bonds priced to yield 20 basis points over Treasuries
via J. P. Morgan. Although the deal saw interest from UK, Swiss and Benelux
institutional investors, it was somewhat eclipsed by the EPDC issue and is
expected to be placed more slowly.
In the 10-year sector, KfW, the German reconstruction agency, issued Dollars
500m of 8 1/4 per cent 10-year bonds via joint leads Dresdner Bank and
Goldman Sachs.
Yielding 27 basis points over Treasuries at the re-offer price, the bonds
were deemed fairly priced; indeed, some felt the spread could have been a
few basis points tighter.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Israeli investment company
plans global offering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Africa Israel Investments, a leading Israeli investment company with
interests in insurance, property and hotels, is planning a Dollars 150m -
Dollars 200m global offering in New York, London and Frankfurt early next
year.
The international offering will follow an Israel secondary offering through
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange worth up to Shk233m (Dollars 77m) which closed
yesterday afternoon. Africa Israel will be the first Israeli company outside
the high technology and medical sectors to issue shares abroad and together
the offerings will raise the largest amount of money in Israel's history.
The move marks the growing interest of Israeli companies in raising money on
European capital markets and the growing interest of European investors in
the Israeli corporate scene. Traditionally, Israeli companies have turned to
New York to raise money.
Mr Shlomo Grofman, managing director, is optimistic about the local
offering, in spite of the weakness of the Tel Aviv exchange, and believes
Europe is now a place for Israeli companies to raise money.
'Definitely there is a new environment in Europe since Israel signed peace
treaties with Jordan and the Palestinians,' he said. 'European investors are
looking at the new Middle East, and particularly companies like ours which
reflect the business of the new region.'
Morgan Stanley has been appointed global co-ordinator for the international
offering and Barclays de Zoete Wedd will be joint lead manager with Morgan
Stanley for the European tranche. Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers will also
participate in the offering.
'This is the first major Israeli offering with a designated European tranche
and reflects growing interest in Israel by international investors,' said Mr
Niel Sebag-Montefiore, BZW corporate finance director.
The offerings are intended to dilute the holdings of Bank Leumi, the largest
shareholder, from the current 50.2 per cent. Under recent banking
legislation Bank Leumi must reduce its stake in the company to 25 per cent
by December 1996.
Mr Grofman said the two offerings will dilute Bank Leumi's share to about 35
to 38 per cent and will be followed by a further global offering later next
year.
Africa-Israel owns the Migdal insurance group, Israel's largest insurance
company, which controlled 24 per cent of the total insurance market last
year. The company also controls and manages Holiday Inn, the largest
international hotel chain in the country, and has extensive property
development schemes under way.
Africa Israel boosted first-half net profits by 51 per cent from Shk20m to
Shk31.2m. Last year, the company made a net profit of Shk63.2m. The company
recently purchased a 26 per cent stake worth Dollars 12.5m in Ayalon, an
Israeli petroleum retailer, and a 45 per cent stake in Haifa Quarries is a
deal aimed at developing a 15,000 sq m site into a Dollars 25m commercial,
office and tourism centre.
Chase Manhattan and Bank Leumi le-Israel BM this week announced a strategic
alliance designed to provide ADR and GDR programmes 'programme services' to
Israeli companies.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp cut in bad debt costs
helps NAB to surge 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Australia Bank, the strongest of the country's four big banks,
yesterday announced a ADollars 1.71bn (USDollars 1.29bn) profit after tax,
abnormals and outside equity interests, for the year to end-September.
The figure, a record for any Australian company, compared with ADollars
1.13bn in the previous 12 months, and translated into earnings per share of
127.3 cents, a 46.2 per cent rise over the 1992-93 result. The abnormal gain
was ADollars 50m, against ADollars 59m last time.
NAB, which takes in the Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Northern banks in the UK
as well as National Irish Bank and Bank of New Zealand, said it had declared
a final dividend of 39 cents a share, making a total for the year of 74
cents. This is an increase of 48 per cent over the previous annual total.
Although NAB had never been as troubled by the property market's collapse
and bad debt experience as its big local rivals, the strong result - in line
with analysts' forecast - confirms the extent to which the Australian
banking sector is bouncing back from the recession of the early 1990s. NAB
said yesterday's result came after a reduction in the charge for bad and
doubtful debts, to ADollars 179m from ADollars 604m. Total impaired loans
after provisions fell by 37.2 per cent to ADollars 1.7bn.
The main Australian Bank division saw its contribution to operating profit
rise by 34.1 per cent, to ADollars 1.03bn, with the UK/Irish group making
ADollars 428m, up from ADollars 293m previously. NAB said the latter
progress came mainly from a reduction in the bad debt charge and improved
efficiency levels. The New Zealand operations made ADollars 143m, up from
ADollars 95m previously.
In spite of the result, NAB shares weakened yesterday and closed 34 cents
lower at ADollars 10.36 on the Australian Stock Exchange.
Some analysts said that investors had been hoping for even higher profits;
others suggested that, while the interest margin had widened in the second
half, cost-containment in the second six months was disappointing. The
cost-to-income ratio for the year overall was 55 per cent, down from 55.6
per cent in 1993 (excluding restructuring costs).
The bank said it expected further interest rate rises in the current year,
both in Australia and overseas, but was looking to improve performance
further as economies picked up.
However, Mr Don Argus, managing director, struck a cautionary note in
Melbourne, saying he did not want to forecast 1994-95 profits 'because,
while saying there is good economic growth being projected for all of the
markets in which we are represented, I still believe there are some signs to
suggest that the system's growth that we have experienced over the past 12
months may not be sustainable.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Capital spending cutbacks batter
construction groups - Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's construction contractors are continuing to suffer from industry's
long abstinence from capital investment, but their performance seems to have
passed its worst. The country's leading contractors yesterday reported a
sharp fall in profits for the six months to the end of September, but said
order books were starting to grow again for the first time in four years.
Capital expenditure accounts for 75 per cent of the turnover at the leading
companies, and so an increase in revenues from housing construction could
not offset a fall in office building business and lower private investment
projects. Delays in the government's budgetary process caused a slump in
public works projects.
Among the four largest companies, only Kajima was able to increase sales in
the period. However, the overall decline in turnover was less than expected
 -combined sales at the four companies fell by 5 per cent - and Kajima and
Obayashi both raised their recurring profit forecasts slightly for the full
year.
Profits for the first half were still well below last year's already
depressed levels, however. Aggregate recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - at the big four fell by more than 15 per cent
as intense competition in the sector forced prices down.
However, a revival in private sector capital investment plans led to a 16
per cent rise in order books at Taisei, while Obayashi's orders were down
slightly. Kajima alone reported a steep fall, as the company was shut out of
public works projects because of its involvement in bribery cases.
Capital spending by Japanese corporations expanded rapidly in the late
1980s, as asset prices increased and companies borrowed heavily to finance
growth. Since 1990, however, investment has collapsed along with asset
prices.
The share of non-housing building in gross national product has fallen to
4.2 per cent, its lowest level for 35 years. The decline has forced
companies to restructure, reducing staff levels and administrative costs.
However, Mr Bernard Siman, construction analyst at UBS in Tokyo, said
capital expenditure was expected to increase as the economy began a gradual
recovery. 'These results suggest that with orders rising and margins
improving, thanks to rising prices and restructuring efforts, the
contractors' performance should improve substantially over the next few
years,' he said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: BA, Qantas reassess flight plan
/ A look at the prospects for the two airlines on the lucrative
Australia-Europe routes in the wake of a decision to block their fares
proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways and Australia's Qantas, in which BA holds a 25 per cent
stake, are expected to re-examine ways in which resources on their
Australia-Europe services could be combined. The move follows yesterday's
decision by the Australia's Trade Practices Commission to block a proposal
which would have seen the two carriers jointly set air fares and freight
rates on these routes.
In its ruling, the TPC, Australia's competition watchdog, said it believed
the proposed arrangement was likely to lessen competition, and that benefits
to the public from the services tie-up would be limited. It was sceptical
about the airlines' argument that they could achieve significant
cost-savings, and that these would be passed on to customers as lower fares.
Professor Allan Fels, TPC chairman, said the agreement was 'very
wide-ranging and open-ended', adding that price-fixing was viewed as 'one of
the most serious forms of anti-competitive conduct'. He also noted that BA
and Qantas had almost half the Australia-Europe air services market, and
that smaller players did not compete in terms of frequency and convenience
of flights.
The official response from the carriers was brief: both said they were
disappointed and needed to study the draft decision carefully.
The TPC ruling, however raises two immediate questions. First, where does
the relationship between British Airways and Qantas go from here? Secondly,
what repercussions does the TPC decision have for the Australian
government's planned stock market flotation of its remaining 75 per cent
interest in Qantas next year?
The proposed deal would have been significant for the carriers - a first,
large step towards implementing the broad commercial agreement they signed
when BA bought its 25 per cent stake in Qantas, for ADollars 665m (USDollars
500m), last year.
Although the airlines characterised their proposal as a 'co-operation'
arrangement, their planned 'pooling' of resources was to be extensive. They
wanted to fix prices - that is, jointly determine air fares and freight
rates - on all routes between Australia and Europe, including those going
via the US, and between Australia and south-east Asia.
They also wanted to jointly manage capacity and yields on selected routes
between Australia and Europe and Australia and south-east Asia. Finally,
they sought to co-ordinate flight scheduling, sales and marketing operations
on some of the routes.
The routes concerned involve big money. According to Qantas,
Australia-Europe services generate around ADollars 1.8bn a year for the two
carriers combined, and about a quarter of its own international capacity is
tied up flying these routes.
In submissions to the TPC, the two airlines argued the routes had not been
profit-spinners in the past, and that public benefits would result if their
viability improved.
Qantas, in particular, used two arguments. It noted that a rise in
profitability would increase the amount which the government - and the
Australian taxpayer - could hope to receive when the airline was floated on
the stock market next year. Conversely, it warned that if the agreement was
not allowed, it might have to reduce Australia-Europe services in an effort
to contain these low returns. This would penalise the travelling public.
The carriers estimated the gain from the proposed agreement at about
ADollars 90m annually, of which two-thirds would go to Qantas. In the
context of an airline which made a profit after tax and abnormals of
ADollars 156m in the last financial year, and which described a target of
more than ADollars 400m as 'the right return on shareholders' funds', this
would be a big bottom-line help.
However, the TPC was highly sceptical about the carriers' numbers. It said
other confidential information from Qantas contradicted this assessment.
At face value, then, yesterday's decision would appear to be a blow to the
airlines' potential relationship. But the story will almost certainly not
end here.
One possibility is that Qantas simply sticks to its threat and prunes back
services to Europe. However, the TPC's ruling is only a draft decision, and
interested parties can ask for a 'conference' on it within the next two
weeks.
Yesterday, more thought seemed to be directed at how the two carriers might
address the TPC's concerns, and still move towards operational
rationalisation on the routes. Some comfort, at least, seemed to be taken
from the thought that it was price-fixing which stuck most firmly in the
watchdog's gullet.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black still keen to lift stake
in Fairfax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media entrepreneur, said yesterday he still
hoped to be allowed to increase his stake in John Fairfax, the Australian
newspaper publisher, to 35 per cent. However, he said he had no plans to
talk to members of the federal government on his current trip to Australia,
writes Nikki Tait.
Mr Black, whose UK-based Telegraph group holds 24.8 per cent of Fairfax's
shares, is limited to 25 per cent under Australian foreign ownership rules
for media assets - a level he has previously indicated is unsatisfactory.
With Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Mr Rupert Murdoch also
holding smaller stakes in Fairfax, there has been persistent speculation
that Mr Black will eventually sell out. However, after yesterday's annual
meeting of Fairfax shareholders, Mr Black said his stake was 'the ultimate
long-term hold'.
At the annual meeting, Sir Laurence Street, Fairfax chairman, said the group
had reached a 'profitable and strategically important phase' and was
'currently negotiating the establishment of strategic alliances and joint
ventures with local and international partners in pay-TV and other media
outlets'.

Y2bn

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daihatsu Motor, Japan's second biggest manufacturer of minicars, posted a
280 per cent rise in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax
 -for the first half of the current fiscal year. It attributed the surge to
a cost-cutting drive, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Daihatsu, owned 16 per cent by Toyota Motor, announced a recurring profit of
Y2.09bn (Dollars 21.2m) to end-September, compared with Y551m a year
earlier.
The profit jump marked the second straight year-on-year gain for Daihatsu,
and was achieved in spite of a dip in sales to Y345.02bn from Y362.87bn a
year ago.
Daihatsu's operating profit rose by Y1.26bn. The company described this as
the difference between a Y5.6bn loss due to poor sales and a saving of
Y6.8bn through cost-cutting measures.
Domestic sales fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier to 182,620 vehicles in
the first half, with demand subdued ahead of the launch of a completely
remodelled Mira - Daihatsu's mainstay model - in September.
Exports fell 50.1 per cent to 44,383 as shipments of assembled cars to China
were replaced by exports of car components.
Daihatsu raised its forecast of recurring profit to Y5bn in the full year
from an earlier Y4bn.

rights

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Randgold &amp; Exploration said its West African mineral rights were likely to
be grouped together and listed as a separate company in early 1995, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg. It also said it would consider a rights issue
early next year to refinance Durban Roodepoort Deep gold mine if current
talks on its possible merger with Rand Leases Gold Mining Co were concluded
successfully.
A number of proposals on the sale of Randgold's extensive mineral rights
were still being considered, Mr Peter Flack, the new executive chairman,
said after announcing poorer annual results.
He said the company's initial enthusiasm about the potential of Randgold's
minerals rights had actually increased. It seemed most likely that the West
African rights would be listed as a group in the first half of 1995.
Pre-tax profits slipped to R4.9m (Dollars 1.39m) for the year to
end-September from R15.9m a year ago, and to R3.7m from R8.3m at the net
level. The company passed its final dividend.
Mr Flack said Randgold had decided to take the full R12.6m costs of an
intended restructuring at its head office in the financial year to September
30 1994.
It had raised R40m for working capital at Durban Deeps gold mine and to fund
retrenchment packages.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Record third period at Wal-Mart
Stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Store openings and a large increase in revenues helped Wal-Mart Stores, the
US discount store group, increase net income by 13 per cent to a record
Dollars 588m in its third quarter to October from Dollars 519m for the same
period last year.
Revenues shot up 21 per cent to Dollars 20.4bn, reflecting new store
openings and recent acquisitions. But profits lagged the growth in turnover
because much of the increase came from the recent acquisition of the
loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse chain from Kmart and the Woolco chain
from Woolworth Canada.
Earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 26 cents from 23 cents.
At the end of the quarter, the company had 61 more Wal-Mart discount stores
than it had a year earlier, making a total of 1,983. The number of
Supercenters rose by 52 to 119 and the number of Sam's Clubs rose by 75 to
437. The company added 122 Canadian Wal-Mart stores, increased the number of
Mexican stores by 38 to 52, and opened three Value Clubs in Hong Kong.
The Sam's Club membership warehouse operations continued their recent
weakness, with same-store sales falling 0.7 per cent. This was offset by
strong growth in the core Wal-Mart operations which increased same-store
sales 7.4 per cent.
Until recently, Wal-Mart's shareholders had been accustomed to seeing
earnings growth averaging 25 per cent a year, but the company, the world's
biggest retailer, is finding it hard to sustain the momentum.

George Weston, the Canadian food distribution, forest products and fisheries
group controlled by the Weston family, improved earnings in the first nine
months and sees further gains in 1995, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 34.7m (USDollars 25.3m), or 74 cents a
share, up from CDollars 21.1m, or 45 cents, a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 3.85bn against CDollars 3.55bn.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 71.6m, or CDollars 1.52 a share, up from
CDollars 50.6m, or CDollars 1.08, on revenues of CDollars 9.8bn against
CDollars 9.06bn.
Mr Galen Weston, chairman, said food processing and distribution were
improving margins, fisheries were turning round, and pulp and paper
operations were now profitable.
He said that while Weston's return on equity was still well below normal,
the company looked forward to better results again in 1995.

MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, said its 24.5 per cent
stake in Asarco, the US mining company, would be sold via a public offering
at a price of USDollars 28 a share, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. This is
slightly in excess of book value, and will raise about Dollars 290m.
The offering is underwritten by CS First Boston and S. G. Warburg. MIM,
which has been steadily disposing of its non-core assets and investments,

<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, and Kinross Gold, a
junior Canadian company, have terminated negotiations on the sale to Kinross
of the Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina for USDollars 47m, writes
Kenneth Gooding in London.
No reasons have been given for the break-down in talks, but Mr Bob Adams,
RTZ director of planning and development, said yesterday: 'We will lose no
sleep over this.'
Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ chief executive, said Kinross had made the first approach
about the proposed deal and had offered a good price for what was RTZ's
highest-cost gold producer. Ridgeway, which is expected to produce about
125,000 troy ounces of gold this year, also had limited reserves - about 10
years - and exploration potential.
He said that, contrary to market rumours, RTZ had not put a 'for sale' sign
on its US gold mines - which also include Barney's Canyon in Utah and
Rawhide (51 per cent-controlled) in Nevada - but if the right offer came
along it would be considered as these assets were not strategically
important to the group.

oversupply, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta. Sales fell marginally to Rs1.8bn.
In the first half, the company's export earnings rose Rs20m to Rs314m.
However, Mr Krishna Kumar, managing director, said export prospects for the

<TEXT>
Banca di Roma, which owns Italy's biggest banking network, has confirmed it
will take control of Banca Mediterranea, based in southern Italy, writes
Andrew Hill in Milan.
Banca Mediterranea, which has about 90 branches in the Basilicata, Campania,
Puglia and Molise regions, has announced a L280bn (Dollars 176m) increase in
capital reserved for Banca di Roma, which will give the Rome-based bank
control.
Banca di Roma said it intended to take control of Banca Mediterranea, formed
in 1992 from a merger between three regional banks, in the spring, when it
would buy a 4.2 per cent stake in the bank.
Banca di Roma has more than 1,200 branches across Italy. As consolidation of
the fragmented Italian banking sector continues, many analysts expect Banca
di Roma to look for further acquisitions in the south, while banks such as
Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana, both based in Milan,
attempt to expand in the richer northern part of the country.
Banca di Roma announced a profit last year of L880bn before tax. Banca
Mediterranea, by contrast, has been hit by recession in the south of the
country, and lost L62bn.

<TEXT>
Dell Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, reported improved
third-quarter results following its re-entry into the market for notebook
computers and a renewed focus on 'direct' sales via mail order and
telephone.
Sales increased 17 per cent to Dollars 885m from Dollars 757m in the same
period last year. Net income for the quarter was up sharply at Dollars
41.4m, or 93 cents a share, from Dollars 12m, or 26 cents, last time.
Notebook computers represented 9 per cent of worldwide computer sales, up
from 5 per cent in the second quarter. Dell also reported strong sales of
desktop PCs based on Intel's high performance Pentium microprocessor, which
represented 32 per cent of sales in the quarter.
Third-quarter sales also benefited from a seasonal increase in US government
sales, which typically decline in the fourth quarter, the company said.
However, revenues from Europe and large US accounts are expected to offset
the decline, said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial officer.
Noting that competitive pricing pressures are intense, Mr Dell said that the
company 'may choose not to take advantage of every opportunity for
incremental revenue in order to deliver steady and sustainable results'.
Gross profit margins declined sequentially from 21.4 per cent of sales in
the second quarter to 20.5 per cent of sales.
However, operating expenses dropped to 13.8 per cent of sales, versus 15 per
cent in the second quarter.
Although earnings were above Wall Street expectations of about 87 cents per
share, Dell's share price declined to close at Dollars 44 3/4 compared with
Wednesday's close of Dollars 46 1/16 .
For the year to date Dell reported revenues of Dollars 2.44bn, up from
Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net earnings were Dollars 82m,
or Dollars 2.10 a share against a loss of Dollars 55.1m, or Dollars 1.48.

<TEXT>
A sharp rebound in its domestic businesses helped Campbell Soup, the US food
group, post a 19 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings to a record Dollars
197m, or 79 cents a share. Net sales in the period totalled Dollars 1.86bn,
up from Dollars 1.76bn a year earlier.
An upbeat Mr David Johnson, chairman, said yesterday: 'Our US businesses
have come roaring back, and our international businesses have continued on a
fast pace.'
In the US, Campbell's sales rose to Dollars 1.12bn from Dollars 1.07bn as
strong volume gains from a number of products - including frozen dinners,
spaghetti sauce and pickles - helped offset a drop in soup shipments which
the group said was part of its programme to eliminate costly peaks in its
manufacturing and shipping cycles.
Bakery and confectionery sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 417m in the wake
of volume gains in chocolate and biscuit products at home and overseas,
while international grocery sales jumped 11 per cent to Dollars 341m, aided
by strong sales of soups worldwide.
The record results helped Campbell's share price climb Dollars 1 1/4 to
close at Dollars 45 1/2 , a high for the year.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ericsson disappoints with 88%
nine-month advance

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, jumped 88
per cent in the first nine months to SKr3.49bn (Dollars 475m) from SKr1.85bn
on the back of surging sales of mobile telephone equipment and tight cost
control.
Although the result was in line with expectations, it disappointed a market
hoping for better figures and the group's B shares fell 5 per cent to SKr439
on profit-taking. This was in spite of a strong third-quarter order intake
and confident remarks about prospects from Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief
executive.
The group's radio communications division, including mobile telephony,
underpinned the performance with a 56 per cent advance in nine-month sales
to SKr26.3bn. Its strong showing, based on rapid growth in the US, Japanese
and Australian markets, enabled the group to lift overall sales 29 per cent
to SKr54.6bn.
In the third quarter, radio communications sales rose 47 per cent to
SKr9.20bn from SKr6.24bn, more than half total sales of SKr18.06bn. Mobile
telephony sales were 72 per cent higher.
The group's other big division, public communications, saw nine-month sales
expand to SKr17.2bn from SKr15.1bn.
Mr Ramqvist said full-year results would be 'significantly higher' than last
year's SKr3.1bn.
'We retain our clear leading position in the world in mobile telephone
systems, with sharply rising installations of all established systems. We
also see a very positive trend in the area of mobile telephones, with a
growing share of the world market.'
Order bookings were 30 per cent higher in the third quarter, taking them to
SKr60.1bn, ahead 22 per cent, for the first nine months.
The group's success in lifting orders for 12 consecutive quarters was
described by Mr Ramqvist as 'evidence that we truly have very competitive
offerings for our customers'.
The group's fastest-growing markets are in Asia, where nine-month sales
climbed 80 per cent to SKr11.4bn from SKr6.3bn.
China and Japan are now the company's fifth and sixth largest markets after
the US, Sweden, Italy and the UK.
Analysts forecast full-year profits of about SKr5.5bn.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro acquires 20% of Asian
broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Dutch bank which is attempting to build a large international
investment banking business, yesterday said it had acquired a 20 per cent
interest in an Asian stockbroker with the intention of acquiring majority
control.
The bank hopes to build up its stake in HG Asia Group, a leading broker in
Asian markets, to majority control within the next year. The HG Asia network
was formerly part of Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which ABN Amro
acquired two years ago, but was then bought out by its management.
Mr Louis de Bievre, the ABN Amro board member responsible for investment
banking, said the bank had had 'a rather limited' presence in Asian
equities. He said ABN Amro had employed a consultant to look for
acquisitions but the HG Asia chance had arisen through past connections. It
would not have bought the stake unless it was confident of acquiring
majority control.
The two other large shareholders in HG Asia are the Guoco Group listed in
Hong Kong and HG Asia's management. The Guoco Group is part of the Malaysian
Hong Leong Group, a conglomerate headed by Mr Quek Leng Chan.
Mr de Bievre said ABN Amro saw Mr Quek's involvement in HG Asia as an
important aspect of the purchase because of his contacts in local markets.
He said Mr Quek wanted to remain a shareholder, which ABN Amro also wanted.

profits in six quarters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Woolworth, the troubled US retailing group, yesterday pulled itself out of
six consecutive quarters of losses. It posted net profits of Dollars 37m in
the three months to October compared with net losses of Dollars 350m in the
same period last year.
However, the comparison was flattered by special provisions and one-time
charges that hit results in the third quarter of 1993. Excluding these, the
combined operating profits of the company's general merchandise and
specialty retailing divisions were little changed.
Woolworth has been cutting back its fading five-and-dime stores and
diversifying into specialty retailing. The strategy has failed to yield
results.
At the operating level, Woolworth said the specialty retailing operations
had increased profits to Dollars 95m from Dollars 61m and the general
merchandise operations had turned in a Dollars 9m profit in the latest
quarter from a Dollars 31m loss.
However, the 1993 figures included special provisions of Dollars 23m against
specialty retailing and Dollars 49m against general merchandise operations,
relating to workers' compensation and general liability insurance.
Without these, the comparison would have shown profits of the specialty
retailing rising less - to Dollars 95m from Dollars 84m - and profits of the
general merchandise operations declining to Dollars 9m from Dollars 18m.
The company took a restructuring charge in last year's third quarter to
cover 13,000 job cuts and closing 970 general merchandise stores in North
America. Without the charge, the comparable period's net losses would have
been Dollars 3m.
Total group revenues fell to Dollars 2.1bn from Dollars 2.39bn. Earnings per
share were 28 cents compared with losses per share of Dollars 2.66 last
time.

member firms

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings of New York Stock Exchange member firms plunged in the third
quarter, falling to Dollars 447m from Dollars 1.3bn a year ago.
For the first nine months, stock exchange member firms earned Dollars 894m,
compared with Dollars 4.3bn in the same period of 1993.
Although the figures for the latest quarter represented an impressive
recovery from the Dollars 404m loss incurred in the second quarter, the
sharp drop from the year-earlier period in the earnings of the 302 NYSE
securities firms which do business with the public illustrates how much
business conditions on Wall Street have deteriorated.
This was largely because of rising interest rates and the slump in the bond
market.
In contrast to the securities firms, which do business with the public, NYSE
specialist firms - the marketmakers which exclusively match buyers and
sellers on the exchange's trading floor - reported a 23 per cent rise in
third-quarter profits to Dollars 38m.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rockefeller denies reports of
mortgage default on centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rockefeller Group, which owns the Rockefeller Centre office complex in
Manhattan, yesterday denied reports that it could soon default on its
mortgage payments on the centre.
Rockefeller Group is 80 per cent controlled by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan
while the other 20 per cent of Rockefeller Group is in the hands of the
Rockefeller family.
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
holder of the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the complex - the real estate
investment trust Rockefeller Centre Properties (RCP) - warned there was
'substantial concern' about the ability of Rockefeller Group to meet its
mortgage payments. Due to the depressed state of the New York commercial
property market, Rockefeller Centre's rental income has not been able to
cover its mortgage payments for years.
Yesterday the Rockefeller Group said the next monthly Dollars 46.5m interest
payment on the mortgage had been paid, and it remained committed to
'maintaining the Rockefeller Centre as the premier commercial property in
the world'.
Although Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family have made up the Dollars 300m
annual cash shortfall on the Rockefeller Centre's books for the past five
years, the SEC filing raised doubts about Mitsubishi's willingness to
continue covering the large losses.
If Mitsubishi pulled out of its commitment to cover the losses and the
property defaulted, ownership of the centre would revert to RCP as the
mortgage holder.
Although property analysts have long doubted whether Mitsubishi would cut
its losses because of the damage such a move would inflict on its
reputation, the SEC filing indicated that RCP believed the Japanese group
may be close to changing its mind.
When Mitsubishi bought majority control of the landmark art-deco complex for
Dollars 1.4bn in 1989, it was one of the most high-profile Japanese
investments in the US. Soon after that deal the New York property market
collapsed and the 19-building complex is estimated to be worth less than
Dollars 1bn.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Procter takes a gamble with
nappy changes - The group hopes to regain market share with its latest price
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a puzzle. Pulp prices are rocketing worldwide, so companies making
paper-based products are under pressure to raise their prices too. Yet
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, announced earlier this
week that it was cutting the US price of its Luvs disposable nappies
(diapers in the US) by 11 per cent. What is Procter &amp; Gamble's game?
At first glance, the announcement sounded ominously like a repeat of
Marlboro Friday. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes 15 per cent of its global
revenues from disposable nappies, said it was cutting the price of Luvs to
claw back market share from cheaper, store-branded and private label
nappies. Last year Philip Morris, another big US packaged goods maker,
employed much the same logic when it cut the price of Marlboro, its
top-selling cigarette brand, to reverse its loss of market share to cheaper,
generic brands.
So was this Diaper Tuesday? The comparison falters because Luvs, unlike
Marlboro, is not a premium product. Procter &amp; Gamble's top disposable nappy
brand in the US is Pampers, while Luvs is a value-for-money brand. Procter &amp;
Gamble says the Luvs price cut is intended merely to restore the product's
competitiveness with private label brands, which have recently become
cheaper.
Even so, the cut will hurt. US nappy prices have already fallen by about 20
per cent over the past two years because of tough competition between
Procter &amp; Gamble, the private label suppliers, and Kimberly-Clark, the US
paper products company that leads the US nappy market with its Huggies
brand. Furthermore, Procter &amp; Gamble is having to accompany the Luvs price
cut with a 2 per cent reduction in the US price of Pampers because Pampers
might otherwise start to look too expensive.
The puzzle is how Procter &amp; Gamble can afford it. Pulp prices, driven by
surging worldwide demand, have shot up by 80 per cent from their November
1993 low of Dollars 390 a tonne, and are rising fast. According to Mr Chip
Dillon, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, Procter &amp; Gamble gets through
700,000-800,000 tonnes of pulp a year in the US alone. So even by the most
conservative estimate, the company is facing an increase in pulp costs of
Dollars 200m a year in the US - equivalent to about 25 cents a share after
tax.
One way Procter &amp; Gamble plans to defray the cost is by increasing the price
of its other paper-based products. It said this week that it was raising the
US prices of its Charmin toilet tissue by 5 per cent, its Bounty paper
towels by 6 per cent and its Puffs facial tissues by 8 per cent. Meanwhile,
the Luvs price cut should be partially offset by increased sales.
The company is also cutting manufacturing costs. In July last year it set in
train a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs - about 12 per cent of
its global workforce - in response to competition from lower-priced
products. 'The efficiencies gained from those actions pay out at a time like
this,' the company says.
Procter &amp; Gamble insists that it expects to continue 'solid' sales and
earnings progress in spite of the nappy price cuts. Ms Lynne Hyman, an
analyst at CS First Boston, is less sure: she thinks the price increases on
tissue and towel products should cancel out the increased cost of pulp,
while lower production costs should balance out the price cuts for Luvs. 'I
would say it's fairly neutral, but a little bit of it is dependent on
getting some higher volumes, so there's a chance it could be slightly
negative,' she says.
If things do go wrong, one possible gainer should be Procter &amp; Gamble's
biggest US rival in paper products, Kimberly-Clark. Unlike Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kimberly-Clark is a pulp producer. Therefore if product prices rise, Procter
&amp; Gamble will be simply defraying higher raw material costs, while
Kimberly-Clark should see the full benefit at its bottom line.
Unfortunately, however, Kimberly-Clark has troubles of its own. The company
has been trying to break into the European market for disposable nappies
with its Huggies brand, but the cost of doing so has proved much higher than
expected - not least because of aggressive retaliatory action by Procter &amp;
Gamble. So the last thing Kimberly-Clark needs just now is a round of price
cuts in the US nappy market.
Mr Sherman Chao, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, remarks that all this is a far
cry from the early 1990s, when consumer product companies were enjoying a
fall in raw material costs and yet were still able to push up prices. 'Now
everything is converging against them - an inability to raise prices in
general and raw material prices moving up.' Seen in that light, it is
remarkable that Procter &amp; Gamble is doing as well as it is. But with the
nappy war moving to Europe, and the increase in pulp prices showing no signs
of slowing, no one is pretending that the diaper business is going to get
any easier.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sony's Hollywood romance dies -
Things looked so different five years ago when the Japanese group paid
Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia and Tristar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the news broke five years ago that Sony, the powerful Japanese
electronics group, had pounced on Columbia and Tristar, the famous Hollywood
studios, the reaction of the US media was nothing short of hysterical.
Sony's Dollars 3.4bn acquisition, followed by the news that Matsushita,
another force in Japanese electronics, was buying MCA for Dollars 6.1bn,
unleashed a stream of rhetoric about the apparently unstoppable Asian
invasion into America's cultural heartland - Hollywood.
This mood soon changed as it became apparent that Sony and MCA's
sober-suited executives were finding it difficult to manage their egocentric
new subsidiaries. Sony yesterday demonstrated how difficult its Hollywood
adventure had been by announcing a first-half Y280bn (Dollars 2.9bn) loss
due to a Y265bn write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), which
includes Columbia and Tristar.
The scale of the write-off outstripped the most pessimistic predictions.
Against the backdrop of last month's public showdown between Matsushita and
its unruly executives at MCA, it has strengthened suspicions that Sony and
Matsushita blundered badly by making expensive acquisitions in the US
entertainment industry.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'If
there is a moral to this story it's that Japanese electronics groups do not
make good parents for Hollywood movie studios.'
Things seemed so different five years ago when Sony and Matsushita embarked
on their US spending spree. The consumer electronics market was maturing and
the Japanese groups faced fierce competition from rivals in lower cost
countries such as South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Sony and Matsushita needed to diversify and reckoned the best area for
investment was the software side of their business: the film studios and
record companies that produced the movies and music pumped out by their
hardware.
Entertainment also offered excellent growth prospects. The emergence of
cable and video, coupled with the globalisation of consumer taste and the
creation of lucrative markets in eastern Europe and south-east Asia, augured
well for long-term sales of English language films and music.
The hitch was that the gulf between the ethos of corporate Japan and the
world of Hollywood was wider than they had feared. One New York analyst
said: 'These LA guys seem like a flakey bunch of prima donnas here in
Manhattan. Over in Tokyo they must seem completely crazy.'
'Crazy' is probably an understatement for Matsushita's view of the behaviour
of Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran chairman of MCA, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, his
president. The two became multi-millionaires by selling shares to Matsushita
and have since made no secret of their contempt for their new parent
company.
Tempers seemed to cool after last month's showdown. However, the intensely
private Matsushita has been left in an unpalatable situation whereby one of
its most important subsidiaries is run by two men who have publicly
criticised its performance.
Sony is in a similar predicament in the music industry thanks to Mr George
Michael, the British singer who has mounted an expensive legal battle to try
to sever his contract with its CBS music subsidiary. Mr Michael is now
reported to be in talks with Mr David Geffen, who is leaving MCA to set up
his own entertainment group.
However, Sony's problems in music pale beside its traumas with films. It has
over the past five years invested an estimated Dollars 4.5bn in SPE in
addition to the original Dollars 3.4bn acquisition price. Mr Peter Guber,
who spent most of that money, resigned last month as SPE chairman. His
departure ended a grim year of internal rows, allegations linking senior SPE
executives to the Heidi Fleiss sex scandal and a poor performance at the box
office.
SPE had an erratic year in 1993 with some successes, such as Philadelphia,
but a disappointment in Last Action Hero, its Dollars 126m Arnold
Schwarzenegger vehicle. This year has been worse. Variety magazine estimates
that its share of the US box office has fallen from 14.7 per cent in 1990 to
9.8 per cent this year. Sony's studios are also bottom of this year's league
table for average gross per film with Dollars 18.1m against Dollars 55.3m
for Paramount, the top studio.
Yesterday's writedown marks Sony's attempt to clear the debris of its first
five troubled years in Hollywood. Its studio also faced substantial
second-quarter losses for mopping up abortive development projects and
lingering legal suits. After Mr Guber's departure it now, in theory, has a
chance to start afresh.
But some observers suspect Sony and Matsushita's plight is not simply due to
cultural incompatibility, but to a flaw in their strategy. This suggests
they should have stuck to hardware, by investing in information technology.
Sony and Matsushita have already made modest investments in the information
technology field. But both privately admit they would have been able to
invest more aggressively had it not been for their commitment to Hollywood.

expectations

<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard's share price reached a 10-year high yesterday when the
computer and electronics company reported even stronger-than-expected
fourth-quarter results. Earnings rose 60 per cent on a 23 per cent increase
in revenues.
H-P, the second-largest US computer company after IBM, is setting the pace
in the market for 'client-server' networks of computers, and also dominates
the rapidly-growing market for printers used with personal computers.
Fourth-quarter sales and order growth was 'outstanding and well balanced
across all geographies', said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president and chief
executive.
Net earnings for the quarter, to end-October, were Dollars 476m or Dollars
1.83 a share, up from Dollars 298m or Dollars 1.18, in the same period last
year. (Earlier this year H-P changed its earnings per-share calculations to
include employee stock options, increasing the effective number of shares
outstanding by about 6m to 260m.)
Net revenue for the quarter was Dollars 7bn, an increase of 23 per cent over
the same quarter last year. US sales were Dollars 3.3bn,up 20 per cent,
while international sales rose 26 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn.
H-P said new orders booked during the fourth quarter were valued at Dollars
6.9bn, an increase of 25 per cent over the same period last year. The order
growth rate signals continuing strong performance in fiscal 1995.
As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold rose to 62.2 per cent
from 61.4 per cent in last year's fourth quarter. However, the ratio of
operating expenses to revenues declined to 26.8 per cent from 30.2 per cent.
For the full year, H-P reported a 36 per cent increase in net earnings to
Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 1.2bn. Net earnings per share were Dollars 6.14,
up from Dollars 4.65. Net revenues for the year rose 23 per cent to Dollars
25bn from Dollars 20.3bn.
Mr Platt said H-P was starting 1995 in a strong competitive position, but
that 'given our size, and the fact that our growth rates have exceeded those
of many markets in which we compete, we're not assuming that our recent
order-growth rates will continue'.
In mid-session yesterday H-P shares were trading at Dollars 101 3/4 , but
fell back to Dollars 100 by the close for a net gain on the day of Dollars 1
1/2.

<TEXT>
Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Europe's second biggest producer of white goods,
is strengthening its position in upmarket domestic appliances with the
purchase of Gaggenau, the long-established German manufacturer.
Terms were not disclosed, but Gaggenau has about 900 employees and annual
sales of DM215m (Dollars 138.6m).
A restructuring programme already under way at Gaggenau will continue, said
Bosch-Siemens, which will maintain the Gaggenau brand.
The deal continues the trend of consolidation in the European domestic
appliances sector. It comes a few days after Munich-based Bosch-Siemens said
it would link with China's Wuxi Little Swan to build a washing machine
factory in China. The Dollars 30m venture, in which Bosch will have a
majority stake, will produce European-designed washing machines for the
Chinese market.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW on course for full-year
profit after strong quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen climbed further back into profits in the third quarter, with the
benefits of rising demand and its tough action to cut labour and components
costs almost wiping out the loss made at the start of the year.
The German motor group said the after-tax loss for the first nine months was
down to DM73m (Dollars 47.1m) from DM1.53bn in the same period of 1993. Its
third-quarter net profit of DM136m compared with DM133m in the second
quarter, and a loss of DM342m in the first three months. In the third
quarter of 1993, it made a net profit of DM70m.
For the full year, VW said it expected to 'at least break even'. In 1993, it
made a group loss of DM1.9bn. 'The underlying trend is basically very
positive,' said Mr Stephen Reitman, motors analyst at UBS.
He forecast fourth-quarter profits of more than DM400m, making full-year
earnings of around DM340m.
Under the uncompromising leadership of Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW - whose group
operations include Audi, Seat in Spain and Skoda in Czechoslovakia - has
striven to bring down the cost of labour and of bought-in parts and
materials.
Despite the improved figures, however, the shares closed DM4.50 lower at
DM455 yesterday.
VW said turnover in January-September was 4.3 per cent higher at DM58.8bn.
Unit sales rose 6.7 per cent to 2.3m vehicles; in Germany, they slipped by
3.4 per cent to 662,500 units, but abroad they showed an 11.4 per cent
increase to 1.64m.
In western Europe, excluding Germany, deliveries were up 6 per cent to
857,000 vehicles, with a 22.5 per cent improvement, to 226,000, in North
America.
Because of model changes in Germany, third-quarter turnover was flat.
Mr Reitman said the July-September result showed clearly the impact of the
drive to cut component costs - spearheaded by the controversial Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua - and of the reduced working week.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Two Swedish banks made steady
headway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The pattern of lower loan losses and weaker underlying results which has
characterised the Swedish banking sector this year was highlighted yesterday
when Nordbanken and Swedbank unveiled their nine-month figures.
Nordbanken, the biggest casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, disclosed
a SKr3.54bn (Dollars 481.6m) operating profit for the period, after being
lifted by last December's acquisition of Gota Bank.
Pro-forma figures, excluding Gota, show profits rising to SKr2.77bn from
SKr2.48bn.
Swedbank achieved a SKr2.61bn profit, following an unexpectedly strong third
quarter which prompted it to raise its full-year forecast and promise a
dividend.
Its result at the nine-month stage in 1993 was a SKr2.65bn deficit.
Both banks saw a sharp reduction in loan losses due to the recovery in the
Swedish economy and lower interest rates. Excluding Gota, Nordbanken's loan
losses fell to SKr1.35bn from SKr3.41bn.
Swedbank's loan losses tumbled 62 per cent to SKr3.35bn from SKr8.86bn. It
also benefited from a SKr1.58bn capital gain on the sale of shares in Robur,
a fund management unit.
Before loan losses, pro-forma figures from Nordbanken showed a SKr4.12bn
profit, down from SKr5.89bn, while Swedbank's result, including the capital
gain, was SKr5.96bn, against SKr6.21bn. Weaker loan demand and tighter
margins lowered both banks' net interest income.
They also had lower capital gains on bond sales than in 1993.
Nordbanken, bailed out by the state in 1992 and due to be privatised next
year, forecast full-year profits of SKr4.6bn, saying final-quarter operating
profits should be at least as much as the SKr1.09bn achieved in the third
quarter.

<TEXT>
Mannesmann, the engineering group which is beginning to benefit from
earnings in its telecommunications activities, staged a turnround to a
profit in the first nine months of this year, following a DM27m loss in the
first half.
The group's profits, which were not specified, 'improved substantially',
while turnover rose to DM21.1bn in the first nine months, up 9 per cent on
the year before. New orders jumped 18 per cent to DM24.7bn.
The group's telecommunications division, built around the successful D2
mobile phone network which now has about 760,000 clients, is expected to
report its first full-year profit. It broke even last December.
The improved results at the Dusseldorf based group were driven mainly by
'dynamic' exports but it also saw improvements in the domestic market. The
strongest performers were the automotive technology and hydraulics
divisions.
Krauss-Maffei, one of the world's leading tank makers, reported
'exceptionally high' orders following contracts from Sweden and the
Netherlands.
The group was also helped by a turnround at its pipe unit, one of its oldest
activities. It represents almost 20 per cent of group turnover and has lost
money in recent years. Sales rose 18 per cent, lifted by better turnover at
the group's Brazilian unit, while orders rose 2 per cent to DM3.2bn.
Demag, the plant division, increased orders 'significantly' following a rise
in exports and the incorporation of Van Dorn Demag, a further step in
Mannesmann's strategy of strengthening its presence in the US market.
VDO, the automotive technology business, saw orders rise 19 per cent in
spite of 'sluggish' growth in the car industry. Sales rose 9 per cent. But
problems remain at Hartmann &amp; Braun, the group's electronics division, which
made a loss.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Carmakers focus on Barclay twins - AFGH
deal unites three secretive entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, one of the biggest motor
retailer groups in Britain, has brought together three of the most secretive
entrepreneurs operating in the UK.
The buyers, the Barclay brothers, the reclusive identical twins David and
Frederick, take secrecy to extremes. Shying away from all publicity, they
operate their business empire from Monaco. A year ago they added a new
hideaway, the Channel Island of Brecqhou situated between Guernsey and Sark,
which they are busy converting into their own island fortress.
The seller is Mr Octav Botnar, the 81-year-old entrepreneur, who has made a
villa in the mountains near Geneva the base for his dwindling business
operations, ever since a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland
Revenue in January, 1992.
The Barclay twins' strategy for AFGH, their first foray into the UK retail
motor industry, is still to be revealed. Their progress will be watched
carefully, however, by some of the world's leading carmakers - most notably
Fiat, Renault, Peugeot and Citroen - which are suddenly discovering this
week, that several of the dealerships operating their franchise in the UK
are under new and mysterious owership.
The UK's motor retail sector is already undergoing a far-reaching
restructuring with a spate of takeovers in the last two years, as the
leading groups led by Lex Service and Inchcape have swallowed up smaller
operators.
Few of the shockwaves reverberating through the sector have been bigger,
however, than those created by the businesses controlled by Mr Octav Botnar,
namely Automotive Financial Group Holdings, now owned by the Barclay
brothers, and its sister company, Nissan UK Holdings.
Only four years ago the Automotive and Financial Group dealer network
totalled about 180 outlets, selling exclusively new Nissan vehicles. Today,
it has no Nissan dealerships - Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, has
established its own UK dealer network starting from scratch in 1992 - while
AFG has been transformed into a multifranchise group with about 70 outlets.
In these four years, Mr Botnar's business empire has been rocked first by
the upheaval of a tumultuous legal battle with Nissan, Japan's second
largest carmaker, which stripped Nissan UK of its franchise with effect from
the end of 1991, and secondly by the corporation tax fraud investigation by
the Inland Revenue.
With the sale of AFGH Mr Botnar appears to have decided to throw in the
towel and to cease trying to exercise remote control of one of the UK's
biggest dealer groups by telephone from Switzerland.
He faces a battle with the Inland Revenue, however, over the other company
he controls, Nissan UK Holdings, about a Pounds 238m tax claim at its
wholly-owned subsidiary Nissan UK. NUKH's latest annual report says the
company will 'contest the assessments in the strongest possible manner as
being without foundation'.
Mr Botnar has controlled as chairman and managing director both NUKH and
AFGH, but their ultimate ownership has remained unclear.
Immediate majority ownership of NUKH is held by European Motor Vehicles
Corporation, registered in Panama, which has a 71.5 per cent stake, while a
stake of the same size in AFGH has been held by GF International Investments
and Finance, registered in the Bahamas. Both companies are controlled by the
same group of trustees of a settlement made by Mr Botnar with his shares in
1974. The identity of the trustees has never been revealed, although a
condition of Mr Botnar's transfer of his shares to the trust, according to
NUK, was that he should remain chairman and chief executive 'for life with
full powers'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New chairman in place at Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final piece in the new corporate jigsaw of Lucas Industries, the
automotive and aerospace components and systems manufacturer, slotted into
place yesterday when Sir Brian Pearse replaced Sir Anthony Gill as chairman.
Sir Brian will oversee a flattened management structure, with six business
managing directors. He will report to Mr George Simpson, the chief
executive.
This system, introduced by Mr Simpson since his arrival at Lucas last April,
replaces the previous portfolio management structure under Sir Anthony.
The switch in chairmen took place after the annual meeting in Birmingham.
'It is the end of a specific and determined effort to get the top team
reformed with some continuity in it,' said Sir Anthony.
This is a reference to the decision taken three years ago, largely to meet
the recommendations of the Cadbury committee, to split the roles of chairman
and chief executive, filled by Sir Anthony since 1987. That it has taken so
long to achieve the change reflects the confusion caused by the selection
and then de-selection of Mr Anthony Edwards as Sir Anthony's heir apparent.
The main focus of power in Lucas now is in the offices of Mr Simpson, fresh
from the renaissance of Rover, the car maker, and Mr John Grant, who became
finance director in 1992 after Mr David Hankinson, his predecessor, fell out
with the rest of the board.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tempers flare at Butte's AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tempers flared and insults were traded yesterday as shareholders sat through
a prolonged annual general meeting of Butte Mining, whose main activity is
prosecuting US lawsuits.
The insults were not directed at the board, however, which is seeking
damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from former managers and
promoters.
Shareholders' wrath was directed at the representative of a fellow investor
who pressed a series of questions over the lawsuit, directors' remuneration
from the litigation and Butte's accounting practices. Butte has been forced
to amend its accounts by the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
After more than an hour of detailed questioning, one shareholder stalked
out, directing a clearly enunciated 'prat' at the persistent questioner.
It became clear that most of the questions originated from shareholders
being sued in the lawsuit, or from those close to defendants.
They pointed out that Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, stood to gain up to
Pounds 10m from the lawsuit. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said he had been awarded the
litigation remuneration at a board meeting. Shareholders were welcome to
examine the minutes to ensure it had been properly awarded.
The chairman said the two-year-old lawsuit had taken substantial turns for
the better in the past year. However, dissenting shareholders pointed out
that the judge had not yet ruled on whether the case could even be heard in
the US. Meanwhile, Butte's flotation is still the focus of a Serious Fraud
Office investigation.
All the resolutions were passed. However, one shareholder objected to
granting share options to non-executive directors. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said that,
given the company's inability to provide the usual incentives to directors,
he did not see there was a problem with the option scheme.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland rises 44%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing and retail group,
increased pre-tax profits by 44 per cent from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 5.39m
in the 26 weeks to October 1.
Turnover grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 54.9m). While the
publishing side rose by just 6 per cent to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 31.3m)
retailing was up 17 per cent at Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 23.5m).
However, Mr Charles Brims, chief executive, reiterated that the next two
years would be difficult and that profit growth would slow. 'We are going
through a transition stage,' he said.
A contract to print the northern editions of the Daily Mail and Mail on
Sunday, which contributed one third of turnover in the printing business
last year, ended in October. A contract to print the Independent expires in
February 1996. Although the group was pursuing new contracts, none was
imminent, Mr Brims said.
Earnings per share rose to 28p (20.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted to
3.51p (3.12p).
The shares closed up 44p at 650p.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Meyer's warning on margins hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Meyer fell 11 per cent yesterday as the building products group
accompanied its half-year results with a warning that pressure on margins
and a slowdown in sales cast a shadow over current trading.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September were 44 per cent
ahead at Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 19m), helped by a Pounds 1.1m contribution
from property disposals, and in line with market expectations. However, the
4.2p maintained dividend disappointed analysts, some of whom were
forecasting a 10 per cent increase.
Mr John Dobby, chief executive, said that the dividend payment was an
attempt to redress the balance between the interim and the final, which had
traditionally split one third to two thirds. 'The dividend payment is not a
reflection of our performance.'
Group turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 669.3m (Pounds 600.8m). Earnings
per share advanced 27 per cent to 14.4p (11.3p). The shares closed down 44p
at 359p.
Operating profits from the Jewson division rose 27 per cent to Pounds 13.1m
(Pounds 10.3m) on sales 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 245.4m (Pounds 215.1m).
Bulk sales were buoyant, although these were subject to lower margins. The
repairs, maintenance and improvement market, which has traditionally
provided the basis for Jewson's earnings growth, was subdued.
Profits from forest products rose 13 per cent to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 8.6m)
on sales 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 219m (Pounds 190.4m). There was also an
improved contribution from the Dutch division of Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.2m),
while the German business contributed Pounds 500,0000 (Pounds 300,000).
Since September, the group had experienced a slowdown in sales growth
brought about chiefly by the rise in interest rates and the consequent
effect on the housing market, according to Mr Dobby. There were also raw
materials pricing pressures which were being passed on but increasingly
facing resistance from the beleaguered building trade. He added that given
the current difficult trading environment, the group would concentrate its
efforts on improving 'operational efficiencies.'
COMMENT
Meyer's management did little yesterday to discourage the downbeat
assessment of the group's prospects. Pricing pressures at Jewson, the
group's biggest earner, look likely to continue as it fights to maintain
market share by increasing its lower margin bulk sales. Profits for 1995-96
are forecast to fall in a range between Pounds 60m and Pounds 65m, giving
earnings of some 33.5p and a p/e of 10.5 times. This compares poorly with
rivals Travis Perkins (11.8 times) and Wolseley (12.2 times) - a position
Meyer has traditionally found itself in. Worth a hold, but the sector as a
whole is likely to remain in the doldrums.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Disposal losses and poor UK trading leave
ACT at Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor trading in the UK together with a loss of Pounds 8.8m on the disposal
of discontinued activities left ACT Group's interim pre-tax profits at
Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 11.5m.
The City had, however, anticipated the decline after a profits warning in
June. Strong underlying growth, principally in revenues and profits outside
the UK, helped push the share price of the Birmingham-based computing
services company up 5p to 103p.
Operating profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 9.89m
(Pounds 11.5m), including losses of Pounds 497,000 (Pounds 1.99m profits)
from discontinued activities. Sales were Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 107.6m) of
which Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 43.1m) related to discontinued businesses.
After tax of Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 2.88m) losses per share were 1.41p,
compared with earnings of 5.24p. Adjusting for the exceptional items
earnings came out at 4.05p (4.41p). An unchanged interim dividend of 1.75p a
share will be paid.
The group had net cash of Pounds 8.87m at the end of the period, only
slightly down on the Pounds 9.05m of 12 months previously. It intends to use
some of these resources to buy back up to 10 per cent of its stock at prices
which will enhance earnings.
ACT has been increasingly focusing on its chosen role as a supplier of
financial services software. Some 62 per cent of sales are now made abroad.
In the first half, overseas profits rose to Pounds 10.3m from Pounds 5.95m,
while UK profits fell to Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 4.6m).
Mr Michael Hart, managing director, said the UK fall was the result of an
extra Pounds 1.5m spent on research and development, a sharp decline in the
market for several of the group's products including the Quasar portfolio
management system and slow equities markets which had hit revenues at NMW,
the stock processing bureau.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said the group had shown resilience. He added
that trading had improved and he anticipated a sound second half.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New chairman in place at Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final piece in the new corporate jigsaw of Lucas Industries, the
automotive and aerospace components and systems manufacturer, slotted into
place yesterday when Sir Brian Pearse replaced Sir Anthony Gill as chairman.
Sir Brian will oversee a flattened management structure, with six business
managing directors. He will report to Mr George Simpson, the chief
executive.
This system, introduced by Mr Simpson since his arrival at Lucas last April,
replaces the previous portfolio management structure built up under Sir
Anthony.
The switch in chairmen took place, as scheduled, after the annual meeting in
Birmingham. 'It is the end of a specific and determined effort to get the
top team reformed with some continuity in it,' said Sir Anthony.
This is a reference to the decision taken three years ago, largely to meet
the recommendations of the Cadbury committee, to split the roles of chairman
and chief executive, filled by Sir Anthony since 1987. That it has taken so
long to achieve the change reflects the confusion caused by the selection
and then de-selection of Mr Anthony Edwards as Sir Anthony's heir apparent.
The main focus of power in Lucas now is in the offices of Mr Simpson, fresh
from the renaissance of Rover, the car maker, and Mr John Grant, who became
finance director in 1992 after Mr David Hankinson, his predecessor, fell out
with the rest of the board.
Sir Brian, a banker by background, sees his job as non-executive chairman as
looking after the corporate governance of Lucas, enabling 'George Simpson to
think through the strategy and to act as his sounding board.'
He stressed that he is a 'team player' and promised 'I will get involved
wherever I think I can add value to George, but I certainly will not get in
his way.'
He becomes chairman as Lucas, exploiting the strength of the automotive
market but rationalising in the face of a sluggish aerospace market, heads
towards 1994-95 pre-tax profits of probably more than Pounds 120m. This
follows a 1993-94 loss of Pounds 129.7m, caused by provisions for
restructuring.
While Sir Brian arrives with 10,000 shares, Sir Anthony retires as the
largest private individual shareholder with 700,000 shares, 983,851 options
and 300,000 warrants.
Lucas shares yesterday closed up 4p at 211p.

Mr Douglas Baker, the chairman, said the change in the tax position from a
Pounds 1.69m credit to a Pounds 225,000 charge had resulted from the full
utilisation of past petroleum revenue tax payments and changes in
legislation.
Losses per share were 0.6p (3.8p earnings).
Looking ahead, Mr Baker said there was a continuing programme of new fields
coming on stream and that despite the problems created by weak prices, the
company had excellent assets and was well financed.

in pre-tax losses from a restated Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 119,000 in the year

The result included an increased surplus of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.09m) on

Sales for the year reached Pounds 5.61m (Pounds 2.67m). Net interest charge

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Regalian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regalian Properties, which specialises in converting office and industrial
buildings into apartments, said yesterday that it had sold two developments
to east Asian investors during the last six months and was close to
concluding negotiations on a third.
In the half year to September 30, Regalian made pre-tax profits of Pounds
799,000 against losses of Pounds 869,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 16.3m as the company neared the
end of its disposal programme of mass-market homes. Mr Bob Perdeaux, finance
director, said the remaining portfolio would be sold by the end of the
financial year.
Net debt has been reduced from Pounds 13m to Pounds 2m as a result of
disposals and interest charges fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 168,000 in
the period. Administration expenses were reduced to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds
1.5m). Earnings per share were 0.68p against losses of 0.74p.
Proceeds on the sale of the two developments in London's West End were not
included in yesterday's figures because Regalian does not recognise profit
of disposals until completion.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman, said that the interest of east Asian buyers in
individual properties and whole developments was encouraging. 'The buoyancy
of the central London market and the very keen interest on the part of
international purchasers bodes well for the future,' he said.
Regalian has two joint venture developments with the Sincere Group of Hong
Kong, including the conversion of a former office block on the south bank of
the River Thames, opposite the Tate Gallery, into apartments. It is also
converting warehouses in Camden Town and Docklands and a former hospital in
Oxfordshire.
Mr Goldstone said the company still had unused credit lines and its
relationships with joint venture partners would allow it to undertake
substantial projects. Earlier this year Regalian made an unsuccessful bid of
almost Pounds 20m for the former Royal Brompton Hospital in central London.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barratt chief hits out at government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Lawrie Barratt, the chairman of Barratt Developments yesterday hit out
at government policies, including an increase in interest rates, which he
said had 'introduced an element of caution and uncertainty which is
undermining the recovery of the housing market.'
Sir Lawrie used the group's annual meeting to attack the government's recent
budget record of substantially eroding mortgage tax relief. He went on to
accuse it of adding to the cost of home ownership with the reintroduction of
Stamp Duty and hit out at the 'petty measure' last November of applying
Stamp Duty to those who require the assistance of builders' Part Exchange
schemes.
'The government should accept that a strong and stable housing market is
crucial to the recovery of the economy and call an immediate halt to any
further increases in interest rates or further erosion of mortgage tax
relief,' he added.
Sir Lawrie, who came out of retirement three years ago after the group began
to incur heavy losses, said 'the housing market is in need of some
pro-active initiatives from the government and no further negative
measures.'
In September, Sir Lawrie reported a 72 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 35.2m for the year to June 30. Turnover was up 23 per cent at Pounds
498.9m.
Yesterday, shareholders were told that sales volume in the first four months
of the current year was holding up at 16 per cent, which was fully in line
with the group's three-year growth plan.
The shares fell 6p to 173p.
Shares in Raine, another housebuilder, also dropped - by 4p to 47p - as Mr
Peter Parkin, chairman, warned at the AGM that achieving profits growth this
year would be more difficult than last. Short-term trading difficulties
would particularly affect interim figures and result in a greater proportion
than usual of profits being earned in the second half, he said.

Improvements in all areas of its business helped Carr's Milling Industries
to raise pre-tax profits by 31 per cent in the year to September 30.
On sales from continuing businesses of Pounds 75.8m (Pounds 57.5m) pre-tax
profit came to Pounds 1.55m, against a restated Pounds 1.19m.
Profit from continuing operations increased 63 per cent to Pounds 3.27m
(Pounds 2m), but discontinued activities carried a loss of Pounds 1.13m
(Pounds 160,000).
An exceptional charge of Pounds 798,000 (Pounds 321,000) was related to the
disposal of Robertson (Bakers).
Carr also said yesterday that Mr Brian Armstrong, who resigned as group
managing director in June, had received compensation of Pounds 194,000.
On a segmental basis, agriculture increased profit by 68 per cent to Pounds
2.08m on sales of Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 42m) and milling made Pounds 1.08m
(Pounds 522,000) on sales of Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 11.3m). Engineering and
other activities contributed Pounds 409,000 (Pounds 353,000).
The final dividend of 5p makes 6.2p (4.3p) for the year. Basic earnings per
share were 14p (10.6p) and on continuing operations 24.4p (12p).

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: FKI falls 15% and takes lead on FRS 7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI, the acquisitive engineering group, became one of the first companies to
adopt the new FRS 7 accounting standard when it reported a 15 per cent
decline in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 18.7m, after
an exceptional charge of Pounds 12.4m.
There was also a Pounds 1m provision for reorganisation at Rhombus, the
German caster manufacturer acquired for Pounds 26m in June. Under FRS 7,
which comes into force for accounting periods starting next month,
provisions relating to acquisitions must be taken against profits rather
than relegated to the balance sheet.
Mr Jeff Whalley, chairman, said: 'The new standard does make things clearer
and we hope to get some credit for adopting it early.'
In spite of the Rhombus provision, the figures were in line with City
expectations and the shares closed 6p higher at 168p.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 377.7m (Pounds 350m),
including Pounds 13.7m from acquisitions. The exceptional charge relates to
goodwill previously written off against reserves, on the sale of three
businesses to Wellman in July.
Earnings per share 2.03p (3.52p) or 4.8p excluding the exceptional charge.
The dividend is up a third to 2p.
Excluding acquisitions, operating margins from continuing businesses topped
the 10 per cent target set in 1992. The shares have underperformed recently
on worries that following the sharp improvement in margins, further profit
growth would be more difficult.
Operating profits rose by Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 36.6m of which Pounds 8.5m
came from Truth, the US window and door hardware manufacturer acquired for
Pounds 66.5m a year ago.
Truth, which makes almost three-quarters of its profits in the first half,
boosted the hardware profits to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 7.9m) on turnover of
Pounds 135.7m (Pounds 72.9m).
Of the other divisions, materials handling profits were slightly down, due
to delayed orders which will benefit the second half, and automotive showed
continued recovery from a low base.
However engineering profits fell almost Pounds 3m to Pounds 4.26m due to
problems at Bristol Babcock. It is being reorganised after failing to
replace some large power station instrumentation contracts in Kuwait.
COMMENT
Now that FKI has achieved its margin target, helped by its success in
pushing up prices, the City has started to worry about where the growth
comes from next. Rumours that it was planning a rights issue to fund an
abortive acquisition also unsettled the shares which have underperformed the
market by a fifth since March. Even so, assuming profits of Pounds 65m in
the year, the shares are on a multiple of almost 17. The rating fully
reflects the achievements to date and the quality of the management team.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scapa at Pounds 23m amid pressure - Signs
that overcapacity in paper industry is receding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scapa Group, the industrial materials company which mainly supplies paper
makers, said yesterday that overcapacity in the paper industry was receding,
but cautioned against over-optimism on prices.
Pre-tax profits rose by 3.6 per cent to Pounds 23m (Pounds 22.2m) in the six
months to September 30, on sales up 10 per cent to Pounds 205m (Pounds
187m). However, the group said that market pressures had reduced sales and
profits from the paper side of its business.
Mr Harry Tuley, chairman, said: 'The overcapacity situation which has been a
feature of the paper-making industry in recent years appears to be coming to
an end. Operating rates at paper mills are rising and output volumes are
increasing at a faster rate than last year.
'The engineered fabrics division, which has continued to gain market share
throughout the period, is in an excellent position to take advantage of the
improving prospects. Current order books are strong and we are looking to
the future with increasing optimism.'
However, Mr Tuley added that the changing structure of the paper and board
industry and the introduction of corporate and partnership sourcing for
paper machine clothing would continue to keep the pressure on supplier
prices.
Because of these pressures, it was restructuring its engineered fabrics
business outside of the UK. A reorganisation charge at the full-year stage
is expected to be below Pounds 5m, but the group said the resulting
improvement in profitability would produce an early payback.
Considerable progress had been made in expanding the other businesses - such
as speciality tapes and filtration products - which increased operating
profits by 50 per cent over the period. The non-paper businesses now account
for 32 per cent of operating profit, compared with 23 per cent at the same
stage last year.
Mr Tuley said the speciality tape business was performing particularly well.
Synergy from French and Italian acquisitions was enhancing growth.
Earnings grew marginally to 6.2p (6.1p), while the interim dividend rose to
1.7p (1.65p).
COMMENT
After four hard years, Scapa is at last seeing orders for new paper machines
and some increases in prices for the rollers and fabrics which it supplies
to papermakers. But the group stressed that the recent bounce in paper
prices would not directly affect its profitability - not least because the
long-term relationships which it has forged with the industry preclude
making a quick killing as soon as the cycle turns. Although these figures
were depressed by several one-off factors, the prospect is therefore of
steady rather than spectacular profits growth. It is for this reason that
Scapa wants to plough its cash into less capital-intensive areas such as
speciality tapes and filtration. Disregarding the Pounds 5m restructuring
charge, the shares  - down 6p yesterday at 200 1/2 p - are trading on a
prospective market average multiple of 14.4, which seems fair.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 600 Group back with Pounds 2.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New products and improved market conditions - especially in North America -
helped 600 Group return to the black in the year to September 30, with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.47m, against a Pounds 1.6m loss previously.
But the machine tools and mechanical handling group said it was determined
to maintain a cautious dividend policy 'for the time being,' and the interim
payout is held at 0.5p.
Turnover rose 23 per cent to Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 44.9m), and the pre-tax
profits include a credit of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.3m) related to the
actuarial valuation of the UK pension scheme. The underlying improvement in
operating profit is Pounds 4m.
Prof Michael Wright, chairman, said the strategy of focused market and
product development, combined with managed reductions in the operating cost
base, was paying off.
The decision to target the North American market, supported by the
acquisitions of Lakeshore Machine Tools, KTS Industries and, more recently,
United Machinery Sales of Indianapolis, had proved propitious.
US sales rose 40 per cent on the comparable period.
New products, especially the Tornado CNC lathe and the Scriba laser marker,
had been received favourably and further products were in the pipeline.
The two main divisions both achieved substantial turnrounds. On turnover of
Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 28m) machine tools had pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m
(Pounds 613,000 loss). Mechanical handling moved from a Pounds 540,000 loss
to a Pounds 560,000 profit, on turnover of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 12.3m).
The company's cautious approach to the dividend is partly explained by the
outlook. Although Prof Wright expected further improvements in group
performance, he said European markets remained sluggish.
The UK was experiencing a slow improvement as economic confidence increased,
but the German market remained depressed. No big improvement in European
conditions was expected before the middle of next year.
Earnings per share were 3.8p (3.8p losses).

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Whitbread rises to Pounds 183.6m - Analysts
remain cautious despite better than forecast increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread opened the brewers' reporting season yesterday with a sharper
profit rise than forecast, thanks to strong gains in premium lagers and cask
ales among its drinks, and in pubs and restaurants on its retailing side.
Pre-tax profits rose by 8 per cent from Pounds 132.3m to Pounds 143.1m in
the six months ended August 27, or to Pounds 183.6m including exceptional
gains, largely from selling most of its stakes in regional brewers. Turnover
edged up 3 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.19bn).
Whitbread's success was considered untypical, however, and analysts remained
cautious ahead of results from other brewers. Whitbread has the best
exposure to fast growing market segments such as premium lagers, stout and
cask ales. These represent about 40 per cent of its beer sales against less
than 20 per cent for Bass, the largest brewer.
The industry suffered a 1.7 per cent fall in on-trade beer volumes in the
six months to August from a year earlier, but Whitbread's was flat.
Off-trade sales were up 5.9 per cent but Whitbread's rose 11.8 per cent.
'Beer is a core business. It is one where we can grow profits and we intend
to go on doing so,' Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said.
His bullish comments and the company's expressed interest in using its
ungeared balance sheet to further its expansion left analysts expecting
deals in due course. He declined to comment, however, on whether Whitbread
was interested in buying Courage from Fosters.
Operating profits from beer rose 5 per cent to Pounds 27m (Pounds 25.8m).
Beer volume was up 3 per cent overall but sales rose only 1 per cent at
Pounds 451.7m, indicating Whitbread faced competitive pricing in off sales.
Pub operating profits were Pounds 59.3m (Pounds 53.9m) on sales of Pounds
295.3m (Pounds 275.2m). Food and drink margins were flat, but food sales
were up 19 per cent, accounting for about 25 per cent of pub turnover, about
double the industry average. Whitbread said it plans to sell its 750 free
houses.
Restaurant and leisure profits were Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 28.4m) on sales of
Pounds 544.9m (536.5m).
The interim dividend rose 7 per cent to 5.35p (5p). Earnings per share were
30.09p (19.96p) including exceptional gains, or 21.62p (19.24p) without.
COMMENT
A few years from now, more brewers might look like Whitbread: strong in
briskly growing beers and nimble in pubs and off-licences. Yet Whitbread
needs to learn some of its competitors' tricks. Bass's beer margins are
about 9 1/2 per cent against Whitbread's 6 per cent. Meanwhile, there is
plenty of momentum to push full-year pre-tax profits to about Pounds 260m
before exceptionals for earnings of 39.2p a share and a prospective p/e of
14. This is broadly in line with the sector but a little caution is called
for until Whitbread spells out its beer expansion.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Brockhampton advances to Pounds 3.77m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Brock-hampton Holdings, the parent of Portsmouth Water,
rose from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 3.77m in the six months to September 30,
though it said that the second half might be weaker than the first.
The shares fell 10p to 373p yesterday.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 12.7m), reflecting the 3.4 per
cent overall rise in charges and a one-off increase in measured revenue
arising from the switch to monthly billing of large commercial customers.
The pre-tax figure would have been greater but for the costs of upgrading
computer equipment committed in late-1993 and by a front-loaded mains
renewal programme. The company said this would be less severe in the second
half.
Earnings per share emerged at 31.3p (30.5p) and the interim dividend is held
at 3p.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Property profits help Clyde Blowers to
double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Blowers, the expanding materials handling equipment company, reported
pre-tax profits more than doubled at Pounds 521,000, against Pounds 205,000
in the year to August 31. There were Pounds 603,000 of exceptional profits
this time, against Pounds 515,000.
At the operating level losses were reduced from Pounds 269,000 to Pounds
92,000 on turnover which rose to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 7.4m).
A long-established quoted engineering company, Clyde has been transformed
since Mr James McColl bought 29.9 per cent in 1992 and became executive
chairman.
Its last purchase was Simon-Macawber, a maker of pneumatic pressure and
vacuum conveyancing equipment, in April from Simon Engineering. It now forms
Clyde Pneumatic Conveyancing and accounts for 65 per cent of turnover, which
is expected to reach Pounds 27m in a full year.
The exceptional profits included a gain of Pounds 593,000 on a property sale
and investment income from property of Pounds 120,000.
A final dividend of 3p (2.67p) is proposed making a total of 4.5p (4p) from
earnings per share of 5.98p (4.69p).

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bourne End in US link to buy Pounds 71m
portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourne End Properties has formed a joint venture with the Whitehall Fund, a
US property investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs, to buy a Pounds 71m
portfolio.
The venture will be 25 per cent owned by Bourne End and 75 per cent by
Whitehall, which has assets of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) but only recently
started investing in the UK.
Bourne End is placing 5.4m shares at 74p each to raise Pounds 4m - its
maximum capital commitment under the deal. The rest of the consideration
will be met from equity committed by Whitehall and a Pounds 58.5m term loan.
The portfolio of 45 office and retail properties, mostly located in London
and the south-east, is being acquired from William Pears Group, a privately
owned property investment company.
The properties generate rental income of Pounds 7.2m, suggesting a yield of
about 10 per cent at the acquisition price. Bourne End said it hoped rents
could be increased to Pounds 7.6m within the next year as a result of
reviews and letting of vacant space.
Bourne End will receive 25 per cent of profits and a management fee.
The partners intend to liquidate most of the portfolio over the next three
years. Whitehall's investment style is based on active trading of its
assets, which it typically holds for less than 10 years.
After three years, Whitehall has an option to sell its stake in the joint
venture to Bourne End or buy out the minority interest.
Mr David Roberts, a director of Bourne End, said it had looked at buying
assets from William Pears earlier in the year, but concluded that it needed
a partner.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Advertising revenue aids Grampian TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased advertising revenue and reduced costs helped Grampian Television,
the independent broadcaster for north Scotland, to increase interim pre-tax
profits by 17 per cent from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 1.81m.
An exceptional item of Pounds 340,000 represented Grampian's share of
start-up costs associated with Scot FM, the central Scotland radio station
launched in September.
Mr Calum MacLeod, chairman, said yesterday that other significant
contributions came from the hire of facilities, the news service contract
with GMTV and funding from the Gaelic Television Committee for a range of
programmes.
Sales in the half-year to August 31 rose to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.87m).
Operating expenses took Pounds 7.77m (Pounds 8.16m). The channel 3 licence
payment was Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 360,000).
The increased interim dividend of 2p (1.5p) is designed to reduce the
disparity with the final. Earnings per share came through at 8.8p (7.4p).

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ascot restructures for second time in 18
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ascot Holdings, the property, pubs and hotels group, yesterday unveiled a
second financial restructuring in 18 months as its half-year results showed
negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 25.7m.
The group, formerly known as Control Securities, is to restructure around
Pounds 164m of group debt. This will involve the issue of new shares to
raise Pounds 27.3m, together with the conversion of preference shares, an
offer to bondholders and settlement of claims by Bass, BCCI and Salomon
Brothers.
The effect of the proposals will be to create shareholders' funds of between
Pounds 51.8m and Pounds 61.6m. This represents a pro forma net asset value
of between 188p and 223p per new ordinary share.
More than 27m shares are being placed at 150p, with a 49-for-1000 clawback.
The new shares represent 66.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Existing shareholders will hold a further 13.4 per cent with the remainder
being taken up by shares issued to Bass, BCCI and preference shareholders.
The existing shares are being consolidated on a 100-for-1 basis. The shares
yesterday closed down  1/2 p at 1 1/2 p.
Ascot has also agreed new banking facilities totalling Pounds 71m and a
mezzanine finance agreement worth Pounds 15m.
The board warned shareholders and bondholders that the company faced 'a very
uncertain future' should the proposals be rejected.
The half-year results to the end of September show the group moving from
losses of Pounds 555,000 into profits of Pounds 2.1m. However, operating
profits fell 22 per cent to Pounds 7.78m (Pounds 9.97m). Turnover fell 34
per cent to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 48.9m).
Earnings per share were 0.2p against losses last time of 0.6p.
Ascot's problems first came to light three years ago, when the Serious Fraud
Office investigation into BCCI led to charges against Mr Nazmu Virani, who
subsequently resigned as chairman and chief executive of Control Securities.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: National Power drops to Pounds 211m after
exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity generator, reported pre-tax profits for the
six months to September 30 down from Pounds 256m to Pounds 211m.
However, this included a Pounds 30m exceptional write-off, representing the
premium paid from the redemption of a Pounds 350m debt issue. The 1993
figure was also boosted by a Pounds 45m write-back of provisions.
Before exceptional items profits rose by 14 per cent, from Pounds 211m to
Pounds 241m, on a 7 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.67bn (Pounds
1.56bn).
The company said that continued reductions in staff and maintenance costs
were responsible for the growth despite a continuing decline in market
share.
Increasing competition from the independent power companies and Nuclear
Electric led to a fall in market share from 35 per cent in the year to March
1994, to 32 per cent in the half year.
The dividend is increased by 16 per cent to 4.35p (3.75p), disappointing
some analysts who had seen PowerGen increase its dividend by 27 per cent, on
a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. Earnings per share amounted to 12p
(16.1p).
Increasing revenues came from direct sales to large consumers, which more
than doubled to Pounds 276m. Sales to the regional electricity companies,
via the pool, showed a marginal decline.
The company continued its cut-back programme, reducing staff by 22 per cent
to 5,667 during the past year, and staff costs fell from Pounds 109m to
Pounds 93m.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, expects the head count to fall to 5,200 by
next March. Maintenance costs should also continue to decline, from the
switch towards more modern and efficient power stations.
National Power benefited from a further running down of its coal stocks,
towards a year-end figure of less than 5m tonnes, compared with the current
9m tonnes.
However, there was a 37 per cent increase in depreciation charges to Pounds
132m, following the commissioning of a new gas power station and
de-sulpherisation plant.
Mr Baker reckoned National Power could halve its rail costs for transporting
coal, currently amounting to about Pounds 130m a year. It has invested in
its own locomotive, and has started discussions with Railtrack.
The international operations, in the US and Portugal, contributed Pounds 4m
profit, with Portugal making a maiden contribution.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Black dares Murdoch to end war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph group, yesterday challenged Mr
Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, to end the UK's national
newspaper price-cutting war.
Mr Black, who was in Melbourne for the annual meeting of John Fairfax, a
Daily Telegraph associate company, said: 'He started the war, he can finish
it.'
The Telegraph chairman was speaking as the UK group announced a Pounds 2.6m
operating loss for the third quarter, on turnover of Pounds 53.9m. The
period felt the full effects of the 18p cut in the price of the weekday
Daily Telegraph to 30p to compete against the 20p Times.
The pre-tax profit for the quarter, including interest payments, was Pounds
3.6m, compared with Pounds 10.6m last time.
Mr Stephen Grabiner, managing director of The Telegraph, said yesterday:
'When we made our price cut it was to defend our market position and to try
to grow our young readership. We have done both.'
Circulation had increased by between 90,000 and 100,000 to about 1.08m. The
company said that from April to September readership among 25 to 44
year-olds had increased by 29 per cent on the comparable period. The Times,
now selling more than 614,000, had increased its proportion of older
readers, Mr Grabiner added.
For the first nine months group turnover was Pounds 190.2m (Pounds 188.3m)
and pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 45.2m).
Earnings per share dropped from 22.5p to 17.7p.
The company said yesterday that the third quarter operating loss had been
caused by a redundancy programme.
Newspaper advertising revenue had increased by 12.5 per cent.
'Reasonable levels of operating profitability will be sustainable, even in a
prolonged period of low cover prices,' The Telegraph said. The outlook
remained 'quite positive' helped by support from overseas and associated
companies.
A stake in Carlton Television, the London weekday ITV company, was sold for
Pounds 10m, representing a capital gain of Pounds 6.6m which was not
included in the interim profits.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said yesterday he
had reduced his full-year forecast for The Telegraph by Pounds 4m to Pounds
43.5m.
The share price, which reached a high this year before the price cut of
625p, fell 5p to 337p yesterday.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks carry lower
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Bank, Scotland's third largest clearing bank, increased pre-tax
profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 110.7m in the year to September 30.
The result, another record for the Glasgow-based institution, benefited from
a Pounds 16.8m reduction to Pounds 21.5m in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts.
Operating profit before charging for bad debts was Pounds 132.2m (Pounds
127.6m).
Mr Frank Cicutto, who became chief executive in January on the death of Mr
Charles Love, said corporate lending fell because companies were reducing
borrowing and accelerating repayments.
Mortgage lending increased 14 per cent and now represented 35 per cent of
the total lending.
Yorkshire Bank which, like Clydesdale, is owned by National Australia Bank,
reported a smaller rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 137.3m (Pounds 131.7m),
though it too benefited from a sharp fall in provisions to Pounds 42.6m
(Pounds 68.4m).
Net interest income fell by just over Pounds 20m to Pounds 256.3m, though Mr
Tom Gallagher, chief executive, said this largely reflected a change in
accounting for loans made before 1991. There was, however, a more
encouraging rise in non-interest income to Pounds 122.3m (106.7m).
An increase in operating expenses to Pounds 198.7m (Pounds 182.8m) - mostly
from investment in projects such as moving processing out of branches -
affected Yorkshire's cost-income ratio, but at 52.5 per cent it is still one
of the better examples in the sector.
During the year Clydesdale largely completed a major reorganisation of its
branch network, removing processing work from its 350 branches and creating
three processing centres.
Because of investment in reorganisation, Clydesdale's cost income ratio fell
only marginally from 60.8 per cent to 60.3 per cent, having been 64 per cent
two years ago.
Total assets were Pounds 6.0bn (Pounds 5.56bn).

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BFI increases bid for Attwoods -
Shareholders urged to reject Pounds 391m offer in favour of break-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods yesterday described the increased bid of Pounds 391m from
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US as meagre and cynical, and urged
shareholders to reject the offer in favour of the proposed break-up plan.
BFI has nudged up its offer from 109p per share to 116.75p and declared it
to be final. It has also promised to pay all investors who tender their
holdings the final dividend proposed by Attwoods of 3.25p. The preference
offer has been increased by 7p to 92p.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, said the break-up plan proposed as
the final defence would still return better value to shareholders.
'We will do this by obtaining a full premium for control of three different
businesses,' he said. 'This is in stark contrast to BFI's cynical attempt to
take control of Attwoods at the lowest possible price.'
Attwoods is expected to publish its formal response to BFI's offer next week
and shareholders have until December 2 to decide.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI said the increase would satisfy shareholders' desire
for 'a little bit more'. Investors now had a simple choice: 'Pick the cash
offer or an extended series of hurdles.' Under the break-up plan,
shareholders would have to wait for Attwoods to get through the hurdles
'before they get anything - if they get anything at all.'
The market view in London was that BFI had finely judged the increased
offer. 'I think now it will be an uphill struggle for Attwoods,' said Mr
Nigel Hawkins of Hoare Govett. 'The break-up was very much seen to be a last
card, perhaps too little, too late.'
However, Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of NatWest Securities thought it might
have been too finely tuned. 'If it had been Dollars 10 per ADR it would be
all over,' he said. 'BFI may have misjudged it slightly.'
Institutions, who were last week critical of Attwoods' break-up plan but
still demanding a higher offer, had pressed BFI to alter the bid. They are
thought to have wanted 100 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of German
businesses.
As the offer stands, shareholders - excluding Laidlaw of Canada, which has
agreed to sell its 29.8 per cent to BFI under the original offer terms -
will receive 80 per cent of the German proceeds.
However, it is thought that the Takeover Panel insisted that BFI retain 20
per cent to guarantee that it would seek the best price.
The increased offer and dividend payment represent Dollars 9.44 per American
Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary shares.
Attwoods' shares closed in London down 1p at 118p.

The Bank of Scotland yesterday announced 'at Asprey's request' that the
upmarket jeweller and its management 'enjoy the full confidence and support
of the bank and that the agreed facilities remain fully available to the
company'.
This was in response to a report in the Mail on Sunday that Asprey was in
potential default of the facility and might face receivership. Mr Naim
Attallah, chief executive, said that the bank could not appoint a receiver
anyway as the Pounds 20m loan facility was based on an unsecured pledge.
Yesterday the bank said: 'No event of default has existed at any time during
the currency of the facility; and the management of the company has not
misled or sought to mislead the bank.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Receivers in at Beckenham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers called in yesterday to Beckenham Group, the heating and
ventilation engineer, said the group had outstanding liabilities of about
Pounds 8m. The receivers were appointed by Tapul SA, a Panama-registered
group, which has a 39.8% stake in the group.
The receivers, Mr Peter Spratt and Mr Michael Gercke, both partners at Price
Waterhouse, said the bulk of the liabilities were to trade creditors. The
group's outstanding bank debt was replaced after a rights issue and placing
which was completed in March.
Five of the group's specialist subsidiaries were to continue trading and be
sold as going concerns. Beckenham Ductwork, the ductwork engineer and
contractor which employs 200 of the group's 260 employees, had been put into
receivership.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: DTI looks into fall in Aerostructures
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is looking into the collapse in
Aerostructures Hamble's share price, according to a letter to a Labour MP.
Mr Jonathan Evans, corporate affairs minister, says in the letter that
'officials are currently considering the various press reports and
information available from other sources which might enable them to
determine whether or not further action should be taken.'
Aerostructures was floated at 120p a share in June. Last month it issued a
second profits warning following production difficulties.
The shares, which closed at 26p yesterday, fell to 24p.
Mr John Denham, MP for Southampton Itchen, wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, last month calling for a DTI inquiry into
the flotation of the Southampton aircraft components maker.
Mr Evans' reply said the whole affair raised 'a number of apparently serious
issues - two of which you identify in your letter - and in studying the
available information my officials are taking full account of your, and your
constituents', legitimate concerns.'
Mr Denham's letter said that the company's employees, many of whom live in
his constituency, were worried about the implications of the share collapse
for the future of the company.
They were also concerned that it could happen so soon after the flotation,
which had left several directors with substantial personal profits.
Yesterday Mr Denham said he hoped the DTI would quickly establish whether
there were grounds for further action. While the first concern should be to
see the company build a successful future, legitimate questions had been
raised by the share collapse.
It was 'in everyone's interests to have the matter resolved.'
Aerostructures is still seeking a new chief executive to replace Mr Andy
Barr, who accepted early retirement without compensation.
Mr Barr made Pounds 1.75m from the flotation.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Eurovein priced at 141p gives Pounds 23m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealings in shares of Eurovein, the Sheffield-based specialist engineering
concern, begin next Thursday following the announcement yesterday of listing
particulars for a placing to raise Pounds 13.55m, net of expenses.
The 10.1m new shares being placed with UK institutions, at a price of 141p,
will represent 61.2 per cent of the enlarged share capital, and give
Eurovein a market capitalisation of Pounds 23.2m.
The deal is an encouraging sign of UK institutions' continued interest in
manufacturing, in a market that has not been easy for flotations. Eurovein
has interests ranging from shotblasting equipment to filtration and machine
knives, and operations in the UK, Germany and Italy.
Mr Bill Eastwood, chief executive, said the placing required a lot of work
from brokers Albert E Sharp, but there was no point where it looked to be at
risk. It was also reasonably priced at a multiple of 11 times last year's
pro-forma earnings.
Eurovein had operating profit of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.6m) in the year ended
July 31.
The company, whose businesses represent a reconstituted version of the old
quoted concern WA Tyzack, will use the placing proceeds to reduce
significantly its gearing, and provide the flexibility to enhance some of
its existing businesses through investment or acquisition.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher to dispose of non-core Charlie
Browns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the retailing group encompassing Woolworth, B&amp;Q, Comet and
Superdrug, announced yesterday it had decided to sell Charlie Browns
Autocentres, the automotive repair and aftercare retailer.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher corporate affairs director, said the
announcement was to 'avoid leaks', and the decision was taken because the
business was not core. Kingfisher bought the 42-outlet Charlie Browns chain
in April 1987 and since then had expanded the business to 79 outlets with
turnover of 'just under Pounds 50m'. Mr Whittaker said that when the group
had been asked about Charlie Browns' profits, the answer had always been: 'a
modest contribution'.
Founded in Shipley, West Yorkshire, Charlie Browns is spread across the
north and Midlands.
Mr Whittaker said that in the mid-1980s, Kingfisher had been looking for
out-of-town opportunities along the lines of B&amp;Q. It tried Homecentres for
furniture and Autocentres for motor parts and servicing. Charlie Browns was
bought to bring the servicing expertise necessary. The motor side was
modelled on the The Pep Boys, a US business resembling a blend of Halfords
and Kwik-Fit.
In August, Mr Bill Bailey left B&amp;Q, where he had been carrying out a
strategic review, to head Charlie Browns. He would be advising on the sale,
said Mr Whittaker.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barclays in Pounds 300m preference buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank yesterday became the latest company to reduce excess capital
by announcing that it would buy back Dollars 500m (Pounds 300m) of
non-cumulative preference shares. The move follows Boots' Pounds 500m
buy-back of ordinary shares earlier this week.
Barclays, which has already redeemed Dollars 700m and DM250m (Pounds 100m)
of bonds that formed part of its total capital base, had to gain Bank of
England approval for the preference share redemption because it will cut the
bank's core capital ratio.
The bank has been accumulating capital without a large rise in its assets
because of limited loan demand. It has also just sold its US asset-based
lending operation to Shawmut National Corporation for a premium of Dollars
290m over book value.
The preference share redemption and bond repayments will together reduce its
Pounds 10.5bn of capital by Pounds 879m. It will also match its capital with
assets better in currency terms, since it has been selling retail banking
assets in the US.
The move would have reduced its capital to risk asset ratio at the half-year
to 10.1 per cent rather than 11.1 per cent, while the tier 1 ratio of core
capital to risk-weighted assets would have been 6.6 per cent rather than 7
per cent.
The bank said it would pay a Pounds 17m premium for redeeming the preference
shares. This would be borne in this financial year along with the Pounds 63m
cost of redeeming bonds, and attributable earnings would rise by about
Pounds 30m a year from 1995.
Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director, said that the bank had primarily been
motivated by matching its dollar capital to its dollar assets. 'As we have
run down the US retail business, we have had a surplus dollar capital
position,' he said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Further inflow of capital gives boost to
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flow of extra corporate capital into Lloyd's of London accelerated
yesterday when two new quoted companies announced they had raised a total of
nearly Pounds 40m and a third said it hoped to find Pounds 30m in the next
week.
However, the boost to Lloyd's efforts at increasing corporate investment was
marred by the failure of Wellington Underwriting, whose share placing was
delayed several times, to reach its Pounds 30m target.
Wellington is the first 'dedicated' company - investing only in syndicates
run by one managing agency and, in effect, an embryonic insurance company -
to obtain a UK market listing.
Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of the Wellington managing agency, blamed
the unsettled state of the UK new issues market for disrupting its plans.
But the failure of Lloyd's ruling council to approve new rules on corporate
investors buying shares in each other prevented Wellington raising an extra
Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m.
Wellington managed to raise a total of Pounds 17.25m via a placing,
including contributions from the US and Germany.
The new Lloyd's companies have not been helped by the lacklustre share
performance of similar investment vehicles launched last year.
However, Euclidian, another new quoted company, raised Pounds 20m for a
range of Lloyd's syndicates. Euclidian's attractiveness to investors was
enhanced by an innovative risk-sharing agreement with Centre Re, the Bermuda
reinsurance subsidiary of Zurich Insurance, which will allow Euclidian to
underwrite insurance policies paying premiums of Pounds 80m, four times the
gross capital raised.
Separately, Kiln, one of the largest managing agencies at Lloyd's, launched
a pathfinder prospectus for Kiln Capital, another dedicated company, which
it expects to be listed in London. It plans to raise up to Pounds 30m via a
placing and offer to some Names on Kiln syndicates.
Kiln Capital plans to invest exclusively in Kiln syndicates and hopes to
tempt investors by offering the prospect of higher returns than the market
average. Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams, a Kiln director, said: 'We have been
consistently better in the past and we will try very hard to continue to do
that.'
Head Insurance Investors, an affiliate of John Head, the New York merchant
bank, has agreed to subscribe to about 10 per cent of Kiln Capital ordinary
shares.
Kiln has set next Thursday as impact day with dealings expected to start a
week later.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Hilton clears way for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hilton Hotels, the US hotel and casino group, shot up Dollars 10
to Dollars 67 7/8 yesterday - a gain of more than 17 per cent - after the
company effectively put itself on the market for the second time in five
years.
It said it had engaged Smith Barney, the Wall Street investment bank, to
advise on a number of strategic alternatives including a possible break-up
or sale of the company, a merger with another business, or a share
repurchase programme.
The company said the purpose of the move was to enhance shareholder value,
but would not elaborate further.
Hilton Hotels owns, manages or franchises Hilton hotels in the US, operates
several more hotels overseas under the Conrad name, and has extensive gaming
operations, mostly in Las Vegas. Its market valuation at yesterday's closing
price was Dollars 3.3bn.
The company once operated Hilton hotels around the world, but it sold Hilton
International in 1966. That company is now owned by Ladbroke.
Some 24.5 per cent of Hilton Hotels' stock is controlled by Mr Barron
Hilton, the company's chairman and chief executive. A Hilton family
charitable foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Fund, controls another 8.6 per
cent.
Mr Barron Hilton invited offers for the company in 1989, but a year later he
was forced to take it off the auction block because no serious bidders
emerged.
Recently, Hilton's gaming operations have been suffering from tough
competition in the key Las Vegas market, but the hotel division has been
performing well. Recovery in the US economy has lifted room rates and
occupancy levels, and last month Hilton reported a 32 per cent increase in
net income to Dollars 27m in the third quarter.
Mr David Wolfe, an analyst at Oppenheimer, a Wall Street brokerage, said
Hilton appeared to be taking advantage of an upswing in the hotel industry
to get a fresh valuation on the company. 'The environment for the hotel
industry is such that they can see an opportunity to get a good price for at
least one part of the business,' he said.
Possible buyers could include ITT, US owner of the Sheraton hotel chain, or
and Ladbroke of the UK, because both have been seeking to expand their
gambling interests.

FT  18 NOV 94 / National Power plans buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the UK electricity generating company, is set to soak up
more than Pounds 500m of the government's forthcoming Pounds 2.5bn offer of
the power company's shares through a buy-back plan announced yesterday.
Through the purchase of up to 102.5m shares, National Power aims to use its
enormous cash resources to boost earnings per share. It should also improve
demand for the government share offer. PowerGen, its listed competitor, said
it was considering a similar move, following recent buy-backs on the stock
market.
The UK government is due to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in
both PowerGen and National Power in February. The National Power share
buy-back would represent around 21 per cent of the government offer, and up
to 8 per cent of its issued shares.
The buy-back will come from the 295m shares that the Treasury had ear-marked
for international institutions, but the international tranche should still
amount to close to Pounds 1bn.
National Power said the deal would result in an increase of between 3 and 4
per cent in its earnings per share, and that its dividend would be similarly
increased. It plans to reduce its dividend cover, to allow further dividend
increases.
The company also announced a new Pounds 500m revolving credit facility, and
unveiled significant board changes, including the appointment of Mr Keith
Henry as chief executive.
Its share price rose 7p to 511p yesterday, helped by the announcement of a
14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items to Pounds
241m, and a 16 per cent increase in dividends.
PowerGen, which bought back 0.6 per cent of its shares earlier this year,
said: 'We have had discussions with the Treasury. We are considering the
possibility of further share buy-backs, but we are keeping all our options
open.'
Some institutions complained the share buy-back would be handled via the
government offer, rather than through the stock market.
Tax-exempt shareholders, such as pension fund managers, could claim a tax
credit from the Inland Revenue if they sold their shares to the company
through a buy-back scheme. By purchasing its shares from the Treasury,
National Power has removed that opportunity.
The purchase by National Power is subject to a clawback of up to 19.2m
shares by the government, depending on demand from international
institutions and the 'discretion' of the Treasury.
National Power will pay the same price as international institutions, with a
discount for paying up immediately, rather than in three instalments.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Budge searches for light at the end of the tunnel: RJB
Mining's bid and projections for British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So now we know why RJB Mining was able to offer what seemed so much for the
English mining regions of British Coal.
If the company's projections are correct and it can make Pounds 220m in
pre-tax profits in 1999, as it says it can in papers being shown to
institutions, then its proposed Pounds 914m acquisition may end up looking
rather cheap.
But it is a large if. According to coal and electricity industry executives
and analysts, serious questions also hang over other assumptions which the
company is using to gather support for one of the most audacious bids seen
for some years.
Much is riding on the outcome of the Pounds 1.1bn fund-raising exercise
which RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd have embarked upon. If it fails,
ministers will be forced to look for another buyer among the bidders it
passed over for RJB. The government's already flagging privatisation
programme would also suffer a blow, and the credibility of both BZW and NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised the government on the bids and
their feasibility, would be damaged.
RJB, founded by chief executive Mr Richard Budge, floated on the stock
exchange last year in preparation for the bid. It appears to be confident of
raising the Pounds 425m in equity and Pounds 628m in debt needed to finance
the bid and provide working capital. BZW is said to have conducted more 'due
diligence' on the bid than any other in recent years. There are still many
institutional investors interested in providing funds. 'People want to
invest in coal,' said Mr Charles Kernot, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Nonetheless few institutions, if any, have made commitments. 'I am impressed
by the company's management but the complexity of the bid means I need more
guidance on the numbers,' said one potential investor.
There will be no shortage of that in the next few weeks. At least some of
the advice on offer is likely to be either non-committal or even negative.
'He may be able to make Pounds 220m in 1998 but it looks tight,' says Mr
Kernot.
One of RJB's rival bidders said that if the company was able to make as much
as it projects then it will be the most profitable coal company in the
world, 'certainly more profitable than Hanson's Peabody or RTZ'. This, he
says, is highly optimistic.
From the point of view of potential lenders for the Pounds 628m of debt RJB
wants to raise, the crucial period will be the years before 1998. RJB
predicts that by that time it will have paid off all the bank debt which
amounts to Pounds 528m (the other Pounds 100m will be financed through a
longer term corporate bond).
This provokes differing opinions among rival bidders and analysts. One says
debts will still be high in 1998; another believes borrowings can be
cleared, saying 'key assumptions' in the RJB presentations on both price and
volumes prior to 1998 seem 'eminently feasible' and that sale of stocks,
valued at Pounds 314m, can clear some of the debt.
The key assumptions are, after all, largely predictable. RJB will inherit
contracts to sell 29m tonnes of year to 1998 to the electricity generators
at prices already agreed. It assumes that it can sell around 35m a year
tonnes of coal in the next three years but that includes the domestic and
industrial markets and so seems plausible.
Most coal executives believe that the debt will be successfully raised in
the next few weeks (although there is less of a consensus about whether it
can be paid off by 1998). Placing the shares to raise Pounds 425m may prove
a more critical test as potential investors will focus on the less
predictable years after 1998.
In presentations to potential equity investors, RJB is saying that the
initial dividend yield is expected to be about 4.5 per cent but that there
will be a 'policy of rapid dividend growth with substantial increases
expected after the reduction of debt'.
RJB assumes demand for the coal produced and sold from the regions it is
buying will remain constant at about 34-35m a year for the rest of the
decade.
However the post-1998 difficulties were highlighted yesterday when Mr John
Baker, chief executive of National Power, the UK coal industry's biggest
buyer, said his company would like to buy UK coal but expected that after
1998 volumes would fall and prices become more competitive.
According to most forecasts outside the RJB camp, markets will decline
markedly after 1998. Some executives think RJB will struggle to sell 25m
tonnes a year from the coal regions after 1998.
Intense competition with other producers seems inevitable. That makes the
Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule (at today's prices) assumed for 1998 and 1999 look
optimistic. A more appropriate figure would be Pounds 1.15 or less, say some
forecasts.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Willis Corroon to cut jobs after fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, yesterday launched a sweeping
restructuring of its main businesses, involving substantial job cuts, in an
attempt to correct an 'unsatisfactory' profits performance.
The group said it was making an exceptional charge of Pounds 40m this year
to cover reorganisation and streamlining costs, about half of which may pay
redundancy expenses. The cost of surplus properties leased by the group is
also being written off.
Willis has set a target of reducing costs by at least Pounds 30m a year  -
about 5 per cent of operating expenses - but refused to say how many jobs
might be lost. Willis employs about 11,300 worldwide.
The announcement came as the group reported a fall in pre-tax profits in the
first nine months of 1994 to Pounds 54.4m from Pounds 70.1m. Willis blamed
poor trading conditions but also said expenses in continuing operations had
risen 6 per cent, partly because of the cost of reforming its US
construction operation.
Operating revenues fell to Pounds 549.3m in the first nine months from
Pounds 576.3m. The group will pay a fourth interim dividend of 1.65p in
January.
Willis' shares closed up 8p at 146p with analysts welcoming the group's
decision to make strategic changes.
But there was scepticism that target cost savings could be achieved quickly
and fears about the impact on Willis' staff morale. Profit forecasts for the
full year have been cut to about Pounds 15m.
Willis' restructuring also reflects mounting competitive pressures in
insurance broking as premium rates stabilise or fall and big client
companies move towards managing risks internally or buying fee-based
consultancy rather than commission-based broking services.
Mr Max Taylor, chief operating officer, said: 'There are attractive returns
to be made in the insurance broking business'.
He added that Willis may form an unspecified number of business units
reporting to the board, rather than the current split into a retail broking
network and a specialist insurance and reinsurance operation.
A minor negative impact on Willis' revenues is expected over the next year.

FT  18 NOV 94 / AT&amp;T seeks Groupe Bull stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company, is seeking to participate in the
privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group.
The US group is proposing to ally with Quadral, the holding company which
controls CSEE, the French electronics equipment concern, to take a joint
stake of up to 40 per cent in Bull, according to sources in Paris. Quadral
is expected to be the majority partner in a joint offer.
Unlike previous French privatisations, the sale of Bull will be conducted
through the formation of industry partnerships rather than a public offer.
The French government, which is seeking to reduce its holding in Bull from
76 per cent to below 50 per cent before next spring's presidential
elections, is due to launch a formal tender for stakes in Bull by the end of
the month.
The planned privatisation has already drawn interest from NEC, the Japanese
computer company which holds 4.4 per cent. NEC said last week that it was
planning to increase its participation and is thought to be seeking a 10 per
cent holding.
Industry observers said that the proposal from AT&amp;T and Quadral would be
compatible with the offer from NEC. The US group and its French partner
would seek to expand Bull's activities in systems integration and
information services and to capitalise on the convergence between the
telecoms and computing industries.
It is thought that AT&amp;T, which refused to comment directly on the deal, will
not want to involve itself directly in Bull's computer operations. It said:
'AT&amp;T is very much interested in advancing the openness of
telecommunications markets in general, and in particular in countries such
as France where markets are closed.'
French government officials are pressing the need for industrial partners to
secure the company's position. Bull has incurred losses of more than FFr15bn
(Pounds 1.78bn) over the past three years and has required subsidies of
FFr11bn since the start of 1993.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Brussels tests Britain's power to block foreign takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has turned the tables on Britain's Conservative
government by accusing it of being over-interventionist in its defence of a
controversial piece of legislation framed by the Labour government in 1975.
Brussels has opened proceedings against the UK over part of the 1975
Industry Act - drawn up by Mr Tony Benn, the then Labour industry secretary
 -which allows the government to prevent foreign takeovers of UK
manufacturers.
The commission argues that the provision is incompatible with European Union
rules on the free movement of capital and, even if rarely used, acts as a
deterrent to foreign investment in the UK.
However, the department of trade and industry said yesterday the government
felt there was still a role for the secretary of state for industry to play
'in protecting the national interest'. Clause 13 of the act - much of which
has been repealed by the Conservative government - states that the industry
secretary has the right to prohibit a foreign takeover if it appears that
there is a 'serious and immediate' probability of a change of control which
would be contrary to the interests of the UK.
This goes further than EU laws that allow national governments to intervene
on health and security grounds, and actively breaches rules which foresee no
restrictions on capital movement and direct investment.
The insistence from the commission that the provision be dropped or at least
altered is politically embarrassing for Mr John Major's government which has
frequently harangued the commission for taking an over-interventionist
approach to industrial policy.
'It is really remarkable that this piece of legislation has survived all
these years of Conservative rule,' said a British official in Brussels
yesterday. UK industry officials said the clause had been kept 'just in
case'.
'There has been speculation from time to time about the risk of UK business
falling into foreign hands. The government accepts that the legislation is
otiose, but it may be needed one day,' said an industry official.
The issue of national ownership is politically sensitive, particularly in
the UK. When Rover, the car maker, was acquired by BMW of Germany earlier
this year, there was widespread dismay among the British public.
'This issue has touched a political nerve. A large number of voters feel
rather worried when they see British industry threatened,' said a UK
official.
The DTI said the commission complaint was not directed at the government's
'golden share' holdings in certain companies which limit foreign ownership,
but rather at the general principle of the 1975 law. The official added that
the UK was hoping to come to an 'amicable' agreement with the commission.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Actuaries attack plan on pension solvency standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government efforts to win employers' backing for pension reforms have been
set back by the refusal of actuaries to endorse proposed minimum solvency
standards for pension schemes.
Members of the actuaries' professional body say the latest proposals are so
weak that it would be better to have no minimum requirement at all.
The government had hoped to give greater security to pension scheme members
while not raising employers' costs significantly. Wide-ranging proposals,
including a minimum solvency standard, were put forward by the Goode
Committee, the government's advisory panel, in September last year.
But in recent months there has been pressure from employers to water down an
earlier minimum solvency proposal on the grounds that it would increase
pension costs sharply.
Actuaries, who assess the probability that pension funds will be able to
meet their obligations, say that if the current proposals are enacted, they
will lull scheme members into a false sense of security over whether
promised pensions will be paid.
'This would defeat the purpose of what the solvency standard is trying to
achieve,' said Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon
and Woodrow. 'Minimum solvency would be illusory.'
Following an acrimonious meeting last week of the pensions board of the
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, which sets professional standards, Mr
Paul Thornton, its chairman, wrote to the Department of Social Security to
express unhappiness with the proposals.
Mr Thornton said in his letter that the profession would use the proposed
standard only if ordered to do so by the government. He said yesterday that
while the government proposal was considered by many to be too weak to
really guarantee solvency, 'the political requirement is to deliver a
solvency standard'.
Some actuaries say the proposed minimum solvency standard would force them
to issue a qualified opinion for every pension scheme they certified as
solvent, a move akin to accountants qualifying corporate accounts.
Specifically, schemes will be able to meet the solvency standard by applying
their holdings in equities against their liabilities for pensioners who are
expected to live at least 10 years. Schemes at present count only gilt
holdings against liabilities to current pensioners because only these
securities ensure certainty of income in the short run.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Brittan warns UK over costs of shunning Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government was warned yesterday it could not 'wish away' the
prospect of a single European currency as Sir Leon Brittan delivered a
strong defence of Britain's place in the European Union.
In a carefully-argued lecture in the City dismissing the views of Tory
Eurosceptics and challenging some of the government's assumptions, Sir Leon,
a former Conservative cabinet minister and recently reappointed as Britain's
senior commissioner in Brussels, insisted the balance of costs and benefits
for the UK remained in favour of the EU.
He warned that whether or not the government chose eventually to exercise
its opt-out from the single currency, it must participate actively in
preparations for economic and monetary union.
In a clear challenge to Mr Major's scepticism towards the idea of submerging
sterling into a single currency, Sir Leon said the costs of standing aside
from Emu would be significant.
His speech came as the government confirmed that the first crucial Commons
vote on legislation to allow higher contributions to Brussels would be on
November 28, the day before the Budget.
Mr Major's warning of a general election if the government lost appeared to
have reduced the number of potential Tory rebels to five or six. With rebels
facing possible suspension or expulsion from the parliamentary party, senior
ministers voiced confidence the bill that would be passed intact.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, signalled that he will seek to defeat the
government if there is a real opportunity to force an election. But Labour
would not be drawn into a trap designed to bolster Mr Major's authority.
Sir Leon told his audience that those who thought Emu would not happen
misunderstood the commitment in the rest of Europe.
It was unlikely that a single currency would be created much before the end
of the century. It was clear also it would not include all member states
initially. But 'this does not mean, as some sceptics would have us believe,
that it will not happen at all. Nor does it mean we can sit back and wait
for 1999'.
Delivering the Proudfoot Autumn lecture, Sir Leon stressed that member
states were already working to meet the convergence conditions for Emu laid
down in the Maastricht treaty. The European Monetary Institute, forerunner
of the planned European central bank, and commercial banks were working on
the practicalities of a single currency. And EU governments had begun to
promote convergence of their real economies by promoting supply-side
reforms.
Sir Leon acknowledged that Britain might stay out of the first wave of
countries, but added that the price would once again be exclusion from the
central core of Europe. That would have harsh implications 'not just for our
economy but even for our security'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Sony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 7 per cent fall in Sony's share price in London yesterday is slightly
odd. The Japanese electronics group's problems with its Hollywood movie
studio have hardly been a secret. The massive Y265bn write-off is actually
good news. By cleaning the decks, Sony is signalling its determination to
get a grip on the former Columbia Pictures. The studio's new management
should be able to put an end to the extravagance that led to such
spectacular flops as Last Action Hero. Columbia still enjoys a strong
distribution network and picture library. Its share of US box office takings
has collapsed below 10 per cent but it is hard to see it falling much
further.
There is no denying, though, the disastrous investment Columbia has been for
Sony. The hoped-for synergies between consumer electronics hardware and
software have failed to materialise. The Japanese group has also been the
wrong parent for such a 'talent' business. It rightly recognised it knew
little about the business, but then gave the studio's top management such a
free rein that they lost masses of money. Now it risks keeping such tight
control that it drives the talent away. This is not a feature of Sony's
Japanese nationality: look at General Electric, the US conglomerate, and its
unhappy experience with broker Kidder Peabody.

FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK generators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government initially had qualms over allowing the electricity
generators to buy their own equity as part of its Pounds 4bn share sale next
year. The Treasury feared such a move might compromise its goal of wider
share ownership. But the Treasury's qualms were swept aside once it
appreciated how buy-backs should benefit the exchequer. By cancelling
shares, National Power and, possibly, PowerGen will enhance earnings per
share, so increasing the price the government can demand for its stakes.
That price should be further supported by the fact that there will be fewer
shares flooding the market.
From National Power's perspective, one cannot fault the principle of
reducing its equity. In fact, the company should be spending more than
Pounds 500m-plus to shrink its capital base. After the buy-back, National
Power will still be able to spend Pounds 1bn on overseas investment and keep
its gearing in the 20-30 per cent range. Another quibble is the method it
has chosen. By buying direct from the government, no shareholders will enjoy
a tax break. If instead it had issued a mega-dividend or bought shares
through a tender, some investors would have benefited from the tax credit.
Though the buy-back is positive for National Power, investors should
currently be wary of buying either of the generators' shares. Brokers who
are keen to be part of the Treasury's sale have in recent months been
pumping out fat notes singing the companies' virtues. Such one-way publicity
has arguably already inflated their share prices.

FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At DM136m, Volkswagen's third-quarter after-tax profits were only DM3m
higher than they were in the previous three months. But a pronounced
recovery is nonetheless under way. The DM73m loss in the full nine months
compares with losses of DM1.5bn in the same period last year.
The key to the earnings revival is aggressive cost-cutting, evident in
virtually unchanged production costs and reduced sales and administrative
expenditure. This is impressive when turnover was up 4.1 per cent to
DM58.8bn in the first nine months. But VW still faces a major cost headache.
Analysts predict that even if rationalisation continues at the current pace,
the net profit margin will only reach 2.6 per cent by 1996 - lower than for
other European volume producers and half the level achieved by the big US
manufacturers. The crunch will come when VW renegotiates the four-day
working week which runs out next year. Sharply reduced 'other income'
yesterday suggests that the group has made higher provisions. If these are
used to cut staff aggressively, so much the better.
Shareholders must assume that their interests will always be secondary to
those of the government of Lower Saxony, which, as VW's largest shareholder,
is concerned more with politics than profits. However, even if VW does not
become as lean as its European and US competitors, there is scope for a
strong improvement in profits later in the decade as sales start to climb
rapidly in response to new models and economic recovery. It may be that
earnings per share will recover to more than DM100 at the cyclical peak, in
which case the shares are cheap at yesterday's price of DM455.

FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Budge's bold budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The story being told by RJB Mining as it trawls the City for Pounds 1.1bn to
buy the bulk of British Coal looks starry-eyed. While its version has a
fairy-tale ending, most other scenarios conclude in tears.
For those asked to provide Pounds 528m of bank debt, there are few concerns.
Once RJB has acquired the English coalfields, it will have about Pounds 315m
worth of coal already out of the ground. Moreover, the contracts to supply
power generators should provide sufficient cash to pay off the bulk of the
debt by April 1998 when they expire. Whether RJB has net cash by then
depends on the extent of cost cutting.
But for equity investors, the venture looks fraught with risk. RJB's
forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m in 1999 depend on optimistic
projections for sales volumes and prices - assumptions shared by few others
in the industry. An unlikely combination of events will be required for its
predictions to come true. These include a significant rise in international
coal prices, which admittedly have begun to edge forward for the first time
in a decade; and the willingness of UK power generators to use RJB's coal to
the exclusion of virtually all others. The latter seems improbable, given
their recent investments in importing facilities and stated policy of
diversifying fuel sources. Given the group's low growth prospects post-1998,
and an expected dividend yield of only 4.5 per cent - about the market
average - equity investors will need considerable convincing that buying
into RJB is a risk worth taking.

FT  18 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Dark days for a white knight - Italy's
embattled prime minister takes time out to explain his mission to save Italy
from the left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silvio Berlusconi honours the engagement. Obliged to impose two confidence
votes on his unruly coalition allies this week and facing a second general
strike, the media magnate turned prime minister might have made his excuses.
Instead, with a gaggle of demonstrators outside the Palazzo Chigi, and a
difficult cabinet session inside, Mr Berlusconi takes time out to explain
his role since taking office six months ago.
'I'm the protagonist of a revolution. I have to operate in a completely
different way to my predecessors,' he says. He sees himself not just as an
outsider, but as a man bringing radical and necessary change to Italy.
His election victory in March, just three months after entering politics,
was due largely to the vacuum created by the collapse of Italy's post-war
political structure. And he is determined to distance himself from all that
went before.
'The only good things I inherited,' he says, surveying the antique chairs,
paintings and tapestries in his office, 'are the furniture, the building and
these objects of Italian culture.'
But being prime minister is a lot tougher and more complex than running his
Fininvest business empire, he concedes. 'As a businessman, I was 100 per
cent responsible for all the decisions running Italy's second largest
private conglomerate. Here my role is the exact opposite, because this is a
coalition government. It has to operate through compromise and mediation.'
His main challenge lies in balancing the interests in his rightwing
coalition, while implementing the painful measures needed to correct Italy's
serious fiscal imbalance.
The 1995 budget before parliament involves big cuts in public spending and a
shake-up of the costly state-run pensions system. Mr Berlusconi tried - and
failed - to get the unions' support for this. In the end, he says, he had to
take a tough line and court unpopularity.
'I did not want this head-on confrontation,' he says. But he has little room
for manoeuvre. 'Our proposals on pension reform are the minimum we could do
to convey a strong signal to the financial markets that we are serious about
reducing the ratio of debt to gross domestic product.' On the latest
projections, Italy's huge debt should peak at the equivalent of 126 per cent
of GDP in 1996.
And he refuses to budge on his election promise of tax cuts. Italy needs to
make more people pay their proper share of taxes, he says, rather than tax
more heavily those already paying. He promises to simplify the tax and legal
structure. 'We want to escape from the jungle of incomprehensible
legislation that surrounds us.'
He also wants to slim down government and review every department to see
what can be best handled by private enterprise. The question is whether he
will be around long enough to see through such changes. 'I don't know,' he
says disarmingly.
He hopes the main coalition partners - his Forza Italia movement, the
populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance - will stay together over the next crucial weeks. But
once the budget is approved, which must be by the end of the year, all the
coalition partners will have to show where their real loyalties lie and
account for the discipline of their members of parliament. He hints that, if
the coalition lacks sufficient purpose to allow him to pursue his agenda, he
would seek a fresh mandate.
Mr Berlusconi is convinced most voters are moderate. But he also believes
that the 35 per cent of the electorate on the left represent a real threat
to Italy's future. He complains that people outside Italy do not understand
this. 'Abroad, they talk about the MSI/National Alliance as something
negative; but the real danger is the contrary.'
He explains his willingness to forego his business career in favour of
politics exclusively in this context. 'You've got to understand the left had
already placed its supporters in key positions in universities, publishing
houses, radio networks, TV stations and the courts. And they had the
organisation to bring people onto the streets . . . Everything was ready for
a leftwing minority to take power.'
'I'm convinced if the left had won the elections, Italy had a future without
either freedom or prosperity.' For him, the fall of the Berlin Wall made no
difference to the power or designs of the left in Italy.
While Berlusconi sees himself as a white knight rescuing Italy from the
left's embrace, others are less charitable about his entry into politics.
Questions are still asked about the conflict between his interests as a
businessman and his role as a political leader. Apart from a substantial
presence in publishing, financial services and retailing, his Fininvest
empire owns three commercial television channels accounting for nearly half
the nation's TV audience.
He spells out that since entering politics, he has resigned from all
directorships and executive responsibilities. He has also appointed a
three-man commission to draft legislation to prevent a conflict of interest
 -and accepted its findings 'without changing a comma'.
In addition, there are numerous checks and balances in Italy's parliamentary
democracy to monitor his behaviour, he says, not least of which is public
opinion. Finally he turns the argument on its head: 'The real point of the
conflict of interest debate is that my companies have suffered from me
becoming a politician rather than the other way around. As a result of
entering politics, I have suffered both from a personal and an
entrepreneurial point of view.'
The Fininvest group, he says, has not been able to take advertising from
state bodies. With some bitterness he comments on the way his enemies have
planted 30 bombs at his Standa stores since he took office. Standa sales
this year are down 10 per cent as a result of a boycott organised by his
opponents.
He says he is willing to sell all his assets. But having built up the group
from scratch over the past 20 years, he does not seem yet to have resolved a
profound personal dilemma over whether or not to let go of his own baby. He
will not be a forced seller, he emphasises: 'That would be unconstitutional,
going against the basic right of private property.'
And he lets slip the thought that Italian prime ministers are not elected
for a fixed term. The implication is clear: he is heading Italy's 53rd
post-war government and he does not know when he may need to look for
another job.
The Fininvest link continues to cause speculation of a different kind:
whether Italy's anti-corruption magistrates, who are investigating various
aspects of his business empire, will eventually reach to the top. 'On this
front I have always been tranquil. Otherwise, I would never have entered
politics because I knew thousands of spotlights would be immediately turned
onto my activities. For example there have been 126 searches by the police
in the last few months, compared to less than 100 in the previous 10 years.'
In an unstable political environment, Mr Berlusconi will not be drawn on the
chances of his government's survival. The decisive moment will come once the
budget has been passed. The crucial element will then be his stormy
relationship with Mr Bossi of the League. Having fought with each other from
the beginning of the administration, the question is whether the prime
minister can sideline Mr Bossi without falling too much into the right's
hands.
Mr Berlusconi is not yet at the eye of the storm. He ends the interview to
rejoin the cabinet, for what turns out to be one of the stormiest sessions
of his administration.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Britain, France and Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence and security issues are expected to dominate today's Franco-British
summit in Chartres. During the later decades of the cold war those issues
divided the two countries, as France was outside Nato while Britain was its
most unconditionally loyal member. But as the cold war fades, they find that
this is the area where they have most in common. They are the two countries
in western Europe for which military power has retained some of its old
glamour, and some of its old relevance as a means of defending national
interests far beyond the national territory.
This gives them a stronger attachment to the tradition of national
sovereignty than is felt by some of their European partners, and therefore
makes them - or at any rate makes the conservatives now in power in both
countries - more suspicious of supranational European blueprints. It also
makes them more sensitive to the implications of the US's diminishing
commitment to European security and transatlantic co-operation, symbolised
most recently and graphically by its unilateral decision to stop enforcing
the Bosnian arms embargo.
The French reaction has an element of 'I told you so', since France has been
warning since the days of Charles de Gaulle that 'a European Europe' should
aspire to be independent of US tutelage. On the British side there is more
sorrow than anger, but the practical conclusions are beginning to converge.
Present in the minds of both sides, if usually unspoken, is the thought that
for military purposes it is vital to canalise German political resurgence
into a strong multilateral vessel. The less credible Nato looks, the
stronger the argument for making that vessel a European one.
These thoughts point to two types of co-operation. One is a closer bilateral
liaison between the two countries' armed forces, at this stage especially
their airforces, and, where economically efficient, between their defence
industries. The other is a joint initiative for the 1996 intergovernmental
conference, aimed at strengthening the EU's 'defence component', the Western
European Union.
Both types of co-operation have their logic, but they need to be carefully
related to each other. The proliferation of ad hoc bilateral or even
multilateral military arrangements involving different combinations of EU
members could easily become an obstacle to a coherent common defence for the
Union as a whole. It would make better sense if the Franco-German Eurocorps
as well as the proposed Franco-British air planning unit were brought within
the WEU structure.
It must also be questioned how credible the WEU will be so long as it
depends on American logistical and air support and intelligence assets. To
make Europe independent in these respects would be expensive, but military
credibility is seldom cheap.
Also essential is a competitive internal market for defence contracts. For
the French, the immediate test of the UK's commitment will be its
willingness to join in building the Future Large Aircraft. This should be
considered sympathetically, but chosen only if the cost is not prohibitive.
In the longer term, Britain's ability to take the lead in a common defence
will also be related to its willingness to join in other aspects of European
integration. Among these, Sir Leon Brittan argued last night, the creation
of a single currency at the end of the century remains all but certain. If
he is right, France and Germany may be unwilling to entrust a leading role
in their defence to a country perceived to be on the fringes of their
economic union.

Rather than political power, it seems German-born Henry Kissinger really
hankered after fame as a sports commentator: 'I always wanted to be a
sportscaster, but I just couldn't lose this New York accent,' he says in a
new advertisement for the New York Times. Perennial presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson says he takes the paper for its real estate; he's hunting for
'a big white house with pillars' on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
And Bill Clinton? No news as yet. But maybe he takes it for its job
vacancies.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Lowry collected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be a sigh of relief at London's Tate Gallery that New York's
Museum of Modern Art has finally found a new director - Glenn Lowry, the
40-year-old director of the Art Gallery of Ontario. It would have been a big
blow for the Tate if the Americans had poached Nicholas Serota, its
ambitious director.
Finding a replacement for Richard Oldenburg, who has been Moma's director
for the past 22 years, has not been easy. It is well over a year since the
New Yorkers started searching and Lowry, an expert in Islamic and Oriental
art, is not the most obvious choice to run a gallery specialising in modern
art. His appointment is another sign of the developing world shortage in
good international museum directors. Finding a top scholar who can turn a
hand equally well to administering and fund-raising is becoming even more
tricky than landing a rare collection these days.

Jonathan Aitken, the UK Treasury's chief secretary, is clearly jinxed when
it comes to written correspondence. For months he has been exchanging
letters with The Guardian newspaper over payment of a Paris hotel bill of
his.
Now he has sent a letter congratulating George Robertson, Labour's shadow
Scottish secretary, on a 'bravura' Commons speech on Wednesday. Aitken's
letter - which opened 'Dear George' - praised Robertson's 'stylish, amusing'
contribution, and forecast rapid promotion.
Unfortunately, the speech Aitken praised was made by Raymond Robertson, Tory
MP for Aberdeen South. Confusion reigns: Aitken even put Monday's date on
the letter, suggesting it was written before the speech.

<TEXT>
Is he going or staying? Mario Campora, that is - Argentina's ambassador to
London. It seems he may have lost his job for disagreeing with his
president, Carlos Menem, over Menem's offer of cash to the Falkland Islands'
2,000 or so inhabitants to up sticks and leave.
Yesterday Campora was still following his timetable and lunched with City
bankers. Meanwhile back in Buenos Aires rumours were flying, suggesting he
was in trouble for pouring cold water on the idea. Campora suggests it's
daft to pay for something over which Argentina already claims sovereignty.
Sound reasoning.
Interestingly enough, senator Eduardo Menem, the president's brother, shares
Campora's opinions on this issue. When in London two weeks ago, Eduardo said
that offering money for the Falklands cheapens Argentina's claim.
Nevertheless, a presidential aide said yesterday - 'unofficially' - that
Campora may be packing his bags to become ambassador in Paris. Which is
hardly Tierra del Fuego, after all.

Will Peter Ruff, the BBC's man in Moscow in the mid-1980s, come in from the
cold? Ruff, who seems to have lost his way a bit since he quit the BBC three
years ago - he popped up briefly at the Chemical Industries Association - is
in the running to take over from Tim Collins, director of communications for
the Conservative party.
Collins wants to be an MP and is expected to have cleared his desk before
the end of the year. The Tories seem to go through their spin-doctors faster
than their party chairmen. The last BBC man in the job was Shaun Woodward,
an ex-Panorama producer, who came and went with little impact.
Ruff is clearly a strong candidate: covering a totalitarian state on its
last legs sounds the right sort of preparation.

What a gift to headline writers - Albert Reynolds gives up being Taoiseach.
If there hasn't been an 'Irish PM goes (back) to the dogs' it will be a
miracle.
For Reynolds has earned millions by serving up minced animal remains to
Irish and British moggies and doggies. Reynolds, who turned 61 on November
3, established his family company, CD Petfoods, in the early 1970s. Now run
by his son, Philip, it churns out Maxi catfood and Max dogfood, the latter
supposedly named after the Special Branch minder of Charles Haughey, whom
Reynolds toppled from the leadership of the Fianna Fail party three years
ago.
If he gives up politics - a fair bet according to Dublin observers -
Reynolds could always dust off his cv, with experience as building site
messenger, cabinet polisher and railway ticket clerk.
Ballroom dancing has pretty much died in the rave culture, otherwise he
could resurrect his Ballroom of Romance company, started in 1958 to enable
youngsters to two-step the night away in teetotal harmony. There again, he
could always work for his nephew, who runs one of Dublin's premier
nightspots, The Pod.
But his own choice might be to take up professional crooning, singing his
beloved country and western songs. He once appeared on Irish TV dressed in
cowboy gear and stetson hat, and has publicly delivered the immortal Jim
Reeves number He'll Have To Go. Maybe he could take up astrology?

FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Hollywood woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the predictability of a Hollywood plot, the Japanese invasion of US
film-making five years ago is now generating pages of red ink. Yesterday,
Sony Corporation announced that writedowns of Y265.2bn (Dollars 2.7bn) at
its Columbia Pictures subsidiary, acquired five years ago for Dollars 3.4bn,
would pull the whole group into loss for this financial year.
The announcement raises several questions of strategy, pertinent also to
Matsushita's Dollars 6.1bn takeover of MCA, owner of Universal Pictures.
First, how does the principle of integrating technology and programming look
now? The trigger for Sony's move into programming was the battle over
standards for videocassette recorders. Sony's Betamax format, arguably
technically superior, lost to VHS for lack of available programming. Sony
learnt, painfully, that customers watch programmes not technology, and
concluded that it must buy a studio to safeguard new products.
The conclusion was wrong, however. Although Sony argues that sales of its
new MiniDisc portable audio products have been aided by its ownership of CBS
records, ensuring that recordings are available to play on them, there are
few other examples to support its case. The flaw in the reasoning is that no
company has a large enough share of the music or video markets to launch a
new consumer product; Sony Pictures, which includes Columbia, has only 10
per cent of the US box office.
If vertical integration is worthless, can Japanese management add value to a
Hollywood studio? The quick answer, judging by the bottom line, is no.
Moreover, there are good reasons for longer-term scepticism, given the
culture clashes between technology and programming companies, and between
Japanese hierarchies and Hollywood egos.
Assessed, then, simply as an investment in programming, how does the deal
look now? Too expensive, clearly. But there is some consolation in that
Columbia's value may now rise, as the explosion of channels and services in
the US and Europe is increasing demand for programming.
Should Sony and Matsushita take advantage of the media revolution by an
alternative strategy: buying channels to distribute the programmes? Both
have invested recently in cable and satellite. The value of those link-ups
can be questioned, but they are more promising than a marriage of technology
and programming.
No such strategy will be successful, however, if the programmes are not
popular enough. Of all the messages in Sony's statement, that is the
loudest.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Personal View: Time to adjust our sets again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK broadcasting in the 1990s was to be about competition, choice and
quality, according to the government which put this trinity on the cover of
a white paper published six years ago this month. Almost half way through
the decade, what do we think of it so far?
There is certainly more competition, most notably in the sale of advertising
between ITV and Channel 4, but the firm grip of the BBC/ITV duopoly is far
from broken.
A fifth terrestrial channel was conceived in 1990 as the single most
important initiative the government could take to introduce market
disciplines. But arguably the only competition Channel 5 has created to date
is between the departments of national heritage and trade and industry over
what to do with it. The contrast with the carefully-considered and
well-timed introduction of Channel 4 is stark.
As for choice, the continued absence of Channel 5 means that 85 per cent of
UK viewers still have only four channels. The 15 per cent who enjoy cable
and satellite would have done so with or without a Broadcasting Act in 1990.
On ITV, it seems that most viewers, advertisers and the Independent
Television Commission, the channel's watchdog, would agree that, despite its
strong popular drama, the channel has become less diverse - longer series in
fewer genres, no single plays, less investigative reporting, and so on.
Was it really for this that Britain's television industry had to endure the
trauma and disruption of the 1990 Broadcasting Act that followed the white
paper? It looks scant reward for the thousands of jobs lost, businesses
broken up and training schemes closed down.
If the outcome has short-changed viewers and set back the global prospects
of what should be a leading British industry, can anyone honestly be
surprised? The main beneficiary of the 1990 Act has been the Treasury, which
has cleaned up like some great croupier in Whitehall. It raked in almost
Pounds 360m in 1993 as rent on the ITV franchises - roughly 25 per cent of
ITV's 1993 revenues, and equivalent to 75 per cent of the industry's annual
pre-tax profits after bid payments. It should do even better this year. No
wonder ITV companies put shareholders second and viewers third.
Some advocate a fresh Broadcasting Act to undo the damage. Others want
another auction of ITV franchises in 1998, to replace the existing
arrangements that will allow current licensees to negotiate 10-year
extensions.
I do not share these views. What is done is done. It would have been better
in 1989 if the government had introduced a modest Bill and then left the
competent regulatory authorities to get on with the job, but it did not and
the industry has moved on. What I would now like to see, with one exception,
is pragmatic regulatory change rather than new legislation.
There is a need, for example, to protect the five regional stations, from
Channel to Grampian, following the government's decision to relax
unilaterally the rules on mergers between ITV stations. No such protection
is afforded by the Broadcasting Act and they may soon be required by the
larger companies to contribute to network costs in proportion to their share
of advertising revenue. I doubt any of these small broadcasters would then
be viable, and the regulator needs to be free to make arrangements to ensure
the survival of diverse services.
The one exception needing legislative change is the widely discredited
ownership rules in the 1990 Broadcasting Act that are unnecessarily
restricting British investment at home and discouraging UK multi-media
companies from competing in world markets.
A large number of interested parties is seeking significant legislative
changes that can affect readers, viewers and listeners nationwide. The
Department of National Heritage has already canvassed views and should share
its findings soon.
The key may be to frame cross-media ownership rules that recognise that UK
markets consist of many audiences by type and location. These audiences
could then be assessed for the influence upon them of various media, with
appropriate and more liberal thresholds being applied to ensure that they
are offered adequate choice.
Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, should publish a white paper
in the new year, legislate as soon as possible - and then leave the
broadcasters and regulators to go in search of the competition, choice and
quality that the 1990s were supposed to be about.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Ukrainian virtue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ukrainian parliament made the world a safer place this week, by
endorsing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Kiev's decision to renounce
nuclear weapons categorically is further proof that Ukraine sees economic
reform - rather than nuclear stockpiles - as its best guarantee of enduring
independence. When President Leonid Kuchma visits Washington next week it
will be America's turn to return the favour by giving Ukraine appropriate
financial assistance.
Although parliament voted for the treaty by an overwhelming margin, it was
not an easy decision. Mr Kuchma himself has undergone a remarkable
metamorphosis: the former director of the Soviet Union's largest nuclear
missile factory gave the keynote address which secured the parliamentary
endorsement.
Mr Kuchma's change of heart is directly connected to his decision earlier
this year to implement a radical reform programme. Ukraine's leaders have
belatedly realised that nationalist rhetoric is too weak a glue to hold
together a fragile new state.
On the strength of its reform plan, Ukraine last month concluded its first
deal with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Kuchma has begun to prove he
is in earnest by administering some of the most unpopular measures demanded
by that deal: price increases, exchange rate unification and land
privatisation.
Renouncing nuclear weapons was the logical next step. As Mr Kuchma told
parliamentarians, it is another sign that Ukraine is choosing to forgo what
he described as the 'illusion' of security offered by nuclear weapons in
favour of the more lasting stability which only economic prosperity can
bring.
Of course, ratification of the treaty also means that Mr Kuchma will be
bringing the White House the best news it has had all month. President Bill
Clinton, who orchestrated the agreement earlier this year in which Kiev
first promised to give up nuclear weapons, can now claim credit for
disarming Ukraine. Ukraine's accession also improves the chances of an
indefinite extension of the treaty next year.
Yet Mr Clinton should not forget about Kiev, now that the worrying prospect
of a nuclear Ukraine has disappeared. By endorsing the treaty, Ukraine has
given up its most powerful bargaining chip. Mr Kuchma is gambling his
country's survival on successful economic reforms. The west should do
everything in its power to improve his odds. Right now that means offering
Ukraine substantial financial aid.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Pinch on pay: Robert Taylor says the stability in UK wage
levels may not last
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's batch of labour market statistics suggests the British economy
may finally be achieving what most postwar governments have yearned for -
sustained growth with falling unemployment, low inflation and above all
relatively modest pay rises.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, was quick to point out the
benefits of moderation in pay: 'Provided companies keep a firm grip on wage
costs at all levels, economic growth will continue to feed through into jobs
as well as rising prosperity.'
However, while pay settlements are stable and there are few signs of
industrial unrest, pressures for higher pay may be building up in the labour
market over the coming year.
So far, there has been no steep upsurge in the level of wage settlements as
the economy has revived. Annual earnings growth stood at 3.9 per cent in
September. The underlying annual growth in manufacturing pay is now running
at 4.5 per cent, nearly twice the inflation rate. However, this is only a
quarter of a percentage point higher than at the same time last year, even
though the recovery is now much further advanced.
Manufacturing productivity is rising at an annual rate of 6 per cent,
impressive by recent British standards. This has meant falling unit labour
costs in manufacturing, where wages and salaries per unit of output were 1.4
per cent less over the three months ending in September compared with the
same period last year.
This is the greatest improvement since the current Department of Employment
unit labour cost records began in 1970. It appears to mark a break from the
past, when gains in productivity were outpaced by pay increases.
In spite of the modest pay settlements, there are no signs of widespread
industrial unrest. In September, just 17,000 days were lost in just 13
strikes involving 8,000 workers, the lowest since the government started
collecting figures. The sporadic disruption by rail signalling staff this
summer does not appear to have sparked a wider strike-wave.
The Engineering Employers' Federation is confident that there will be no pay
escalation in manufacturing in the immediate future. Independent forecasters
such as Incomes Data Services expect settlements to remain stable, though
slightly above the inflation rate.
Even in the public sector, where the government has imposed a three-year
freeze on the pay bill, there is apparent calm. Threats of resistance from
the public service sector unions appear to have ebbed.
What there has been is a loss of more than 420,000 public sector jobs in the
first 18 months of the freeze, which have helped to fund pay increases.
Public sector pay has therefore risen in line with wages in the private
sector without any increase in the total pay bill.
Yet despite this apparent stability and self-restraint on pay, there remain
worries about future trends.
Mr Howard Davies, director- general of the Confederation of British
Industry, continues to warn employers about the need to rein back what he
sees as 'upward creep' in pay settlements. He points out that German and US
unit labour costs have fallen even more than the UK's in recent months,
while British productivity remains well below the country's main
competitors.
There are also concerns - expressed at this month's CBI conference by its
president, Sir Bryan Nicholson - that high pay rises for top executives
unrelated to company performance may stoke up pay demands from the rest of
the workforce, as the gap widens between the top and lower ends of the
earnings ladder.
Some pay negotiations this autumn have aroused fears of an upward trend in
settlements. In September, Rover group car workers only narrowly accepted a
two-year wage deal worth 10.7 per cent. Talks are continuing at Jaguar,
where workers have rejected a 7.5 per cent pay package recommended by their
union negotiators.
In both cases, shopfloor workers said they were less concerned with the pay
offer than the changes being demanded of them in longer hours of work.
'There are signs that workers elsewhere are less willing to accept workplace
restructuring unless it is rewarded by higher pay,' says Mr Alistair
Hatchett, editor of Incomes Data Report.
Changes in the workplace have also made it harder to read pay trends. The
demise of national or industry-wide pay bargaining in recent years and the
government's active encouragement of decentralisation and
performance-related pay in the public sector mean that wage bargaining is
increasingly carried out at local level.
This makes it more difficult to generalise about what is happening to pay
levels across the country. But it may also be storing up discontent for the
future if some groups are doing better than others because of local
conditions. 'In the past people felt their pay was related to a concept of
what was fair. National agreements reflected that feeling,' says Mr Chris
Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation. 'Now on pay
they are finding themselves very much out on their own.'
Mr Hatchett says there is 'immense frustration' among employees over pay at
the moment. This view is reinforced by the latest British Social Attitudes
Survey, published this week, which reveals an anxious workforce increasingly
concerned about widening pay differentials, matched by fears about job
security.
It may be premature to conclude the UK economy is free at last from pay-push
inflation and the concept of the going-rate. Wage expectations are less
ambitious than they used to be, perhaps because for the time being most
workers seem more concerned with their job security than big pay rises.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: View on Apec is a classic example of
'Eurocentrism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD GILLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I suspect that your leader, 'Apec and Europe' (November 16), will have
engendered a considerable amount of mirth among businesses and governments
in Asia and the Pacific. After claiming rather patronisingly that 'any kind
of discriminatory arrangement within so large a part of the world's economy
would be undesirable', you suggest that 'Apec should be a catalyst for
global negotiations and neither a substitute for such negotiations, nor an
independent forum'. Good heavens, no.
After all, you then add 'the only outside entity capable of insisting upon
this is the EU', and we all know how deeply the EU is committed to free
trade: ask the Cairns group.
Your leader is a classic example of what we poor countries in Asia and the
Pacific sometimes call 'Eurocentrism'. Dr Mahathir, prime minister of
Malaysia, is trying to make a point, you know; perhaps one day you will
understand it.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Different aims, common cause: Complex pressures led 18
Asian-Pacific countries to form the Apec trading bloc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago the Seattle summit, this week the Jakarta summit, and now a big
bang: all trade and investment is to be liberalised in a region accounting
for half the world's economic activity.
It is little wonder the 18 leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum felt exhilarated.
The final statement required a consensus across enormous political and
economic diversity, between countries with some seriously strained
relations. Ranging from the US and Japan, two of the world's richest
economies, to China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, with among the lowest
per capita incomes, Apec's members have reached agreement at remarkable
speed.
Their differences, and the extended timetable envisaged for liberalisation,
raise questions about whether the plan can ever be fully realised. It calls
for Apec's industrialised members to remove their trade and investment
barriers by 2010, and for developing economies to do so by 2020. By then,
most of the leaders who met in Jakarta will be long out of office, forgotten
or dead.
However, the importance of this week's decision lies less in the long-range
targets that it set than in the commitment of Apec leaders to a continuing
process of high-level negotiation. By calling for a detailed blueprint for
regional liberalisation before their next summit, in Osaka a year from now,
they have obliged themselves to produce at least some tangible short-term
results or risk loss of political face.
That they have got this far is due to the convergence of a complex set of
domestic and external pressures. Last year's Seattle summit was prompted by
a common desire to kick-start the Uruguay Round negotiations, which were
then stalled. Many Apec members believe that, by presenting a united front
in Seattle and hinting that the grouping could become an alternative to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the round failed, they prodded the
EU into making the concessions needed to conclude the world trade talks.
Beyond that, the 18 governments' motives differ. The US views Apec primarily
as a tool for prising open fast-growing Asian markets and for pressing
Europe into further trade concessions. Australia broadly shares these
objectives and also sees the grouping as a way to prevent economic isolation
by establishing itself as part of the Asian region.
But for Japan and many other Asian countries, the main purpose of Apec is to
guarantee their access to the US market. They hope the grouping will keep US
trade policy engaged internationally, at a time when Washington's commitment
to multilateralism appears increasingly ambivalent. China, meanwhile,
believes that Apec membership will help buttress its bid to join the new
World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt in January.
Satisfying these disparate aims may not be easy in a grouping that prides
itself on operating by consensus and is keen to avoid institutionalised
decision-making. That consensus has already been strained by the evident
reluctance with which Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister and
long a sceptic about Apec's ambitions, went along with this week's summit
declaration.
How deep the 18 countries' differences run may become clear soon, when they
start trying to hammer out a trade liberalisation programme. They face a
daunting set of challenges. There is no agreement yet even on how far the
plan should cover services as well as goods. Nor is there any decision on
how to tackle agriculture, a sector that is highly protected and politically
sensitive in much of Asia. Equally uncertain is whether the US will consent
to curbs on its increasingly frequent use of anti-dumping measures against
low-priced imports, most of them from Asia.
The crunch question, though, is how far the benefits of freer trade within
Apec should be extended to the rest of the world. This week's summit firmly
rejected any move towards an inward-looking trading bloc. It declared that
the removal of barriers in the region should be fully consistent with Gatt
principles and designed to strengthen the multilateral trade system. The
implication, to which most Apec members subscribe, is that the goal should
be to achieve enough progress to trigger another Gatt world trade
negotiating round.
Views diverge widely, however, on how this objective should be achieved  -
and, by extension, on what sort of creature Apec should aim to become. The
US, and to some extent Australia, believe Apec should offer the benefits of
its planned liberalisation to non-members only if they first agree to
reciprocate by opening their own markets further.
In Washington's case, this view is heavily coloured by domestic politics.
The timetable agreed this week would oblige the US to remove barriers to
imports from China and other developing countries 10 years before they
opened their markets fully to US exports. The belief is that Congress would
approve such a deal only if Apec also promised to help the US extract bigger
trade concessions from other trading partners, notably in Europe.
However, such an approach could accentuate concerns that the US will use
Apec to narrow further national interests. Though fears of US domination are
voiced openly only by Dr Mahathir, they are shared privately by countries
such as Japan and China. Both have already been targets of increasingly
aggressive US trade diplomacy, backed by the threat of unilateral trade
sanctions.
As a result, many Asian members are anxious to keep Apec as open as possible
to the rest of the world and to ensure that it does not undermine the
pre-eminence of the Gatt and the WTO. Indeed, Thailand argues that the
grouping's priority should be simply to build support for another Gatt
round, after which it should take a back-seat role.
For all these reasons, there seems little immediate likelihood that Apec
will develop into a bloc that is bent on putting its members' interests
above those of the world economy as a whole. The prognosis could change
quickly, though, if the US Congress failed to ratify the Uruguay Round in a
fortnight's time. In that event, the risk of indefinite further delays and
uncertainties about the future of the Gatt could induce some Apec countries
to look again at the grouping as an alternative to the multilateral trade
system.
But even if that does not happen, Apec's leaders will remain under pressure
to keep up the momentum generated by this week's summit. Though success is
far from guaranteed, so much political prestige has been invested in the
enterprise that the fall-out from outright failure would spread right
through the Pacific rim region, and quite probably beyond. If only for
reasons of self-esteem, that is a risk none of the leaders can contemplate
with equanimity.

<TEXT>
Sir, In his interesting review of Failure in British Government: The
Politics of the Poll Tax (November 17), my former cabinet colleague, Kenneth
Baker, writes: 'The Treasury was not helpful: Nigel Lawson, then chancellor,
opposed the poll tax but was not prepared to block it.'
As I recount in my memoirs, I did everything I could to stop the poll tax.
However, the novel constitutional doctrine that chancellors have it in their
power to 'block' a proposal which has the enthusiastic backing of the prime
minister, supported by an overwhelming majority of his or her cabinet
colleagues, is (perhaps regrettably) un-founded.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a convincing argument on nuclear
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN OTRANTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles's article 'Particle of hope' (November 11) speculates
unconvincingly on the privatisation of Britain's nuclear industry; it simply
lacks the backing of logic and current trends to support it.
For nearly five years the order to privatise electricity production has been
viewed as the coup de grace for British nuclear ambitions. But in fact
nuclear power from its origin has never really been economically
competitive, democratically supported or environmentally acceptable. Its
toxic waste problems, after half a century, remain unmanageable; its market
share is being overtaken by sustainable energy technologies, while its
deeply damaging effects are beginning to unfold.
Hope for the people of Britain lies not in the conjecture that anachronistic
nuclear power will survive but in developing affordable, benign, renewable
energy. John Otranto,

FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statistics burden is no greater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A H COWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Carole Macpherson (Letters, November 15) claims that the Intrastat
system for the collection of European Union trade statistics is a greater
burden on business than the old system which operated prior to completion of
the single market. We do not believe this is the case.
Under the old system customs declarations had to be made in respect of each
consignment. Most businesses employed agents to submit these declarations.
The agents, of course, charged for providing this service.
An indication of the scale of the activity is that 7m import and export
declarations a year were abolished with the advent of the single market.
Under the new system only larger businesses, some 30,000 out of the 150,000
companies engaged in EU trade, have to complete the Intrastat declarations,
which are considerably less detailed than the previous import declaration
and only have to be submitted once a month.
However, most businesses involved in the new system have chosen to complete
the Intrastat forms themselves.
Ms Macpherson is correct in pointing out that there were start-up costs to
be borne by bringing this work in-house. However, the analysis of costs that
we conducted, in consultation with business before introduction of the new
single market and subsequently revalidated, showed these initial costs
rapidly being converted into a continuing annual saving.
Finally, we have followed a policy of a 'light touch' on enforcement while
the new system has bedded in, but we believe the contribution of those who
have made an effort to comply with the new system would be devalued if we
were not to pursue the non-compliants, now less than 1 per cent of the
total.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A delightful view of Lear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KUMON TOKUMARU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your review of The Tale of Lear by the Suzuki Company of Toga (Arts:
'Suzuki's austere 'Tale of Lear' ', November 11) reminded me of the analogy
of the father meeting his daughter's fiance for the first time: regardless
of how perfect this fiance is, the father automatically dismisses him
without reason.
Suzuki's version of King Lear was thoroughly accepted and applauded by the
UK audience, the home country of Shakespeare, but was summarily rejected by
critics without any logical argument.
Suzuki has interpreted the original text as the madness of aged men and
projected it on to the Japanese spiritual world using well-trained
Suzuki-method actors. As a Japanese, I appreciated this production, because
it did not cheaply sell exoticism to the western audience. In fact, I felt
nostalgic, a kind of comfort, as though the story was derived from our
traditional tales, or as if it were Japanese Samurai drama produced for a
Japanese audience. Therefore, it is natural that some British people could
have felt alienated or deprived by this performance.
But please do not deny the possibility that Shakespeare can be interpreted
and performed in a 'different' cultural context, 'different' that is to you.
For me, Suzuki's success was a delight. The production was evidence that we
could establish a common world culture, a culture that can be shared by any
ethnic group and a culture which is no longer Eurocentric.

My late and much lamented near-namesake, Ronald Eyre, used to say that
directing opera was like inflating a plastic elephant. Before I started to
direct my first opera I thought I knew what he meant, and I thought I agreed
with him.
I once did a show with Ken Campbell which did indeed require the inflation
of a plastic elephant; it was tossed out into the auditorium at the end of
the show and bounced about by the audience above their heads. It was a brief
gesture, which required a disproportionate amount of effort on the part of
the elephant's minder, Mavis. She started mid-morning repairing the small
tears from the previous night's exertions with a bicycle repair outfit. She
then plugged the beast into an aircompressor and waited patiently for the
plastic pachyderm to achieve its majestic, fully inflated form, only to see
it deflate, devoid of dignity, during its nightly appearance - a process, at
least for Ron, remarkably similar to directing an opera.
I have always had powerful prejudices against opera. Stuck for a
conversational diversion, I once asked Princess Margaret - a noted (or
notorious) balletomane - if she liked opera: 'Can't stand it. A lot of
frightfully boring people standing still and yelling.' Blunt perhaps, but
not a universe away from my own feelings at the time.
Being marinated in the art of theatre, and nourished by an aesthetic of
'truthfulness' - however relative, and however pretentious - I was
unsympathetic until recently to a medium which transparently is not
concerned with holding the mirror up to nature. Opera seemed to me to depend
on the audience's acceptance of an elaborate conceit.
The motor of 'music theatre' is music rather than theatre, and the making of
music seemed to me to have little in common with the making of theatre.
Music does not have to have a point; that is its point, the music. With good
music, as Auden says, you have only to listen to it, and be grateful.
Theatre, on the other hand, prospers, or labours, under the despotism of
logic: it maintains a stubborn dependence on plot, which in many operas
delights in its obscurity and revels in its resistance to common sense. And
if its plots often appear absurd, its passions often seem either histrionic
or bathetic.
I was uneasy about an entertainment which employed so many people to achieve
its effects, and could be as unwieldy as an aircraft carrier. I was uneasy
too (and remain so) about the cost, swollen not only by the numbers
involved, but the need to submit to fees dictated by the international
market. And to be honest, I have been put off opera not so much by the
activity itself, as by the personality of some of its propagandists - the
fans, the enthusiasts who criticise and catalogue every performance with the
joyless pedantry of armchair cricketers poring over their Wisdens.
However, I've become a convert. It is still unlikely that you will find me
in future years in the Crush Bar extolling the virtues of Otto Schweppes'
Leporello, castigating Helga Haagen Dazs' Marschallin, and minutely
examining the flaws in Guido Gamforalaf's Ring, but I have lost my heart to
at least half a dozen works, not all of them by Mozart or Verdi.
I have come to accept that opera is a world like any other; like the
theatre, opera has its own partiality, its own criteria, its own forms of
truth and of excellence, no less exacting, and no less rare than in the
theatre. I have recognised that I have earned Matisse's rebuke to the woman
who complained that an arm in a painting of his was out of proportion to the
body: 'It's not an arm, madam, it's a picture.' Opera is its own thing and
it is as fruitless to blame it for not being like theatre as it is to blame
theatre for not being film, or a melon for not being an orange.
My conversion has occurred through the sorcery of Sir George Solti, who,
after a flirtation with me over Falstaff in Salzburg, lured me into
directing La Traviata at Covent Garden: 'I have never conducted Traviata,
you have never produced it: together we will make our first Traviata.' I
have not regretted it, and I will never tire of watching him at work with
the orchestra and singers - punching the air, on his toes like a boxing
trainer, singing and shouting like a muezzin. 'Play this forte,' he crowed
to the 'cellos, 'Break your wrists and break my heart.' I enjoy as much our
minutely detailed discussions about the meaning or value of a note, a word,
a gesture; it is an obvious and extraordinary pleasure to work with a great
conductor, but it is as rare and as important to work with a great
collaborator.
'It's too early to jubilate about this enterprise,' Solti has said to me. I
can jubilate privately that my prejudices against opera have been cast off
and my worst expectations have been defied: instead of a soprano the size of
a Wessex saddleback, I work with one who has a large and beautiful voice and
a waist the size of a teapot, the tenor has a modest ego and a voice as
unforced as a mountain stream, the chorus are cooperative and inventive, and
rehearsals have been free of operatic (or theatrical) tantrums.
In one sense Ron was right: there is something of the elephant about opera -
an awesomely large, sometimes cumbersome, and sometimes heart-stoppingly
beautiful animal. But there is far too much poetry about it to be rendered
in plastic, and directing it does not seem like pumping up an inflatable,
however much huffing and puffing it involves. It is much more unpredictable
than that: like getting an elephant to dance on a tightrope. Oh yes, and
sing too.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: Sedipova - singled out for praise / Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The love affair between the Wigmore Hall public and its Russian singers gets
ever more intense. On Wednesday there was a new object of adoration, the
soprano Valentina Sedipova, making her London debut during the
Mariinsky-Kirov Series.
Sedipova, one of the seemingly endless supply of young Russian sopranos
making an impact in the west, is a leading member of the Kirov Opera.
Reporting from St Petersburg in February, Max Loppert singled her out for
praise after her alluring Sea Princess in Sadko. This recital confirmed
those impressions: hers is a well-supported voice, powerful and full of
colour throughout its range.
She sang a fascinating programme that underlined the richness of Romantic
Russian song. No less than seven composers were represented, including
rarities by Sergey Taneyev, Alexander Grechaninov and Mikhail
Ippolitov-Ivanov. Sedipova began, appropriately, with the 'father of Russian
music', Glinka: initial nervousness soon disappeared, and the soprano
revealed a liveliness in 'To her' and 'Bolero'. She caught the languid
atmosphere of Taneyev's 'Through the ethereal haze' perfectly.
Three familiar Tchaikovsky songs were given fresh treatment by Sedipova and
her idiomatic accompanist, Larissa Gergieva. The soprano scaled down her
voice for the light 'Serenade', and opened it out again for the bursting
emotion of 'Whether the day reigns'.
In the encores Sedipova finally allowed her operatic voice to come out.
Santuzza, Cio-Cio-San and Gioconda were brought to impassioned life in
full-throated Italianate singing. We must hear her at Covent Garden.
The Mariinsky-Kirov Series is supported by the Regent Hotel (London) and
British Airways (St Petersburg).

FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: Peter Sellars's 'Merchant of Venice' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was to be predicted that Sellars's staging of The Merchant of Venice
would prove slow, post-modern, agenda-ridden, Americanophobe, heavy-handed,
poorly performed, insensitive, untheatrical, unspontaneous, unShakespearean,
and unoriginal; and so it proved. (About one-fifth of the audience left at
the interval.) But - unlike, say, the Dusseldorf Romeo and Juliet - this is
not merely another terrible staging. Watching the Sellars Merchant is like
staring into a nightmare of the future.
You may not be surprised to hear that his Venice is Californian, and his
Shylock black. Or that, in the trial-scene speech on 'purchas'd slaves',
Shylock intones the single phrase 'Let them be free]' three times (Shylock
as Martin Luther King - natch) - while videos show us President Bush
apparently urging on the cops to smash Black Power demonstrations.
As usual, Sellars is bending works of art to suit his own unyielding agenda:
ie to broadcast his own PC guilt at white supremacism, and to express his
own convictions that the Americanisation of world culture is destructive.
The problem, it must be stressed, is not Sellars's agenda but the dull
crudity with which he bashes it home. He works not as an artist but as a
demagogue. (The notion that Shylock is more sinned against than sinning -
scarcely new - was central to David Thacker's recent RSC production.) It is
interesting that - as in Jude Kelly's haunting West Yorkshire Playhouse
staging in March - Sellars maximises the homosexuality of the
Antonio-Bassanio relationship, and underlines the angst that afflicts Portia
when she realises what she has married into. And he takes some of them
further. But, whereas Kelly's emotional drama was as taut as a thriller,
Sellars makes it monolithic.
As always, his conception of character is one-dimensional. As always, he
seems to dislike virtually every character onstage. Antonio is the worst
villain, of course, being chief capitalist manipulator. But Portia is
lachrymose from start to end. (When she and Nerissa snap into a bit of rap
as they prepare to don men's clothes, it is a mere shtick, true to nothing
in her character elsewhere.) Shylock is a solemn, orthodox bore, and at his
dullest when (twice) he breaks down about Jessica's defection. 'Hath not a
Jew eyes?' is delivered straight to a video-camera, and relayed on the 15
screens dotted around the stage and auditorium; very measured, it sounds
like something Shylock had said a million times before.
Nothing here is spontaneous. Sellars keeps making speeches sound
deliberately phoney. Antonio's friends and Portia's suitors are
image-conscious, forever addressing video monitors. Salerio, Solanio and
others keep turning into TV reporters. Sellars is, presumably, making points
here about the terrible way in which modern living is indeed being geared
for perpetual broadcast. (A few of them are funny, as when Salerio-Solanio
do one duet scene like a creepy pair of breakfast TV hosts.) But, since he
has all his actors speak with microphones heavily amplifying almost
everything, so that they sound broadcast-oriented and pre-recorded, he
commits the sin he satirises. Meanwhile, the immediacy of poor Shakespeare's
lines is wholly ignored. Live theatre has never felt less live than in
Sellars's hands.
Yet the fact that Sellars has zero sense of Shakespeare is, in this context,
a minor felony. He is, after all, only treating the Bard the same way that
he has been treating Aeschylus, Handel, Mozart, et al. No, Sellars's main
crimes are not against artistic text but against human spirit. The dreary
inflexibility of each stage character, the deliberate lack of spontaneity in
his world, the relentless wise-guy irony of his every production, the
appalling need to twist ambiguous texts to make monotonously white-guilt and
Americanophobe points: these factors are symptomatic of the worst tendencies
of our increasingly politically-correct and post-modern era. They express a
kind of modern cultural Stalinism that - though it intends merely to oppose
the worst of Eurocentric traditions - is actually hostile to civilised
values. I do not exaggerate when I say the following: to watch Sellars's
work, like that of the choreographer William Forsythe, is to feel that the
next dark age is already upon us.
Barbican Theatre until Saturday.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Saison Russe' in Paris / Review of the Kirov's
'Bakhchisaray' and 'Coppelia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An important Saison Russe (shades of Diaghilev in 1909) has started in
Paris. The opera and ballet troupes from the Mariinsky / Kirov Theatre,
complete with orchestra, are installed at the Theatre des Champs Elysees
until the end of December, and will make intermittent forays into the
regions.
The opera repertory is significant: Sadko; The Invisible City of Kitezh; The
Queen of Spades; Khovantschina. The three ballet offerings are less
impressive, though none has before been shown in the west by the Kirov. I
saw the old (1934) Fountain of Bakhchisaray and a new (1993) Coppelia; the
remaining item, Vainonen's version of The Nutcracker, turns up in December.
Fountain of Bakhchisaray is an intriguing example of Soviet ballet because
it was made when creative artists were shackled by Stalinist aesthetics and
the theory of 'socialist realism', where art for the people valued political
correctness above all else. Bakhchisaray's theme was 'correct' because taken
from Pushkin. Tartar horde ravages Polish manor house, and kills everyone
save the fair Maria, who is lusted after by their Khan Guirey. End of Act 1.
Act 2 is set in Guirey's harem where his chief mistress, Zarema, takes on
alarmingly at the arrival of Maria, who shrinks from every Tartar
suggestion. In Act 3, Zarema kills Maria in a fit of jealousy. She, in turn,
is tossed from the castle walls. Guirey mopes, and has a fountain installed
to remind him of events - a happy combination of sentiment and sanitation.
The ballet has been popular since its first performance, when Ulanova was
the exquisite Maria. Rostislav Zakharov's choreography and Boris Asafiev's
music were of their time and, not surprisingly, unadventurous. The Bolshoi
brought the ballet to London in 1956, and it was memorably danced by
Struchkova and Velta Viltsin as Maria and Zarema - the roles are matched in
much the same way as Nikiya and Gamsatti in La Bayadere - and by a
tremendous collection of men as Tartars, led by the magnificent Alexander
Lapauri. The Bolshoi's style then - dramatically weighty, intense in meaning
as in dynamics - exactly suited Zakharov's dances, which smacked of the
silent cinema but were effective for all that.
The Kirov's account, looking cramped on the Champs Elysees' stage, was
unconvincing. The Polish dances were daintily trodden on the spot, and
neither Julia Mkhalina as Maria nor Viktor Baranov as her fiance Vaslav,
were anything but visitors to their roles. The subsequent acts, which look
like fuzzy memories of Scheherazade for the harem and Bayadere for the
confrontation between Maria and Zarema, went for little. It was the Zarema
of Sylvie Guillem, a guest with the Kirov, who provided the glamour and
sheer physical drive that can make the piece credible. Zarema was one of
Plisetskaya's great roles, which suggests something of its potential. Mlle
Guillem indulged herself, and gave resonance to the part.
The music is tuneful and efficient, but thin. The staging looked no less
thin (the original designs, with Bakstian moments, by Vera Khodasevich are
still used) and the burning of the manor at the end of the first act, which
made us gasp in 1956, is now as uninteresting as the Polish dances which
precede it. The way of preserving these old but significant pieces is
something which Russian ballet will have to consider very seriously. This
touring version is an unworthy lightweight.
About the Coppelia, given in a new staging by Oleg Vinogradov, the ballet's
director, I find it difficult to comment. In the right hands it is the most
joyous ballet. It has been absent from the Mariinsky stage for 60 years, but
the traditional Petersburg version exists in notation and memory. It is
cogent as drama, touching, and above all, happy. Vinogradov's version is
confused, conscienceless - Delibes' perfect score is Frankensteined, with
bits chopped, repositioned, and disfigured with one egregious interpolation
 -and cursed with choreography where manic vivacity is no substitute for
heart, grace, wit, sense.
Many dancers rush about the stage in tasteless and complex costuming by
Irina Press. Vinogradov - whose patron is St. Vitus - repeats his usual
choreographic tricks of ceaseless and crude activity. The delightful Irina
Shapchits is lost as Swanilda, and is required to behave like an apprentice
termagant. Mikhail Zavialov is a featureless Franz, and he has a quartet of
friends who dance well. Coppelius is Woody Woodpecker impersonating
Voltaire. Delibes is made to sound glossy, brisk and unfeeling by the
orchestra under Alexander Viliumanis. And that is exactly the way in which
Vinogradov misinterprets and destroys this beautiful ballet.

<TEXT>
Transatlantic sensationalism in televised courtrooms is less dangerous than
Euro-artiness, to judge by The Trial (9pm, BBC2). Wonderful opening titles,
faces from Central Casting - villains and eccentrics of Dickensian ripeness
 -then cut to Edinburgh, that Jekyll and Hyde beauty-queen of cities.
Scotland has blazed the trail in admitting courtroom cameras, and the first
in Nick Catliff's series is a glossy mix of filmic values and incongruous
tragedy. The petty crook accused of murder is first glimpsed, as serenely
suffering as a madonna, beautifully, airily lit. His advocate is as
sardonically rueful, fastidiously lugubrious, as Rumpole. One forgets this
is real. Of course, it's not live, so no rough edges: smoothly edited
eavesdroppings on accused and solicitor, lawyers discussing tactics; the
camera roams freely in prison and court. Only occasional phrases, the
post-verdict anti-climax and a woman sobbing off-screen remind us this is no
soap opera. Which is worse, the obscene carnival of OJ Simpson or this
anodyne style exercise?

A range of probes capable of measuring temperature in extreme conditions
such as those inside a nuclear reactor has been developed by Cableries de
Lens, a French company.
The probes consist of thermocouples which are tightly packed with a mineral
insulator such as magnesia or alumina inside a metal sheath. The insulator
protects the thermocouples from chemical attack, while its density and
thermal conductivity allow the same response times as a bare wire of the
same diameter.

Salicylic acid, the precursor of aspirin, has been found to play a central
role in plants' ability to resist disease.
Scientists at Ciba-Geigy in the US and Switzerland conducted experiments on
transgenic tobacco plants which found that an accumulation of salicylic acid
is essential for the expression of plant disease resistance. The lack of
salicylic acid hinders acquired resistance and makes the plant more
susceptible to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, according to the
report in today's Science.

Jiffy Packaging, a UK company, has launched a paper packaging material as an
environmentally acceptable alternative to plastic bubble wrapping.
Its Flextra product is a roll of paper with thousands of tiny slits, which
takes up less storage room than conventional packaging materials. When it is
stretched it becomes a three-dimensional honeycomb of hexagon-shaped holes,
giving it cushioning properties.
Its ability to expand to 10 times its height and by 20 per cent in area
makes it suitable for filling voids, corners and gaps.
The manufacturers believe that the paper is an environmental advance on
previous products because it is made from recycled fibres, is reusable,
bio-degradable and can be recycled.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology: Virtually in business - Commercial applications
of virtual reality are growing rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An engineer opens the engine bay door of the aircraft, positions a trailer
under the engine bay, jacks it up and removes the bolts securing the engine.
He then connects the engine to the trailer, lowers it and removes it for
servicing.
It is the same routine as usual, involving the same steps and taking the
same time as usual. The difference is that the tools are computer-generated,
the engineer is wearing a headset and the exercise is being conducted in a
virtual world.
This is an application of virtual reality, a form of three-dimensional
computer graphics which allows users to feel as though they are looking at a
graphic, and interacting with it, from the inside. As the user manipulates
the system, using a device such as a mouse, glove or spaceball, the software
updates the image and transfers this new view of the virtual world back to
the user through a display.
This aircraft engineer's encounter with virtual reality is part of the
design process at McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace company. It bought the
system in September from Division, a UK-based supplier, on the basis that it
would involve 'fewer mock-ups and prototypes, earlier design testing and
reduced costs'.
Examples such as this show that virtual reality is beginning to make inroads
in business, although its image is still heavily dominated by its
applications in games and entertainment. 'Overcoming the preconception of
management that VR is about hype and entertainment' remains a significant
challenge, according to Pierre duPoint, marketing director of Division.
The business market for virtual reality currently accounts for just Dollars
4.1m (Pounds 2.5m) of the Dollars 115.8m total market, according to 4th
Wave, a US consultancy. It is expected to grow strongly. By 1998 it expects
the business market to account for Dollars 95m of a total market worth
Dollars 569.9m. Research and development applications are expected to grow
from Dollars 40.3m to Dollars 64.4m in the same period.
Even now, the variety of business users and applications is extensive.
Examples range from EDF, a French nuclear power operator, which uses virtual
reality to help engineers plan maintenance programmes that expose them to
minimum radiation, to Wall Street where Maxus Systems International, a
financial consultancy, has designed a system that allows traders to
represent financial information visually by using symbols that float on a
virtual plane.
Most business uses of virtual reality fall into three categories: marketing,
design and training.
Just over Dollars 2m is currently being spent on marketing applications of
virtual reality, according to 4th Wave. A notable user is Matsushita, the
Japanese interior design company. In its Tokyo showroom, customers can view
a combination of any of the 50,000 items in its catalogue by putting on a
headset and taking a virtual tour of a house in which they are installed.
The cost of the equipment, at more than Pounds 250,000, might inhibit other
retailers from following their lead. However, the company is considering
rolling out the project to its other shops using a cheaper, PC-based system.
Similar equipment is also used in the UK, where British Gas has installed a
virtual reality system (which uses a monitor rather than a headset) to
demonstrate kitchen designs in its Coventry showroom.
Design is another application that makes good use of virtual reality's
convincing simulation of products. One of the most innovative uses of the
concept has been in drug design, where Glaxo and the University of York are
working on a Pounds 600,000 three-year project with funding assistance by
Division, the UK's Department of Trade and Industry and the Science and
Engineering Research Council.
The goal of the project is to allow chemists to manipulate molecules using
virtual reality, allowing them to get a tangible sense of how they interact.
Glaxo says that although 'the jury is still out' on how well the system will
work in practice, the concept has proved itself.
Within the field of industrial design, virtual reality may be adopted
relatively easily, since it is a variation on widely used computer-aided
design.
When CADCentre, a Cambridge-based computer-aided design business, launched
Review Reality, a virtual reality software product for designers of process
plant, recently, it was depicted as the latest in a line of products that
allow engineers to visualise their design database.
Review Reality presents petrochemical installations and offshore platforms
as life-like computer models, generated in real time. George Osborne, an
engineering general manager of Kvaerner H&amp;G, the Norwegian shipbuilding
group, is enthusiastic: 'It is highly desirable because it is more
life-like,' he says.
For complex equipment such as plants and rigs, the uses of virtual reality
go beyond design. Simulated models can also be pressed into use for
activities such as safety assessments and training.
Virtual reality is proving useful in training people to cope with complex
situations, such as in a fire.
The UK's Fire Service College uses virtual reality for training because it
provides a visual explanation of the complex mathematical theories that
underpin fire engineering. The software designed by Superscape, a UK-quoted
virtual reality company, allows trainees to see what happens to a fire in
changing conditions, such as when doors are opened or shut.
Applications are likely to expand further as virtual reality systems become
less expensive to install. Since virtual reality depends on high-performance
computing power, the hardware can cost Pounds 250,000 to create top-quality
graphics.
For many users who find the quality of the image from a PC-based system
acceptable, the costs can be much lower. For example, IBM, together with
Virtuality, a UK virtual reality company, is about to begin marketing a
virtual reality development system costing between Pounds 6,600 and Pounds
55,000.
Prices are likely to fall further. 'We want to make it accessible to more
people by bringing the costs down,' says Jon Waldern, managing director of
Virtuality.
As with many new technologies, many potential customers will be tempted to
wait until the price of virtual reality equipment falls and performance
improves. But as cost becomes less of a deterrent, virtual reality looks set
to become widely adopted as a practical tool.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Management: The difficult art of skills transfer

<TEXT>
Why did General Motors flounder so badly in the US throughout the 1980s,
while its European offshoots prospered mightily? Only in 1991, when the
parent company was about to hit the crash barrier, did it start to learn
managerial lessons from Europe.
They included the need to import Opel's notorious cost- cutter, Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua - who after a few instructive months defected noisily to
Volkswagen.
Why has Ford suffered from a mirror-image of the same problem? The US parent
company revitalised itself a decade ago through a string of far-reaching
changes - including the introduction of teamwork and total quality - but its
European arm adapted far less successfully, and has performed in lacklustre
fashion as a result.
The reasons are not peculiar to the motor industry. Nor are they simply
explained by geography - that is, the thousands of miles that hamper
effective communication between locations such as Detroit and Germany, even
in this electronic age.
Instead, the causes are generic. They afflict almost every large
organisation, not only those with a far-flung network of units, but also
those with a diverse range of businesses in the same country. Even similar
units on the same site can be affected.
The problem is that the transfer of skills and practice between businesses
within a company is far trickier than most people realise. In some respects,
thanks to the glamour of competitive benchmarking, it is harder than
learning lessons from outside.
This is not merely a matter of the ubiquitous 'not invented here' syndrome
interfering with internal organisational learning, although that does always
create a powerful barrier. There is far more at fault: poor understanding of
what really constitutes 'world class' practice; head offices that have no
idea how to encourage the transfer of skills between their business units;
and a long list of other value-destroying problems.
Many of them have been investigated in unusual depth in a two-year study of
'intra-firm transfer of best practice' carried out by Gabriel Szulanski, a
researcher at Insead, a leading European business school. His report will
shortly be published by an arm of the American Productivity &amp; Quality
Centre*.
The study finally dispels the widespread myth that companies can breed best
practice just by designating internal 'centres of excellence' for particular
skills and know-how, and then letting them disseminate it to eager internal
customers.
Szulanski examined 122 transfers of 38 technical and managerial practices in
a range of US and European companies including AT&amp;T Paradyne, BP, Chevron,
EDS, Rank Xerox, Sprint and Banc One, an Ohio group known for its transfer
mechanisms. In descending order of difficulty, the following problems
emerged:
Inadequate 'absorptive capacity' on the part of the recipient unit.
Szulanski uses this term to describe its ability to identify and implement
the practices in question.
Inadequate understanding of the practice, either on the part of the
recipient unit or of the provider. Detailed operating procedures for the
practice may not be available, and the skills and resources needed to
perform it successfully may not be listed properly.
The quality of the relationship between the two units in any transfer. One
or both of them may not be keen to collaborate, and to assign good personnel
to the project. Even if they are enthusiastic, communication may not be
well-established or easy.
The recipient unit may be considered unreliable by the provider.
The provider may lose its initial enthusiasm because it has to carry too
much of the financial burden.
Another finding was that it took an average of 27 months for a unit or
company to recognise the existence of an opportunity to transfer best
practice, and another nine to implement the transfer.
Coming from a bunch of supposedly leading companies, this is a pretty sorry
catalogue.
Puzzlingly, the study pays only scant attention to one of the most important
factors in the transfer of best practice: the parent company's effectiveness
in fostering it.
Szulanski calls this the 'organisational context' within which transfers
occur, or fail to. He finds that those 'mandated' by the organisation are
less difficult than optional transfers, but that neither are as successful
as 'strongly suggested' and spontaneous ones.
This conclusion begs a series of important questions about the role of head
office. They are covered much more fully, under the jargonistic title of
'linkage influence', in Corporate Level Strategy**, a new book reviewed on
this page on October 5.
Among other examples, it cites Banc One's use of an unusually detailed
monthly reporting system to pressurise all its affiliates to gauge their
performance against other units, and to identify good exponents of the
practices that they need to introduce or improve.
But such centralised procedures can have their downside. The book warns that
managers in some companies admit they deliberately conceal potential
transfer opportunities for fear of losing control to some centralised
procedure.
One executive is quoted as saying: 'I would always prefer to deal with an
outsider because you don't have to watch your back on the political issues.'
That was part of the sad reality at GM and Ford in the 1980s, as it still is
in most companies. It means head offices must tread a knife-edge between
inadequate involvement and over-interference. Both Detroit giants are now
striving to do just that.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology: Cleaner nooks and crannies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In Edwardian England, the streets were swept clean by the likes of Eliza
Doolittle's father. In modern-day Japan, the job is done by large trucks
equipped with water hoses and brooms that roam the streets at night.
But for the nooks and crannies which the heavy-duty cleaner trucks miss,
Banzai, a Japanese manufacturer of automobile and leisure equipment
maintenance machinery, has produced a powerful vacuum cleaner for use on the
streets.
The Field Vacuum Cleaner has suction strength of 13cu m per minute. It sucks
up everything from dead leaves to empty bottles, cans, water and sludge. It
reaches under park benches and into corners of pavements and removes mud
from the gutters.
The company started exporting the cleaner to France three years ago, where
it is used to clean the debris stuck in the grooves of railway tracks, and
to clear dog mess from the pavements of Paris.
The company started to sell in Japan after sales in France took off, and
Banzai says it is now selling around 60 machines a month.
Buyers in Japan include companies that clean parks and office blocks, while
golf driving ranges and tennis courts use it to retrieve players' balls.
The 70kg machine runs on a gasoline engine. The 3m hose, which weighs 3kg to
4kg, is supported by a rod extending from the cleaner. The refuse box inside
the cleaner, which holds 120 litres, detaches from the machine for emptying.
Banzai warns that while the machine is suitable for cleaning small areas
that are hard to reach, it is inadequate for efficient vacuuming of wide
surfaces.
In Japan, the cleaner costs Y780,000 (Pounds 4,936).
