FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Still room for
enhancement - Wholesale banking systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to take electronic links between the global banking community for
granted. The sheer scale of automated payments make these transactions
appear commonplace. The UK's Clearing House Automated Payments System
(Chaps) handles Pounds 90bn worth of payments every day. These payments are
settled on a daily basis, with the danger of one participant being unable to
honour a transaction termed settlement risk.
The idea of failure in such a system seems faintly ludicrous. Chaps has
processed up to 76,000 items in one day - the very extent of computerised
transactions lends the whole system a clinical air, but there is still room
for improvement, and Chaps has commissioned systems house Logica to
undertake a Pounds 3m enhancement of its service.
The aim of this project is realtime gross settlement (RTGS). Chaps needs to
move beyond a reconciliation of accounts at the close of trading and into
RTGS. This prevents a payment instruction going through unless the sender
has funds or central bank backing to cover the transaction.
Logica wrote the original gateway software that translates Chaps messages
into a suitable form for the network. Now its consultants are moving UK
banks to RTGS while Chaps continues normal operations.
'It's an evolutionary change that should be implemented by the end of 1995,'
says Eric Sepkes, a director of the Chaps governing body and London-based
vice-president with Citibank. Mr Sepkes identifies the policy of building on
an existing system as a Chaps strategy - 'the whole idea is not to start
from scratch,' he says.
RTGS migration is one obvious path for electronic settlement systems across
the globe. But other striking trends are emerging in the international
financial messaging market.
The Royal Bank of Scotland joined forces with Banco Santander, Credit
Commercial de France and Portugal's Banco de Comercio e Industria in 1991.
Together they launched the Interbank Online System (Ibos), described by the
participants as a virtual banking association. Ibos links the customer
networks of the participating banks without reference to existing financial
infrastructures.
John Bertrand, managing director of Ibos, is blunt about the motivation for
the Pounds 5m project. Existing structures were not up to the job, he says -
'the old method involved a flow of payments through the correspondent banks.
There would usually be four banks involved in passing on one transaction.'
Ibos has been perceived as a challenge to worldwide Swift international
funds transfer system. Mr Bertrand is not too worried by that perception -
'Ibos is different from Swift: we don't compete directly because Ibos has
evolved to the next level. Swift is a hub-based system with technology
dating from the 1970s. Ibos allows users to send a message direct, wherever
they want.'
This simple function flies in the face of traditional wholesale banking
practice, where payments would be passed down through the network. While
Swift's system enjoys worldwide acceptance it is dependent on this heritage
of correspondent banks.
Ibos used network expertise from British Telecom and computers from Digital
Equipment for the initial phase of operations. In January this year the US
computer services giant Electronic Data Systems (EDS) joined Ibos. The Royal
Bank of Scotland's own IT staff were able to integrate the first incarnation
of Ibos.
But EDS made its reputation by managing other people's technology in a
cost-efficient manner. By calling in the experts, the Ibos partners have
tacitly admitted that they need help in expanding the network. EDS will
certainly provide vital technical credibility as Ibos trawls for more
subscribers willing to pay the Pounds 50,000 entrance fee plus another
Pounds 48,000 for annual hardware and software rental.
Royal Bank of Scotland has moved its traffic off the Swift system and claims
a cost-saving of 23 per cent on cross border transactions.
The use of third parties to handle the nuts and bolts of technology is an
established practice in banking. Outsourcing IT contracts is big business,
and the market for outsourced corporate telecoms in Europe is estimated at
Dollars 11.7bn by 1997. Financial institutions will take up a large slice of
this lucrative trade, and some players are diversifying from the money
markets into data manipulation.
MW Marshall is one of the world's largest money brokers. Since September
1992, it has operated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Saturn Global Networks
(SGN), that flashes critical financial communications around the globe for
over 50 clients. SGN targets medium-sized banks that require their own
secure network for voice and data transmission but are not willing to pay
for a huge in-house project. SGN delivers computer intelligence in the form
of local processors and appropriate communications software.
'Integration of voice and data is what the market wants,' says Peter Hase,
SGN business development manager. Hase and his colleagues deliver that
capability while the banks stick to their core activity. It is a healthy
reaction to the heady days of the 1980s when banks became preoccupied with
IT and telecoms strategies.
Julian Wood works with City financial and training consultancy Profile - his
experience of working on ambitious IT projects within commercial banks
during the 1980s has convinced him that too many institutions still go in at
the deep end when investing in IT.
'A lot of banks haven't really learnt the lessons of the last decade,' he
says. 'They still put money into huge, 'inter-galactic' systems meant to
cure all ills. What they don't do is get the planning cycle right. They
should either take a long-term view, and accept that there will be hiccups
and changes to the specification en route. Or they should only invest in
short-term projects.'
The rise of operations like Ibos and the demand for services offered by SGN
suggest that a lot of institutions are getting out of Wood's overblown
'inter-galactic' projects.
Logica's enhancements to Chaps will add a new dimension to the banking
capability without a wholesale redesign of the core system. Electronic
networks are now part-and-parcel of commercial banking and many subscribers
are learning that the smaller, less ambitious advances offer the most gain.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (5): Barajas plans an 'airport
city' - Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barajas airport, which accounts for 20 per cent of Spain's air traffic, is
scheduled to grow fast over the next decade as it becomes the focal point
for economic activity in the area between Madrid and the satellite towns of
Torrejon de Ardoz and San Fernando de Henares, both of which have become
important light engineering centres.
Access to the airport, which is 15km from the city centre, has been
considerably eased by the completion of Madrid's second ring road and of two
new direct approaches to the main terminals. A third ring road is planned as
well a rail link.
The expansion comes at a time when the airport remains below saturation
point and it will avert any over-capacity in the future.
Barajas handled a record 18.4m passengers in 1992, is forecast to be used by
some 18m this year. The airport will have a capacity for 27m by the year
2,000.
Over the past two years more rational use of the airport's two intersecting
runways has raised the maximum number of flight operations from 33 to 55 per
hour, the number of aircraft bays has been raised from 75 to 100 and
additional space has been gained for the passengers by linking up the main
domestic and international terminals.
Such improvements allow the airport to absorb without undue strain a
forecast annual increase of some 4 per cent in its number of passengers as
it awaits the construction of a new runway and a new terminal that will come
into service after 2000.
The planned new facilities represent a quantum leap for Barajas and they
form part of an ambitious plan to develop an 'airport city' that will
incorporate large recreational areas, new office and service sector zones,
and a greenfield industrial estate.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (6): Attention switches to
Malpensa - Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expansion at Linate, Milan's principal airport, is hampered by its
dependence on a single runway. Last year, the airport recorded a 2 per cent
increase in aircraft movements to 114,157, and the number of passengers
handled increased by 1.3 per cent to 9.5m.
Passenger capacity is more than adequate, following the improvements to the
airport terminal in the late 1980s. But rather than increasing the size of
aircraft serving Linate, airlines prefer to increase frequency, and the
airport - a mere 20-minute taxi ride from the centre of the city - cannot
add a further runway because it is, as its spokesman puts it, 'hemmed in by
concrete'.
Attention has therefore switched to the city's second airport, Malpensa,
which like Linate belongs to SEA, a profitable private company controlled by
the Milan city authorities.
Malpensa, 45km from the city, currently handles only about 3.6m passengers a
year, on charter and intercontinental flights.
A programme of improvements, Malpensa 2000, including a new fast rail-link
with the city centre, is under way and should be sufficiently advanced to
allow some flights to transfer to from Linate to Malpensa in 1998.
A political decision will have to be made on whether to take the logical
next step and move all international flights to Malpensa, keeping only the
busy domestic operations at Linate.
This year traffic at both Milanese airports is increasing. In the nine
months to the end of September, the number of passengers using Linate was up
9.1 per cent against the same period last year, and at Malpensa, up 3.2 per
cent.
Linate, which handles only scheduled flights, is tailored to business users,
who account for an estimated 70 or 80 per cent of all passengers.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (7): Projects underline a
serious ambition - Frankfurt and Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany is serious about becoming a major European air hub, and its two main
airport projects of the past few years only serve to emphasise this.
The most recent is the opening last month of a second terminal at Frankfurt
airport in an attempt to siphon away international traffic from London's
Heathrow.
At the same time the new Munich airport, opened in May 1992, is already
handling 12.7m passengers a year and expects to increase that to 13.4m this
year and eventually up to the terminal's capacity of 18m.
With 58 services a week to North America, Munich is Germany's second-largest
hub for overseas flights.
Both aim to be passenger-friendly, and Munich is probably every passenger's
dream. With just one terminal, without the 'satellites' and 'fingers' found
at London's Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle, it aims to make it easy to
get around.
Frankfurt's second terminal, built at a cost of DM1.6bn (Dollars 1.07bn), is
the airport's answer to overcrowding. The airport, which serves 105
scheduled airlines, is second only to London's Heathrow and is the busiest
passenger airport in continental Europe, and last year handled 32.5m
passengers - almost three times its capacity when it opened in 1972.
The new terminal expects to handle 5m passengers this year, and will be able
to cope with between 10m and 12m passengers. Its new terminal is linked to
the original facility with a driverless overhead shuttle, and meanwhile
upgrading of Terminal 1 is under way, where Lufthansa, the national carrier,
will occupy the western half of the building.
But in spite of the huge projects at both airports, both have an eye on the
future. At Munich, the next large project will be the Munich Airport Centre,
which will include further airline offices, a conference centre and
restaurants, and more shops and lounges.
Meanwhile Frankfurt plans to link its two terminals with a third section to
create what it calls a 'mega complex', and a second railway station for the
airport is due to go into service before the turn of the century.
Also on Frankfurt's agenda is readiness for the next generation of aircraft
 -the 'super-jumbos' which will carry up to 800 passengers. During the
construction of the terminal, the aircraft manufacturers were consulted
about the likely dimensions of such aircraft, and as a result the eight
terminal gate stands can all accommodate aircraft with a wingspan greater
than today's 747s.
However, it does not expect to have to expand its runway capacity until well
after the turn of the century. By 'fine-tuning' its existing runway capacity
the airport says it expects to be able to cope with additional aircraft
movements up to 2010.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (3): Cause for local celebration
 -Regional airports are chasing small airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich is celebrating 800 years as a city and capital of the English region
of East Anglia. Another cause for local celebration is the sudden success of
Norwich airport. With a newly completed Pounds 1m extension to its terminal
building, Norwich now handles 230,000 passengers a year and epitomises the
rise of the regional airport.
'We survive on feeding other airports through the hub and spoke system says
Norwich Airport marketing manager Peter Buckell. Amsterdam's Schiphol is the
lifeblood of Norwich. So far this year 63,000 passengers from the wealthy
but remote region of East Anglia have flown out of Norwich on one of four
daily flights to Schiphol.
Consolidated fares, the practice of selling one ticket inclusive of the
regional air fare to the larger hub and then on to the ultimate destination,
have made Norwich an attractive prospect for Transatlantic passengers. The
hop across the North Sea to Schiphol takes less than an hour, and the Dutch
hub is renowned for the facilities it affords transit passengers.
A new pier has opened recently dedicated to regional services. Mr Buckell is
mildly surprised at the effect of this connection 'We have been flying to
Amsterdam for 25 years now, and this year has exceeded all expectations.'
Norwich Airport is a comfortable option for passengers. With just three
gates it offers a contrast to the mayhem of Heathrow or Gatwick, and that
lack of congestion is mirrored in the air. Landing slots are available and
capacity problems are unheard of.
This ease of access for airlines has combined with increasing journey times
to major airports to boost regional airports and the carriers that
specialise in servicing them.
This growth has been a boon to the 56 members of the European Regional
Airlines Association (ERAA). A spokesman claims that ERAA airlines find
themselves pursued by adventurous airports. 'It is quite common nowadays to
see an airport go out, find an airline and propose that the carrier takes up
slots on a new route,' the spokesman said.
'The airport itself will have done the market research to justify that
route. Airports are now being innovative in offering marketing support to
the airline service.'
This is a new tack for airport authorities. Traditionally they waited for
the carriers to beat a path to their door and plead for landing slots. But
across Europe regional airports are chasing the new small airlines to marry
their capacity with passenger demand for local, convenient terminals.
Liberalisation under an EU Inter-regional Air Services Agreement played a
big part in creating this market. Air UK is one of ERAA's larger members
with 1,400 employees and a fleet that includes BAe 146 four-engined jets.
The advent of jet aircraft such as the 146 and Fokker 100 have expanded the
options for regional services. With about 100 seats and an airframe designed
for economical operations over short distances these aircraft make the most
of new European routes.
Phil Chapman, director of planning at Air UK says the 146 was the deciding
factor in Air UK's adopting a service from the UK to Florence. Previously
passengers for Tuscany flew to Pisa. Mr Chapman says Air UK can now tap into
lucrative upmarket holiday traffic by offering a flight direct to a popular
destination.
This kind of association benefits both parties. The ERAA cites the
development of Dortmund airport as a result of close co-operation between
the airport authority and the Nuremberg-based carrier Eurowings. Mr Chapman
notes that most of the 36m passengers carried by ERAA members in 1993 are
ultimately bound for a centre of population. But the ease of access factor
will persuade them to land away from their prime destination.
Dusseldorf is cited as a successful regional airport, but Dusseldorf Airport
Ltd is now promoting Monchengladbach, 15km away, as an attractive
destination. The company highlights 'unlimited slots, favourable user
charges' as incentives to carriers, while passengers can enjoy air and bus
shuttles to Dusseldorf itself.
Eastern Europe is latching on to the hubs and spokes theory. Under Soviet
domination Hungarian internal aviation relied on a network of 20 grass
airstrips to supplement Budapest's main terminals. Now the civil aviation
authority is taking control of former Warsaw Pact military airbases. Hungary
is acquiring a ready-made regional airports infrastructure that should help
attract foreign investment that will see its local carriers moving out of
their traditional domain of cargo carrying and crop-spraying into more
profitable sectors.
The carriers that make up ERAA are currently enjoying an average annual
passenger growth rate of 14 per cent. That is double the figure for large
carriers flying traditional routes into leading hubs. Regional airports have
learnt to work in tandem with these carriers and make life easier for the
hard-pressed passenger as well as boosting the bottom line.
This is a perilous industry, with apparently successful operators such as
Air UK nudging the balance sheet into profit. Regional airports simply
cannot afford to ignore the customer.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (8): Congestion is expected to
worsen - Zurich and Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich and Geneva airports are both enjoying moderate growth in both
business and leisure traffic and are suffering from capacity constraints.
In both cases, the problems are entirely related to passenger handling.
Zurich-Kloten's three runways are more than adequate to meet foreseeable
demand as is Geneva-Cointrin's single runway.
Zurich's two terminals tend to reach their limit to handle passengers in
early summer when both business and leisure traffic is high. Cointrin is
already handling 6m passengers a year, which is about 15 per cent more than
the terminal was designed to accommodate. With passenger growth of 4.8 per
cent in the first eight months of this year, things will get worse before
they get better.
However, construction is under way on a SFr120m (Dollars 96.7m) terminal
extension that will raise capacity at Cointrin to 8m passengers a year when
it is completed in 1996. Other more moderate improvements in people moving
are also in the works.
At Kloten, the outlook is more cloudy. The airport is a hyper-sensitive
issue in environment-conscious Zurich. A proposal for a new SFr2bn terminal
building must be submitted to the people of the canton in a referendum next
summer. If the proposal is approved, construction could begin in 1998 with
the hope that the terminal would open in 2003.
In the meantime, congestion in the existing terminals will worsen. In the
first nine months of this year, passenger numbers were up 7 per cent, and
the upward trend is expected to continue.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (2): Heathrow is challenged -
The fierce competition to become top European hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapidly emerging role of airports as catalysts for economic growth is
intensifying competition for market share among the hub airports of Europe.
BAA is pressing for the development of the Pounds 900m Terminal 5 at
Heathrow, London, to cope with relentlessly rising traffic and, just as
significantly, to secure its position as the foremost hub airport in Europe.
The development would lift capacity by 30m passengers a year to about 80m by
2013.
A hub airport is one where many passengers change aircraft (and sometimes
airlines) for onward flights - to 'inter-line' in airline language - because
the airport is served by a lot of carriers.
At Heathrow, more than 90 airlines from 85 countries offer direct flights to
more than 200 destinations. These figures are bound to rise in conjunction
with air passenger and cargo traffic, putting further pressures on slots -
precious take-off and landing times.
The slots problem at airports revolves around several factors: runway,
terminal and air traffic control capacity and even the possibility of bigger
aircraft.
Improvements in ATC capacity by the UK National Air Traffic Services (Nats)
and Eurocontrol, and the prospect of Terminal 5 support BAA's claim that it
will not need a third runway at Heathrow.
The most immediate challenge to Heathrow is from the nearest continental
European cities where several other hubs are expanding rapidly.
ACI Europe statistics for 1993 show that Heathrow was the busiest European
airport, with nearly 48m passengers, of whom about 30 per cent were
inter-lining. It was followed by Frankfurt with 32.5m, Paris - Charles de
Gaulle (CDG) - at 26.1m, Paris Orly at 25.4m, Amsterdam at 21.3m and London
(Gatwick) at 20.2m.
At Frankfurt a new Dollars 3.86bn terminal opened in October, raising the
airport's capacity by 10m-12m passengers a year. In the past nine months the
airport handled 26.5m passengers, and is on target for 34m for the year.
The airport is linked to the German rail network and expansion plans include
a second station for advanced high-speed trains.
The Paris Airports' Authority, which owns CDG, Orly and Le Bourget, plans a
third runway at CDG and a third terminal. Another terminal opened at Orly
last year, raising capacity by 10m passengers a year.
Schiphol, Amsterdam, is a European hub already attracting many UK travellers
who find it a more convenient inter-line airport than Heathrow. Its
expansion programme will provide for 34m passengers a year by 2000 and 40m
(plus 5m rail passengers) by 2015. A fifth runway is planned.
These are the main developments at Heathrow's direct competitors but
virtually every other airport in Europe is undergoing modernisation to meet
the anticipated doubling of traffic by the early years of the next century.
At Heathrow, the Pounds 70m Flight Connection Centre in the Central Terminal
Area, designed for inter-lining passengers, opens next month. The Pounds
300m London (Paddington) to Heathrow rail link is due to open in 1997.
Although still regarded by some as a 'holiday' airport, Gatwick is a
scheduled services hub serving more than 100 destinations.
Elsewhere in the UK, Manchester is planning a second runway, while a
planning inquiry has begun into the development of Filton, near Bristol, as
a substantial regional airport for the south-west of England.
The Dollars 22bn that ACI Europe estimates its 261 member airports in 43
countries will be spending between 1993 and 1997 on facilities, is likely to
go mostly on terminals and runways within existing airport boundaries.
The number of airports planned on greenfield sites is small - at
Athens-Spata and Berlin-Brandenburg, for example - largely because of lack
of space and environmental constraints of governments.
Progress since 1990 in improving and expanding airports and harmonising air
traffic control facilities appears to have reduced traffic delays, leading
to a downward revision in the forecast cost penalties of congestion from
Dollars 10bn to Dollars 6bn a year by 2000.
But delays are still 'unacceptably high', according to John Meredith, the
Air Transport Action Group's executive director, who adds that 'governments
must continue to make major investments in the aviation infrastructure if
Europe is going to realise the economic benefits its air transport industry
can bring'.
There remains the question of how far the development of advanced high-speed
rail transport throughout Europe, and especially the Channel Tunnel, will
affect short-haul air transport and the hub airports.
There is concern in the air transport industry that the emphasis being
placed by the EU on developing 'inter-modality' between airports and
high-speed rail services could divert attention from the need for direct
investment in airports and ATC facilities.
The tunnel seems certain to divert a significant volume of traffic from the
airlines, especially if fares remain competitive. Whether any of those
passengers will be inter-lining between rail and air is uncertain. The
Paddington - Heathrow rail link will help ease UK transfers, but a Channel
Tunnel link built into Heathrow would be beneficial.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (4): Facilities cater to every
type of traveller - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's five international airports represent the entire spectrum of the
genre, from the overcrowded to the virtually deserted, serving everyone from
the besuited businesses traveller to the sombrero toting package
holidaymaker.
The number one, Heathrow, remains easily the busiest international airport
in the world. A million passengers a week pass through its four terminals.
It operator BAA admits that it is close to reaching a level that is
uncomfortable for its users.
The solution - a fifth terminal - will not be opened until 2002, and that is
assuming permission is granted for a go ahead next year.
But airlines continue to flock to Heathrow, with the likes of American
Airlines and Cathay Pacific deserting other London airports in recent months
in search of the lucrative business traveller.
Inside the airport, facilities for business travellers continue to improve.
The latest addition is a flight connections centre.
London's second airport, Gatwick, still labours under an image of being a
charter flight base, even though it is often much quicker to reach than
Heathrow for central London-based travellers.
It has just opened a business pavilion for first and business class
travellers, and a transit lounge that claims to allow the quickest
connections in Europe of about 30 minutes.
BAA marketed London's third airport, Stansted, as a business airport from
the start. But with just 3m passengers a year and a capacity of 15m, it has
a long way to go before it reaches the critical mass which is needed to
attract the frequency of flights to capital cities that business travellers
demand.
Number four, London City Airport, is this year finally able to say that it
is a success story. Passenger levels are 75 per cent above their levels last
year and it now served 10 destinations with its small aircraft operated by
six airlines including Air France, Virgin and Dutch carrier VLM.
Finally there is Luton Airport, which admits it will remain a holiday
airport for many years to come. It is trying to boost its business traffic
and to that end is concentrating on establishing a direct rail link to the
City of London, the Thameslink, which also connects to Gatwick.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): Management attitudes are
more important than technology - While the fiercely competitive financial
services industry is increasing its spending on information technology, it
frequently fails to achieve the full benefits
</HEADLINE>

The world's financial institutions are looking with fresh eyes at electronic
technology as they gear up to face ever fiercer competition, not only from
within the financial services industry itself, but also from the world
outside.
The articles in this survey deal with a number of the principal themes in
financial technology including payment systems, image processing and
database technology. They also cover management issues with a technological
slant, including fraud and its prevention, and outsourcing.
There is some irony in the fact that these same technologies are
facilitating many of the new challenges and lowering the barriers of entry
to the finance business.
It could have been predicted, for example, that Swift, the banks' global
electronic payments message system, would eventually face competition from
an organisation outside the banking world with a global network and access
to financial expertise. That competition now exists and Swift has been
forced to announce price cuts and to lower its joining fee, in response.
Ibos (Inter-bank On-line System) is the kind of organisation which observers
argue represents the new competition for Swift - in embryonic form, at any
rate.
It is a joint venture initially between the Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco
Santander of Spain - and Electronic Data Systems of the US, a subsidiary of
General Motors and the world's largest computing services company.
Other members include Credit Commercial de France and Banco de Commercio e
Industria of Portugal. The first US customer, First Fidelity Bancorporation
joined this year.
Thomas Metz, director of global business development for Ibos in the UK,
while rejecting the notion that Ibos is a direct competitor for Swift, says
the group has built a cross-border cash management system - a digital
superhighway for the banking industry.
Swift, meanwhile, is extending its business into the area of securities
messages, and has applied to become a network supplier to the UK securities
industry's yet-to-be-implemented Crest settlement system as part of a
campaign to increase message traffic and revenues.
The threats to the traditional finance industry come from a multiplicity of
directions. Microsoft, the world's largest software house, this year
acquired Intuit, developer of the most popular personal finance software,
Quicken, used by about 6m personal computer users.
The deal, which is subject to scrutiny by the US antitrust authorities,
gives Microsoft an important toehold in a market - home banking - where
traditional banks have failed to make much of an impact. Microsoft,
developer of MS/DOS-Windows, the most popular operating system for personal
computers, also aims to take a leading role in the creation of the
information superhighway.
One measure of the financial institutions' renewed interest in technology,
after some years of cutting back expenditure, is growth in the information
technology budget. According to the consultancy Ernst &amp; Young, US financial
institutions will spend Dollars 16.35bn on technology in 1994, 6 per cent
higher than the previous year. Andrew Mayer of Ernst &amp; Young estimates that
the total will be Dollars 19.8bn in 1997.
Comparable figures do not exist for Europe but the consultancy, Price
Waterhouse, says that more than half the financial services companies it
reviewed in its annual information technology survey intend to increase
their spending on technology, despite the fact, it says, that many IT
projects have proved eventually to be failures.
This is hardly new, either in the finance industry or outside. What is
depressing is that over the years there has been so little progress in
ensuring that projects are brought in on time and budget.
The consequences can be expensive. Stewart Stevenson, senior manager for
systems development at the Bank of Scotland, after listing tried and tested
rules for successful project completion concluded with the admonition: 'If
you can print money, ignore all the above.'
Clearly, many companies do. According to Price Waterhouse, some 25 per cent
of companies believed that most of their IT projects were unsuccessful
either because they were delivered too late and over budget, or because they
had failed to meet user-needs.
'The results paint a depressing picture,' commented PW. 'With such
significant difficulties in the delivery of IT projects, it is not
surprising that there exists a big issue surrounding the integration of IT
with corporate objectives. The result calls into question the extent to
which the IT functions understand the business.'
The PW result confirms the view of Nick Temple International Business
Machines' general manager for the finance industry in Europe who argues that
data processing departments in financial services companies have become
unresponsive to the needs of the business, (see interview, page two of this
survey).
There are a number of technological developments which may result in some
improvement in this unsatisfactory situation. An important element is the
growth of object-oriented software development. Essentially, to take
advantage of new business opportunities, software has to be developed
rapidly and accurately. Traditional methods of software development are slow
and prone to error.
The principle behind object oriented software is the creation of libraries
of software modules which can be swiftly assembled in different ways to
create new applications.
In the end, however, management attitudes are more important than
technology. The Boston Consulting Group has established a number of rules
for successful computer projects (a somewhat similar list to Mr Stevenson's)
of which the most important are:
Never to commission information technology projects (it is the business
imperative that is important).
Quantify the benefits at every stage of the project (if you do not measure
benefits, you will not achieve them).
Make sure the managers understand their jobs are on the line if the project
fails (in too many cases, nobody has continuing responsibility for a
project).
It gives the example of a big European bank which was considering requests
from its managers for 300 individual computer projects. There was no agreed
way of measuring the benefits, political rather than business needs dictated
priorities and most of the projects were under-staffed.
Initial analysis revealed that many of the projects were unattractive. The
bank refocused its activities so that only the most attractive projects went
ahead and these agreed projects were fully resourced. The result was a
Dollars 400m increase in the economic value (net present value) of the
projects over their life.
Concentration on core competences is the watchword for the early 1990s,
however, and a number of financial services institutions are beginning to
question their involvement in data processing. Some are actively
considering, or have implemented, the outsourcing of parts of their
information technology operations. IBM, for example, is managing the
automated teller machine network of one of the largest building societies.
There is a fine balance, however, between operations which can be outsourced
and those which must be kept in-house. One High Street bank which outsourced
about 20 per cent of its operations told the consultancy Business
Intelligence: 'Financial services these days is so competitive that if you
have an idea - and we have several in the bank at the moment which are being
pursued - there is no way that we are going to let any outside supplier
anywhere near it.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (1): The figures paint a bright
picture - With an anticipated doubling in passenger traffic and increased
cargo activity in the next five to 10 years, most European airports are
undertaking modernisation and expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE

<TEXT>
Air travel has always been regarded as a barometer of overall economic
activity. One has only to visit any airport in Europe, or study the
statistics, to be convinced that the recession of recent years is on the
wane.
The Association of European Airlines (AEA), representing 24 airlines,
reports that the boom in demand so far this year continues. It expects
traffic growth for the year as a whole, in terms of revenue
passenger/kilometres flown, will be up between 8.5 and 9 per cent, with
freight gaining about 13 per cent in revenue tonne/kilometres flown,
'marking 1994 as one of the best growth years of the last 15 years'.
BAA, owner of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in
the London area, recently reported that in the 12 months to end-September it
handled more than 74.2m passengers at those three airports, up 7 per cent on
the previous 12 months. Heathrow alone handled 50.3m, a gain of 7.1 per
cent.
For cargo, the picture was even brighter, with total air freight handled at
the three airports in the year to end- September up by 16.2 per cent to
1.14m metric tonnes, with Heathrow handling 945,417 metric tonnes, up 15.8
per cent.
This is being repeated throughout Europe: almost every airport is crowded,
and not just at peak periods. ACI Europe (the European regional section of
the global Airports Council International), representing 261 airports in 43
countries throughout the region, reports passenger traffic up 7.9 per cent
in the first half of 1994 at 278.5m with cargo up 11.7 per cent at 4.22m
metric tonnes. Aircraft movements were up 2.4 per cent at more than 5m. Many
airlines report strong business. The pattern of travel, too, appears to be
well-spread, with a strong element of business travellers mixed in with
leisure passengers.
Not only are European airports becoming busier, but most of them are also
undergoing modernisation and expansion. It has been estimated - by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) - that the cost of
worldwide aviation infrastructure modernisation could run as high as Dollars
350bn from 1991 to 2010, with airport development alone accounting for
Dollars 250bn of that, the rest being largely for air traffic control
facilities.
The figure, however, covers basic development costs, such as terminals,
runways, aprons and the necessary equipment for operations. It does not
cover the cost of associated infrastructure developments, such as external
road and rail links and other facilities, which are often separately funded
developments. If these outlays are included, the overall cost of world
airport development could be much higher, perhaps about Dollars 400bn.
The precise share of that required by Europe's airports is difficult to
guage, for many development plans are still in process of formulation. But
ACI Europe estimates that between 1993 and 1997 alone, its members
throughout the region will be spending Dollars 22bn on modernisation and
expansion programmes.
These airports have combined annual revenues of about Dollars 13bn, employ
more than 1m people and handle more than 520m passengers a year (both
domestic and international), together with 8m tonnes of freight and 10m
aircraft movements. These figures will rise as traffic grows.
The Air Transport Action Group (a global coalition of aviation
organisations) forecasts that European air traffic of more than 500m
passengers in 1994-95 will rise to about 650m by 2000, and thereafter to
820m by 2005, and more than 1bn by 2010. In a further study on the economic
benefits of air transport, ATAG points out that for every 1m passengers
passing through an airport, between 2,500 and 8,000 jobs are created both
directly and indirectly, with an annual economic impact of between Dollars
130m and Dollars 1.6bn.
ATAG adds that airports also act as magnets for a wide range of industrial
and commercial enterprises, often followed by the development of other urban
infrastructures such as housing, schools, shops, road and rail transport.
This creates further employment and economic growth. BAA says that Heathrow
alone generates 70,000 jobs, and that another 6,000 will be generated if its
proposed Pounds 900m Terminal 5 goes ahead.
But the growing volume of traffic at Europe's airports has generated its own
problems, operationally through congestion on the ground and in the air, and
environmentally through the effects of noise and pollution on surrounding
communities.
Air congestion is being eased steadily by the sheer weight of increased
terminal, runway and air traffic control infrastructures. In many places,
road and rail access are also being improved, but at slower rates, so ground
traffic congestion is often a serious problem, especially at peak hours.
Earlier fears of strangulation of the air transport system because of
infrastructure constraints are now lessened. ATAG points out that the
estimated cost of congestion to the European economy will be about Dollars
6bn annually by the year 2000 against Dollars 10bn estimated earlier, with
traffic lost due to congestion down to 27m passengers a year against an
earlier estimate of 50m.
But the problems are still there: ATAG says airport and ATC capacity
improvements have barely kept up with increased demand. Continued spending
on infrastructure will be necessary to keep pace with further traffic
growth.
There is also a growing feeling that governments and the EU tend to focus
more on road and rail than on air transport, and that in the latter the
emphasis is more on airlines than on airports.
The AEA argues that the emphasis in the EU's plans for Trans European
Networks is heavily biased towards road and rail. In the 34 transport
projects which may qualify for EU financial support under this policy 'only
three air transport projects - airport development at Milan, Berlin and
Athens - are included', says the AEA, adding that most are national
projects. 'None would have the pan-European dimension that the air traffic
control project offers,' it says, a reference to the AEA's campaign for a
unified 'Single Sky For Europe' in terms of air traffic control.
ACI Europe, in turn, believes that in the air transport sector, the emphasis
is biased in favour of airlines, with airports being largely neglected. In
particular, there is a tendency to ignore the smaller regional airports when
governments negotiate international air services agreements.
As Philippe Hamon, director-general of ACI Europe, points out, in such
matters national flag carriers are consulted, but neither the airports nor
the regions they serve receive the same attention.
Environmental issues are inextricably entwined with infrastructure
development. No one likes an airport in his backyard, or even nearby, and
the problem of finding where to put future additional runways and terminals
will be compounded by the need to meet increasingly formidable environmental
constraints.
This is already difficult in the over-crowded London and south-east England
region, and the solution may well require innovative thinking - perhaps even
a return to the concept of an offshore airport in the Thames Estuary.
Elsewhere on continental Europe, Paris Charles de Gaulle has more space
avilable for new developments than most others, but there may well be
problems elsewhere. Plans for a fifth runway at Amsterdam's Schiphol have
already led to a site being selected further away from the city than the
present airport.
In the meantime, as a result of the massive rise in traffic over recent
years and the potential further growth, airports as individual entities are
substantially changing their character.
The daily presence of thousands of people with time and money on their hands
has seen the evolution of airports as important retail centres. BAA is
actively exploiting this.
As Mr Hamon has said: 'In the past 50 years airports have undergone major
transformations. 'They have developed from aerodrome to airport. From public
utility to commercial entity. From administration of a simple function to
management of a complex enterprise. From providers of services to airlines
to enterprises marketing to passengers. From primary facility to intermodal
transportation centre, indeed a platform for many commercial activities and
a partner in economic development.'
He adds that today, as an essential part of the national and regional
economy, this new role of airports 'must be acknowledged by regulators at
both national and European level.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paying little attention to the better than expected interim results, British
Steel put on only a penny at 159 1/2 p with a lively 15m traded as the
market continued to peer anxiously ahead to the next cyclical downturn for
the group.
Having outperformed the market by more than 50 per cent over the past year,
the shares have hit the buffers in recent weeks, lagging slightly on a
one-month view as fears for a cyclical profits reversal sometime in 1996-97
have taken hold.
Cable and Wireless was marginally easier at 383 1/2 p as worries about the
company's Mercury unit continued to dog the shares. There was 5.8m turnover
yesterday as Robert Fleming Securities reiterated its sell note.
In contrast, mobile communications group Vodafone powered ahead in no less
than 6.7m shares traded, rising 9 1/2 to 217 1/2 p in advance of what is
universally expected to be a bumper set of results early next week.
Consumer products retailer Boots attracted attention after it confirmed that
it had agreed in principle to sell its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the
German chemicals and drugs group, for Pounds 850m.
The company was generally thought to have negotiated a good price for the
sale, although more optimistic analysts were left slightly disappointed,
having anticipated a sale price Pounds 50m higher.
The move ended months of speculation over what one analyst called 'the
world's worst kept secret'. After an initial retreat, Boots closed at 513p
ex-dividend, up 5 1/4 , as analysts turned their attention to how the group
would use the proceeds of the sale. A share buy-back operation was seen as
the most likely move.
High street bank Lloyds jumped 13 to 580 1/2 p as dealers said Kleinwort
Benson was poised to release a positive note on the clearer. HSBC rose 7 to
728p on a James Capel recommendation and Barclays was restrained by a
repetition of UBS's long term caution.
Precious metals, car parts and materials technology group Johnson Matthey
put on 10 at 581p as analysts reacted enthusiastically to a possible merger
with metals and plastic business Cookson Group. The potential deal was
described as an important strategic fit. Cookson firmed 1 to 252p.
British Aerospace gained 2 1/2 at 463 1/2 p following news of a potential
Dollars 1bn aircraft order. The group has won a Dollars 420m order for 25
Jetstream 41s with an option on a further 35.
Talk continued that Unigate was planning to buy unlisted Dairy Crest, the
UK's biggest cheese maker. Unigate shares eased a penny to 358p, although
analysts warned that such a takeover could spark a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets saw turnover of 7.5m as the shares hardened a penny
to 140p. The day's trading in the stock included a line of around 1m shares
switched from J. Sainsbury, which closed at 409 1/2 p xd after trade of
3.2m.
High street retailer WH Smith finished 3 lower at 453p, with Nomura said to
have reduced its current-year profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 140m
due to difficulties in trading. Negative press reports on jewellery and
luxury products group Asprey saw the shares surrender 11 to 146p.
Chemicals group BOC improved 6 to 710p ahead of figures expected today.
However, much of the sector was restrained by concern over companies'
inability to pass on the price of raw materials to customers following
Wardle Storeys' figures. British Vita retreated 7 to 222p.
Monument Oil &amp; Gas received support from an in-depth analysis of the sector
published by Smith New Court. The shares were firm at 69p.

FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caught up in first day euphoria - direct running between London and the
Continent started officially yesterday - Eurotunnel jumped 17 to 270p amid
heavy buying from Paris and on talk that several big US hedge funds which
target high risk/high reward issues have been chasing the shares.
Their recent performance has led to head scratching among London analysts,
with the group looking increas-ingly set to miss its own severely downgraded
revenues forecast for this year. The investment approach in France has been
less fundamentally based, however.
Turnover in Paris yesterday was 3.75m shares, more than double the London
volume. Eurotunnel, under 200p less than five weeks ago, is now 5 in excess
of this year's rights issue price.

FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI gets triple boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals leader ICI was one of the stronger performers among the FT-SE 100
constituents yesterday as the company's joint broker turned bullish and the
market focused on the phenomenal rises in raw materials of which ICI is the
main UK manufacturer. Also, investors picked up international earners ahead
of an expected US decision on interest rates. ICI climbed 16 to 771p.
Broker SG Warburg joined the majority of UK investment houses by moving to
'buy' from 'hold'. Analyst Mr Paul Milchrist refused to comment on the
rationale behind the move, but it was believed to have been prompted by the
fall in the share price since third-quarter figures in October that were
accompanied by a sharply raised earnings forecast.
The shares received a further boost from comments made during the profits
announcement from Wardle Storeys, a big user of PVC.
The company, which makes items such as trim and seat- covering for the car
industry, said it had budgeted for price rises of at least 40 per cent in
the six months from the start of September, and Wardle fell 24 to 371p on
concern over the squeeze in profit margins.
ICI's involvement in PVC is modest, but analysts responded to the overall
boom in commodities - Smith New Court expressed its support at the afternoon
meeting.
Finally, many investors were alighting on leading dollar earners in
anticipation that the US Federal Open Market Committee might raise its key
Fed Funds rate today. Any increase would stimulate support for the US
currency.
Dollar strength also helped pharmaceuticals group Glaxo bounce 10 1/2 to
619p. The shares were further encouraged by reports that a new anti-viral
drug being developed by the company had been effective in fighting Hepatitis
B.

FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Late buying surge sees Footsie
approach 3,100 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong support for the dollar and international bonds ahead of today's
crucial decision on the course of US interest rates encouraged London's
equity market to launch another attack on the 3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100
Index.
The late flurry of buying across most international markets produced a surge
of support for the Footsie future and drove the cash market to the day's
best level at the close. The FT-SE 100 settled 19.4 higher at 3,095.3. And
dealers were hopeful of another good showing by UK equities when the market
opens this morning.
Some dealers harboured suspicions that activity in specialist derivative
products, involving specially tailored options, could have played a
significant part in the late drive by leading stocks. Activity in these
deals has played an increasingly large part in the London market in the past
12 months.
Aiding the much improved mood in the market was news of a possible merger
involving two big UK companies, Johnson Matthey and Cookson, which could
produce a Pounds 2.5bn new entrant for the FT-SE 100 Index, and more highly
encouraging news on the dividend front from the leading UK companies as
British Steel pleased the market with a top of the range interim payment.
One of the few minor disappointments for the market was the level of
turnover which, at 492.4m shares, continued the recent run of dismally low
volumes. Last Friday saw the value of customer business just manage to creep
above the Pounds 1bn mark.
Turnover in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 302m shares, more than 61 per
cent of the day's total. Second line stocks failed to register any
significant gains, however, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ending just 1.6
firmer at 3,538.1.
Big gains in the leaders at the close were a reversal of the early trend in
the market, when prices slipped away on very low volume as dealers became
increasingly nervous ahead of today's FOMC meeting at which the Federal
Reserve is expected to hoist its Fed Funds rate for the sixth time this
year.
A 50 basis-point rise is viewed as the very minimum the markets would take
as acceptable if the Fed is to be seen as maintaining a responsible attitude
to containing US inflationary trends. Many analysts would prefer a rise of
75 basis points and many would like to see rates increased by a full point.
The first of a big batch of economic numbers from both sides of the
Atlantic, UK producer prices, were broadly as expected and played little
part in determining events in the market. Along with the outcome of the FOMC
meeting today brings US retail sales numbers, industrial production details
and capacity utilisation figures.
At its worst, shortly before midday, the FT-SE 100 was down 6.4 and being
strangled by lack of interest. Sentiment began to improve over lunchtime,
however, with the stronger dollar and a firm opening by Wall Street
prompting keen demand across Europe.
'The sellers dried up and the futures boys moved in,' said one senior
trader, who added that the market was in a bullish mood at the close.
There was heavy turnover in the banks, where switching out of Barclays was
said to have driven National Westminster and other leading clearers better.
Lloyds were lifted by a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
Vodafone took the accolade as the FT-SE 100's best individual performer,
responding to increasing optimism over next week's interim figures.
The English power generators moved ahead confidently, with the market
looking for the companies to fulfil high expectations for their respective
interim dividends. Payments in excess of 20 per cent are being sought by the
sector's bulls.

FT  15 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved higher yesterday, climbing back above 3,100, but
trading volume remained woefully thin, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The market passed a listless morning but picked up once Wall Street came
into the picture. There was a reasonable two-way business from 3pm onwards
but contract numbers stayed low.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,101 at the close of put trading, up 28
points. The premium to the cash market was around 13 points, with fair value
some 6 points.
A number of major houses, notably NatWest and GNI, were in action during the
afternoon but contract numbers totalled just 8,545, little better than the
8,073 traded on Friday when large parts of the Continent were closed.
In late, screen trading the December future moved ahead a few more points to
3,108 but again there was no real enthusiasm, with contract numbers for the
day staying under 10,000.
Stock option activity was also little changed from Friday, with 31,163
contracts dealt, against 31,129. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for
23,000 lots.
Lonrho was again far and away the busiest individual stock option, turning
over 2,350 lots. J. Sainsbury (855 contracts) and BT (530) were also active.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bounces on rises in
bonds, dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices bounced strongly from Friday's losses yesterday, influenced
by rising bond prices and a strengthening dollar, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28.26 at 3,829.73, more
than making up for Friday's 20.52 loss. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 advanced 3.69 to 466.04, while the American SE composite gained
0.68 at 448.72 and the Nasdaq composite was up 6.06 at 768.18. New York SE
trading volume came to 260.6m shares.
The market was strengthened in part by gains made by the dollar against the
yen and the D-Mark. This boosted bond prices by allaying fears that a
declining dollar would drive investors out of US government securities.
Volume was modest as investors awaited news on interest rate policy expected
to come out of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee. The consensus on Wall Street was that the Fed would boost the
Federal Funds target rate by 50 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent.
Traders were also awaiting other economic indicators this week for hints of
inflationary pressures. Expected today were data on retail sales and
industrial production, and tomorrow should see the release of all-important
consumer price figures.
The biotech sector continued to make strong gains after reports that a major
pharmaceuticals company was negotiating to buy a minority equity position in
Chiron. After closing Dollars 11 3/4 up on Friday, Chiron added Dollars 2
3/4 at Dollars 74 1/4 , towing along much of the rest of the sector:
Genentech gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 48, Amgen Dollars  1/2 at Dollars
58 1/2 and Biogen Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 5/8 . Cellpro closed Dollars
1/4 off at Dollars 15 1/4 .
Chrysler, which was among the most actively traded securities on the NYSE,
jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 amid a tussle between the company and
Mr Kirk Kerkorian, its biggest shareholder. Mr Kerkorian said he wanted to
increase his holding in the carmaker and called on Chrysler to act to lift
the value of the company's shares.
Eastman Kodak forged ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 3/4 after an analyst at
Prudential Securities upgraded the stock to a 'buy', citing the company's
speedy move to return to its photographic roots by selling other assets.
Canada
The Toronto market finished mixed after light trading ahead of today's US
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. One trader said any movement
yesterday was likely to reflect position-squaring in advance of the expected
rise in US interest rates.
The TSE 300 index gained 6.51 points at 4,177.19, but declines led rises by
407 to 314 after volume of 48.3m shares. Venezuela
Share prices on the Caracas stock exchange slipped for the 11th day in
succession, the Merinvest index closing 2.36 or 1.9 per cent lower at
124.05.
Electricidad de Caracas, the market's benchmark stock, shed 12 bolivars more
to 230 bolivars. It has fallen steadily from above 330 bolivars since the
end of September, following the announcement of a Dollars 65m, one-for-six
share subscription.
Investors continued to off-load Electricidad shares in the cash market, said
traders, to take advantage of the share subscription which runs until
December 9.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt climbs on Ifo
profits forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were mostly subdued as they waited for today's FOMC meeting in
Washington and the rise in interest rates that it is expected to bring,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT advanced on the firm dollar and a stable German bond market. The
Dax index closed 10.94 higher on the session at 2,089.29, and improved
further in Ibis trading to end the post bourse at 2,091.04. Turnover fell
from DM5bn to DM4.4bn.
Equities were encouraged by the Ifo economic research institute forecast
that profits in west German industry could jump by 150 per cent to a total
of around DM50bn in 1994.
Financials were strong on the hope that the Federal Reserve may help
stabilise global interest rates, and bond markets, with its decision today.
Allianz recovered DM41 to DM2,416 on the session and Commerzbank by DM7 to
DM326.
Elsewhere it was mostly a day for individual stockpicking. Schering, the
pharmaceuticals group, gained DM9.70 at DM969, encouraged by a full-year
sales forecast of DM350m for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis drug, rising
by 50 per cent in 1995. The market had expected full-year sales of around
DM300m.
SAP, the computer software group, hit a new 1994 high of DM1,003, up DM26 on
a big business deal with IBM of the US; Computer 2,000, which announced a
'strategic alliance' leading to a majority stake in AmeriQuest Technologies
of Irvine, California, rose DM20 to DM460.
MILAN was enlivened by a flurry of late buy orders after a session marking
time ahead of the parliamentary confidence vote on a budget measure offering
a tax amnesty on building work. The Comit index was 0.92 lower at 640.13
while the real-time Mibtel index finished with a gain of 63 to 10,264.
Construction stocks turned in another strong performance on hopes of new
contracts following the recent floods in the northwest of the country.
Unicem rose L282 to L10,512 and Grassetto put on L88 to L1,816.
Shares in electricity companies rose strongly on speculation that they will
take a bigger share of Italy's power generation market following the
privatisation of the electricity giant, Enel. Edison picked up L165 to
L6,726 and Sondel was L55 ahead at L2,530.
Banks continued to be driven by takeover speculation. Romagnolo fell L445 to
L16,166 on news that it had obtained approval to merge with Cassa di
Risparmio di Bologna as a poison pill measure.
PARIS, back from holiday, managed to combine one or two quite sharp
individual gains with a lack of general impetus as the country saw its third
cabinet minister since July resign under a cloud.
The CAC-40 index fell 7.27 to 1,941.08 in turnover of FFr2.89bn. The most
outstanding gain, FFr8.90, or 6.1 per cent to FFr154 in Thomson CSF, the big
electronics group on the French privatisation list, came on the rumour that
the consumer electronics division might be floated off first, and separately
before the defence side of the business.
Meanwhile, Eurotunnel rose FFr1.70 to FFr22.65 on a successful trip for the
first train carrying fare-paying passengers on the new Eurostar express
service.
ZURICH edged lower after a firm, dollar driven opening. The SMI index fell
6.9 to 2,590.9. Ciba fell SFr21 to SFr741 amid rumours, prompted by a press
report, that it was to buy a 49 per cent stake in Chiron, the US drugs
group. Ciba declined comment. Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr5,780 on
news that Mr Peter Simon, head of the pharmaceutical division, was to leave
the group at the end of the year.
Holderbank, the cement producer, picked up SFr20 to SFr1,035 after telling
the autumn news conference that it had no plans to raise fresh capital in
the near future and that its North American branch was set to make
substantial profits for the first time in several years.
AMSTERDAM's international stocks were supported by the firm dollar and the
AEX index picked up 1.23 to 408.92.
Aegon closed up Fl 1.20 at Fl 107.40 on its better-than-expected nine months
results and improved forecast; other financials finished narrowly mixed.
Royal Dutch Petroleum rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 189.50, supported by the firm
dollar while Philips gained 70 cents to Fl 53.20 as last week's US selling
faded and the stock staged a technical rebound. PolyGram rose Fl 1.40 to Fl
76.40.
KNP BT rose 50 cents to Fl 50.30, ahead of third quarter results on Friday
and on the positive outlook for the paper business.
Nutricia closed up 30 cents at Fl 90.10, rebounding on speculative buying:
the market hoped that Unigate would make an announcement about the sale of
its 30.2 per cent stake, Nutricia has half year results due on Wednesday.
TEL AVIV ran into more trouble. Following Sunday's fall of 4.51, or 2.45 per
cent in the Mishtanim index, with mutual funds dumping equities to meet
investor redemptions, equities ran into more selling and the index fell
another 2.27, or 1.3 per cent to 277.31.
WARSAW registered its sixth successive fall, and threatened its 1994 low of
7,215.2 as the Wig index fell another 210.2, or 2.8 per cent to 7,235.9.
Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to 405bn zlotys, and dealers said that they
expected the June low to be tested later in the week.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Today's FOMC meeting
restrains region

<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average closed marginally softer after arbitrage buying
offset earlier selling by overseas and individual investors, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 22.91 at 19,261.45 after a day's high of 19,298.96 and low of
19,115.72. Arbitrage unwinding coupled with profit-taking by foreigners and
retail investors depressed the index, but corporate and arbitrage buying
helped share prices recoup losses later.
Volume totalled 231m shares, against 290m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks gained 0.15 at 1,517.82 and the Nikkei 300 put on 0.20 at
278.70, but falls led rises by 555 to 388, with 228 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 1.77 at 1,252.25.
Traders said investors were cautious ahead of today's US Federal Open Market
Committee meeting, which is expected to decide on an interest rate rise.
Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on earnings announcements. Many
analysts believed that most of this year's earnings growth had been
discounted into share prices, as well as most of the profits rise for next
year. However, Mr Jason James at James Capel said the profits growth for the
whole economic cycle had yet to be factored into the market.
The rise in the dollar against the yen supported export-orientated
electricals. The US currency moved up to the Y98 level for the first time
since October 18. Mitsubishi Electric rose Y4 to Y702, NEC Y10 to Y1,160 and
Pioneer Electronic Y20 to Y2,500.
Tokyo Securities, which announced a Y32bn extraordinary loss stemming from
unauthorised derivatives trading, finished at an offered price of Y570, down
from its Friday close of Y670. Nikko Securities, a leading shareholder in
Tokyo, declined Y20 to Y1,000. Other leading brokers were mixed, with Nomura
Securities unchanged at Y1,870 and Yamaichi Securities adding Y14 at Y699.
Mitsui Fudosan, a leading real estate developer, retreated Y20 to Y1,000
following poor interim earnings announced last week. The company posted a 50
per cent fall in first-half recurring profits. In contrast, Mitsubishi
Estate, another property developer, moved up Y4 to Y702.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 29.02 to 21,293.58 in volume of 114.5m
shares.
Roundup
Today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting restrained a number of Pacific
Rim markets, although others found domestic factors to take them higher.
SEOUL saw broadly based advances in a technical rebound after last week's
four consecutive declines, and the composite index rallied 12.34 to
1,128.57.
A 28-times oversubscription of the state-owned Korea Telecom shares
bolstered others in the sector. Korea Mobile hit its upper limit of
Won12,000 at Won631,000 and Dacom added Won2,500 at Won126,500.
TAIPEI turned back as short-term investors and speculators took profits and
retreated to the sidelines in the belief that the market would stagnate in
the two weeks before next month's elections. The weighted index ended 89.41
or 1.4 per cent down at 6,393.27 in turnover of TDollars 26.9bn.
SYDNEY lost ground on expectations of higher US interest rates, and the All
Ordinaries index weakened 25.5 or 1.3 per cent to 1,926.5, its lowest close
since September 22, 1993.
WELLINGTON was on hold ahead of the FOMC meeting. The NZSE-40 Capital index
closed 22.02 off at 2,054.61 in light turnover of NZDollars 22m. Fletcher
Challenge fell 14 cents to NZDollars 4.25.
HONG KONG ended a lifeless session slightly higher, having reversed mild
losses in late trade, boosted mainly by a jump in shares of Li Ka-shing's
companies.
The Hang Seng index put on 11.07 at 9,378.92 in turnover that fell to
HKDollars 1.75bn, the lowest since July 5.
BOMBAY was again led lower by falls in Reliance and Tata Iron and Steel. The
BSE 30-share index dropped 37.71 to 4,020.99 on selling pressure from mutual
funds busy mobilising funds for several forthcoming primary issues. Tisco
fell Rs7.50 to Rs267.50 and Reliance Rs8.75 to Rs363.75.
SINGAPORE blue chips closed mixed but Malaysian stocks traded over the
counter found fresh demand from retail buyers. The Straits Times Industrial
index firmed 4.35 to 2,326.94, while Malaysian situation stocks rose
sharply, resulting in a 22.92 gain in the UOB OTC index to 1,182.59.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly higher in cautious trade and the composite index
closed 14.44 ahead at 1,044.31, helped by gains in some key blue chip
stocks.
BANGKOK finished firmer on late buying of blue chips, after drifting in
negative territory for most of the morning. The SET index added 11.62 at
1,477.84 in turnover of Bt5bn.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Sweden welcomes EU poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nordic markets put in mostly positive performances in response to Sweden's
vote to join the European Union in Sunday's referendum.
The Swedish markets had already discounted the result, although some
investors had become increasingly nervous when polls, 10 days before the
vote, suggested that opponents to EU membership might be gaining the upper
hand.
In Stockholm, the Affarsvarlden index advanced 34.90 to 1,499.20 as
investors demonstrated relief and optimism at the outcome.
The real estate and construction sub-index was the best performer, gaining
5.8 per cent, supported by lower rates and expectations of increased
domestic infrastructure investment. Skanska 'B' rose SKr10.50 to SKr171.50.
Oslo, facing its own EU referendum on November 28, pushed higher in a
positive, but highly restrained, reaction to the outcome of the Swedish
poll.
The All-share index was up 2.85 at 600.99 as the market hoped that the
Swedish experience might dilute opposition to Norwegian membership. Norsk
Hydro firmed NKr0.5 to NKr247.
Copenhagen rose across most of the board in line with bonds, and the KFX
index was ahead 0.69 at 93.97.
Helsinki was unable to make progress as foreign investors focused on
Stockholm. The Hex index softened 0.27 to 1,931.47.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Masked by a neutral performance in October, the turn from strength to
weakness in the Japanese equity market accelerated last week with a fall of
3.2 per cent in local currency terms, according to the FT-Actuaries World
Indices. However, Mr David Shaw, strategy director of the Legal &amp; General
Group, points out that among the big battalions Japan's weakness stretches
back much further. 'Since the beginning of 1990,' he writes, 'US equities
have outperformed Japanese equities by about 260 per cent in local currency
terms.' L&amp;G reckons that the Japanese stock market should be moving,
finally, into a bull phase while the US equity market stagnates or retreats.
The Pounds 30bn investment house has already made an asset switch in its
international funds based on this forecast, following an examination of the
economic fundamentals in both markets.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Krona moves centre stage after Swedish EU
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona was the main mover on the foreign exchanges yesterday
after a weekend referendum vote in favour of joining the European Union,
writes Philip Gawith.
Although a 'yes' vote had been largely discounted, the market still drove
the krona to a high of SKr4.6530 against the D-Mark, from Friday's close of
SKr4.75. Profit-taking then saw the currency slip back to SKr4.712 at the
London close.
Also in the news was the French franc, where a further political resignation
helped to drive the currency to an 11-month low. It closed at FFr3.44/DM,
from FFr3.439.
Overall activity was fairly subdued, with most market attention focused on
the meeting today in the US of the policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee. There is an overwhelming consensus in favour of the Federal
Reserve lifting the Fed Funds rate 50 basis points, to 5.25 per cent.
With the D-Mark the victim of some selling pressure, the dollar ended firmer
at DM1.5453, from DM1.5280. Against the yen it closed at Y98.425 from Y97.5.
It finished New York trading at DM1.5445 and Y98.30.
Some analysts fear, however, that this will not satisfy the market, leaving
the dollar vulnerable to a sell-off.
Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.2 from
80.3.
After the initial bout of post-referendum euphoria, the market's attention
returned to the underlying economic challenges facing Sweden, causing a
small correction.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, commented: 'The krona is
probably not going to appreciate much more from here, following the sharp
run-up in the weeks ahead of the vote. People realise that joining the EU
will not be the answer to many of their problems.'
The key concern is whether the new government will succeed in putting its
finances on a sounder footing. 'They have to address the fiscal issue if
they want to take part in monetary union,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior
currency economist at UBS in London.
Although the prospect of EU membership is likely to serve as an inducement
to tighten policy, the central bank's efforts to curb inflation could
complicate this process. Mr Turner noted: 'The central bank has shown itself
happy to raise rates if it sees inflation ahead, but that is not terribly
consistent with trying to lessen the debt burden.'
One of the catalysts for further French franc weakness was the weekend
resignation of the co-operation minister Mr Michel Roussin, the latest in a
string of corruption related departures.
'Is there another Italian job in the offing? That is what's bothering
international investors,' said Mr Peter Luxton, economist at MMS in London.
Mr Roussin's departure follows comments last week from Mr Jacques Chirac, a
right-wing candidate for the presidency next year, that unsettled markets.
He proposed a referendum on whether France would join a single currency
arrangement, and also pledged to strive for full employment.
Mr Turner said: 'Once you get within six months of an election, as you are
in France, politics become a much bigger issue for the markets.'
Amid all the speculation about what the Fed may do today, a few facts are to
hand. One concerns market expectations: the December and March Eurodollar
contracts on the Liffe were trading at 93.97 and 93.46 yesterday, suggesting
that the market is expecting rates to rise by around 125 basis points, from
4.75 per cent currently, by the year-end, with a further 50 basis points
tightening in the first quarter of 1995.
Another involves a bit of history. Citibank, in its latest currency
comments, noted that the average cumulative rise in Fed Funds, for any
period of monetary tightening since 1960, is 530 basis points over an
average time scale of 20 months. 'This implies a potential Fed Funds target
of 10 per cent by the end of 1995,' said Citibank. 'However, the current
cycle features relatively lower levels of inflation and our best guess is
that the Fed Funds rate will move to 8 per cent over that time period.'
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.176bn
assistance, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn
shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 per cent and 5 5/8 per cent.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stora raises pulp charges still
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stora, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, said yesterday it planned to
increase long-fibre pulp prices by a further Dollars 50 a tonne from January
1, the sixth price rise in a year.
The increase, which will lift the price of northern bleached softwood kraft
pulp to Dollars 750 a tonne, means pulp prices will have nearly doubled from
their Dollars 390 at the end of last year.
The rebound from 1993's exceptionally low levels has been driven by wood
shortages, rising demand, and inventory build-ups.
A number of North American and European pulp producers have recently
announced price rises as part of a general industry drive to take advantage
of rising demand and economic recovery. The weaker dollar helped to trigger
the latest increase.
Mr Lennart Holm, president of Stora Cell, the group's pulp unit, said he
expected pulp prices to continue rising next year, although at a slower
pace.
'We think that the price will climb to Dollars 840 to Dollars 850 per tonne
by the end of next year,' he stated. Prices peaked during the last cycle at
Dollars 840 a tonne in 1989.
Stora is also increasing the price of bleached short-fibre birch and
eucalyptus pulp by Ecu30 to Ecu580 (Pounds 455) a tonne.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN seabed agency prepares for
its inaugural meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new United Nations agency to monitor the recovery of minerals from the
international seabed is to be launched in Jamaica tomorrow with the
inaugural meeting of the International Seabed Authority.
UN officials say that all the operations of Unisa will be on a commercial
basis, and that the intention is to find an orderly method of dealing with
minerals located on the international seabed, preventing 'chaos and anarchy'
in the world's metals markets.
The authority will be responsible for implementing the Law of the Sea
Convention, a broad agreement on seabed mining that was reached after 11
years of contentious negotiations between industrialised and developing
nations.
The new agency's work will focus on the exploitation of billions of dollars
worth of polymetallic nodules lying on the international seabed, which have
been declared the 'common heritage of mankind', by the UN. The nodules
contain mainly copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, with smaller quantities
of other minerals.
When the negotiations started under the auspices of the UN, it was expected
that commercial exploitation of seabed minerals would have started by 1998.
UN officials now say that seabed mining will not begin until about 2008.
The Law of the Sea Convention also creates Enterprise, the authority's
commercial arm, which will oversee exploration and mining through joint
ventures among private companies and states, and Tribunal, which will
adjudicate disputes over seabed mining among states and companies. The
authority and Enterprise will be located in Jamaica, while Tribunal will be
based in Hamburg.
The negotiations on the convention were drawn out because of concerns among
industrialised states that developing country governments would have too
much an influence on the authority and effectively control seabed mining.
For their part, developing countries feared that international consortia
with significant technological and financial resources would dominate seabed
mining, depriving poorer countries of the benefits.
The treaty that the ISA will administer makes provision for the protection
of land-based producers of minerals found on the international market.
Land-based producers were worried that unregulated seabed mining could flood
markets and depress prices.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices bounce to 4-year
highs - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices bounced to four year highs at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday after absorbing a morning bout of selling associated with the
approach of 'third Wednesday' option declarations.
With that out of the way, buyers crowded back into the market, pushing the
three months delivery contract to a four-year high of Dollars 2,751 a tonne
at the close, up Dollars 68.50. Analyst Angus MacMillan of Billiton Metals
explained that fundamentals remained supportive for copper, with stocks
continuing to fall.
Other base metals followed copper's lead and all ended with substantial
gains.
ALUMINIUM, bolstered by speculative buying and developing supply tightness,
gained Dollars 28.50 at Dollars 1,183 a tonne for three months delivery.
COFFEE futures pared gains to end sharply lower on mixed selling triggered
by stop-loss selling orders in both New York and London and higher exports
from Brazil.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pension portfolios seen opening
up to commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many large pension funds are close to including commodities in their
investment portfolios as a way of diversifying away from traditional
financial holdings, according to Mr Steven Strongin, vice president and
commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
'We are now in a bull market and some investors are taking their first steps
into commodities, but it will probably not be until the next production
cycle when commodities earn a permanent place in many portfolios,' he said.
The perception among many investors is that commodity markets are reaching
the peak of their price upturn. But Mr Strongin pointed out that although
some metals and coffee had swung sharply upwards, many other commodities
were yet to be affected. The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which tracks
movements of 22 commodities, is up 4 per cent so far this year.
'There is a certain pattern to price movements in each business cycle: gold
leads the way followed by the industrial metals with oil coming later and
soft commodities last,' Mr Strongin said. So far, the current price run has
adhered to previous patterns.
Oil has been left behind as other commodity markets have taken a
roller-coaster ride this year, but Mr Neil Bresolin, commodities analyst at
Goldman, believes that lack of investment in production, coupled with
increased demand, will be enough to push prices up next year. 'Oil and
coffee are the most volatile markets so you won't see oil going up in a
straight line, but there is potential for it to ratchet up next year,' he
said.
Global growth will give a boost to all commodity markets. Mr Strongin points
out that strong growth in Asia and Latin America is more closely linked to
rising demand for basic commodities as production in those economies is more
commodity-intensive.
'The specific timing of price moves in different sectors depends on the
build-up of capacity in previous cycles: there will be an increase in soft
commodities fueled by demand from developing countries. But the bumper US
harvest has temporarily dampened those markets,' said Mr Strongin.
Some strong price movements in metals and coffee this year have been blamed
on speculative action by hedge funds ignoring market fundamentals. But Mr
Strongin believes speculation in commodities cannot be sustained for long
periods because of the discipline imposed on the markets by physical
realities.
'The spot markets make commodities unique because they are based on real
physical demand for raw materials. Anticipatory moves in price are difficult
to sustain.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amoco begins drilling for
Silesian coal bed methane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amoco, the US oil and gas company, has begun exploratory drilling for coal
bed methane gas in Poland's Silesian region, where reserves are estimated at
between 400bn and 600bn cubic metres.
Success would enable Poland to cut its dependence on Russian natural gas
imports and boost the share of gas in overall energy consumption from a
present low of 8 per cent.
Amoco won its concession on a 500 sq km plot in the summer of last year but
delayed drilling until Poland agreed in August to extend tax breaks allowing
the company to recoup initial costs with future profits. The company says it
will invest between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m on developing the gas if
the exploration is successful.
Mr Michal Wilczynski, a deputy minister responsible for energy resources, is
confident that the present exploration effort will produce 5bn cu m of coal
bed methane a year by the turn of the century.
Poland at present consumes about 12bn cu m of natural gas a year, of which
half is imported from Russia.
Metanel, a Polish company controlled by Elektrim, a listed energy and
telecommunications equipment company, began exploration work in the same
region last summer in a programme covering seven wells at a cost of 120bn
zlotys (USDollars 5m).
Amoco has promised to drill 15 wells at a cost of Dollars 10m over three
years. Ten per cent of the cost of the programme is being financed by the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector
affiliate.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE cocoa study clears funds of
distortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES

<TEXT>
The hedge fund and institutional money that has poured into the commodity
markets this year has not made futures contracts more volatile nor pushed
prices out of line with physical supply signals, as is believed by many
traders, according to a report to be released this week.
The report, by Christopher Gilbert, professor of applied econometrics at
Queen Mary and Westfield College, part of the University of London, was
commissioned by the London Commodity Exchange and is the first to examine
the activities of futures funds in the London market. It charts fund
activity in the world cocoa market.
Prof Gilbert notes that many institutional investors have been attracted to
commodities since the beginning of the year as a way of diversifying their
portfolios. At the same time, short-term trend-following funds with fairly
large amounts of money to trade have been increasingly active in
commodities.
It is these short-term traders who base their decisions on technical trends
that many dealers blame for exaggerating price trends and increasing
volatility in the commodity markets. However, Prof Gilbert shows that
intra-day volatility in cocoa has changed little in the past five years.
In addition, he believes that there are enough dealers basing their
decisions on fundamental analysis of the market to counteract the effects of
technical trading. 'This suggests that technical trading is unlikely to have
any sustained effect on prices, but does not preclude the possibility that
it does exaggerate short-term price movements,' he notes.
Fund activity does have the beneficial effect of dramatically improving
liquidity in agricultural futures markets, where thinness has been a
particular problem. This addition of depth offsets the exaggerated price
movements generated by fund activity. Prof Gilbert says 'these two effects
appear in general to cancel'.
He also refutes the suggestion that funds have pushed prices away from
physical supply signals, concluding that, on the contrary, in cocoa they
have brought the two closer together.
Institutional fund investors looking to play the long-term trends in
commodity markets have provided much of the growth in liquidity in the cocoa
market, particularly in New York, during the past eight years.
Since last July, funds have also become large holders of cocoa stocks. From
an analysis of US regulatory figures, Prof Gilbert concludes that these
funds hold between 300,000 and 600,000 tonnes of cocoa in the London and New
York markets.
These holdings account for between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the entire
stocks held by the industry.
'The commodity funds have essentially bid it away from the grinders. They
are willing to pay a higher price to control the stock. This reflects their
concerns about inflation, their view that cocoa and other commodities (but
not coffee) remain cheap and the poor performance of other investments,' the
report states.
Prof Gilbert says that the purchase of cocoa stocks by the funds has
coincided with the general run-up in price experienced by the market. He
says funds are not necessarily pushing the cocoa price out of line with
market fundamentals, but that cocoa appears to have been under-valued in
1990-1992.
The report suggests that the large fund purchases in July 1993 may have been
the catalyst that triggered a return to prices more in line with costs. This
points to the fact that 'fund activity has affected the level of cocoa
prices, but in a direction which aligns them more closely with market
fundamentals'.

Gilbert. Available from the London Commodity Exchange from November 24.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move higher ahead of Fed
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices rose sharply at the long end yesterday following a rising
dollar, but volume was light as traders waited for news of interest rate
policy from today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 25/32 at
93 1/2 , yielding 8.073 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 23/32 , to yield 7.011 per cent.
Toward the end of the afternoon, the dollar rose to Y98.27 and to DM1.5446
from Y97.55 and DM1.5305 late Friday. Traders said the rising dollar drew
some foreign investment into the bond market.
Trading was light, however, as investors waited for action on interest
rates. Market analysts expect the Fed to boost the target federal funds rate
by 50 basis points to 5 1/4 per cent at today's meeting, and most say such
an increase has already been factored into the markets.
Inaction by the Fed could cause prices to tumble, while an increase of 50 or
more basis points should cheer the market, which is looking for signs that
the central bank is committed to taking a tough stance against inflation.
Some fear, however, that a 50-point increase could disappoint the market.
In addition to word from the Fed on interest rates, traders will take note
of a series of other economic statistics due out today including figures on
October's retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation.
Most analysts expect both retail sales and industrial production to be up by
0.5 per cent; capacity utilisation - the amount of capital stock being used
to produce goods - is anticipated to be 84.8 per cent.
European government bond markets followed US Treasuries slightly higher
yesterday, with most investors staying on the sidelines, waiting for the
impact on US interest rates of today's Federal Reserve meeting.
German government bonds edged up in the wake of Treasuries, and the December
bund futures contract ended at 90.22, up 0.15 on the day.
Mr Paul Compayne, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, said: 'We are
seeing most of the markets being cautious ahead of the FOMC meeting. That
meeting will determine where markets will go over the next few weeks.'
He added that most participants were already discounting a 50 basis point
rise in US interest rates, saying: 'If there is no Fed action as a result of
the meeting, then markets will sell off.'
The UK government bonds market remained nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting
and a raft of UK data to be published tomorrow. However, gilts prices were
lifted by the rise in US Treasuries and a rumour that the CBI distributive
trades survey, which is due to be published today, would show that the
recovery is faltering.
Analysts were digesting the suggestion that the balance of UK retailers who
had seen a rise in sales in the past year had fallen to a negative 3 per
cent from a positive figure of 28 per cent.
Swedish bonds put in a strong performance on the back of the 'yes' vote in
the European Union referendum, with the yield on the benchmark 11-year bond
falling 23 basis points to 10.88 per cent. On Thursday last week it was
yielding 11.43 per cent.
Mr Paul Donovan at UBS said that the Swedish vote was likely to support
other Scandinavian bond markets, with Norwegian bonds strengthening on
prospects for its entry after the vote on November 28 and Danish bonds
benefiting from international capital inflows to the Scandinavian bloc.
He added that the possibility of a downgrade of Sweden's credit rating by
Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, remained a threat
but that fiscal tightening might avert this.
He said: 'There is a perception that EU membership will provide an external
fiscal constraint on the government. Investors will now look for further
fiscal tightening through spending cuts.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Goldman widens staff
reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global reshuffle at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has reached
Europe with the disclosure that at least six high-level executives based in
London or Frankfurt will move or retire as general partners.
Mr Bob Steel and Mr Rick Garonzik, co-heads of equities and fixed-income
operations, and Mr John Downing, head of equity capital markets, currently
based in London, are to return to New York. Mr Artur Walther, co-head for
Germany, is retiring.
The European operations are retrenching. They have suffered from adverse
trading conditions and will shortly complete across-the-board job cuts of
about 5 per cent.
Goldman yesterday conceded that its expansion from 1,550 employees in Europe
at the start of the year to 1,800 had been excessive. 'We overbuilt a bit,'
said Mr Eugene Fife, chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
Asia, as well as Europe, has seen high-level job turnover, with the
retirement as general partners of Mr Moses Tsang, who led the Hong Kong
office, and Mr Henry James, president of Goldman Sachs in Japan.
Overshadowing all these departures, however, was the surprise resignation
last week of Mr Mark Winkelman, head of worldwide fixed-income operations.
Mr Winkelman left after being passed over for promotion when Mr Stephen
Friedman stepped down as senior partner and Mr Jon Corzine took his place.
Goldman Sachs is a partnership and staff movements follow a biannual cycle
which is now reaching its peak. The firm selects new partners every even
year; and departures and transfers are usually timed to coincide with the
end of the firm's financial year on November 30.
Mr Corzine presented the restructuring as 'generational change that's
essential to make this firm vital'. He said: 'I don't think we are stripping
out the heart and soul of Goldman Sachs.' In Europe, the firm has taken on
14 new partners which, with the six departures, brings the total to 37.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: First closure of Peregrine
fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peregrine Investments Holdings, the Hong Kong-based investment bank,
yesterday announced the 'first closure' at Dollars 500m of its Asian
Infrastructure Fund and gave details of its investments.
The fund, which was launched earlier this year, will invest in Asian
telecommunications, transport and power plants, underlining a growing trend
towards private financing of infrastructure, especially in the emerging
markets.
It has already raised some Dollars 590m. is well on track to meet a target
of Dollars 1bn by the time of its final closure next year and should
eventually match in size the AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund, which closed in
June with Dollars 1,086m committed.
Peregrine's fund is co-sponsored by Frank Russell Company, the International
Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank and investors associated
with Mr George Soros' Quantum Fund.
Its advisory board is chaired by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur
who runs Hopewell Holdings, the property and infrastructure conglomerate.
Three of the fund's initial investments are in Consolidated Electric Power
Asia companies, a group controlled by Hopewell, with Dollars 50m each to be
channelled to CEPA units in Indonesia, Pakistan and India.
The fund has also committed to four other projects: an initial Dollars 26m
in a 108km four-lane toll road linking Chengdu in Sichuan with Mianyang; up
to Dollars 50m in a telecommunications project providing broad band digital
transmissions between Europe and east Asia; and up to Dollars 75m in a 235mW
combined cycle power station in Andhra Pradesh, in India.
The utilities in which the fund is investing offer 'stable and predictable
cashflows, but because these economies are growing so quickly they do have
the characteristics of growth stocks,' pointed out Mr Philip Tose, chairman
of Peregrine.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Bonds: EIB finds firm retail demand for
Dollars 200m of four-year paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the market occupied by the outcome of today's US FOMC meeting, there
were only a few small-sized new eurobond issues yesterday, aimed mainly at
retail investors.
Attention this week is likely to be focused on the Republic of Italy's
Y400bn three-tranche offering of bonds, of three-, 10-and 20-year
maturities, expected to be launched mid-week.
In the dollar sector, the European Investment Bank launched a Dollars 200m
offering of four-year paper priced to yield seven basis points over US
government bonds.
Syndicate managers said that the offering was expensive compared with
existing four-year paper, such as the EIB July 1998 which is currently
trading in the secondary market at around 17 basis points over the yield
curve.
However, lead manager ABN Amro reported firm demand from retail investors in
Switzerland and the Benelux countries. The proceeds were swapped into
floating-rate pesetas, market sources said.
In the yen sector, INI Finance launched a Y30bn issuer of five-year bonds
targeted mainly at Japanese institutional investors. The bonds offered a
spread of 29 basis points over Japanese government bonds.
After completing a series of roadshows in Asia, Germany's Bayerische
Landesbank is poised to launch either a dragon bond or eurobond, Lehman
Brothers said. Lehman has been mandated to lead a deal of up to Dollars
500m, although the exact terms will depend on market conditions following
the FOMC meeting, syndicate officials said.
The Australian and Canadian dollar sectors saw continued activity yesterday.
New South Wales Treasury Corporation launched a ADollars 100m offering of
three-year bonds, which were sold mainly to Japanese retail investors, lead
manager Nomura said.
Nomura said it was promoting Australian dollar debt to Japanese investors.
The coupon of 4.5 per cent offered particularly good value compared with
three-year Japanese bank deposits, which currently offer 2 per cent, it
said.
Rabobank Nederland launched a CDollars 125m offering of six-year bonds
priced to yield 11 basis points over Canadian government bonds.
Lead manager Wood Gundy expects most of the bonds to be taken up by Swiss
and Benelux retail investors. The proceeds were swapped into floating rate
US dollars, sources said.
JP Morgan led a multi-currency offering of collateralised two-year
floating-rate notes denominated in dollars, D-Marks and Swiss francs, for
SMM and reported demand from investors across Europe. There is strong demand
for floating-rate D-Mark assets in particular, an official said.
Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ), a Czech power utility, is said to be
planning a debut Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m eurobond, in a deal
lead-managed by JP Morgan. CEZ, the largest company listed on the Czech
stock exchange, is rated BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazard Investors is to launch an Indian equity fund this week in conjunction
with BK Birla, the Indian business group, and the Bombay-based merchant bank
Creditcapital Finance Corporation, in which Lazard holds 40 per cent.
Lazard Birla India Investment Trust (LBIIT) hopes to raise Dollars 100m for
the fund, which plans to invest primarily in shares in companies listed on
one of India's stock exchanges, securities offered by Indian companies on
global markets, and in privatisation issues and IPOs of Indian companies.
Shares in the fund, which is to be listed in London and Mauritius, will be
sold from Wednesday at Dollars 1 each, with a minimum investment of Dollars
5,000. For every five shares investors will receive one warrant enabling
them to buy further shares in the fund at Dollars 1 on February 28 in any
year between 1996 and 2005.
Mr Adrian Evans, a managing director of Lazard Brothers and chairman of the
LBIIT, expects two-thirds of the fund to be placed with institutional
investors, with the remainder targeted at non-resident Indians in the UK and
the Gulf region.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telco ahead sharply at midway

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), India's leading commercial
vehicle maker, saw operating profit in the six months to end-September
almost double to Rs2.24bn (Dollars 71.3m) from Rs1.12bn a year earlier.
Net profit for the period advanced to Rs562.8m from Rs301m.
Telco said market conditions during the first half had improved
significantly since last year. It added that it had achieved record levels
of production and sales.
The sustained recovery in demand for the automotive sector pushed up vehicle
sales to 53,391 units from 37,507 vehicles last year. Vehicle production
increased to 57,313 vehicles from 25,197.
Cheaper borrowing should also have a positive impact on the company's
performance for the rest of the year.
Meanwhile, Tata Iron and Steel, the flagship company of the Bombay-based
Tata group, said operating profit for the same period rose by 40 per cent to
Rs3.06bn.
This was achieved as a result of a richer product mix and improved control
over costs. Net profits rose to Rs868.1m from Rs46.3m.
Analysts said that although the increase was sharp it was below
expectations. Domestic demand for steel was buoyant, reflecting an increase
in domestic sales of 33 per cent, to 758,000 tonnes.
Exports almost halved to 155,000 tonnes from 308,000 tonnes, forcing Tisco
to concentrate on the home market, and raising its domestic share to 14 per
cent from 11 per cent last year.
Overall production increased by 9 per cent to 1.08m tonnes from 994,600
tonnes last year.
The company said results would improve later this year with the near
completion of its modernisation programme.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Shell to pay L238bn for rest of
Italian venture
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Dutch/Shell is to strengthen its presence in Italy by buying the
half-share of the MonteShell petroleum joint venture which belongs to
Edison, the energy subsidiary of the Montedison industrial group.
Shell Italia, the Anglo-Dutch group's Italian subsidiary, is to pay L238bn
(Dollars 152m) for total control of the refining, transport, storage and
distribution operations of MonteShell, which was formed in 1987. MonteShell
operates 2,200 service stations across Italy, and has a 7.6 per cent share
of the Italian market.
The two companies said yesterday that they had reached agreement on the
sale, which should be completed early next year. The price will be fixed
after MonteShell reports its 1994 results. It is the second big deal struck
by Montedison and Shell in the past year.
The Italian company is restructuring following its near-collapse in 1993,
while Shell is pursuing a programme of expansion in Italy.
In December 1993, the two companies agreed to form a Dollars 3bn plastics
joint venture, known as Montell, which would be the world's largest
polypropylene manufacturer. The deal is still awaiting approval by US
regulators.
Under the terms of the preliminary agreement on MonteShell, Edison will pay
MonteShell L58bn to retain a 50 per cent stake in its liquid gas operations
and in some industrial activities near Trieste. It is believed that Shell
and Edison will also try to sell these operations in due course.
Montedison and its financial holding company Ferruzzi have been pursuing a
divestment programme since last December in an attempt to reduce debt.
Yesterday, Montedison said that the proceeds of the MonteShell sale would be
reinvested to help develop the group's energy sector.
Edison is the biggest of Italy's private energy producers and could benefit
from a liberalisation of the sector after the privatisation of Enel, the
state-owned electricity company, next year.
Shell used to own a substantial network of service stations in Italy, but
sold them to Eni, the state energy and chemicals group, in 1973, pulling out
of the Italian petroleum products market. It bought the small Conoco petrol
operation in northern Italy in 1979.

Y23.5bn

<TEXT>
Suzuki Motor, Japan's largest producer of minicars and the world's
third-largest manufacturer of motorcycles, expects parent operating profit
to reach Y23.5bn (Dollars 24.1m) in the year to March 1995, up from its May
forecast of Y21.50bn, the company's vice-president, Mr Yoshio Saito, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Operating profit totalled Y21.84bn in 1993-94.
The revision was based on higher-than-expected sales of the minivan-type
660cc Wagon R, and cost-cutting efforts in the first six months to
September.
Suzuki, which is 3.4 per cent owned by US carmaker General Motors, announced
first-half parent operating profit of Y14.76bn, up 21.8 per cent from a year
earlier.
The six-month operating profit was a record for Suzuki, surpassing the
previous high of Y13.79bn in the first half of 1992-93.
However, projected full-year operating profit would not match the record of
Y24.61bn in 1990-91, Mr Saito said.
Suzuki revised its forecast for 1994-95 depreciation costs to Y47bn from a
May prediction of Y45.30bn, compared with Y51.80bn in 1993-94.
It left its forecast of capital investment unchanged from a May forecast of
Y30bn, against Y34.20bn a year earlier.

drop

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) is cautious on future earnings after it
posted a drop in both parent and group earnings in the first half, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Foreign exchange market instability and cuts in capital investment in Japan
were cancelling out rises in consumer spending and a bottoming-out in
corporate earnings, it said.
In the six months to September, Sony Music, which is 71 per cent owned by
the consumer electronics group Sony Corp, reported a 5 per cent fall in
parent recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y9.41bn
(Dollars 96.5m).
Group recurring profits in the six months were Y10.61bn, down 16.4 per cent.
But for the full year to March 1995, Sony Music forecast parent recurring
profits of Y20.3bn against Y19.84bn a year earlier, and group recurring
profits of Y23bn against Y25.8bn
For the parent company, new releases by top Japanese and overseas artists is
likely to boost earnings. But the higher-than-expected cost of setting up
two record companies this year and falling sales at a sports goods
subsidiary will hit group earnings.
A decline in sales of Japanese-language records and earnings from financial
investments as well as a rise in the company's tax bill hurt first-half
earnings.

executive share plan
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Boral, the large Australian building products company,
yesterday forced a poll on two elements of its controversial executive share
plan.
Although both proposals were subsequently approved by large margins at the
annual meeting in Sydney, the shareholder action demonstrated simmering
unease among some investors at the proliferation of more generous forms of
executive remuneration.
Shareholders have expressed fears that the country could be about to adopt
US-style reward schemes, while analysts have suggested that - at least in
some instances - the conditions designed to give executives incentives
through share-based remuneration packages are being made too easy.
The first proposal represented an amendment to Boral's executive share plan,
allowing the company to pay up to 1 per cent of operating profit before
abnormals and tax into a trust, which could be used to acquire shares on
behalf of executives.
The second concerned the purchase and allocation of shares worth ADollars
225,863 (USDollars 167,306) to Mr Tony Berg, who became managing director of
Boral in January. Mr Berg was formerly managing director of Macquarie Bank,
the Sydney-based investment bank.
Mr Berg's service agreement states that performance incentives and certain
entitlement in lieu of superannuation are paid to the executive share plan,
and used to buy Boral shares. The permission was sought in relation to
incentives/superannuation earned in the period to end-June.
Opponents of the motions outvoted supporters at the meeting itself. But both
proposals were carried in a poll, with more than 95 per cent of votes in
favour.
At the meeting, shareholders were told that first-quarter results showed 'a
healthy increase' in both sales and profits, and that the full year should
be 'a good one'.

<TEXT>
Japan's leading property developers were hit by declining office rental
rates and a fall in interest income in the first six months of the fiscal
year.
Mitsui Fudosan saw a 50 per cent plunge in recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - to Y4.7bn (Dollars 48.2m) due to a sharp
narrowing of profit margins because of a cut in office rents and a rise in
expenses stemming from sales of luxury houses.
Sales fell 0.3 per cent to Y342.5bn and after-tax profits dropped 43.6 per
cent to Y4.2bn. Product related costs were equivalent to 87.7 per cent of
income.
In the second half, the company expects to post extraordinary losses of
Y80bn related to aid to its finance subsidiary, but it added that the losses
would be covered by profits from shareholdings.
For the full year to March, recurring profits are expected to fall 26.8 per
cent to Y12bn on an 8.2 per cent decline in sales to Y730bn.
Mitsubishi Estate said interim recurring profits fell 4.3 per cent to
Y29.6bn while sales rose 12.3 per cent to Y229.5bn due to its new buildings
in Tokyo and Yokohama. After-tax profits rose 18.3 per cent to Y21.5bn.
For the full year to March, the company expects recurring profits to decline
26.2 per cent to Y35bn on a 4.6 per cent fall in sales to Y420bn.

<TEXT>
Peregrine Investments Holdings, the Hong Kong-based investment bank,
yesterday announced the 'first closure' at Dollars 500m of its Asian
Infrastructure Fund and gave details of its initial investments.
The fund, which was launched earlier this year, will invest in Asian
telecommunications, transport and power plants, underlining a growing trend
towards private financing of infrastructure, especially in the emerging
markets.
It has already raised some Dollars 590m. is well on track to meet a target
of Dollars 1bn by the time of its final closure next year and should
eventually match in size the AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund, which closed in
June with Dollars 1,086m committed.
Peregrine's fund is co-sponsored by Frank Russell Company, the International
Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank and investors associated
with Mr George Soros' Quantum Fund.
Its advisory board is chaired by Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur
who runs Hopewell Holdings, the property and infrastructure conglomerate.
Three of the fund's initial investments are in Consolidated Electric Power
Asia companies, a group controlled by Hopewell, with Dollars 50m each to be
channelled to CEPA units in Indonesia, Pakistan and India.
The fund has also committed to four other projects: an initial Dollars 26m
in a 108km four-lane toll road linking Chengdu in Sichuan with Mianyang; up
to Dollars 50m in a telecommunications project providing broad band digital
transmissions between Europe and east Asia; and up to Dollars 75m in a 235mW
combined cycle power station in Andhra Pradesh, in India.

News Corp, Mr Rupert Murdoch's global media group, has lifted its stake in
John Fairfax Holdings to about 3 per cent, according to an article in the
Fairfax-owned Australian Financial Review newspaper, Reuter reports from
Sydney. The Financial Review said News Corp was understood to have bought
7.3m shares, representing about 1 per cent of Fairfax, earlier this month
for ADollars 23m (USDollars 17.3m).
In July, News Corp revealed it had bought a stake in Australia's oldest
newspaper publisher. The total stake is below the 5 per cent substantial
shareholder notice that has to be lodged with the Australian Stock Exchange.
Fairfax is 15 per cent owned by Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting and 25 per cent by Mr Conrad Black's The Telegraph group in the
UK.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minorco wins battle for Lisheen
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter battle for control of the Lisheen project in County Tipperary,
Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, has ended in
victory for Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American-De
Beers group of South Africa, and Ivernia West, an Irish company, writes
Kenneth Gooding.
Minorco has paid Ivernia Dollars 77m to acquire 50 per cent and management
control of Lisheen. Ivernia immediately beforehand paid Dollars 77m cash to
Chevron to buy the US oil group's 52.5 per cent stake. Ivernia says it
thereby has lifted its share of the Lisheen project by 2.5 per cent, to 50
per cent, at no net cost to itself.
The struggle for Lisheen developed because Chevron in 1992 agreed to sell
its controlling stake to Lac Minerals of Canada. Ivernia claimed to have
pre-emptive rights over Chevron's shareholding.
But this claim had to be tested in the Irish High Court which in September
ruled in Ivernia's favour.

Japan's transport ministry will decide this week whether to go ahead with
the listing of West Japan Railway (JR West) as originally planned, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The government is considering whether to list JR West on Japan's stock
exchanges before the end of the current fiscal year next March, transport
vice-minister Mr Michihiko Matsuo was quoted by a ministry spokesman as
telling a news conference.
'We are in a difficult situation, but we will make a decision soon, probably
by the end of this week,' Mr Matsuo was quoted as saying.
JR West applied in August to be listed on six Japanese exchanges, including
the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange.
Most stock market participants expect the JR West listing to be postponed
following the unsuccessful October 27 listing of another government entity,
Japan Tobacco.

Energie-Versorgung Niederosterreich (EVN), a leading Austrian energy
utility, lifted pre-tax profits by 20.6 per cent to Sch1.08bn (Dollars
100.3m) in the year to August 31 1994, mainly because of cost-cutting,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Revenues of the company, 49 per cent of which has been privatised, advanced
only 2.1 per cent to Sch10.5bn, reflecting the negative impact of warmer
temperatures on energy sales.
Revenues from electricity sales were up 1.9 per cent to Sch7.1bn, while gas
sales eased 0.9 per cent to Sch2.89bn. Heating sales jumped 32.9 per cent to
Sch97m, due to the takeover of heating services for the city of Baden and
other extraordinary factors.
EVN attributed the surge in pre-tax profits to increased volumes,
improvements in energy efficiency and strict cost management. The average
number of full-time employees in the year dropped 5.7 per cent to 2,884.

US anti-trust authorities have launched an investigation into SmithKline
Beecham's Dollars 2.3bn acquisition earlier this year of Diversified
Pharmaceutical Services, a US drug distributor, writes Richard Waters in New
York.
The enquiry, by the Federal Trade Commission, follows its intervention last
month in Eli Lilly's purchase of PCS, a pharmacy benefit management (PBM)
company. After reaching a compromise with Lilly, the FTC said it would
continue to look closely at vertical integration in the pharmaceuticals
industry, which has seen some of the biggest distributors fall into the
hands of manufacturers.
The Diversified acquisition was completed in May, several months after Merck
paid Dollars 6.7bn for Medco Containment Services, another PBM. A Merck
spokesman could not immediately be reached, but that acquisition is also
believed to be under review.
SmithKline said that it had been notified by the FTC of its interest, and
added that 'the procedures that we have in place are responsive to any
reasonable concerns the FTC or other government representatives may have.'

alliance

<TEXT>
Fujitsu, Japan's largest manufacturer of computers, and Sharp, the consumer
electronics maker, yesterday announced an alliance to develop new products
based on mobile communications, information processing and imaging.
The move comes as Japan's electronics industry is beginning to position
itself for the emerging market for products which transcend the traditional
boundaries of computing, telecommunications and consumer electronics.
The so-called multimedia market is expected to grow rapidly over the next
few years, providing new product possibilities for consumer electronics
companies finding it difficult to sustain a flow of new ideas and for
computer manufacturers hit by falling profit margins.
The first development by Fujitsu and Sharp will be a mobile
telecommunications system allowing users of 'Zaurus', a hand-held computer
made by Sharp, to tap into, and extract information from, a data network
operated by Fujitsu.
The two companies said they would be working on ways to ensure their
products could be connected: 'We will work together to develop advanced
technologies in devices and interfaces that can become industry standards.'
The alliance brings together two companies with recognised strengths in
areas expected to be crucial to the development of advanced multimedia
products. Fujitsu is a leader in information processing and communications
systems technologies.
Sharp, for its part, has become dominant in liquid crystal display panels,
and has experience in new personal information tools software through its
agreement with Apple to manufacture the US company's personal digital
assistant.
Fujitsu could learn from Sharp's speed of development and its ability to
bring out hit products, said Mr Mikio Ohtsuki, Fujitsu vice-president.
Fujitsu has been attempting to move increasingly into the consumer market
with the launch last year of a multimedia machine which confers the
capabilities of a personal computer on an ordinary TV.
Fujitsu already provides Sharp with semiconductors while Sharp supplies
Fujitsu with liquid crystal display panels. However, the two companies have
no plans to co-operate in these fields.

Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental
telecommunications operator, posted a 52.2 per cent increase in net profits
to Es4.72bn (Dollars 37.2m) for the first nine months of 1994 compared with
the same period last year, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, attributed the rise to the
beneficial effects of tariff reductions, cost-cutting and returns on
international investments.
Meanwhile, Portugal Telecom (PT), the state-owned global operator formed
from a merger of three companies in July, reported a a first-half net profit
of Es8.1bn on a turnover of Es155.9bn.
Marconi is to be integrated into PT by the end of the year, before the
partial privation of the new group in 1995. The government has not yet made
clear how Marconi's private shareholders, mainly US and UK institutional
investors, are to be compensated.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minorco wins battle for Lisheen
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter battle for control of the Lisheen project in County Tipperary,
Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, has ended in
victory for Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American-De
Beers group of South Africa, and Ivernia West, a junior Irish company,
writes Kenneth Gooding.
Minorco has paid Ivernia Dollars 77m to acquire 50 per cent and management
control of Lisheen. Ivernia immediately beforehand paid Dollars 77m cash to
Chevron to buy the US oil group's 52.5 per cent stake. Ivernia says it
thereby has lifted its share of the Lisheen project by 2.5 per cent, to 50
per cent, at no net cost to itself.
The struggle for Lisheen developed because Chevron in 1992 agreed to sell
its controlling stake to Lac Minerals of Canada. Ivernia claimed to have
pre-emptive rights over Chevron's shareholding.
But this claim had to be tested in the Irish High Court which in September
ruled in Ivernia's favour.
Lisheen is expected to have a life of 13 to 15 years producing an annual
155,000 tonnes of zinc, at a relatively low cash cost of 30 cents a lb.
Capital expenditure is estimated at USDollars 184m and start-up is scheduled
for early 1997.
Minorco owns 24.5 per cent of Ivernia, as does Outokumpu, the Finnish
resources group.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting spurs Austrian
utility at pre-tax level
</HEADLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Energie-Versorgung Niederosterreich (EVN), a leading Austrian energy
utility, lifted pre-tax profits by 20.6 per cent to Sch1.08bn (Dollars
100.3m) in the year to August 31 1994, mainly because of cost-cutting,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Revenues of the company, 49 per cent of which has been privatised, advanced
only 2.1 per cent to Sch10.5bn, reflecting the negative impact of warmer
temperatures on energy sales. Also, gas sales declined because high rainfall
enabled local utilities to buy or generate more of their needs from hydro
sources.
Revenues from electricity sales were up 1.9 per cent to Sch7.1bn, while gas
sales eased 0.9 per cent to Sch2.89bn. Heating sales jumped 32.9 per cent to
Sch97m, due to the takeover of heating services for the city of Baden and
other extraordinary factors.
EVN attributed the surge in pre-tax profits to increased volumes,
improvements in energy efficiency and strict cost management. The average
number of full-time employees in the year dropped 5.7 per cent to 2,884.
The company has agreed further contacts with electricity and gas utilities
in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, and has declared its interest
in acquiring stakes when they are privatised.
Assuming that strong economic growth continued in the company's operating
territory of Lower Austria, the outlook for next year's earnings was
'promising', the company said.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Air NZ expects to top 37% gain
in earnings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Air New Zealand expects profits for the current year to exceed comfortably
the 37 per cent rise in tax-paid earnings to NZDollars 190m (USDollars 118m)
achieved in the 12 months to last June, Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, told
yesterday's annual meeting in Wellington.
He said the company expected to expand its international passenger capacity
by more than 16 per cent this financial year. This would primarily stem from
the introduction of new non-stop services between Los Angeles and Sydney en
route to New Zealand, and new links from Brisbane to the new Japanese
airport, Kansai.
Mr Matthew criticised Canberra for this month's decision to suspend
unilaterally the single market aviation agreement with New Zealand, one week
before Air New Zealand was due to have started domestic services within
Australia.
He said Australian travellers should not 'buy their government's outrageous
proposition' that either Air New Zealand or its government was to blame for
the collapse of the agreement, which would have brought downward pressures
on Australian air fares.
Mr Matthew added that both airline and government had maintained an
unprovocative stance 'throughout this remarkable sequence of events', in
spite of Australian initiatives to angle the competitive environment in
favour of Ansett and Qantas, the Australian carriers.
'Matters must be put right if Air New Zealand is not to find itself
commercially disadvantaged,' he said. 'We hope we will not need to seek
recourse by way of the various remedies available to us under the original
agreement to which both governments are signatories.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Barlow improves on forecasts by
boosting net profits 47.8%

<TEXT>
Barlow Limited, the rump of South African conglomerate Barlow Rand, which
was unbundled last year, has improved on initial forecasts by reporting
after-tax profit of R412.4m (Dollars 117m) for the year ended September, a
rise of 47.8 per cent from the pro forma figures of R279m for the previous
year.
In spite of the sale of several businesses during the year, especially in
its troubled off-shore subsidiary, UK-based J. Bibby &amp; Sons, turnover rose
to R12.87bn, up from R11.76bn previously.
Operating profit rose by 72.6 per cent to R405.2m from R234.8m while
interest paid dropped to R178.3m from R230.8m.
The group's balance sheet remains sound, with the debt/equity ratio at a
comfortable 13.4 per cent and cash in hand of some R707m.
Barlow's successful launch of a Dollars 75m international bond issue also
testified to the company's growing international profile.
Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said the results reflected a stronger mangement
focus in the reconstituted group. He noted that Barlow had also benefited
from the upturn in the domestic trading environment during the second half
of the year following the South African elections in April.
The largest contributor to earnings was Pretoria Portland Cement, which
benefited from increased demand for cement and lime products.
Both PPC and construction subsidiary Federated-Blaikie, which also improved
in the second half, are expected to achieve higher volumes over the coming
year as a result of the government's large-scale, housing programme.
At the same time, increased demand for earthmoving equipment helped Barlows
Equipment to boost earnings while paint division Plascon also performed
satisfactorily. But Barlows Consumer Electric Products continued to suffer
from a depressed consumer appliance market, and J. Bibby's improved bottom
line came only after a major restructuring, involving the sale of non-core
assets to offset heavy losses in operations in Spain and Portugal.
Mr Clewlow predicted that the coming year would see a continued improvement
in group earnings given the reduction in overseas borrowings and the group's
appointment as Caterpillar dealer in four additional African countries.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Czechoslovak Airlines seeks
local investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Czechoslovak Airlines is about to enter talks with Czech financial
institutions that could lead to a new shareholder injecting fresh capital
into the loss-making carrier.
The move follows the withdrawal of Air France from an investment in CSA in
March.
The new investor is likely to acquire part or all of the 49 per cent stake
in CSA held by the Czech National Property Fund, the government body that
owns shares in companies being privatised.
Mr Frantisek Slaby, CSA's executive vice-president for finance and planning,
said the airline had abandoned its search for a single strategic partner to
replace Air France, and was seeking an alliance with a local investor.
'There are (Czech) institutions able and willing to be financial partners of
CSA,' he said. 'The partner would be from the financial sector but not
necessarily a bank.'
Mr Slaby declined to say who the potential local investors might be.
However, one local institution likely to be approached is Ceska Pojist'ovna,
the largest Czech insurance company, which has a 4.5 per cent stake in CSA.
The Consolidation Bank, the state-owned 'hospital bank' that manages much of
the bad debt of newly-privatised Czech companies, and which holds the 19.1
per cent stake in CSA formerly held by Air France, could also be considered.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: A listing in the time of
calamity - Hanover Re has a lot riding on its partial float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first stock market listing of a German reinsurance company for 33 years
 -that of Hanover Re, to raise DM530m (Dollars 353m) - comes at a time of
more frequent natural disasters, higher premiums and a more selective
approach in the industry to new business.
The issue is also one of the first with shares in nominal DM5 units instead
of the usual DM50. These are now allowed under regulations aimed at
encouraging private investors to buy more shares. Next to Switzerland,
shares in Germany are the most expensive in Europe.
With its sister company, Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung, Hanover Re is
Germany's second largest and the world's fifth largest reinsurance concern.
The new issue, in which 25 per cent of the capital is being sold, is the
seventh largest in Germany since 1983.
Hanover Re and the issuing consortium, headed by Commerzbank, hope to
convince German and foreign investors that the company's policy of forgoing
growth in premium income in high-risk areas and concentrating on
profitability will continue to pay off.
In deference to some analysts who thought the issue price might be too high
for many investors, especially foreigners, the voting shares are offered at
DM75 each for subscription from November 18 to 22. Some initial estimates
were nearer DM90.
Mr Erich Coenen, a Commerzbank director, said yesterday the issue price was
attractive, both 'optically' compared with the high price of other
reinsurance groups - Munich Re stood at DM2,750 - and 'analytically': the
price-earnings ratio of 15.8 based on expected 1995 earnings is well under
the German sector average.
With Eisen und Stahl, which is more domestically-oriented than Hanover Re,
gross premium income last year was DM5.3bn, a rise of 30 per cent. The
underwriting loss fell to DM122m from DM263m and net profits shot up by
nearly 200 per cent to DM125m. Group investments totalled DM10.3bn.
Mr Michael Reischel, Hanover Re's chief executive, does not expect growth to
be as spectacular this year or next.
'We have grown enormously over the past three years,' he said. But the group
had resisted the temptation to expand liability levels - risks are simply
too high in certain areas. 'So we expect lower growth over the next few
years. We are cutting back where necessary,' says Mr Reischel.
The message is the same as that last week from Munich Re, the world's
biggest reinsurance concern. Because disasters such as earthquakes, floods
and typhoons have become more frequent, premiums have escalated. 'Assets are
more highly concentrated,' said Mr Reischel. 'Fifteen years ago, Hurricane
Andrew in Florida would have caused a lot less damage.'
The hurricane was the largest disaster, in terms of insured damage, to have
hit the industry. January's earthquake near Los Angeles was the second
worst.
As an example of risk areas where premiums have tended to rise steeply, Mr
Reischel cites Japan where Typhoon Mireille caused heavy damage in 1991.
'The trend for natural disasters seems to be on the rise,' says Mr Reischel.
More damage and more insurance payouts are definitely to be expected.
Because the industry spreads its exposure internationally, this trend
affects premiums in all sectors, not just those where the risk is severest.
'Insurance customers, whether private or corporate, have to pay more if they
want cover,' says Mr Reischel. 'The reinsurance industry can't create money
by magic.'
In the five years to 1993, premiums paid for worldwide catastrophe risks
totalled nearly Dollars 20bn, says Mr Herbert Haas, a director of Hanover
Re. Damage payouts totalled just over Dollars 18bn, but brokerage, interest
and other costs pushed this up to Dollars 25bn, leaving the industry with an
overall deficit.
Thus, many reinsurers and primary insurance companies have pulled out or
been forced out of the reinsurance business. Mr Reischel puts the figure at
more than 100 since 1990. New reinsurance capacity is available from
Bermuda, but Mr Reischel sees this as positive - 'since new investors are
only looking for returns, they will hopefully prevent a rates war'.
Because it was founded as recently as 1966, he says Hanover Re has been
spared some of the worst calamities, such as claims on asbestos or pollution
liability. It has also kept out of the over-crowded London and Singapore
reinsurance markets. However, it is raising its presence in Asia and
Australia, where growth is high.
The company has no acquisitions in mind after buying NRG Victory Australia
Life Reinsurance last year.
Hanover Re will use its DM230m share of the issue proceeds to lift its 4 per
cent stake in Eisen und Stahl, with which it does business on a group basis,
to a 53.9 per cent majority holding. The remainder will go to its parent,
Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie (HDI), a mutually-owned insurer.

Thomson Corporation benefited from improvements in most of its publishing
and travel businesses in the third quarter to post an 18 per cent rise in
earnings, writes Bernard Simon.
The New York-based company, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, lifted
net earnings to USDollars 263m, or 45 cents a share, from Dollars 223m, or
39 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 2.04bn from Dollars 1.86bn.
Thomson Travel's operating profits climbed 15.5 per cent to Dollars 164m.
Its UK package-tour subsidiary achieved a 16 per cent rise in bookings last
summer. Lunn Poly, the UK travel agency chain, is estimated to have boosted
its market share by one percentage point, to 25 per cent. Operating earnings
at the information and publishing division climbed 21 per cent.

Strong growth in domestic sales and a fall in tax charges helped Toys R Us,
the US toy retailer, report a 26 per cent increase in net profits in its
third quarter to October, writes Richard Tomkins.
Net income rose to Dollars 47.4m from Dollars 37.5m, but the comparison was
flattered by a one-time tax charge of Dollars 5m in last year's third
quarter. Without the charge, profits growth would have been 12 per cent.
Sales rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.63bn and operating profits, 15 per cent
to Dollars 96m. Earnings per share, boosted by the company's stock
repurchase programme, rose from 13 to 17 cents, a gain of 31 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Problems at Kmart, the US discount store group, appeared to have worsened
yesterday when it reported a fall in after-tax profits from Dollars 104m in
last year's depressed third quarter to Dollars 39m this time.
It was the seventh consecutive quarter of earnings decline. However, Kmart
had warned last month that profits would be down, and the shares were little
changed. They closed in New York down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 15 5/8 .
Kmart blamed the profits fall on unusually warm weather in late September
and early October, which affected customer purchases of autumn clothing.
It said sales in the core discount store division had strengthened in the
quarter as a whole, with revenues up 2.7 per cent at stores that had been
open for more than a year. However, the increase failed to translate into
profits growth because sales were heavily weighted towards lower-margin
goods.
Group revenues rose 9 per cent to Dollars 8.89bn. Net income of Dollars 104m
for 1993 excluded Dollars 10m of losses from discontinued operations. On the
same basis, earnings per share fell from 22 cents to 8 cents.
Since the end of the quarter, Kmart has sold its 21.5 per cent stake in
Coles Myer, the Australian retailer, for Dollars 928m. It has also cut its
stake in OfficeMax, one of its specialty retailing subsidiaries, from more
than 90 per cent to 25 per cent.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sybase, a leading supplier of database software for large computer networks,
is to acquire Powersoft, a software development tools company, in a stock
swap valued at about Dollars 782m.
The acquisition is the latest in a series of software industry mergers over
the past year.
'This merger will create the worldwide leader in client/server software,'
said Mr Mark Hoffman, Sybase chairman, chief executive and president. Sybase
and Powersoft were, respectively, market leaders in database software and
client/server software development tools, he said.
'The combination of the two companies strengthens our expertise,
distribution, and product solutions to scale from the desktop to the
enterprise.'
The acquisition follows long-standing collaborative marketing arrangements
between the two companies. Sybase estimates that a third of its customers
use Powersoft software development tools.
Based on figures for the 12 months ended in September, the combined company
will have annual revenues of about Dollars 730m, making it the seventh
largest software company in the world. With a combined annual growth rate of
75 per cent, it will also be the fastest growing of the top 10 software
companies worldwide.
Powersoft's share price soared on news of the acquisition, gaining almost
Dollars 12 to trade at Dollars 73 1/4 before closing at Dollars 69 1/4 , up
from Friday's close of Dollars 61 3/8 . Sybase closed down Dollars 2 1/16 at
Dollars 46 5/16 .
Under the acquisition agreement, Powersoft shareholders will receive 1.6
Sybase shares for each Powersoft share.
Powersoft, based in Concord, Massachusetts, will operate as an independent
subsidiary of Sybase, which is based in Emeryville, California.

Canada's Molson Companies plans to narrow its focus to brewing and
specialised chemicals, and to dispose of its retail hardware business.
However, the company also warned yesterday that the present strike by North
American ice-hockey players and a disappointing performance by Diversey, its
international cleaning-services subsidiary, would push earnings for the
fiscal year to March 1995 below last year's CDollars 125.7m (USDollars
92.5m).
Molson owns the Montreal Canadiens, last year's champion hockey team, as
well as the arena where it plays. A dispute over players' salaries has led
to an indefinite postponment of the start of this year's season.
Mr Mickey Cohen, chief executive, said yesterday Molson would leave the
retail sector 'in an orderly fashion' over the next year or two.
The retail interests, which include three chains of do-it-yourself hardware
stores in Canada, generated 22 per cent of Molson's revenues of CDollars
2.97bn last year.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bebear keeps Axa on the global
track - The French insurer's chief is sticking to his international vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing that is guaranteed to provoke Mr Claude Bebear, head
of Axa, the insurance group, it is to suggest his company is essentially
French.
His focus for many years has been firmly international. Mr Bebear was born
in the Dordogne and began his career at Ancienne Mutuelle, a small mutual
insurance company in Rouen (it became Axa after a series of mergers in the
1980s). He has since built it into one of the largest groups in the world,
with more than Dollars 230bn in assets under management.
Fresh from the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in 1958, he was selected as
'dauphin' to succeed the father of a classmate as head of Ancienne Mutuelle.
He qualified as an actuary and worked throughout the company.
Before he was 30, he moved to Canada for two years to work for his company's
affiliate. 'I got to know North America and I understood that France is
something small in the world,' he says.
'I saw that there is another way to think than the French way. You realise
that the way to do business is completely different elsewhere. I had to
adapt to different ways of thinking.'
It is a philosophy he has been committed to as he expanded the group
overseas. At the top are locally recruited management. 'They know the market
and are known in the market.' Below them are international teams who can
bring in new ideas and prove more innovative than the local staff working
alone.
Axa wasted no time expanding internationally. Once in charge, Mr Bebear
quickly began a merger and acquisition programme, first domestically and
then abroad. 'I was convinced that one day the market would change and
become global.'
'You could survive then with a small business. That is less and less true.
Companies are becoming bigger, and laws and liabilities more complex. Even
small businesses are selling products outside France. The market is becoming
more concentrated. You have to be able to follow your customer.'
While arguing for diversification to reduce dependency on a single economy,
he stresses it is important for Axa to remain strong in France. 'We need to
be among the leaders in a market. It is better not to be in too many markets
but strong in a few,' he says.
That said, Mr Bebear is sure the future for his business lies in Asia. This
summer he began operations in Japan and Axa also has a representative office
in Beijing. 'I'm convinced that in 20 or 30 years from now the Asian market
will be the biggest in the world,' he says.
'The time to go is when the market is starting, so you can grow with the
market.'
The global vision makes it all the more painful for him to recall a recent
visit by a US credit rating agency which raised concerns about Axa's French
casualty business when it represents just 18 per cent of the group's
business. 'We are seen as a French company,' he says. 'We want to show that
we are becoming more and more global.'
This helps explain why he is keen to have stock market listings for Axa:
first in New York next year, and then probably in London and Tokyo by 1997
at the latest. 'It is important to raise money elsewhere,' he says. 'The
French market is too small, and US pension funds prefer to invest in a
company quoted there.'
His sensitivity to being perceived as running an essentially French company
is also reflected in a Dollars 9m-a-year advertising campaign launched last
month and aimed at international decision-makers.
He acknowledges, however, that some foreign investors are suspicious of the
fact that Axa is controlled through a complex structure. Only 49 per cent is
publicly held and the remainder is with seven insurance mutuals and several
cross-shareholdings, which prevents any risk of takeover.
'I am very happy with the arrangement,' he says. 'We are not in danger, no
one can buy us. It means we can invest even if we know the market is against
us or unable to understand us. It keeps us out of the reach of raiders.'
He does not rule out the possibility of relinquishing the controlling
shareholding of the mutuals, but is concerned that this could lead to a
takeover. 'I see Mr (Michael) Milken is back in business in the US.'
As for Axa's future, there is a paradox. Mr Bebear has become known for
developing a group stripped of hierarchy, with authority delegated and
formality removed. 'We have to tell managers they are not there to give
orders to other people but to help them grow.'
On the other hand, the company is clearly dominated by him. In the early
1980s, just before it became Axa, it was in danger of becoming known as
'Groupe Bebear', as one insider puts it.
'His company is not very hierarchical,' says the director of a rival
insurer. 'But nothing gets done without Bebear's knowledge or specific
approval.'
That prompts the question of what happens when he leaves. Now aged 59, he
says he plans to start 'reducing his involvement' from next year. He says no
decision has finally been taken on his successor but he has written a letter
of recommendation in case anything happens to him unexpectedly.
The choice could prove just as important as any of Axa's international
plans.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Viacom profits up seven-fold in
third quarter
</HEADLINE>

Acquisitions helped Viacom, the fast-growing US entertainment and media
group, to a seven-fold rise in earnings a share in the third quarter.
The results included a first-time contribution from Paramount
Communications, acquired for Dollars 9.6bn earlier this year.
However, they have yet to reflect Viacom's Dollars 8.4bn acquisition of
Blockbuster, the video and music retailer, or its Dollars 1.1bn sale of
Madison Square Garden.
Net earnings were Dollars 327.3m, compared with Dollars 30.9m, before
extraordinary items, and earnings a share were Dollars 1.32 against 18
cents. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 508m.
Mr Frank Biondi, president, said the inclusion of Blockbuster would improve
results further. 'Our prospects for the fully integrated company, when all
our operations are reflected and we begin to benefit from the many
cross-divisional activities now under way, are tremendously promising,' he
said.
Blockbuster's sales in the nine months to September were up 42 per cent to
Dollars 2.1bn and net profits by 26 per cent to Dollars 360.2m.
Earnings from Viacom's television networks were up strongly, largely because
of higher advertising rates and subscription revenues. However, profits from
cable TV fell by 33 per cent, after a 12 per cent fall in the previous year,
as a result of government-imposed cuts in cable rates.
Among the activities acquired with Paramount, feature films earned Dollars
86m on sales of Dollars 431m in the quarter (no comparable figures were
given).
Viacom said the quarter had been helped by such US releases as Naked Gun 33
1/3 and Forrest Gump. Television programming earned Dollars 18.7m, affected
by lower syndication sales. Paramount Parks earned Dollars 30.3m, affected
by lower attendances and higher costs.
The publishing division, also acquired with Paramount, earned Dollars 175m
on sales of Dollars 701m. Results were helped by Paramount's own Dollars
553m purchase of Macmillan, part of the bankrupt Maxwell empire, at the
start of the year.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tabacalera looks abroad for
expansion targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tabacalera, the Spanish tobacco group, said it was actively looking at
several overseas markets to identify expansion opportunities, Reuter reports
from Madrid.
'We are looking at the fastest growing markets which would be the most
interesting for us,' said Mr Calixto Rios, financial director, announcing a
104 per cent improvement in group nine-month pre-tax profits.
It set up a joint venture this year with ZPT Radom in Poland, where it
produces its new Winns brand. Cigarette consumption in Spain is falling by
0.7-1.0 per cent a year, he said. Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia,
however, offer potential for growth.
The group's nine-month pre-tax profits rose to Pta13.05bn (Dollars 106m)
from Pta6.4bn in the same period last year, as sales of premium brands rose
due to a crackdown on smuggling. Costs fell as a result of lay-offs. Group
net sales rose to Pta535.77bn from Pta456.3bn.
Sales of the top of the range Philip Morris and Reynolds brands, such as
Marlboro and Winston, which Tabacalera makes under licence, were
particularly buoyant. These are the types most popular with smugglers.
'The results have evolved very much in line with expectations. We hope the
final quarter will be similar and we are sticking to our original
forecasts,' Mr Rios said.
The company expects to cut the workforce by 750 people, or nearly 9 per
cent, by the end of the year.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Groups bid for Spanish telecoms
licence

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two consortia, both predominantly backed by domestic capital and each
including foreign operators, entered their bids yesterday for Spain's second
mobile telephone licence. The licence will be awarded by the Spanish
government before the end of the year.
The competition pits the Cometa-SRM consortium, which has Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya as its biggest individual shareholder, against
Airtel-Sistelcom-Raditel backed by Banco Central Hispano and Banco
Santander.
The contest to operate a Global System for Mobiles (GSM) mobile digital
network, which will compete with one reserved for Telefonica, the
state-controlled communications group, is the first big step in a
deregulation package which, over the next three years, will introduce cable
television and end Telefonica's monopoly as a national basic telephony
operator.
'This is the most significant investment challenge in Spain to date because
it involves the break-up of voice monopoly,' said Mr Claudio Boada, managing
director in Spain of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which is
advising the transport and communications ministry.
The bid is one of the biggest domestic investment outlays on record to
capture what is regarded as a very high growth market. There are some
400,000 subscribers for Telefonica's existing analogue cellular system. Mr
Boada believes that over the next 10 years the GSM system will win a 12 per
cent market penetration in Spain and 4m subscribers.
The consortia must bid a minimum of Pta50bn (Dollars 393m) to obtain the
licence, but analysts believe the real net value of the licence could be
some Pta160bn. The winning consortium will then face an initial investment
of some Pta120bn.
Officials say the bids will begin to be reviewed next week, and the decision
will be announced by December 31.

network

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW is to open a new Dollars 600m car manufacturing facility in the US
today. Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder, chairman, described the Spartanburg plant
yesterday as 'only the first' of a global network of manufacturing sites
which will preclude further expansion in Germany.
BMW sees the plant as by far the single most important manufacturing step it
has taken outside of Europe.
Mr Pischetsrieder insisted the plant, where 570 employees earn little more
than one-half of their German counterparts, and which - on current exchange
rates - has costs some 30 per cent lower, was not a signal that BMW was
'emigrating' from manufacturing in Germany.
However BMW's four existing plants could meet all foreseeable demand for its
cars in Europe, within its strategy of remaining an 'exclusive' carmaker
with a world market share of around 2 per cent.
'We don't want to grow in Europe,' said Mr Pischetsrieder. BMW would now
concentrate on developing a global component supply infrastructure and
manufacturing network for the BMW and Rover brands, he said.
BMW has declared a long-term goal of producing 90,000 cars a year at the US
plant, probably before the end of the decade. But according to Dr Helmut
Panke, chairman and chief executive of BMW (US) Holding, and in charge of
all BMW's North American activities, the plant may have to expand further -
to 120,000 or 130,000 units annually - if BMW is to achieve the full
benefits of flexibility within a global production system.
'In the long run there will be other opportunities . . . that's why we have
a 1,000-acre (Spartanburg) site.'
Although only being formally opened today, the plant has been in limited
production since September. It is making only 12 cars a day but this is due
to rise to 150 a day by the middle of next year and 300 a day in 1996.
Initial production is of 3-series saloons, to be joined by a new open
two-seater next September.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Schering chief forecasts annual
profits ahead 10% at DM310m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Schering, the German pharmaceuticals group, will rise this year
by 10 per cent to DM310m (Dollars 202m) and turnover by between 12 per cent
and 14 per cent, Mr Giuseppe Vita, board chairman, said yesterday. He said
the dividend would 'at least' match last year's DM14.22.
Mr Klaus Pohle, chief financial officer, said he expected group sales to
increase by about 8 per cent a year until the end of the century, more than
4 percentage points higher than the industry's expected average growth. This
would boost Schering's turnover to DM7bn-DM8bn.
Growth is attributed to the wider marketing of the Betaseron drug, a
treatment for multiple sclerosis; the introduction of Levovist, an
ultrasound drug; and the recent decision to refocus on pharmaceuticals.
In the first nine months of this year, net profits rose 8 per cent to
DM210m, compared with the same period in 1993, while turnover increased by
14 per cent to DM3.52bn. Net profits for the whole of 1993 totalled DM254m,
with turnover at DM5.3bn.
The optimistic forecasts for the next five years stem from Schering's
decision two years ago to divest its industrial chemicals and natural
substances divisions, and hive off its agro-chemical divisions into a joint
venture with Hoechst, which took effect last January.
Mr Vita said he expected the Betaseron drug, currently only on sale in the
US, to obtain approval for distribution in Canada in the middle of next
year, as well as in some European countries.
'We expect turnover of Betaseron to increase to DM350m by the end of this
year,' he said. Turnover for the first nine months totalled DM230m. The
Levovist drug would boost sales by between DM300m and DM500m.
Turnover for Cyproteronacetat, or CPA, a drug containing hormonal treatments
and which is used for contraceptives, fell 3 per cent between September and
October following unconfirmed reports that the drug contained a carcinogen,
a substance that encourages the growth of cancer.

change

<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland shareholders have been recommended to vote against
the board's controversial proposal to convert its registered shares into
bearers. The advice, in what is a setback for UBS, comes from a leading US
adviser to institutional investors on corporate governance issues.
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory service, said the
UBS board's proposal, which will be put to an extraordinary meeting of
shareholders next Tuesday, violated the principle that basic company
structures should not be altered in the midst of a battle over control.
The governance of UBS is being challenged by BK Vision, an investment
company that is its largest shareholder. BK, controlled by maverick Zurich
broker Mr Martin Ebner, is seeking to rally a majority of shareholder votes
at the next general shareholders' meeting in April to make substantial
changes to the bank's board and strategy.
UBS has claimed the challenge had an unfair chance of succeeding because its
backers were accumulating large numbers of registered shares.
The par value on the registered shares is one fifth that of the bearers.
Investors can thus acquire votes more cheaply by buying registered shares
than by buying bearers.
ISS, founded 10 years ago by Mr Bob Monks, a pioneer of the US corporate
governance movement, said the move by the bank to strip the registered
shares of their extra voting power without compensation was unacceptable.
'While we agree that allowing any shareholder to influence or control the
bank without controlling a majority of its share capital would be improper,
allowing the bank to disenfranchise and cause economic damage to a whole
class of shareholders because of a dispute about strategy with one
individual is also improper,' ISS said.
The recommendation from ISS, which provides advice on worldwide proxy voting
for some 75 institutional investors, is a setback for UBS.
The bank is counting heavily on the support of non-Swiss shareholders,
saying as holders of bearer shares they can only benefit if the motion is
passed.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Elektrowatt net income falls
just short of record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elektrowatt, the Swiss power generation and engineering group, said net
income in the year to September 1994 was slightly below the previous year's
record SFr212m (Dollars 165m). No figure was given.
Mr Oskar Ronner, chief executive, said the group was hit hard by the
strength of the Swiss franc. Consolidated sales rose only 3 per cent to
SFr4.9bn and new orders were up 8 per cent.
He added that the group would at least maintain its dividend and held out
the possibility of a special bonus payment in recognition of its jubilee.
Elektrowatt, in which the CS Holding financial services group has a 46.3 per
cent stake, said sales of electric power were 4 per cent higher at SFr1.7bn.
The engineering and contracting division lifted sales 6 per cent to SFr900m,
but incurred a loss because of provisions on two projects.
Holderbank Financiere Glarus, the world's largest cement producer, expects
consolidated net income to jump 48.1 per cent to SFr425m in 1994, due to
improved results of subsidiaries in Europe and North America. Net sales
would rise 3.2 per cent to SFr8.7bn, with shipments of cement and clinker
rising 6.5 per cent to 49.2m tonnes, it said.
Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, said Holderbank planned to launch a
programme of American depositary receipts in the US next year.

doubling by year 2000

<TEXT>
The stock market value of Germany's Hoechst chemicals and drugs group will
double by the end of the decade, following restructuring and a management
shake-out, Mr Jurgen Dormann, chairman,said.
Mr Dormann, who has made wide changes in management and operations since
taking over in May, also aims to double sales in Asia from 10 per cent to 20
per cent of group turnover.
Outlining his ambitious programme, he told the Financial Times he would
continue looking for a further 'two or three' mid-sized pharmaceuticals
companies to add to Hoechst's recently-acquired US interests in generic
drugs.
However, he would wait until prices became more reasonable. Hoechst had
'perhaps' paid too high a premium in last year's purchase for Dollars 546m
of a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a US generic drugs maker, he said.
Industrial gas production would be expanded with a newly-approved scheme to
invest DM500m (Dollars 327.22m) in the company's Messer Griesheim
subsidiary.
Hoechst had taken a risk spending heavily on moving into emerging east
European markets, but all its new businesses there had become profitable
within 12 to 18 months of start-up. Negotiations were under way for several
joint ventures in China.
In one of the chemical industry's most persistent problem sectors, Mr
Dormann said further measures might be necessary to reinforce Hoechst's
restructured PVC production. Most of its operations were merged last year
with those of Wacker of Germany into a new company, Vinnolit, which accounts
for some 10 per cent of west European production capacity. But this was not
enough, Mr Dormann indicated, and there could be room for a third partner.
Combined with structural changes effective from January 1, which will reduce
the number of operating divisions from 15 to seven and transfer
responsibility for divisional strategy and profits to their managers, the
result would be 'a doubling of our share price by 2000', Mr Dormann said.
He also revealed he was reconsidering his plans, drawn up in his previous
job as chief financial officer, for an initial public offering of shares in
the US subsidiary, Hoechst Celanese. An international placing of shares in
electrodes subsidiary Sigri Great Lakes Carbon, however, was still set for
next spring.
The placement plan for Celanese was originally intended to consolidate its
independent status, but Mr Dormann said his decentralisation project should
serve the same purpose. 'We will know in another 12 months,' he said.

News International is planning to amend its Articles of Association
following an issue of bonus preference shares by News Corporation, its
Australian parent.
Special dividend shares in News International are governed by a formula that
links the dividend paid to the dividend on ordinary shares in News Corp. The
shares are intended to reflect the rights and entitlements of ordinary
shareholders in News Corp.
The formula is now deemed inadequate because of the peculiar nature of the
bonus preference shares issued by News Corp on a 1-for-2 basis at the end of
September.
An amendment to the formula has been drawn up to protect the economic
interests of the special dividend holders in News International. It will be
put to them at a meeting early next year.

Sharply improved gross rental income and a reduced interest burden helped
James Smith Estates, the provincial property investment company, report a 72
per cent interim profits expansion.
Mr Stephen Mulliner, chairman, said the company had made purchases totalling
Pounds 3.3m since the end of the half-year and was seeking further
portfolios and individual properties 'which meet our investment criteria'.
The pre-tax line for the six months to September 24 jumped to Pounds 1.34m
(Pounds 775,000) reflecting a 42 per cent growth to Pounds 1.65m (Pounds
1.16m) in rental income and interest payable of just Pounds 93,000 (Pounds
237,000) following the Pounds 12.3m placing and open offer in March.
The interim dividend goes up to 1.7p (1.55p), payable from earnings of 4.1p
(3.37p) per share.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bett Bros rises 36% to Pounds 5.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bett Brothers, the Dundee-based housebuilding, property and inns group,
lifted pre-tax profits by 36 per cent, from Pounds 4.36m to Pounds 5.93m, in
the year to August 31.
Last time there was a Pounds 2.4m credit from the refinancing of an
associate.
The improvement reflected increased activity and profit in all three
divisions despite the tough trading environment, the directors said.
Housebuilding contributed Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 18m) to sales and Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 2.5m) to operating profits. Property and investment turnover was
Pounds 4.32m (Pounds 2.84m) with profits at Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.49m),
while in pubs and hotels turnover and profits were Pounds 5.07m (Pounds
4.5m) and Pounds 1m (Pounds 942,000) respectively.
Gearing of only 29 per cent formed a basis for expansion, directors said.
They intended to invest in each of the operating areas, mainly in extending
geographic coverage, particularly in central Scotland where a start had
already been made in housing.
Earnings per share increased to 32.56p (21.84p) and the dividend is raised
from 2p to 4.5p via a proposed final of 3.25p (1.5p).

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Siebe buys US group for Dollars 90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls group, has agreed to pay Dollars 90m
(Pounds 54.8m) for Triconex, a US company which makes critical process
safety shutdown systems for the chemicals, oil and gas industries.
The UK-based group will make a tender offer worth Dollars 17.75 a share; the
deal has been recommended by the board and senior management of
California-based Triconex, which is quoted on Nasdaq.
Triconex pioneered triple modular redundant (TMR) technology for the process
industry.
Siebe said this provided a similar level of safety to that available to the
aerospace industry, at an extremely competitive cost.
TMR architecture utilises three parallel components throughout the system,
so the failure of any single component will not cause an interruption in
control.
Siebe said Triconex was not only the recognised leader for such safety
systems, but had also been instrumental in making this technology the
industry standard.
Triconex, founded in 1983, has achieved rapid sales growth, particularly
during the past five years. In the year to September 30, it made net income
of Dollars 5.2m on sales of Dollars 48.8m. It has net assets of Dollars 36m.
Its equipment has been used for many years by Foxboro, Siebe's
Massachusetts-based subsidiary, which has been gaining market share with its
Intelligent-Automation process control systems.
Siebe said safety shutdown systems were the fastest growing part of the
process control industry.
Although it was paying a high multiple of earnings for the US company,
Triconex was already achieving Siebe-style margins and was being bought for
its potential.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Associates' turnround buoys British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A much bigger than expected turnround at associated companies, combined with
more than trebled trading profits from its own business, helped British
Steel to announce its best interim results since the 1990-91 year.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 rose from Pounds 27m to
Pounds 159m, on turnover ahead from Pounds 1.97bn to Pounds 2.2bn.
Earnings per share jumped from 1p to 6.49p and the interim dividend is
raised from 0.5p to 2p.
In its trading statement, the company highlighted the 'major improvement' in
the results from its main associated undertakings.
These include Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer,
and UES Holdings, the UK engineering steels and forgings concern.
Analysts had been pencilling in a contribution of about Pounds 20m from
associates, against a loss of Pounds 8m in the previous first half. In the
event, they contributed Pounds 41m, a performance which reflected
rationalisation and cost reductions.
Avesta Sheffield, in particular, was spurred by increased demand and selling
prices.
It now appeared well positioned to benefit from the current improved trading
conditions, the company said.
In September, British Steel paid Pounds 85m to increase its stake in the
company from 40 per cent to 49.9 per cent. It had previously spent Pounds
20m taking up its share of an Avesta rights issue.
The recovery at Rotherham-based UES, in which British Steel has a 60.9 per
cent stake, was less marked.
It lost Pounds 48.1m before tax in 1993, but has since been trading
profitably.
GKN, which owns the other 39.1 per cent, has made it clear that it does not
consider the company to be a core business.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said his
company was a long-term investor in UES. He added, however, that the company
was still 'not as efficient as we would like it to be'.
On British Steel's own trading position, Mr Moffat said the improvement in
UK demand in the latter part of its last financial year had continued into
the first half.
The emerging recovery in mainland Europe had also strengthened.
As a result, sales volumes had increased by 6 per cent to 5.9m tonnes,
selling prices had continued upwards, and trading profit had jumped from
Pounds 38m last time to Pounds 120m.
Capital spending in the first half rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 43m. Net debt
was Pounds 4m at the end of the period, after the additional Pounds 105m
investment in Avesta Sheffield. This compares with net funds of Pounds 37m
at the end of fiscal 1994.
The effective tax rate for the half year fell from 22 per cent to 17 per
cent, following the writeback of ACT previously written off, and, in
associates, the utilisation of tax losses brought forward.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Renold jumps to Pounds 4.6m as orders
increase 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Renold almost doubled in the six months to October 1,
when the chain and gear manufacturer experienced a 20 per cent rise in
orders.
The Manchester-based company yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.6m (Pounds 2.4m) on turnover up 8 per cent to Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.4m),
despite lower sales in the machine tools and rotors division.
Operating margins improved from 5 to 7 per cent, after a lengthy
restructuring which has cut the workforce by 30 per cent to 2,600 in the
last four years.
Profits were also lifted by lower redundancy costs of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds
500,000) and a reduction in interest costs from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds
600,000.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said: 'During the bad days, the company
invested a hell of a lot in the factories. That new equipment is producing
the goods now and generating a good cash stream.'
Profits improved at the chain operations, where the UK plants reported
higher sales in both domestic and export markets. Chains account for 60 per
cent of group turnover.
Demand recovered for the automotive timing chain produced in Calais, as US
motor manufacturers aim to replace belts with longer-lasting chains to drive
camshafts.
The gears division reported a 35 per cent increase in orders after
attracting contracts for escalators in underground transport systems,
including London's Jubilee line.
The machine tools division is expected to improve sales in the second half,
including orders from the air conditioning and food distribution industries
in Japan and Russia.
Mr Cotterill said the company would seek to acquire bolt-on businesses to
complement its present activities. It was also planning to lift capital
expenditure from its present Pounds 2.5m.
Gearing fell from 19 to 2 per cent at the half-year stage as net borrowings
decreased to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 10.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 5.5p (2.9p) and the interim dividend is lifted
from 0.7p to 1.2p.
The shares closed up 4 1/2 p to 178 1/2 p yesterday.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo returns to the acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalamazoo, the Birmingham-based computer services and printed systems group,
has made its second acquisition of the financial year with the purchase of
WIS Computer Systems for up to Pounds 5.79m in cash and shares.
'There is more to come. We've been quite busy. There are a number of
discussions in the pipeline,' said Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive. In
August, Kalamazoo said it expected to spend up to Pounds 20m this year on
expanding its computer services business.
The initial payment for WIS, a privately owned Cardiff company, is Pounds
1.52m in cash and Pounds 270,644 in new Kalamazoo shares. A further
consideration of up to Pounds 4m in cash and shares depends on the net
results of WIS in the years to January 1998.
The effect of the share issue, combined with the shares issued under
employee share option schemes announced in January, will be to dilute the
holding of Kalamazoo Trust to less than 50 per cent for the first time since
it was set up in 1948.
Earlier this year the trust, established to ensure that employees had
majority ownership, agreed to accept dilution, thus giving the board the
choice of using Kalamazoo paper to make acquisitions.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Aim contract
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings, has won a North American
contract with a potential value of more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 30.4m).
At the same time, however, it warned that low production levels would hit
current year profits.
Mr Jeff Smith, chairman, said that 'while this contract award further
strengthens the already excellent outlook for 1995-96, the current year
remains difficult with low levels of production, particularly in the first
half, and full year profits may be lower than last year.'
He said, however, that the group was well placed to cope with significantly
increased production rates resulting from the new contract and the Saab 2000
contract.
Aim Aviation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is to supply Northwest Airlines,
the Minneapolis-based carrier, with integrated interiors for its fleet of
Douglas DC9-30 aircraft.
The initial order for 40 aircraft sets is valued at more than Dollars 22m
(Pounds 13.4m) with deliveries to commence in May 1995. Northwest has also
an option on a further 66 aircraft sets.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Revamped UK Estates cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Estates, which changed its name from Sheafbank Property Trust in March
following a financial restructuring, reported reduced pre-tax losses for the
year to June 30 and said that dividends, halted in 1992, were likely to be
resumed in the new year.
Gross income improved to Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 805,000) including Pounds
1.64m from money broking; discussions for a management buy-out of the latter
are under way and disposal would complete the group's withdrawal from
financial services.
Operating profits were Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 260,000). Net interest charges
of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 600,000) left the pre-tax loss at Pounds 650,000
(Pounds 1.76m). Losses per share were 2.58p (10.41p).
March's reconstruction included a placing which more than doubled the equity
base; shareholders' funds at end-June amounted to Pounds 16.6m, up from
Pounds 6.45m a year earlier.
Since the period-end the group has sold its Parkway industrial estate at
Trafford Park, Manchester, for Pounds 3.6m, 20 per cent above valuation in
February. This had underpinned the outcome according to Mr David Gradel,
chairman, and would allow the resumption of dividends, starting with the
preference distribution scheduled for January 1.

FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Dunnes battle comes to court -
Former chairman seeks break-up of controlling family trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A two year battle for control of Dunnes Stores, Ireland's largest retailer,
moves to the High Court today when Mr Ben Dunne, the former chairman, will
ask the court to break-up the family trust that has owned most of the
company since the 1960s.
Mr Dunne lost the chairmanship of Dunne Holdings, the group company, in
March last year after being out voted 3-2 by the other executive directors,
who are also his brother and sisters. By August last year, he had been
relieved of all executive responsibilities.
Dunnes has an annual turnover of IPounds 900m (Pounds 880m), employs 5,000
people and has about 22 per cent of the Irish retail market.
Following an unsuccessful attempt in August 1993 to get the other members of
the family to buy him out, Mr Dunne instigated legal action. He is seeking
to have the trust declared invalid, claiming it does not operate as a
genuine discretionary trust and was designed to shield the assets of the
business from the Irish revenue authorities.
Set up in the 1960s by the company's founder, Mr Ben Dunne Snr, the trust
holds 99,000 non-voting ordinary shares. There are 1,000 voting preference
shares held equally by Mr Dunne, his brother and two sisters, as well as the
estate of one sister who died last year.
The ordinary shares are held in trust for the children of the five
preference shareholders. If the trust is broken up, the ordinary shares are
expected to pass to the preference shareholders on a pro-rata basis.
Mr Dunne is claiming that a decision by the trustees to extend the trust
after it was due to expire in 1985 was not valid as they did not have the
power to do so. By extending the trust, a capital gains tax bill, estimated
to have been IPounds 40m, was avoided.
Mr Dunne is also alleging that the trustees cannot carry out their functions
properly because of an 'invidious conflict of interest' as some of them are
also legal and financial advisers to the company.
The four trustees are Mr Noel Fox, a senior partner in Oliver Freaney, the
Dublin accountancy firm, Mr Edward Montgomery, a senior partner in Matheson
Ormsby Prentice, the law firm, and Mr Frank Bowen and Mr Bernard Uniacke,
two partners in the Irish practice of Deloitte &amp; Touche.
If Mr Dunne is successful he will seek to buy-out his brother and sisters or
sell his shares, valued at IPounds 80m, to them.
In a separate action, due to start later this year or early next year, Mr
Dunne will claim that he has been oppressed and ask the court to order his
brother and sisters to sell their shares to him.
Alternatively, he wants to be returned to his previous position or have the
court make his brother and sisters buy him out. Failing that, he wants the
company wound-up and the assets distributed.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tussauds confident about Spanish park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tussauds group, operator of Port Aventura, the Spanish theme park which
opens next April, said yesterday it expected the project to be profitable
from its second year.
Mr Nick Harvey, Tussauds' head of corporate development, said at the World
Travel Market exhibition in London that Port Aventura would avoid many of
the mistakes which have plagued Disneyland Paris, the theme park operated by
Euro Disney.
Port Aventura will close during the winter months and will not have its own
hotels, unlike Disneyland, which remains open throughout the year and has
six hotels which it has struggled to fill since the park's opening in 1992.
Tussauds, which is part of Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, owns
40 per cent of Port Aventura, which is an hour's drive from Barcelona.
La Caixa, the Spanish savings bank, has 30 per cent, Anheuser-Busch, the US
brewer and theme park owner, has 20 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent
is held by Fecsa, the Spanish utility company.
The park, which has cost Pounds 300m to build, is expected to be completed
by the end of December.
It is hoping to attract 2.5m visitors in its first year, of which 1.1m will
come from outside Spain.
Ms Maggie Bergsma, who markets the park to tour operators, said she expected
France to be the biggest foreign market, followed by Germany, the
Netherlands and the UK. Many of the foreign visitors would be holidaymakers
on the Costa Brava, a two-hour coach drive away.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys edges ahead after land sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An exceptional profit on the sale of land helped Wardle Storeys, the plastic
sheeting, military parachute and marine safety and survival equipment
manufacturer, report a modest 2 per cent increase in full year profits.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8.04m to Pounds 8.2m in the year to
August 31 bolstered by a Pounds 1.49m profit on disposals, including the
sale of 9 acres of land adjoining the group's site in Brantham, Suffolk.
The exceptional gain offset a decline in operating profits, which slipped to
Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.84m) and a reduction in net interest income which
fell to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 2.21m). Turnover, including a Pounds 727,000
contribution from acquisitions, grew by 2 per cent to Pounds 79.6m.
Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 23.9p (21.7p) and an
unchanged final dividend of 12.25p is proposed, maintaining the total for
the year at 17.25p. The shares fell by 24p to 371p.
Operating profits picked up sharply in the second half, when profits
increased by 25 per cent over the first six months. The improvement came
despite continued weakness of the lira, which affected the performance of
the technical products division, and reorganisation costs in both the RFD
inflatables and GQ Parachutes operations.
Operating profits in the technical products division, which makes
specialised plastic sheet and coated fabrics, increased slightly to Pounds
2.55m (Pounds 2.49m) on turnover which grew modestly to Pounds 55.1m (Pounds
53.2m).
The group said margins were under pressure due to increased raw material
costs.
Operating profits on the safety and survival equipment side fell from Pounds
3.34m to Pounds 2.72m on turnover of Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 24.8m).
Within the division, GQ Parachutes, which makes specialised parachutes,
reported operating profits of Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.84m) on sales of Pounds
8.17m (Pounds 8.1m). Profits were struck after a near-Pounds 300,000 charge
to cover the cost of consolidating operations at the Blackmill site.
RFD Inflatables reported profits of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.51m) on turnover
of Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 16.7m).
Net cash declined by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 27.3m at the year-end, mainly due
to the cost of acquisitions, capital expenditure greater than depreciation
and an increase in working capital, partly offset by receipt of part of the
proceeds from the sale of the Brantham land.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said the current year had started
strongly.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore to launch micro trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore is to launch an investment trust to track a new index covering the
smallest 1 per cent of UK equities by market capitalisation.
The MicroCap index has been formulated by Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul
Marsh of the London Business School, who have also been involved in
establishing smaller companies indices for Hoare Govett.
The new index includes about 670 companies, the largest of which has a
market capitalisation of about Pounds 29m. This means that there is no
cross-over with the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, which has a cut-off point of
Pounds 30m.
The Gartmore Micro Index Trust will take holdings in about 500 companies.
Mr Gary Smith, the fund manager, said the trust would be capped at Pounds
100m. Its minimum size has been set at Pounds 25m. The trust will be
launched by means of a placing and public offer, opening on December 2.
Hoare Govett announced yesterday that it had raised Pounds 30m for an
investment trust tracking the new Hoare Govett 1000 index, which covers the
bottom 2 to 2.5 per cent of the UK equity market.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sketchley rises 11% and aims to rebuild
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sketchley is poised to embark on a marketing campaign in an effort to
rebuild its image and increase awareness of its brand name.
Mr John Jackson, only 11 days into his new job as chief executive, said that
dry-cleaning was mostly generic, but that the Sketchley brand was an
under-utilised asset and should denote market leadership in terms of
professionalism and reliability.
Mr Tony Bloom, deputy chairman, acknowledged that problems in the past had
tarnished the brand, but a marketing campaign, probably on radio and in the
press, would start soon to address this and to increase awareness.
The announcement came as the dry-cleaning, photo-processing and textile
services group reported pre-tax profits up 11 per cent from Pounds 3.61m to
Pounds 4m in the 26 weeks to September 30.
Mr Jackson was appointed following the departure of Mr John Richardson, who
with Mr Bloom steered Sketchley away from the financial brink. Mr Richardson
left, because 'the job is done'.
Mr Bloom said both consumers and retailers remained cautious, given that the
'macro scene is still patchy'. On the consumers' side, dry-cleaning was 'a
grudge purchase'. He added that the retail side was highly operationally
geared. 'Three extra customers per day per shop and we'd have a really
excellent business.'
Group turnover slipped to Pounds 74.5m (Pounds 75.7m), including Pounds
1.49m (Pounds 24.1m) from acquisitions, as 60 lossmaking branches were
closed, bringing the total to 750.
So far there are 47 sites which combine dry-cleaning and Supasnaps, the
photo-processing business acquired in 1993 for Pounds 6.6m. The group
expects to have 150 joint sites within 18 months, which will involve a move
into the north of England where Supasnaps is already represented.
The retail division made profits of Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover
of Pounds 45.8m (Pounds 48.9m). Profits in textile services rose to Pounds
2.79m (Pounds 2.21m) on turnover of Pounds 28.2 (Pounds 25.3m). Warrender
Aircraft Services, acquired in April for Pounds 8.4m including debt,
contributed Pounds 400,000 to profits and Pounds 1.5m to turnover.
Over the half, borrowings rose from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 15.5m after the
Warrender buy, giving gearing of 42 per cent. This should revert to the
30-35 per cent level of the April 1 year end by the end of this year.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.5p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1p.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Retailing looks healthier - Boots' decision
to sell drugs side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Boot started selling herbal remedies in Nottingham in 1849, he
could not have imagined how awkward it would be for his successors to mind
the shop and to discover new medicines.
Yesterday, the management of The Boots Company, one of the largest employers
in the east Midlands, opted to concentrate on retailing.
The decision was no surprise. Boots has been criticised for being too small
to compete in the drugs industry.
Barely in the world's top 40 drug makers by sales, it needed a breakthrough
to stay on terms.
It was not to be. In the summer of 1993 it was forced to abandon its most
promising drug, Manoplax, a heart treatment, because of side effects.
The company quickly announced a strategic review of its pharmaceuticals
operations.
An outright sale was only one of the possibilities.
The exercise followed a decade of acquisitions in the 1980s, culminating in
the unhappy purchase of retailer Ward White in 1989 for Pounds 900m - only
just above the Pounds 850m the company is likely to receive for its drugs
businesses.
The delay in finalising the drugs business sale was partly because of the
price Boots was asking - which put off such suitors as the UK drugs
companies Zeneca and Medeva - but also because of the company's historic
commitment to the city of Nottingham where it is one of the biggest
employers.
But earlier this month, Boots management said that job losses were
inevitable. This cleared a path for a buyer keen to cut costs, and provided
an opportunity for a management buy-out. In the end, BASF was able to offer
more.
The sale includes all of Boots overseas prescription drugs operations. These
range from insulin sales in India to its biggest product, Synthroid, a
thyroid hormone, which is only sold in the US. Other products include Brufen
and Froben for rheumatism and to combat inflammation.
Boots has not left the health business entirely. It still owns an
over-the-counter businesses that includes throat pastilles and sticking
plasters.
Ironically, the sale of the drugs division will dilute earnings. But Sir
James Blyth, chief executive, earlier this month sweetened the pill for
shareholders by suggesting that some of the sale proceeds might be returned
to them.
He did not say whether this would take the form of a share buy-back or a
special dividend.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sea Containers shows modest growth to
Dollars 21.7m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing
group, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 21.7m (Pounds 13.2m) for the
third quarter, marginally up from Dollars 21m.
The result brings the figure for the nine months to September 30 to Dollars
25.2m (Dollars 35.5m).
The group, which owns the Orient Express and Hoverspeed, was adversely
affected by the removal of a hovercraft from its cross-Channel route, in
anticipation of the opening of the Channel tunnel last summer. Mr James
Sherwood, president, admitted that 'in hindsight, this was a mistake'.
The group has three groups of high yielding preference shares, and Mr
Sherwood said Sea Containers was looking at asset disposals to fund a
restructuring.
Total revenue was Dollars 154m (Dollars 146m) in the quarter. Earnings per
share for the quarter and nine months were Dollars 1.19 (Dollars 1.17) and
Dollars 1.16 (Dollars 2.15).

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UAP to pay up to Pounds 265m for Provincial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance company, is expected to
have to pay between Pounds 255m and Pounds 265m for Provincial, the UK
insurance group it has acquired in a deal completed yesterday.
UAP announced in September that it expected to pay less than Pounds 300m for
privately-held Provincial. Documents sent to Provincial's shareholders are
understood to suggest that the actual consideration is Pounds 235m plus a
further sum, dependant on the UK company's performance since the summer,
expected to be between about Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
UAP bought Provincial as part of its plans to expand into the UK non-life
sector of the insurance industry. Of particular interest was Prospero,
Provincial's direct selling operation. Provincial reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 31.8m last year.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: SBC to underwrite Matheson Lloyd's issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation has agreed to underwrite half the shares in a planned
quoted Lloyd's of London investment company which proposes to raise up to
Pounds 50m to invest in the insurance market next year.
Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust plans to issue up to 50m ordinary shares
at 100p each, of which SBC has agreed to underwrite 25m. The Swiss bank said
it hoped to find subscribers for the balance in continental Europe, east
Asia and Bermuda, as well as in the UK.
MLIT intends to spread the money raised across about 40 Lloyd's syndicates
underwriting a broad range of insurance business. Acting as its Lloyd's
adviser is Jardine Lloyd's Advisers, a company set up jointly by SBC and JIB
Group, the international insurance broker, earlier this year.
MLIT is the latest company to announce plans for new investment in Lloyd's
from next year, and if successful would be one of the biggest entrants.
Investors' appetites for Lloyd's have been limited, particularly in the UK,
resulting from the lacklustre performance of similar investment companies
launched last year and the continuing bad publicity surrounding the
insurance market.
However, Mr Michael Kershaw, executive director at SBC, said the bank
expected a significant move towards limited liability corporate investment
at Lloyd's. 'You have to take a strong view, one way or the other, about
Lloyd's, and we have taken a positive one.'
To boost the attractiveness of MLIT, a warrant entitling shareholders to
subscribe for one ordinary share at 100p will be issued with every five
ordinary shares.
The latest date for acceptance is November 23 and dealings in the ordinary
shares and warrants are expected to start on November 29.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ADT improves to Dollars 35.6m in third
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group with operations
in North America, the UK and continental Europe, yesterday reported a modest
3.5 per cent increase in third quarter pre-tax profits.
The Bermuda-registered group which does much of its business in the US but
retains a UK quote, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 35.6m in the three
months to September 30, against Dollars 34.4m last time.
Operating profits before goodwill amortisation of Dollars 6.5m (Dollars
6.6m) increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 60.2m (Dollars 54.2m) on turnover
ahead 8 per cent to Dollars 340.3m (Dollars 315.7m).
Net interest costs increased from Dollars 13.4m to Dollars 14.2m and
earnings per share fell to 18 cents (22 cents).
The electronic security services division contributed Dollars 44.7m (Dollars
39.1m) to operating profits on sales of Dollars 249m (Dollars 231.3m), while
vehicle auction services reported operating profits of Dollars 15.5m
(Dollars 15.1m) on sales of Dollars 91.3m (Dollars 84.4m).
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said third quarter
results 'were in line with management's expectations'.
The third quarter results lifted pre-tax profits for the nine months to
Dollars 111.2m (Dollars 104.8m), on sales which advanced to Dollars 1.02bn
(Dollars 950.8m).
Earnings per share for nine months were down from 67 cents to 56 cents. The
year-on-year decline reflects the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the
group's refinancing package in August last year.
ADT's shares closed up 30p at 740p in London.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Size the important ingredient - Johnson
Matthey and Cookson's merger moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his last annual report, Mr David Davies, Johnson Matthey chairman, put it
quite plainly: 'Size is an important ingredient for a company with our
ambitions. We aim to become a constituent member of the FT-SE 100.'
Yesterday, the City was wondering whether sheer size was the main ingredient
in its possible merger with Cookson.
Such a move would push the combined group well into the top 100 UK companies
with a market value of about Pounds 2.5bn and annual sales of Pounds 3.5bn.
But analysts believe that, size apart, the rewards from putting the two
together would be fairly modest.
'Size brings some benefits in its own right but the merger is driven more by
the ambitions of the managements than anything else,' said one leading
analyst.
Such sceptical views were encouraged by the companies' decision not to
elaborate publicly on the merger talks, news of which leaked out over the
weekend.
But the general reaction was mildly positive, with Johnson Matthey shares
ending 10p higher at 581p while Cookson edged up 1p to 252p.
The concrete benefits analysts could point to were the potential cost
savings.
Both companies have large London head offices costing some Pounds 10m a
year, and also have some overlap in operations and research. Eliminating the
duplication could generate savings of more than Pounds 20m year which would
be useful, if not spectacular, in the context of current combined profits of
about Pounds 200m.
In at least one business area, electronic materials, a merger would also
make strategic sense.
Cookson is one of the world's leading manufacturers of speciality chemicals
and laminates used in the production of printed circuit boards.
Johnson Matthey supplies many of the same electronics manufacturers with
complementary products.
Electronic materials will provide more than a third of the two companies'
combined profits this year and the merged group would be one of the top five
suppliers in the world.
There are other areas of overlap but most have been addressed already with
the joint venture in ceramic colours and the sale of Johnson Matthey's
jewellery materials business to Cookson.
Elsewhere, the groups have little in common: Johnson Matthey is the world's
biggest manufacturer of automotive catalytic converters and the leading
marketer of platinum group metals; Cookson is Europe's largest maker of
plastic flower pots and a world leader in dental floss.
Johnson Matthey prides itself on its high level of research and development
spending, more than one third of pre-tax profits last year, and sees itself
very much as a high technology company. In contrast, while Cookson has sold
off most of its assorted engineering businesses much of the group remains
fairly mundane.
'If you go round Cookson's operations you realise that it is not as high
tech as you might think from looking at the pictures in the annual report,'
commented one analyst.
One speculation yesterday was that the combined group might be able to
contemplate larger disposals of unpromising businesses. The companies
themselves are likely to argue that it will allow them to take on biggest
acquisitions.
Even if the two companies' shareholders buy the arguments in general there
is still the ticklish question of valuation. If shares in the new combined
group were to be allocated in line with the companies' respective reported
profits Cookson investors would get about 57 per cent. However, it is
thought that Johnson Matthey will fight for more than 43 per cent, partly on
the grounds that it has more conservative accounting policies. Analysts
estimate that if it were to switch to Cookson's policies on depreciation and
pensions its profits would be some Pounds 7m higher.
Johnson Matthey supporters also argue that it has better longer term growth
prospects though this is disputed by Cookson followers who point out that
Cookson's profits are currently growing faster.
Mr Davies and Mr Dick Oster, Cookson's American chief executive, have got
plenty to talk about.

FT  15 NOV 94 / SGS-Thomson share issue to raise Dollars 480m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday
announced plans to raise up to Dollars 480m (Pounds 292m) through the issue
of shares on the New York and Paris stock markets.
The operation is a significant step in the development of the semiconductor
group, which was formed in 1987 through the merger of state-owned groups
Thomson Semiconductor of France and Italy's SGS Microelectronics.
Analysts in Paris said the issue of shares, which will represent about 20
per cent of the company's enlarged capital, would reinforce its balance
sheet and could mark a step towards privatisation.
The decision to raise capital on the stock market follows a strong
improvement at the company, which is Europe's second largest semiconductor
manufacturer. Last month it reported net profits of Dollars 166.1m for the
six months to the end of July - more than for the whole of the previous
financial year. Sales for the current financial year are expected to rise by
about 20 per cent, compared with the Dollars 2bn recorded in 1993.
Profits have been boosted by the upswing in the international semiconductor
market and by reduced financial charges following two capital increases of
Dollars 250m last year. The company's principal products include
semiconductors for telecoms, computers and control systems.
Under the terms of the issue, 21m shares will be offered. Just over 13.6m
will be offered to investors in the US and Canada, with the balance being
offered in other countries.
In addition to listings on the New York and Paris stock exchanges, the
shares are expected to be quoted on Seaq International. SGS-Thomson is also
considering a quotation on Telematico, the Italian screen-based dealing
market.
The shares are to be priced at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 23. Morgan
Stanley will be global co-ordinator and lead manager of the issue, with
Banque Indosuez and Lehman Brothers as co-global co-ordinators.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Kerkorian hits out at Chrysler policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire US investor who is the biggest
shareholder in Chrysler, yesterday launched an attack on the carmaker's
anti-takeover defences and said he wanted to raise his stake in the company.
In a letter to Chrysler's board yesterday, Mr Kerkorian also called on the
company to take steps which would increase the value of the company's
shares. These included undertaking a 'meaningful' stock buy-back programme
over the next year, raising its quarterly dividend and enacting a
two-for-one stock split. The Las Vegas-based investor said he had been
rebuffed in his earlier approaches.
Chrysler said it would 'consider these requests as it considers the requests
of all shareholders'. The company's shares jumped 5 per cent in heavy
trading during the morning, lifting Chrysler's market value to Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 10.3bn).
When Mr Kerkorian first bought his stake of more than 9 per cent in December
1990, the company was in the throes of a financial crisis and was valued at
less than Dollars 3bn.
Under a poison pill plan adopted in 1990 to ward off Mr Kerkorian,
Chrysler's directors could thwart any attempt by an investor to take a stake
of more than 10 per cent by giving other investors the right to buy
additional shares at half-price.
Chrysler said the plan was originally intended 'to act in the best interest
of all the company's shareholders if someone should seek to obtain a
position of control or substantial influence over Chrysler'.
Tracinda, Mr Kerkorian's private investment company, indicated that it would
seek approval under US anti-trust law to take its stake in the carmaker to
as much as 15 per cent.
A week ago, a brief announcement by Mr Kerkorian which was filed with the
SEC for regulatory purposes, prompted concern among Chrysler shareholders
that he was preparing to sell part of his investment, hitting the company's
share price.
To conserve cash, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 15 cents a
share in 1991. This year, with the North American car markets booming, it
has raised the dividend twice, to 25 cents.
Directors are scheduled to meet on December 1 to agree the next dividend
payout.

FT  15 NOV 94 / BSkyB chief may win Pounds 2m bonus: Prospectus for
satellite TV flotation reveals sharp increase in dish subscriptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sam Chisholm, the chief executive of British Sky Broad casting, could
receive up to Pounds 3m this year in salary and bonuses, the pathfinder
prospectus for the satellite television venture revealed yesterday.
In addition to his salary this year of about Pounds 340,000, Mr Chisholm,
who is regarded as a key figure in turning around BSkyB, has received Pounds
732,000 based on 0.5 per cent of pre-tax profits in the 1993-94 financial
year. Since June 1992 BSkyB has moved from an operating loss of Pounds 47m
to an operating profit in the year to June of Pounds 170.1m.
The document reveals that when the BSkyB share price is quoted, Pounds 7.5m
will be distributed among 11 present and former managers as a one-off
payment. Of the total, Pounds 3.8m will be paid to three current and
proposed directors. Mr Chisholm is expected to receive more than half this
total, possibly as much as Pounds 2m.
The prospectus for the company's London and New York flotation also showed
continuing growth in subscriptions.
During the three months to the end of September this year, normally a quiet
period for subscription growth, BSkyB added more than 162,000 new
subscriptions through dish and cable networks, lifting the total to 3.65m.
Mr Richard Brooke, BSkyB chief financial officer, said 'the relentless
growth' was continuing despite the October price increase of Pounds 3 a
month to all programme packages, taking the top price for all channels to
Pounds 22.99 a month and increasing the basic service from Pounds 6.99 a
month to Pounds 9.99.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, the media group that owns the
Financial Times, now has a 17.5 per cent stake, claimed the company had
experienced 'no material change' in the rate of disconnections since the
price increases were announced last August. In the past three years the
annual rate of disconnections had been cut by more than half to its present
figure of around 13 per cent. This compares with a so-called 'churn rate'
experienced by some cable companies of between 30 and 35 per cent.
BSkyB confirmed that the 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital which is
to be floated is likely to be priced at between 233p and 268p valuing the
company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn. Net proceeds from the global
offering based on a mid-point pricing would be around Pounds 810m although a
new external bank loan will bring new money to Pounds 1.21bn.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Risky business reveals US bank's Achilles heel: Bankers
Trust's leveraged swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leveraged swaps have turned into the Achilles heel of Bankers Trust's
derivatives business.
The bank says it has sold these instruments to fewer than a dozen companies,
all of them in the US. But at least two of these companies have since filed
lawsuits over multi-million dollar losses they incurred. And an internal
investigation has uncovered breaches of the bank's rules in the way other
leveraged swaps were sold to companies, leading to the removal of six
executives from their posts last week.
In an interview before the internal actions last week, Mr Charles Sanford,
the bank's chairman, refused to comment on the legal cases - a Dollars 130m
(Pounds 79m) claim from Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, and a
Dollars 73m lawsuit from Gibson Greetings, a greetings card company. But,
referring to companies which buy complicated financial instruments, he said:
'Everybody has to have risk management.'
The experience of recent weeks raises some questions.
First, should the bank have been selling these instruments to companies at
all? Under a leveraged swap, the normal payments that would be made under an
interest rate swap agreement are multiplied, making them more volatile when
market rates move.
Mr Brian Walsh, the bank's head of derivatives, says many companies last
year were engaged in 'aggressive hedging' - an apparent contradiction in
terms.
Knowing this, was the bank right to sell such instruments to non-financial
companies? According to Mr Walsh, leveraged swaps were only sold to
companies with sophisticated treasury departments capable of understanding
and managing the risks.
Mr Sanford, meanwhile, says the bank will follow a 'belt and braces'
approach in future, taking extra care to ensure companies understand what
they are buying. With regulators breathing down its neck, the bank is likely
to seek to control its derivatives sales force more closely.
For a bank that has been at the forefront of developments in the derivatives
markets, putting the brakes on ambitious staff could cause problems. Mr
Sanford says: 'I hope we will always be an innovative company with good
products.'
Second, does the failure of the leveraged swaps reveal a deeper weakness in
Bankers Trust's ability to manage financial risk?
'They didn't work out as well as we'd like,' says Mr Sanford of the disputed
contracts. But he adds: 'In the rest of the derivatives business and the
rest of the bank, we didn't feel any problems' from the upheaval in
financial markets this year.
Certainly, the bank's management of risk in its own trading business this
year has been more effective than many other big traders, whether hedge
funds or other banks - though it failed to repeat last year's Dollars 1.6bn
of revenues from trading, much of it from proprietary trading. 'We've
outperformed most of our competitors with a 15-16 per cent return on equity,
even with a big capital base,' says Mr Sanford. 'If this is our low year,
that's not at all bad.' For now, the bank has pulled in its horns,
withdrawing much of its capital from proprietary trading business - though
it expects to return in force when conditions improve.
Third, do the cases reveal a deeper weakness - a lack of the sort of lasting
relationships with big US companies that will support its business in
future? While the bank has made a successful business out of raising finance
for below-investment grade companies, its dealings with big companies have
tended to come either through its trading business, or through its trust and
custody business.
The bank's relationship with Procter &amp; Gamble was not handled by a single
relationship manager. That is not surprising, given that Bankers Trust
claims to have sold derivatives to 3,100 different entities over the years.
'With all these counterparties, there will be lots where the relationship is
at the product management end,' says Mr Sanford. But as the leveraged swap
experience is showing, that strategy can break down when product managers
are loosely controlled.
Despite a spectacular post-tax return on capital of more than 20 per cent in
each of the past four years, Bankers Trust's shares have consistently traded
at a discount to its peers.
Mr Sanford is unapologetic. The bank will not change its strategic
direction, he says. The case for derivatives - that they provide a way for
companies, banks or investors to manage risks more effectively - stands. 'I
don't see it slacking off in intellectual or practical intensity,' he says.
'It's a technique for risk management that is so efficient, I don't think
that it will slow down.'
In its lawsuit against the bank, even P&amp;G talks of the way derivatives can
hold down borrowing costs or reduce risk. Says Mr Sanford: 'Most senior
managers (in corporates) are now locked into using derivatives.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / British Steel lifts payout as profits surge to Pounds 159m:
Analysts raise full-year forecasts as demand in Europe is expected to
strengthen by 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel, Europe's second largest steelmaker, is raising its interim
dividend from 0.5p a share to 2p after a surge in half-year pre-tax profits
from Pounds 27m to Pounds 159m.
The company reported its best interim results since 1990/1991 yesterday. Mr
Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the rise in the dividend
reflected the better results and the more favourable economic outlook.
Prospects for the second half were encouraging, he said, and steel demand in
the UK and continental Europe was expected to grow by about 5 per cent this
year.
The company has indicated to analysts that the interim payout could
represent one-third of its total dividend for the year, pointing to a final
payment of 4p and a total of 6p. That compares with just 2p for 1993/94.
The City had been expecting a big rise in British Steel profits and in the
interim payout, and the shares closed 1p higher last night at 159 1/2 p.
Some analysts raised their profit forecasts. Mr Tony Lancelott at UBS, one
of the British Steel house brokers, lifted his forecast this year from
Pounds 375m to Pounds 400m, while Mr Tim Bennett at Birmingham-based Albert
E. Sharp raised his full-year forecast from Pounds 605m to Pounds 695m.
British Steel is benefiting from a worldwide increase in steel prices as
demand rises and supply is squeezed. Volumes and prices rose about 6 per
cent in the first half.
Mr Moffat said that, in D-Mark terms, continental European steel prices were
still about 10 per cent below 1989 levels, and steelmakers would be looking
to recoup at least that difference.
British Steel's UK plants are working at 95 per cent capacity, even though
UK steel demand is still 25 per cent below its 1989 peak.
Mr Moffat admitted there would be capacity constraints for British Steel as
demand rose, but said he had no regrets about the company's cuts of recent
years, which mainly focused on inefficient capacity.
Mr Moffat said steel demand in developing countries was growing by 5-7 per
cent a year compound, and already accounted for 43 per cent of total steel
demand worldwide.
'Opportunities will present themselves in growing markets,' he said.
British Steel, he said, would continue to press the European Commission to
resolve the subsidies issue, following the partial withdrawal of the
Commission's rescue plan for the industry.
He was encouraged by the refusal of Mr Tim Eggar, UK industry minister, to
endorse the latest proposal to support Eko Stahl, the east German
steelmaker. A rescue plan has to be agreed unanimously by EU industry
ministers.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survival of Irish coalition comes under growing threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of Ireland's Fianna Fail-led coalition government was under
increasing threat last night, with senior government officials predicting
its collapse. The crisis throws fresh doubt over the future pace of the
Northern Ireland peace process.
As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was outlining proposals to bring
Ulster's loyalist groups into the talks process in a speech at the Lord
Mayor's banquet, Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, was preparing
for a parliamentary showdown today with his Labour party partners.
The crisis, triggered by Labour's opposition to Mr Reynolds' proposed
appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the
High Court, looks certain to end the 22-month coalition.
Mr Reynolds was in consultation with his Fianna Fail ministers yesterday. If
the crisis is unresolved and Mr Reynolds loses a vote of no confidence he
could seek the permission of Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, to
dissolve parliament, and call early elections.
Alternatively, and some political observers believed this more likely
yesterday, Mrs Robinson could ask the opposition parties to form a
government with Labour. Mrs Robinson is understood to have taken legal
advice yesterday.
The prospective collapse of the Dublin government threatens to halt progress
on the joint framework document being negotiated by the UK and Irish
governments for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland.
But in a remark hinting at the possible break-up of the coalition, Mr Dick
Spring, the Irish foreign minister and Labour leader, said: 'The momentum
towards peace this opportunity offers as a prospect is beyond attack by any
form of government or political party.'
After a meeting with Mr Spring in Dublin yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that progress had been made, although
he refused to be drawn on a date for completion of the framework document.
The UK government aims to start exploratory talks with loyalist political
representatives before the end of the year, Mr Major announced yesterday.
Speaking in London, he confirmed that the government was ready to begin
talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, by the end of the year.
His remarks were welcomed across the political divide in Ulster. Mr Seamus
Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party, said: 'These talks should happen as quickly as possible so
that the preliminary elements can be dealt with.'
However, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, described Mr Major's speech
as 'wholly inadequate' and attacked him for 'still talking about talks'.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Major attacks MPs with too many paid interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night underlined his determination to shake off the
charges of sleaze that have damaged his government by launching a robust
attack on MPs who take on too many paid outside interests.
The prime minister used his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in
London to defend the right of MPs to have outside interests and to argue
that the UK would not benefit if parliament were populated by 'wholly
professional' politicians.
He said, however, that Westminster should not be 'a hiring fair'. Parliament
should not be a 'way' to other jobs, 'as frankly it sometimes has been'.
Speaking as MPs prepare to return to Westminster for tomorrow's Queen's
Speech detailing next year's legislative programme, Mr Major emphasised that
the recently established Nolan committee would have a continuing role in
policing standards in British public life.
The body's task was not just to meet 'immediate questions', he said, but 'to
act as a running authority of reference - almost, you might say, an ethical
workshop called in to do running repairs'.
In a speech billed by Downing Street as more than usually his own creation,
Mr Major said it was important to attract the 'right people' into public
service and urged commentators to use their 'very great' freedom to attack
and expose with responsibility.
'We no longer live nowadays, thank goodness, in a 'deference society', where
you are respected for who you are not what you are,' he said. 'But let's not
swing too far in the opposite direc-tion.'
Acknowledging the need to improve the accountability of the public service,
he said that government had been 'too secret too long'. 'It is damaging if
there appears to be some kind of inside track - a gulf between those who
know how to play the system and others who do not,' he said. His sympathy
was with those on 'the outside track'.
Mr Major was speaking as it emerged that one feature of the Commons debate
after the Queen's Speech may be a speech by Mr Neil Hamilton, the former
corporate affairs minister, who resigned last month following allegations of
impropriety which he strongly denies.
Friends of Mr Hamilton said last night that he was 'minded' to try to take
part in the debate. But they added that he would not say anything which was
likely to militate against his resuming ministerial office.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, attacked the speech as
'depressingly complacent'. He said Mr Major was 'whistling in the dark'.
In a speech that ranged more widely than the occasion's traditional focus on
foreign affairs, Mr Major also commented on the economy, business and
Northern Ireland.
Welcoming recent remarks on the need for responsibility in setting executive
pay levels, he said there was 'no doubting the resentment that large and
often unjustified pay rises' could cause.
He said British capitalism had become 'capitalism with a conscience, but
there was still more that business could do to improve its image'.

FT  15 NOV 94 / TRW finds partner for Dollars 2bn global telecoms venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The race to establish the first global satellite system for mobile phones
intensified yesterday as TRW, the large US-based aerospace manufacturer,
announced an equity partner for its Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) Odyssey
project.
It said that Teleglobe, a Canadian provider of intercontinental
telecommunications services, had agreed to take part in a joint venture
designed to put the satellite system in orbit for the start of operations in
1998.
The aim is to build a network of communications satellites able to provide
personal voice, fax and paging services to subscribers anywhere in the
world.
Customers will use a pocket telephone similar to existing cellular phones.
The service is likely to find its greatest use in remote areas with little
telecoms infrastructure.
The Odyssey project, planned for four years, will compete with several
similar ventures. These include Iridium, in which the main partner is
Motorola, the US electronics company; Globalstar, which is being developed
by Loral, the US defence group; and a system planned by an affiliate of
Inmarsat, which provides mobile communications services to maritime and
aeronautical markets.
Iridium is expected to cost Dollars 3.4bn, while Globalstar will require an
investment of Dollars 1.8bn.
To meet the estimated Dollars 2bn cost of Odyssey, Dollars 1bn is expected
to be raised through debt. Of the rest, TRW, which had revenues of Dollars
7.9bn last year, is providing Dollars 100m and Teleglobe, with 1993 revenues
of CDollars 1.4bn, Dollars 50m. The balance is expected to be found from
equity partners both strategic - such as telecoms operators - and financial.
Mr Charles Sirois, chairman and chief executive of Teleglobe, said yesterday
that Odyssey would essentially operate as a wholesaler of personal telecoms
capacity.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The retail portion of the BSkyB flotation contains an unusual feature:
shareholders will not know the price of the shares when they send in their
application forms. They will write out cheques specifying how many pounds
worth of shares they wish to buy, but the price will be set later after a
book-building process involving institutions.
The main advantage of the technique is that the time between pricing an
offer and the start of dealing will be shortened. Typically in the UK, there
is a delay of up to two weeks to give small investors time to turn round the
paperwork after the price is set. By shortening the period, underwriting
risk could be reduced and the proceeds from the offer increased. Such a
system is common in the US.
BSkyB's sponsors must convince small shareholders to buy shares without
knowing what their price-earnings ratio or yield will be. A similar
technique was used in the third tranche of BT's privatisation. The
difference is that then retail investors did not simply have to rely on
institutions' judgment of what constituted a fair price; they were sold
shares at a discount to what the professionals paid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt the spectacular profits momentum at British Steel will
continue as economic recovery in Europe gathers pace. But the six-fold
increase in interim earnings per share will not stop investors asking
whether now is the time to sell. The issue is whether the full cyclical
upswing in earnings has been discounted in a share price up nearly 30 per
cent against the market this year.
Higher prices and volumes will ensure that British Steel's pre-tax profits
will soon rise to beat the Pounds 733m achieved in 1989-90, the peak of the
previous cycle. The top of the current cycle is likely to be 1996-97, in
which pre-tax profits could amount to Pounds 900m, some 33p of earnings per
share. This far ahead, there is necessarily considerable imprecision about
such forecasts - perhaps profits will exceed Pounds 1bn. But assuming a
conservative outcome, the shares do not look cheap. At 159 1/2 p, they are
trading at nearly five times peak earnings, not far short of the peak
valuation in the last cycle.
Optimists argue that the recession due for 1998 or thereafter will be
gentler than the previous one. British Steel, for one, believes that steady
demand from Asia will offset the impact of downturn in Europe. If this were
to be the case, the shares could arguably command a higher rating now, on
the basis that the stability and therefore quality of earnings was set to
improve. However, the optimistic scenario ignores the woeful lack of
progress in eliminating subsidies and overcapacity from the European steel
industry. The shares are supported now by an above-market yield, but a
rerating would be undeserved.

FT  15 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BASF/Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots' reasons for selling its prescription drugs business are easier to
fathom than BASF's motives for buying it. Boots' operations lacked critical
mass in research and development. Discovering and bringing a new medicine to
market is risky. The best way to reduce that risk is to have a broad
portfolio so, if a drug is dropped because it proves unsafe or ineffective,
alternatives remain. But Boots' drugs sales were insufficient to support
such a large portfolio. When its heart-drug Manoplax failed, there was
little to take its place.
In the short-term, BASF may discover some geographic and product synergies.
Overheads, marketing and R&amp;D can be rationalised. The price, at 1.6 times
sales, is reasonable compared with the multiples paid for American Cyanamid
and Syntex.
Even so, compared with Bayer or Hoechst, BASF will remain a pharmaceutical
pygmy - about 30th in world rankings. Buying Boots will promote it from the
fourth to third division. If the Boots deal is the first in a series
enlarging its patented drugs business, BASF's strategy may work. As Sweden's
Pharmacia has demonstrated, viable drugs companies can be constructed by
amalgamating third division players. Innovative products could be secured by
taking a stake in a US biotechnology group.
Though BASF's strategy may pay off, it is hard to believe it is the best use
of the group's resources. BASF's strengths are not in marketing medicines.
They are financial - its cost of capital is well below ICI's - and in
technology-based heavy industry such as bulk chemicals. Galling though
Hoechst's and Bayer's healthcare success may be, BASF would do better to
concentrate on what it does best.

seems fulfilled running a medium-sized public company. The suspicion is that
the main drive behind their merger talks is size for size's sake. A combined
group would be able to embark on larger acquisitions than either company
individually.
If Cookson and JM do consummate their marriage, synergies will doubtless be
claimed. But from the information so far available, it is hard to see these
being substantial. True, there would be cost savings from eliminating one or
other head office, but that would be true if any two businesses were merged.
Synergies may also come from putting together the companies' electronics and
precious metals operations: Cookson and JM make complementary electronics
products which may be able to share a distribution channel. JM's precious
metal refining business may also be able to wring some extra profit from a
vertical relationship with Cookson's precious metal fabricating arm. But
neither prospect looks terribly exciting.
Even without much in the way of industrial logic, shareholders in one of the
companies could benefit if they received a particularly large slice of the
merged entity. Yesterday there were suggestions that JM shareholders might
do somewhat better than the company's relative market capitalisation would
suggest. But if that were the case, the benefit to JM investors would be at
the expense of Cookson's. The companies will have to put on a convincing
demonstration of the industrial case for merger if shareholders are to be
satisfied.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Positive vote for a bigger club: The entry of Sweden could
prove a turning point in the fortunes of the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Yes to membership of the European Union in Sunday's referendum
vindicates the EU's enlargement strategy.
With the people of Austria, Finland and Sweden having voted in favour of
membership of the club, pressure will mount on the Norwegians to follow suit
in their November 28 referendum.
Whether or not Norway follows its immediate neighbour, there is now the
prospect of a new Nordic dynamic for the EU that will offset the tug towards
the Mediterranean which took place with the entry of Greece, Spain and
Portugal in the 1980s.
The entry of Sweden - the most powerful of the newcomers - could prove a
turning point in the EU's fortunes after two years marked by recession,
monetary instability and divisions over the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
'It shows that Europe is still attractive,' said Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing
president of the European Commission.
Mr Delors was worried that a No vote in Sweden would have emboldened
Euro-sceptics in Denmark, the UK, perhaps even his native France. It would
also have sunk hopes of coaxing fish- and oil-rich Norway into the fold.
Finland would have been left isolated, and a Sweden outside the EU might
have provided a focus for deeper Nordic co-operation in competition with the
EU.
Instead, three - possibly four - wealthy, industrious states are on schedule
to enter the Union in January 1995. Each agrees, broadly, on freer trade,
tighter budgets, stricter environment rules and greater openness in
decision-making.
Sunday's vote in Sweden means that the Scandinavians and Austrians have
finally come in from the cold. For most of the post-second world war era,
Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway kept western Europe at arms-length,
cherishing their neutrality and viewing the political aspects of the (then)
European Economic Community with suspicion. All four joined the UK-led drive
in 1959 to create a free-trade rival known as the European Free Trade
Association.
The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 left the EFTA states facing instability
to the east and caught in a political vacuum. With the EU entering its most
dynamic phase with the creation of a single market and plans under way for a
single European currency, the Union suddenly looked an attractive option.
Mr Delors, fearful that premature enlargement could dilute the forces of
integration inside the Twelve, proposed a half-way house called the European
Economic Area. The EEA offered the benefits of the single market but not
full membership. Businesses in the non-EU countries were forced to accept
dozens of regulations and decisions over which they had no influence. 'We
were silent partners,' says President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.
Such commercial considerations were important in the applications by
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway for full EU membership. But there was
also a hard-nosed political calculation: EU membership looked a safer bet
than limited regional co-operation or relative isolation within the EEA.
'We need to be part of the political processes which have great impact on
Norway's future,' said Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister.
The first impact of enlargement will be to prod the Union into looking less
inward and more outward, especially towards the east. The Nordic countries
want Brussels to pay more attention to environmental disasters in the former
Soviet Union; and they are committed to anchoring the Baltic states in
western Europe.
The newcomers share a goal of early EU membership for the central and east
Europeans. In rough sequence, enlargement might begin with the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary, followed by Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania,
and the Baltic states.
Second, enlargement will affect the union's trade policy. In the Council of
Ministers - and inside the European Commission - a delicate balance exists
between the EU's northern liberal wing and the more protectionist 'Club Med'
countries often led by France. In future, the balance is likely to tilt
toward a more liberal regime.
The Nordic countries are also expected to line up behind Britain, Denmark,
the Netherlands and, usually, Germany in opposition to over-generous state
aid. Similarly, the addition of net contributors to the EU budget may give
extra weight to the Anglo-Dutch-German campaign to control spending at the
expense of the 'Poor Four' - Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal - which
benefit from extra regional aid.
Third, enlargement is bound to further erode the neutrality of Austria,
Finland and Sweden (Norway is a member of Nato). The three are expected to
be drawn progressively into the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling
defence arm. But partly out of sensitivity to domestic public opinion and to
Russia, the process will be slow.
On the surface, expansion of the EU looks like a victory for UK-led
arguments in favour of 'widening' Europe rather than 'deepening'
integration. The newcomers are not centralisers and support the principle of
subsidiarity, the principal of devolving decision-making from Brussels where
appropriate.
But enlargement is double-edged from the UK's standpoint: the Austrians and
Scandinavians enjoy generous welfare state provisions and are determined to
strengthen the EU's social policy which is such an anathema to the UK.
Moreover, all four newcomers accepted the Maastricht treaty in their
accession negotiations. They show little inclination to follow the British
policy of seeking treaty opt-outs in areas such as the planned European
monetary union. They are likely to be in the vanguard of moves towards
greater integration.
Finally, enlargement means that institutional reform is back on the agenda.
Decision-making is hard enough with the present 12 member states, each with
veto power in areas such as fiscal policy. Sixteen member states means more
working languages, more European Commissioners and, possibly, more paralysis
 -and adds to the pressure for streamlining at the 1996 Inter-Governmental
Conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
The question is: how much? With one eye on the next enlargement to central
and eastern Europe, Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union has already
floated ideas for organising a Union of between 20 and 25 member states,
built around a Franco-German 'hard-core' committed to faster political and
economic integration. But France is hesitant about a further surrender of
political sovereignty; the UK remains unremittingly hostile.
This is a complex subject upon which the finest minds in Europe have only
just begun to ponder. The tendency so far appears to be towards a minimum
set of rules and obligations, with no member state having the right to stop
others able and willing to move at a faster pace.
This is a message that suits the Austrians and Scandinavians. They have
spent 30 years on the outside looking in. They have had a vigorous debate on
the merits of membership. Now they are committed to making it work.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Unsafe as houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the absence of high inflation, it was inevitable that the British housing
market should suffer a hard landing after the giddy price spiral of the
1980s. Less easy to rationalise is the failure of the market to respond to
economic recovery. Even after the recent increase, nominal interest rates
are low by historic standards. The ratio of house prices to earnings looks
similarly depressed. Yet the latest monthly survey from the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests that prices and activity have
remained stagnant at a time when a seasonal uplift might have been expected.
The impact of the government's tax increases on personal incomes is an
important factor, since mortgage lenders advance money on the basis of a
multiple of post-tax income. Yet the more potent restraining influence is
probably the state of the personal sector balance sheet. Whereas the
corporate sector has paid down debt and returned to financial surplus since
the trough of recession, the personal sector is still struggling with the
burden of debt incurred in the 1980s and the subsequent plunge in house
prices. Mortgage debt between 1988 and 1993 rose from 26 per cent of the
equity in British homes to an unprecedented 46 per cent.
Hardest hit are the million or so households with negative equity, where
borrowers are trapped in their homes until they can save enough to repay
debt, or find that inflation comes to their rescue. Since the average value
per household of this negative equity is only Pounds 5,100, less than 10 per
cent of the value of the average house, it would take only a small increase
in prices to do the trick. Yet the gap may be harder to close than simple
arithmetic suggests.
For a start, the adjustment in the personal sector balance sheet is proving
a slow and painful process. Young first time buyers who might normally have
emerged at this point in the recovery are absent because they bought
prematurely in the panic of 1988-89. And for those who are still able to
borrow, the investment logic in housing looks less compelling. Interest
rates may be historically low in nominal terms, but they are high in real
terms, especially when the borrower is investing in an asset that is not
keeping pace even with today's very subdued rate of inflation.
In the long run things may look different. The demand for housing increases
with rising earnings, while the supply of land is fixed. The poor scope for
productivity growth in house building ensures a rising cost of housing
relative to other goods. Against that, demographers expect a lower rate of
household formation over the next 30 years as the population ages. This
would reduce demand, unless older households turn out to want more valuable
homes.
For the moment, though, the dull state of the housing market looks like a
symptom of a sustainable, non-inflationary recovery. Unfamiliar, perhaps
even un-British, but long overdue.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Foreign policy gridlock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first reaction of some Clinton supporters last week, when the Democrats
lost control of both houses of Congress, was to suggest that from now on the
president would concentrate on foreign policy, which has come to be seen as
his greatest strength.
That in itself is a remarkable development. Bill Clinton won the presidency
two years ago by arguing that his predecessor spent too much time on foreign
policy and not enough on America's domestic problems. For most of the time
since he has been portrayed as hopelessly inept and indecisive in foreign
policy. Only lately, as his domestic programme ground to a halt, has his
foreign policy performance, notably in Korea, Haiti and the Middle East,
begun to look a little better.
It is also true that the balance of powers between president and congress is
more favourable to the former in foreign than in domestic policy. But that
is not saying much. Foreign policy involves spending money, and the
president cannot spend money, even abroad, without congressional authority.
The world was abruptly reminded of this last week when Mr Clinton had to end
US participation in the enforcement of the arms embargo on Bosnia: an action
which might make sense if it were part of an overall strategy to help the
Bosnian government achieve military victory, but which in the present
context serves only to destroy a very delicate consensus among the leading
powers that took well over a year to reach, and in the process badly
undermines what is left of the Atlantic alliance.
The president also has to obtain the consent of the Senate for his
nominations to ambassadorial posts and other senior positions in the state
and defence departments (though not in the National Security Council). His
Republican predecessors often had difficulty with this, not from Democrats
but from a fellow Republican, Senator Jesse Helms, who regards the entire
foreign service as a bunch of liberal elitists, and who is a master of the
art of procedural delay.
Mr Helms is deeply suspicious of almost all forms of US engagement with the
rest of the world, especially those (such as the Uruguay Round) that take a
multilateral form and require the US to abide by rules that other countries
have a role in setting and administering. He describes the United Nations as
'that long-time nemesis of millions of Americans . . . which costs the
American taxpayers billions of dollars'. He is against virtually all foreign
aid, except aid to Israel. He even disapproves of efforts to make peace
between Israel and Syria, since for him it is axiomatic that Syria's desire
for peace cannot be sincere.
Come January, Mr Helms will be chairman of the Senate foreign relations
committee. Mr Clinton's freedom of action to pursue any foreign policy of
his own will from then on be severely constrained. Those who rely on US
leadership and commitment in confronting the complex problems of the post
cold war world would be well advised to look elsewhere.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Sweden's Yes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, Sweden's vote to join the European Union was close, but clear
enough. It was always going to be a hard decision to reverse all those years
of staunch neutrality and independence. The fact that both the main party
leaders, plus the heart of the business establishment, threw their weight
behind a Yes vote must have convinced the waverers.
Now Austria, Finland and Sweden have voted to accept the membership terms
laboriously negotiated with Brussels, the pressure will be on the even more
sceptical Norwegians to follow suit. If they stay out, as a majority still
appears inclined to do, they will be extremely isolated in northern Europe.
They are and will remain members of the European Economic Area, which gives
them most of the advantages of the single market, but no real influence on
all the rules and regulations which underpin it. The terms they have
negotiated with the rest of the EU are, by any objective measure, a good
deal. Even such a notorious sceptic as Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries
minister, said so. It would be good for Norway, and good for the EU, if they
now vote Yes as well.
However, it is up to the rest of the Union to prove to its new members, from
the obvious Euro-enthusiasts in Austria to the Euro-sceptics in Scandinavia,
that the club is worth joining. By their accession, they will strengthen
those voices arguing for free trade and budget discipline - for they are all
going to be net contributors to the EU budget. They will provide a very
healthy counterbalance to the rather more protectionist influence of the
southern Mediterranean member states. They will bolster the free trade lobby
headed by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
They will also bring more votes for environmental protection, for open and
democratic decision-making, and for high social standards, aims which have
not proved so popular in London, at least. But the EU is nothing if it is
not about the process of consensus-building and shared decision-making.
Striking deals will inevitably become more difficult as the Union grows, but
this means that more effort must be made to streamline the process, to
reduce the bureaucracy, while at the same time providing maximum flexibility
for the devolution of decision-making - so-called subsidiarity.
Once Norway has voted, the EU can turn its attention in full to the real
challenge of the end of the 20th century - which is to bring the fledgling
democracies of central and eastern Europe into the fold. In both economic
and political terms, it will prove a far more difficult process than the
relatively painless task of embracing three or four prosperous western
democracies. It will require far more adjustment in the policies and
institutions of the EU. But it is the most important enlargement of all for
the security, stability and long-term prosperity of the continent.

FT  15 NOV 94 / High political price of partnership: Scandinavian divisions
over EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedes are not given to hyperbole, least of all Swedish diplomats. But no
one in Stockholm thought it was out of place on Sunday night when Ms Anita
Gradin, ambassador to Austria and soon to be the country's first European
commissioner, declared: 'Sweden is writing history tonight. This is the most
important decision we in Sweden have taken in the post-war period.'
By voting to join the European Union, Sweden and Finland (which held its
referendum last month) have cemented a profound change of direction that
will affect their strategic allegiances, political alliances and economic
development.
However, the subdued countenance on Sunday evening of Mr Ingvar Carlsson,
the Swedish prime minister who battled hard to achieve the 52.2 per cent to
46.9 per cent Yes victory, reflected the defensive mood in which both Sweden
and Finland (which voted 56.9-43.1) have embraced EU membership. A similar
mood can be detected in Norway, where uncertainty surrounds the outcome of
its referendum on EU entry in 13 days.
The Nordic countries may be on their way into the heart of Europe, but a
large proportion of their people remain hostile to - or at least sceptical
about - EU membership.
The move to join the EU came relatively recently. As late as 1990, Mr
Carlsson continued to hold his Social Democratic party back from abandoning
its traditional opposition to membership. A year later, with recession
looming and the end of the cold war removing a vital obstacle to neutral
Sweden's participation in the EU's political structures, Mr Carlsson
abruptly swung the party in favour of joining.
The application for membership lodged by Sweden prompted a similar move by
Finland which was afraid of being left behind on the fringes of Europe. It
also saw an historic opportunity to cement its position in the west while
Russia was in disarray following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In Norway, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour prime minister, also judged
that the applications by Sweden and Finland gave the political impetus
needed for an attempt to overturn the Norwegian rejection of membership in
1972.
In Sweden and Finland, a majority of voters has now accepted the case for
membership made by the mainstream political, business and labour
establishments - accepting the move from neutrality towards European
security structures, from small-nation independence to political
co-operation, and from self-sufficiency to economic integration.
But the pattern of voting showed the divisions created by the referenda in
Sweden and Finland. Most striking was the way southern, urban areas voted
Yes and the less-populated rural and northern areas voted firmly No.
In Sweden, most regions voted No. Majorities for entry came only in the
heavily populated areas around the three main cities - Stockholm, Gothenburg
and Malmo.
For Mr Carlsson, there were other worrying features. Opposition to change
among first-time voters was higher than might have been expected from young
people. There was also strong opposition from women, who are heavily
employed in Sweden's generous welfare system which they fear is under threat
from EU membership.
And some 45 per cent of those supporting Mr Carlsson's Social Democratic
party voted against membership. Those who voted Yes were mainly
higher-income supporters of right-of-centre political parties, such as the
conservative Moderate party led by Mr Carl Bildt, the former prime minister.
It is the better-off who expect to gain most from EU membership.
In other words, what might be described as the most characteristically
'Nordic' part of the electorate - those dependent on the welfare state and
those outside the big cities - rejected membership. They rallied instead to
the No campaign led by a minority of the Social Democratic party leadership
and two small parties, the Left party and the Environmental party.
Mr Carlsson's pro-EU campaign argued mmbership would give Sweden the
economic stability needed to correct the huge imbalance in public finances
and help the battle against unemployment - now 13 per cent of the workforce.
He rejected the No campaign argument that EU membership would erode the
welfare state.
But if the economic fruits of membership do not come through quickly, the
split in the Social Democratic party over the EU could widen and become a
long-term problem - not unlike the difficulties over Europe Mr John Major,
the UK prime minister, has experienced in his Conservative party.
A similar pattern can be seen in Finland's vote for EU membership. Mr Esko
Aho, the prime minister who led the successful campaign to join the Union,
has had to deal with a bitter internal battle in his rurally-based Centre
party, split by fierce opposition to EU membership from farmers. The party,
suffering also the political consequences of having led the government
through a deep recession, is now expected to lose power to the opposition
Social Democrats in next March's general election.
Norway's Mrs Brundtland also presides over a party that is split on the EU
issue. She knows that if she wins a Yes in Norway, the country will, like
Sweden and Finland, be divided geographically and politically. If Norway
votes No, however, a wider divide will open between Scandinavian neighbours
that have long sought to stay in step with one another.
The Nordic move into the EU is, indeed, a historic move. But forging a new
relationship with Europe looks likely to impose a steep price on the
politicians who have led the campaign for EU membership.

Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the
German Bundestag, is fast turning into Chancellor Kohl's unguided missile.
Lamers wants to set up a 'hard core' of states at the centre of Europe and
forge ahead with European federalism, much to the irritation of several
European governments. One of those least happy is his own. Bonn's finance
ministry takes exception to Lamers' suggestion that France, Germany and the
Benelux countries will automatically form the 'core' of European monetary
union.
Londoners have the chance to hear for themselves when Lamers brings his
federalist roadshow to town on Thursday, speaking at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs and the European think-tank, Federal Trust.
Will he tone down his federalism once at the heart of Euroscepticism? Let's
hope not; some snap, crackle and pop would make a nice change.

Yesterday's letter in the FT from Mike Flanagan, network director of Post
Office Counters, caught the eye. Not so much for his comments about the
growing popularity of franchised post offices with customers, but his
statement that 95 per cent of Britain's post offices have been run by
sub-postmasters for the past 350 years.
Business must have been pretty slow for the first couple of hundred years
until Sir Rowland Hill introduced the modern postal system in 1840.

Is Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's trade representative and tub-thumping
promoter of US commercial interests, going a bit soft? He arrived at this
week's informal summit of Apec leaders in Indonesia on a Singapore Airlines
flight. And that despite this year's diplomatic fracas over Singapore's
caning of an American student. 'At least the plane was a Boeing,' protested
an embarrassed Kantor aide.

Lawrence Watson, of Hay management consultants, confessed to delegates at
the company's annual international conference - just ended in Prague - that
not everything had run smoothly from the outset.
The problem was that a Czech customs officer questioned Hay's import of 400
copies of The Empty Raincoat, the latest book by employment theorist Charles
Handy, one of the speakers. The books were stopped at the border while
customs officers fired off a fax to ask: 'Are the raincoats made of wool or
cotton and are they for males or females? We don't know how much duty to
charge you.'

Takes a naval man to restore discipline. For the first time in living memory
photographers will have to wear morning dress at tomorrow's state opening of
Parliament if they want to take pictures in the House of Lords. Admiral Sir
Richard Thomas, a former deputy supreme allied commander in the Atlantic,
who took up his duties as Black Rod a couple of years ago, has been
increasingly concerned by the clothes sense of some paparazzi. Last year's
turnout was felt to be particularly sloppy.

Whatever city English-speakers find themselves landing up in these days,
there seems to be a local English-language newspaper ready and waiting. From
the Moscow Times to the Buenos Aires Herald, someone wants to tell you
what's going on in their neck of the woods.
Two new ones have now joined the ranks. Prague yesterday saw the launch of
the Bohemia Daily Standard, a tabloid backed by Bank Austria and publisher
Erik Best, aiming for sales of 10,000 in a city with about 30,000
English-speaking expatriates. It's edited by Francis Harris, who covered the
former Czechoslovakia for the UK's Daily Telegraph.
Meanwhile in Switzerland, The Geneva Post was launched on Monday. Publisher
Jacques Werner, a lawyer who also publishes academic journals on arcane
legal matters, hopes his paper will appeal to Geneva's large expatriate
community attached to numerous UN and other international organisations.
Werner, who has hired former Independent foreign editor Harvey Morris as
editor and is aiming to sell around 10,000 copies, apparently has only one
prejudice - he doesn't want to see the phrase 'gnomes of Zurich'. So we
won't mention that.
But what a pity that both papers missed the chance of snapping up Andrew
Neil, former editor of the Sunday Times, who has now severed most of his
links with Rupert Murdoch. Maybe the Phnom Penh Post is scouting around for
a new champion . . .

FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bureaucracy in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL COHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having read the article by Emma Tucker about her experiences with
Brussels bureaucracy (Perspectives: 'Welcome to Soviet Belgium', November
12/13), I can only feel sorry for her.
However, being a Dutchman, who has lived in Germany, France, Belgium and the
UK, I regret that my experiences with the authorities in the UK were by far
the worst. This starts when you enter the UK and your car is thoroughly
searched for an hour (although I have short hair), and it continues when you
want to have a residence permit. Maybe having an Indonesian wife does not
help, but I have never felt as humiliated as when I waited in a queue
outside the Home Office in Croydon at 6am - after a 2 1/2 hour drive - only
to be told several hours later that I should have gone to my local police
station, which had just sent me to Croydon the day before.
So, not much different from Brussels, I fear.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Marginalisation of Mediterranean
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN C CALLEYA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your assessment of Europe's future challenge in your editorial,
'Europe's big challenge' (November 9), is accurate in indicating that the EU
1996 intergovernmental conference must contend with the assignment of
furthering the integration experiment in the west and simultaneously spell
out a plan for integrating the states of eastern and central Europe.
But it surprisingly makes no mention of Europe's challenges on its southern
flank. An analysis of the EU's recent document, Strengthening the
Mediterranean Policy of the EU: Establishing a Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership, which proposes the creation of a free trade zone in the area,
and a review of EU enlargement to include either Malta, Cyprus or Turkey,
are absent.
For the record, the EU now gives twice as much aid to eastern Europe as to
the Mediterranean. In the period 1990-1994, the EU spent Ecu 1.626bn
(Dollars 2.07bn) on the Mediterranean and Ecu 3.781bn on eastern Europe.
Is this an indication of gradual marginalisation by Brussels of the
Mediterranean, despite lip-service to the contrary?

FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: The worst of all worlds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OLEH HAVRYLYSHYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Painful rebirth from the ashes' (November 11), Anthony
Robinson makes some valuable points about how much has been achieved by
former communist countries in the transition from central planning to market
economy, and how this is already giving pay-offs. It is useful to have such
a 'half-full glass' perspective on the still difficult process of change in
these countries.
However, I would take issue with Robinson's too-simple analogy between the
capital amassed there in recent years through 'often clandestine
expropriation and export of raw materials, energy and other resources' and
the US and European robber baron equivalents in the 19th century.
The 19th century monopolists did not, on the whole, make their fortunes with
the help of a highly interventionist government. US and European economies,
while not paragons of free markets, were generally open, competitive
economies, with free price-setting, very low government budgets (generally
balanced) and a prudent money-creation environment. The transition economy
robber barons base their profits on privileged access to low-priced
materials, substantial and cheap credits, trade licenses (hence monopoly
rights), and so on. The big difference therefore is that today's robber
barons have become strong proponents of retaining the administered and
distorted system that is neither central planning nor an open competitive
market. For them, this is the best of both worlds, and they have plenty of
influence to try to keep things that way. For the population at large, this
partial step to the market is the worst of both worlds.
It will not automatically happen that the accumulated capital (much of it
abroad) will be reinvested in these economies. It will require a
strong-willed leadership to break the system of interventions, create a
competitive, open-market environment - and thereby attract back this amassed
capital.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greenpeace: a changing role, but not
out of a job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In her long article, 'Campaigners all at sea' (November 12/13), Bronwen
Maddox says Greenpeace has 'campaigned itself out of a job', because it has
achieved 'extraordinary success in changing the relationship between
advanced industrial societies and the natural world'. Sadly, we have to
disagree.
The 'success' has been mainly confined to the establishment of political
conventions and increased understanding - attitudes have changed but
activities mostly have not. For the media the global environmental crisis
has perhaps been eclipsed by the 'environmental revolution' in the attitude
of politicians and industrial public relations but this is change in
appearances, not substance.
Maddox cites the London convention on radioactive waste dumping, but
Sellafield still pumps waste out to sea from land. Toxic waste dumping at
sea has been banned. Yet waste is still legally discharged from land, dumped
on land or incinerated. And, as she says, 150 countries acknowledged global
warming at the Rio Earth Summit yet carbon dioxide emissions are still set
to rise.
There is no international treaty to protect forests, even on paper: we are
taking direct action to stop the Brazilian mahogany trade. The Montreal
Protocol on protection of the ozone layer was incapable of forcing industry
to adopt technologies that did not use ozone destroying or global warming
gases. This led Greenpeace to intervene in the market with 'greenfreeze'
refrigeration, instead of continuing to rely on the media and government
instruments to deliver change.
Maddox fairly describes some of the problems faced by environmental
organisations in a more environmentally-aware world: we must change role
from mainly identifying problems to delivering change. But our task is to
stop destruction, not just to draw attention to its most visible forms.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Virtually real democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are sitting at home, your hand near the remote con-trol device. A
convicted murderer's face appears on the screen, top right corner. A voice
asks whether the miscreant should or should not be executed. The text
alongside reinforces the spoken message: 'To have your say, simply press Y
or N' The unpleasant details of the killing, some recreated by computer
imagery, have just been replayed for what seems like the thousandth time.
You are reminded that if the public-access vote is 'Y' the supreme penalty
will be exacted, in full view, just after the dinner hour. You reach across
your snack tray and pick up the remote . . .
The above little scene, some may protest, is a sub-Orwellian nightmare,
unworthy of serious attention. Oh yes? Even in California? Sophisticated
folk like us know that true democracy is a nonsense. It is the rule of the
mob. Elites - that is, you and I - manage to stave off the mindless tyranny
of the majority by a variety of means, the most effective of which is the
pretence that periodic elections decide matters of importance. Modern
government, even in its minimalist form, is so complicated that it would be
impossible to consult the voters at every turn.
Not so. Technology that could make the largest of countries function like a
parish meeting already exists. In its most advanced form - a multimedia box
connected by telephone line to everywhere - the necessary gadgetry is likely
to become commonplace in middle-class homes by, shall we say, the turn of
the century. Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, indicated yesterday that
his company proposes to sell software that puts buyers in touch with
catalogues, purveyors of financial snake-oil, electronic libraries, and that
great stimulant of so many of our imaginations, the Internet. Mr Gates has
made a huge success of Windows, the program that enables newcomers to
understand computers. He might do well with his Microsoft Network.
It is not evident that he has political applications in mind, but that makes
no difference. Politics is already entwined in the Net. In the 1992
presidential election Mr Ross Perot promised electronic plebiscites. Last
year President Bill Clinton stage-managed an 'electronic town hall',
although without voting rights. His vice-president is starry-eyed about the
whole business. If you have the necessary hardware you may embark on a
virtual reality tour of the White House. Sophisticated chip-based devices
were deployed in last week's mid-term elections, the ones in which the
Democrats were so thoroughly worsted. In Minnesota candidates for the Senate
conducted an on-line debate. Computer-access public interest groups have
been established in Oregon, Ohio, Illinois, Florida and elsewhere. They are
available on the World Wide Web, which can transmit text, moving pictures
and sound.
In California, nearly every candidate spent part of his or her campaign
funds on digitising their messages. A nasty proposition, number 187, was
overwhelmingly approved. It denies public services to illegal immigrants.
Last year some Californians supported attempts to have TV cameras present at
executions. Software companies have invented ways of identifying electors at
their home screens, although it is not clear how this kind of electronically
screened vote could be kept secret. Yet add it all up and my opening
paragraph becomes less fanciful. Wired democracy is a popular notion. No
wonder Mr Newt Gingrich, leader of the Republicans in the lower house,
remarked after his party's recent victory that every bill or committee
report filed in Washington would be put on line.
It is important to keep hold of actual reality. Browsing through Profile,
the FT's on-line library, I read that some 20-30m personal computers, in at
least half the world's countries, are linked to the Internet. Yet the most
advanced technology is probably possessed by say, between 2m and 3m PC
owners. That probably defines the number of Americans who logged on to
candidates' literature during the mid-term elections. Could it be that the
Net is just another device for whiling away the long night hours? We have
waves of the future come and go; none has yet drowned us. Satellite TV,
cable, fibre-optics, the fax, the cordless telephone have been subsumed into
our lives; none has become predominant.
That said, I am not so sure that the gathering wave of 'electronic
democracy' will recede. Voters everywhere are disillusioned with established
parties and politicians. The temptation to travel back to ancient Athens via
one of Mr Gates's icons may be irresistible. In Britain various think tanks
and pressure groups have worried at the edges of the problem, without
reaching much of a conclusion. Lean Democracy, a pamphlet published by Demos
in the summer, discusses participatory models of wired decision-making. 'It
is likely to take many years of experiment . . . to discover which methods
of using technology entail which effects,' the prudent authors say.
A discussion on referendums organised by Charter 88 a few weeks back could
be summarised as concluding that they are all right if limited to
constitutional issues or local matters. Demos, Charter 88 and the
Labour-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research have all discussed
citizens' juries, groups of public-spirited individuals who are prepared to
sit and listen to professionals before pronouncing on the merits of this or
that policy. The IPPR booklet, Citizens' Juries, by John Stewart, Elizabeth
Kendall and Anna Coote was published last Thursday. It describes experiments
in the US and Germany and proposes a trial run in Britain.
Why not? An electronic referendum is a dangerous idea. Voters would decide
on the basis of no knowledge, and flashy sound-bites. The poor may not have
access to computers. Putting a citizens' jury on TV or an interactive net
might be more attractive, if you could be certain that the participants paid
attention. Meanwhile, we should think. The first picture of an Apple PC in
the FT appeared in the late 1970s. It showed a child at the screen. Now
grown up, she has presented me with a subscription to the Internet. That is
how far home computing has travelled in about 16 years. We will experience
the politics of this device well before another 16 have passed.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Statement of intent: Pretoria's ambitious economic programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 2bn bid for a military helicopter contract; a recipe for
vitamin-enriched bread; and a trade union federation's development fund: all
are part of a new national mission in South Africa, the Reconstruction and
Development Programme (RDP).
With the death of both apartheid and the socialist vision of the African
National Congress, the RDP is being promoted as the country's path to
political stability and economic growth.
It is now so powerful and pervasive a feature of South African life, that
scarcely any large initiative, in the private or public sector, is launched
without ritual reference to the plan.
International donors talk of promoting the programme, the corporate sector
spells out how its plans gel with the RDP's goals, and educational
institutions frame their mission in terms of developing the necessary human
capital to implement the RDP.
However, behind this enthusiasm lies widespread confusion over exactly what
the programme involves.
Most people would probably say the RDP was primarily a state-sponsored
initiative to provide jobs and houses for the very poor - casting an eye at
the R37.5bn over five years that the government has budgeted to promote
everything from school feeding schemes to new water plants in rural areas.
But important though these high-profile initiatives are, they are only part
of a much larger programme. The white paper on the RDP, recently presented
to parliament, sets out the programme's five broad goals as meeting basic
needs, such as jobs, land and housing; developing human resources through
education and training; promoting economic growth; completing the
democratisation process; and establishing the government structure and
capacity to implement these aims.
As Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister without portfolio who has the task of
overseeing the programme, is fond of pointing out, the RDP is intended to do
more than build a few extra schools and clinics.
'It is not a set of ad hoc projects on the ground,' he said last month. 'It
is not about government centralising power in its own hands. It is about the
fundamental transformation of government and society.'
The economic policies that are being adopted to meet these aims have been
widely applauded both domestically and abroad. Although the programme
includes several state-led initiatives, the bulk of the RDP will be driven
by the private sector.
The commitments to nationalisation and socialist policies that infused
earlier drafts of the programme, when it was part of the ANC's electoral
campaign, have been jettisoned. So, too, have the references, side-by-side,
to free enterprise, frugality and high-spending, inflationary policies.
The ANC-led administration has instead committed itself to cutting the
budget deficit, is pushing ahead with privatisation, and has proven highly
supportive of the Reserve Bank's unpopular policy of high interest rates -
aimed at keeping a rein on inflation.
Indeed, the new government has become so staunch a defender of economic
discipline that it has been charged by some of its constituents with being
too right wing.
Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin's response to these charges has been that
'fiscal and monetary discipline as an instrument to achieve objectives may
mean that, like (former UK prime minister) Mrs Thatcher, we use a stove to
cook a meal, but ours is a very different meal: it is one that we all will
share and enjoy the quality of the cooking.'
While such high hopes for the gains from economic discipline are thought to
be realistic by many observers, they worry that other elements of the RDP
may not be. The white paper's commitment to increasing civil service
productivity and cutting the number of state employees appears Herculean. A
recent analysis by the Johannesburg-based Centre for Policy Studies
concludes that, given the pressure on the government to deliver improved
conditions and the difficulty of retrenching white bureau-crats, meeting
these goals is likely to prove impossible.
Even more problematic is the question of project implementation, dealt with
only briefly in the white paper. Local authorities are to be given a
management role in everything from the provision of houses to new schools.
In practice, however, local government remains chaotic in much of the
country as a result of widespread rent and service boycotts; establishing
effective local government structures could take years.
'The RDP at this stage is very abstract. It deals with the framework but not
delivery,' said Mr Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, responsible for the running of
local government elections planned for next year.
It is the idealism that underlies the programme that seems to have generated
this weakness, as well as the programme's strengths.
The RDP is essentially a revolutionary plan drawn up by a new government
with a burning vision of the country it wants to build, and a strong desire
to deliver tangible results from the destruction of apartheid: hence the
broad scope of the RDP, and its adoption as a national crusade by all the
political parties in government.
Rather than being a policy document over which political opponents disagree,
the RDP has become a statement of aims within which most policy disputes are
taking place. Thus the debate on interest rates is framed as a discussion
over whether higher interest rates will promote the RDP.
The same is true in business. During a recent car industry strike, employers
defended their low wage offers as necessary to free funds for capital
expenditure in support of the RDP, while workers' organisations argued that
under the RDP they should be receiving improved training and better
conditions.
The programme's elevation to national mission has also raised the prospect
that those who stray from its premises will be purged. There have already
been calls for various senior civil servants to be dismissed for being
'anti-RDP'; an official at the Development Bank of South Africa was fired
following charges that he tried to sabotage the programme.
However, the government seems under no illusions about what will ultimately
determine the success of the RDP. It is economic growth that will make or
break the programme. The danger will lie in trying to deliver too much too
soon.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Customs and Excise adds to burdens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROLE MACPHERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest Peter Norman's article on the first
prosecution of a UK company for failure to provide Intrastat returns
('Company fined over missing trade statistics', November 9).
Dams International has my sympathy. I know only too well the additional
burden which has been placed on UK businesses by Customs and Excise with
this latest statutory requirement.
However, the closing comments by customs officials that the Intrastat system
is 'less burdensome than previously' is a little difficult to comprehend.
Certainly it is less burdensome for Customs and Excise as the entire burden
falls on UK businesses to collect these statistics.
From our own experience, the investment in extra administrative and systems
development has had an all too real cost, which certainly does not fit in
with the stated 'savings to UK businesses of Pounds 135m'.
Surely Customs and Excise is referring to savings by central government, it
having once again passed the onus for collection of tedious statistics to UK
businesses? There are many further examples, including National Insurance
and value added tax on private fuel, etc.
It is difficult for us to see the savings.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Schnittke Series - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In this, his 60th birthday, Alfred Schnittke's position as the natural
successor to Shostakovich as Russia's leading composer seems unassailable.
Schnittke festivals are on the increase, his discography is - for a serious
contemporary composer - massive, and his rate of production - especially
given his precarious state of health and his need to make statements on a
large scale - shows no sign of dwindling. For his admirers, he is as much
moral inspiration as pure musician: they speak passionately of his work's
overwhelming emotional intensity and of his giving voice in dark and
dangerous times to the soul of an oppressed Russian people.
These are strong claims, but are they justified by the musical reality? Do
the ends - the powerful communication of non-musical truths - justify the
means? Can we turn a deaf ear to the relative crudity of Schnittke's
techniques, not least his juxtapositions of avant-garde cliches and
quotations from the whole gamut of musical history? Or should we expect more
from a composer of his stature than a language in which the ideas behind the
music are more important than the music itself, and in which the actual
notes dissolve into a rhetoric whose only raison d'etre seems to be dictated
by the composer's own freely associating anxieties?
'Perhaps' and 'sometimes' may be the answers, but not, I think, on the basis
of the three Schnittke pieces given exemplary performances by the London
Sinfonietta in the opening concert of the Barbican Centre's Schnittke Series
on Friday. The shortest, Three by Seven, proved a slight, rather dry and
schematic exchanges between harpsichord and instrumental ensemble.
The earliest, Quasi una sonata of 1987 for violin and chamber orchestra, a
reworking of his Second Violin Sonata of 1968, was a typical head-on
collision between sounds from the 1960s avant-garde and quotes from
Beethoven and Brahms, which ignores the purely musical implications of its
material in favour of hollow gestures and temper tantrums.
The most recent, Five Fragments on Pictures by Hieronymous Bosch, receiving
its recourse to rudimentary melody-plus-chords textures, sounded dangerously
undercomposed.
Ironically, it was the work of two of Schnittke's compatriots which offered
the main musical interest of the evening. Life without Christmas - Daytime
Prayers by Giya Kancheli was a gentle, Goreckian meditation for clarinet and
ensemble, capped by the arrival of a boy soprano to sing a Latin prayer.
More striking was Alexander Raskatov's Xenia, another delicate, meditative
work, evolving logically from shimmering tintinnabulations and revealing a
fine ear for subtle shifts of colour, new orchestral sonorities and some
appealingly quirky changes of direction.
The Schnittke Series continues at the Barbican Centre tonight and November
17.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Ashton celebrated - Clement Crisp reviews the Royal
Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the weeks leading up to Christmas, the Royal Ballet is offering two
programmes of ballets by Sir Frederick Ashton, with the added seasonal
pleasure of his Cinderella. This is a first and over-due celebration of the
work of the man whose creations vitally shaped our national style of classic
dance.
Ashton was a genius. First Marie Rambert, then Ninette de Valois gave him
his earliest chances, and de Valois - prescient as ever - entrusted him with
the role of chief choreographer to her company in 1935. From that moment on
he made ballets which can be seen as an ascending curve of imaginative
brilliance, craft and poetic sensibility.
I have been fortunate enough to see much of his work with its first casts.
(Ashton was often indifferent to dancers who took over roles, and could make
such devastating comments as 'She's not chic' - by which he meant wit in
technique and manner). His maturity as a choreographer came after the war.
For the next three decades he made ballets whose variety and felicity of
means were central to the Royal Ballet's identity.
He took on the mantle of Petipa and gave us Cinderella, the delicious and
shamefully neglected Sylvia, the tragic Ondine, the sunburst of La Fille mal
gardee, and the romance of The Two Pigeons. He explored Fonteyn's gifts in
role after role. He could evoke Greek myth in the mysterious Persephone and
Daphnis and Chloe, and extract the essence from a drama to make a work as
emotionally succinct as Month in the Country. He could be hugely and subtly
funny in A Wedding Bouquet, and very moving through no less subtle means in
Lament of the Waves. He could make dance glitter - one of his own favourite
works was the sublime theorem of Scenes de ballet - and make his dancers
opulent, grand, in Birthday Offering.
Above all, his creativity fed on music, and on qualities he sensed in his
interpreters - hence his lack of much interest in their successors. His
ballets remain the truest portrait of his company for much of its existence.
So now, somewhat belatedly, the Royal Ballet makes an Ashton homage. A stage
shared with opera precludes the celebrations that New York City Ballet gave
in last spring's showing of 73 Balanchine works. But I made a tally of some
30 Ashton pieces which should be in the repertory. A national ballet owes
this to its dancers and audiences: the Ashton heritage is no less important
than, say, the works of Benjamin Britten, and Ashton must be accounted one
of our greatest lyric poets.
Thursday night's first programme brought a revival and re-decoration of
Daphnis and Chloe, the return of La Valse and Symphonic Variations, and
duets from Sylvia and Birthday Offering, works spanning 12 great Ashtonian
years, 1946-58. The evening was the victim of injuries: four principals,
among others, were replaced. It is for this reason that I am reluctant to
say much about Symphonic Variations, which looked studied rather than
spontaneous. Because this work has been elevated to the status of a sacred
text, it is too often danced as if its cast were in church. Bruce Sansom in
the leading male role was fine: the rest of the cast looked tentative. They
might adopt some of the freedom and sense of giving themselves to the pulse
of the music which made the opening La Valse look so handsome as Ravel's
whirlwind bore its couples along.
The two pas de deux made me long for the entire ballets from which they were
extracted. Birthday Offering was, in 1956, a loving portrait of the
company's seven ballerinas in the year of its silver jubilee. (I wish I
thought that the present troupe could field seven such varied and
fascinating artists). At the heart of it, of course, Margot Fonteyn and her
cavalier, Michael Somes. On Thursday, Lesley Collier and Jonathan Cope gave
the duet its proper grace. Collier has wit and the proper understanding of
Ashtonian nuance, and Cope is a handsome partner: the piece was alive.
The Sylvia duet - one of Ashton's most brilliant and demanding creations for
Fonteyn and Somes - did not look happy with Viviana Durante and Irek
Mukhamedov. Mukhamedov has the power the dance needs, though he makes it
seem more Bolshoi-like than heretofore. Durante seemed flustered by
intricacies that Fonteyn played with a delicious and understated amusement
in what Ashton had set her to do. But the duet whets the appetite: we really
must have the whole ballet restored to the stage with its ravishing designs
by the Ironside brothers.
Daphnis and Chloe has been long over-due for return. Now it is back, with
new design by Martyn Bainbridge replacing John Craxton's original
decoration. The initial impression of Bainbridge's work is excellent. His
permanent set is of creamy stone walls with a distant landscape shimmering
through horizontal lines which mask the backdrop. The costuming is timeless
yet suitably archaic, in natural-coloured linen and wool for the villagers,
rather more conventionally piratical for Bryaxis and his crew. I think it a
miscalculation to use an obviously theatrical moon and tinselly stars for
the pirate scene, and to make the last act sea like a dowager's sequinned
bosom glittering all-too-brightly in the morning light. These seem trumpery
when contrasted with the earlier aptness of the design.
The Chloe of Trinidad Sevillano - a replacement for an injured Sarah Wildor
 -was deliciously soft in outline and tender in manner, and the character
lived. So did Stuart Cassidy's Daphnis, happily combining innocence and
passion. Lykanion and Dorkon, who must tempt the young lovers, were given
first sketches by Benazir Hussein and Adam Cooper, but the pirate Bryaxis
needs a far weightier presence than Matthew Hart's physique can bring - the
part cries out for Mukhamedov. This is, nonetheless, a welcome revival. Let
it be the precursor of much more Ashton - and MacMillan - restored to the
stage: their work is our national ballet's treasure, and identity.
Daphnis and Chloe sponsored by the Robert Gavron Charitable Trust.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Breda hosts the art of youth - The European biennale
show, 'Germinations'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germinations, a European biennale for young artists, was set up in the early
1980s under the aegis of the Office Franco-Allemande pour la jeunesse. The
UK joined in almost at once, followed by the Netherlands, and so it has
continued to grow until in this, its eighth recurrence, some 15 countries
are taking part.
Such growth speaks not just of a practical success, but of a wider
recognition of the cultural and educational opportunity that Germinations
represents. The arguments make themselves: the focus upon youth and
education; pan-european co-operation extending across the community into the
former communist bloc; all the cultural opportunities that follow, of mutual
experience and exchange.
Yet what the European Commission giveth, the European Commission taketh
away, and this time, late in the day, the funding was withdrawn. To
criticise this Breda Germinations for the absence of those workshop
programmes, whereby participating artists from different countries would
have been given the chance to work abroad together at selected centres in
the months before the actual exhibition, is therefore no criticism of
Germinations itself. The point was acknowledged by the administration, and
confirmed by the artists, who certainly felt deprived.
The immediate reinstatement of these workshops is already the declared
priority for Germinations 9. Where the money will come from, however - the
Commission; the national funding bodies; private sponsorship? - is unclear.
The pity is that the sums are still comparatively small.
Has Germinations itself become too big? Sixty-four artists are represented,
a handful from each country which inevitably blurs what might be national
characteristics into individual quirks and interests. With funding secure,
would a more frequent programme be better, allowing a reduced and rolling
permutation of the member nations rather than all aboard, every time?
Perhaps.
The work itself is what is to be expected of any recent student generation,
an avant-garde orthodoxy in both range of practice and content. There is
enough here of the beautiful, intriguing and well-made to remain encouraged.
It is only the narrowness of the range of preoccupation, the stultifying
assumption that art must be idea-led rather than more intuitively responsive
to the world, that is so sad.
Here, then, are some film and video, some print, installations, both
conceptual and theatrical, and a lot of well-made abstract sculpture. There
is also some painting on canvas, almost all of it abstract and some of it
very good. Such is the currency of art schools, not just in the UK but
across Europe. But for anything direct and competent in its relation to
nature, most of all to the figure, we look in vain. What little there is of
figurative representation is embarrassingly inept.
That said, however, I would also say that the British contingent of eight
artists was as strong as any, ranging from painting, through sculpture, to
conceptual installation. Two of the painters were outstanding - Lynn Flavell
with her elegantly abstracted pattern-fields derived from piles of fruit;
and Sophie Benson, whose large, delicately worked and spatially ambiguous
drawings deservedly won her the special bursary. The sculptor too, Naomi
Dines, had made some quite extraordinary things. She is obsessed by tack and
tackle of all kinds, as might be found on boats or horses, or in the surgery
 -odd splints, supports, restraints, all beautifully made in leather and
hung with an off-hand deliberation upon the wall. Of the rest I liked the
sinister chair-figures of Klara Klose (Czech), Catherine Harang's metal
structures (France), Petra Ondreickova's painted relief perspective (Czech)
and Katarina Diacomi's prawn-like wire creatures, dancing on springs.
Barbara Kowalczyk (Poland), with her parcels of pigment on shelves and
window-sills, won the Boudaille Prize as best artist in the show.
Germinations 8: the St Joost Academy and the De Beyerd Contemporary Art
Centre, Breda, The Netherlands, until December 4. Supported by the
Commission of the European Community, Brussels, and by individual national
organisations.

Two things stand out tonight: Barbara Windsor (the Carry On mode is
inescapable). The busty cockney sparrer has little of interest to say, but
that's to be expected from Without Walls: The Obituary Show (C4 9.00), with
one of those fearsomely humourless commissioning editors who persistently
pronounce obiter dicta on humour. On tonight's showing you might think she's
been rather lucky. So perhaps has Muriel Gray, extolling (or not) the Range
Rover in Ride On (C4 8.00): a figure no less grotesque but rather less
self-knowledgeable.
From sex, albeit self-parodying, to our other preoccupation, money. How to
Win the Lottery (BBC1 9.30) is also a lesson in how to survive that
sometimes pyrrhic victory. Inane purchases, litigious relatives, the quest
for wealth sliding effortlessly into the slot once occupied by organised
religion.
Those who remember the young John Pilger's blend of righteousness,
theatrical anger and occasionally woolly thinking can skip Network First
(ITV 10.40) with a clear conscience. Some of that youthful hysteria would be
welcome in this plod through the British arms trade.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Technology: Microsoft on-line to the future - The software
giant's planned information service for PC users is assessed by Louise Kehoe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft is set to bulldoze its way into the on-line computer services
business with the launch of the Microsoft Network, unveiled by Bill Gates,
chief executive, yesterday.
Gates described his vision of how data networks will change the way people
work, learn and communicate by the year 2005 at the huge Comdex computer
trade show in Las Vegas. He said his planned on-line service will be a
significant step toward realising the full promise of personal computing by
putting 'information at your fingertips'.
Microsoft's plans are not just futuristic dreams. The world's largest and
most profitable software company aims to make the on-line services business
a central element of its long-term growth. As well as investing heavily in
the new business venture itself, Microsoft is forming partnerships with
telephone companies, publishers and entertainment groups to create a broad
range of on-line services.
In preparation for these services, Microsoft has developed software for
users and information providers. The company is also proposing a business
model that it believes will draw substantial third party investment to
creating new interactive on-line services, greatly expanding the market.
The ultimate goal is to establish the Microsoft Network as a standard
'platform', or technology foundation, for interactive on-line services in
much the same way that its Windows program is the software base for a huge
variety of personal computer applications.
The Microsoft Network 'will provide a setting for a worldwide electronic
marketplace of products and services from Microsoft and third parties,' the
company says.
Access to the Microsoft Network will be one of the features incorporated in
Windows 95, a new version of the widely-used PC operating system program, to
be released next April or May. Purchasers of PCs loaded with the new
software as well as those who upgrade their current versions of Windows,
will be offered a discount or free trial of the basic communications
services of the Microsoft Network. These will include electronic mail,
bulletin boards and chat lines.
But Microsoft plans to expand its on-line services quickly with the addition
of newspapers and magazines, shopping catalogues, games and educational
services as well as its own base of services. To draw publishers to its
network, Microsoft is offering them flexibility in how they run and charge
for their on-line services.
An on-line magazine on the Microsoft Network might, for example, charge a
modest subscription fee but raise additional revenue from advertising. A
shopping catalogue might offer free access but charge a transaction fee.
Both will be able to control the look and feel of their on-line service to
preserve their brand image.
'We will be more flexible than existing on-line services,' says Bill Miller,
Microsoft director of on-line services marketing. 'Providers will not be
limited in the ways in which they realise revenue for their services. More
important, they will retain the majority of the revenues that their content
and services generate.'
Most of the current on-line services charge users simply according to how
much time they spend connected to the service and pay 'content-providers' a
flat 20-30 per cent share of revenue. For users, Microsoft's plan will mean
lower fees for basic services and the option to spend more on specific
information sources. It also eliminates the biggest drawback to exploring
new on-line services - the cost of connect time as you browse.
To support this new approach to the on-line services business, Microsoft has
created a sophisticated billing and tracking system that will be linked to
credit card and direct bank debit processing centres.
Through an agreement with Visa, the biggest credit card provider, Microsoft
is also creating tools to ensure security of on-line transactions using
encryption technology.
Microsoft has also developed software to make its on-line services easy to
use. Methods for navigating the service will be based on the familiar
Windows interface. One enhancement will be 'short-cuts' - the ability to
return to a favourite on-line service simply by clicking on an icon.
Companies could use such icons as a marketing tool, Miller suggests. They
might, for example, send icons to users via electronic mail in much the same
way that companies today distribute advertising materials in the post. Some
users will throw away this 'junk electronic mail', but others will be
tempted to click on the icon to look at the products or services on offer.
By matching its approach to on-line services closely to conventional
business practices, Microsoft expects to attract a broad range of potential
on-line service providers that have until now been struggling to figure out
how to make money in the new world of interactive multimedia services.
Companies going on-line via the Microsoft Network will none the less be
leaping into the unknown. It is yet to be seen how many of Microsoft's
Windows 95 purchasers will then sign on to the service.
In contrast, companies such as Mosaic Communications that are building
software tools to support electronic commerce on the Internet - the
international computer information network with an estimated 25m-30m users -
have an established customer base.
'Companies that are writing applications for the Internet today are going to
be best poised to create businesses in interactive digital services,' says
Jim Clark, chairman of Mosaic Communications, a venture that sells Internet
software. 'Large companies are flocking on to the Internet because it has
worldwide reach,' he claims.
'The Internet is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and the Microsoft
Network will end up being a footnote. I think it will fail. In the long term
it will become just another service on the Internet.'
In the short term, however, Microsoft's plans are sending a chill through
the commercial on-line services industry. CompuServe, Prodigy and America
Online, the three leaders in consumer-oriented on-line services, which have
about 6m subscribers, are scrambling to drop prices and upgrade their
services in anticipation of the Microsoft Network.
Microsoft acknowledges that the perceived threat to established services may
be overblown. 'The notion that Microsoft enters the market and the world
changes is crazy,' says Miller. 'From where I sit, we have a long way to go
to match the infrastructure and customers and partners of the existing
services.' While Microsoft's entry will undoubtedly create new interest in
on-line services, existing services 'are going to have an advantage over us
in terms of what they can offer to customers'.
But for how long? With some 20m to 30m copies of Windows 95 expected to be
sold in the first 12 months, Microsoft could quickly overtake all its
competitors and fulfil Gates's vision of 'extending the Windows-based
desktop (personal computer) to a worldwide community of people, ideas and
information'.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Technology: Toolbox for genetic medicine - An ambitious
biotechnology network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most ambitious commercial network dedicated to research and development
in genetic medicine so far was announced yesterday by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer,
the Franco-American pharmaceutical group.
RPR has set up collaborations with 14 companies and academic research
organisations in the US and France, to create what it says is 'the world's
first broad biotechnology network' in the related fields of gene therapy and
cell therapy. At the same time it is establishing a new division, RPR
Gencell, to co-ordinate the network.
Gene therapy involves treating disease by transferring new genetic material
(DNA) to the patient's cells. Cell therapy means removing cells from the
body and treating them with biological agents, such as growth factors, to
increase their activity before returning them to the patient. The two
techniques coincide in 'ex vivo gene therapy', when DNA is added to cells
removed temporarily from the body, to restore the function of a missing or
defective gene.
'Cell and gene therapies offer the opportunity to cure disease at its
origin, while improving quality of life, reducing healthcare costs and
developing new preventive practices,' says Robert Cawthorn, RPR chief
executive.
'It is clear that a variety of technologies - a toolbox, if you will - are
needed if we are to conquer diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and
cardiovascular disease. Our answer is RPR Gencell, an integrated network of
external and internal scientists that will share the 'tools' and expertise
necessary to build successful cell and gene therapeutics on an accelerated
timescale.'
According to Thierry Soursac, general manager of RPR Gencell, the company
has invested Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) over the past two years in setting
up the network. RPR expects to spend about Dollars 100m next year on R&amp;D in
gene and cell therapy.
Other international drug companies, such as Sandoz and Roche of Switzerland,
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, and Eli Lilly of the US, have made
substantial investments in external R&amp;D though alliances with biotech
companies and universities. But Soursac claims that the RPR network is
better planned and more comprehensive in its chosen field.
'The others have less a network and more a succession of investments,' he
says. 'We have built something from the ground up, with clear vision and
therapeutic focus.'
According to Soursac, RPR was able to set up its collaborations relatively
inexpensively, without the huge up-front payments that some other drug
companies have made to biotech partners, because its partners can see the
benefits the network will bring them.
'For example, Ed Rubin (of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Human Genome
Centre, California) is floating on tens of millions of dollars (in grants
from the US government's gene sequencing programmes),' Soursac says. 'He
doesn't need more money. What attracted him is the platform of technology
offered by the club.'
Rubin agrees that his centre is less interested in more funding than in
using the RPR network to speed up the application of newly discovered genes,
particularly those predisposing to cardiovascular (heart) disease. 'We have
good candidate genes,' he says. 'We need better tools to deliver them to the
patient.'
The experimental 'vectors' used to carry new genes into human cells include
various viruses and tiny fat-like
particles called liposomes. But there is also evidence that simply injecting
the genes as 'naked DNA' can work well in some circumstances.
The RPR network had six therapies in clinical trials, with two more trials
about to start. The network will focus initially on cancer, cardiovascular
disease and disorders of the central nervous system.

UBS, the securities house, has announced changes in its convertible and
warrant business.
Mark Larkin, head of convertible trading, has resigned suddenly. The fall in
the bond markets is believed to have led to heavy losses in convertible
trading, although UBS would not comment on its trading position.
Larkin, who resigned last Tuesday, has been replaced by his former deputy,
Colin Dimmock.
Separately, Michael Hammond has joined UBS in New York as executive in
charge of international convertible and warrant sales. He comes from CSFB,
where he was in international convertible sales for five years.
Grant Williams is to join UBS in London on December 1 as director of Asian
equity derivative trading from Robert Fleming where he has been since 1985,
most recently as manager of south-east Asian trading.

FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Cheung seeks further Fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Cheung - the new man at the helm of Fortune Oil, the London-listed oil
company that has just completed its first joint venture in China - may be
worth watching.
He peppers his conversation with jargon about strategic perspective and
streamlining Fortune's board: words to gratify a management school (he has a
Harvard MBA and is an ex-McKinsey consultant), but which conceal a
nuts-and-bolts attitude and solid understanding of running a company
spanning two countries and cultures.
Cheung, 36, was born in Hong Kong to which his parents had emigrated from
the northern Chinese provinces of Hubei and Shandong, and educated at Sussex
University. He spent many years living in the UK and Los Angeles and carries
a US passport. However, he recently made his first ever trip to Beijing -
and says it felt like going home.
A former member of the Central Policy Unit, a Hong Kong government
think-tank, Cheung nevertheless reels off a string of criticisms of the
colony's government. He questions an educational system that produces
students proficient in neither English nor Cantonese, and says Hong Kong's
disputed port extension may turn out to be a white elephant.
But his commitment to local culture appears rock solid. His children attend
Chinese schools, rather than the international institutions favoured by
expatriates and Chinese who have lived overseas.
Less than a month after Cheung took over as chief executive, Fortune has
just completed a Dollars 25m single point mooring oil terminal in Maoming
which will enable the local oil refinery to increase its capacity
substantially. It is the company's first joint venture in the world's third
largest economy and Cheung is confident that it is just the first of many.

FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Iveson quits dairy sector to head Teesside Tec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Iveson, managing director of the Milk Marketing Board until its
abolition on November 1, has become chief executive of Teesside Training and
Enterprise Council.
Iveson, 43, spent 21 years with the MMB; as md of the 61-year-old business
was responsible for a Pounds 2bn annual turnover.
He says he could have remained within the dairy sector but decided to opt
for a change by moving to the Tec. 'It's an opportunity to make a direct
contribution to the improvement of the local community,' he says.
He has come into Teesside Tec as it gears up for a new challenge, thanks to
Samsung, the Korean industrial group which last month announced its choice
of Teesside for a Pounds 450m electronics complex. Middlesbrough-based
Teesside Tec, which is providing Pounds 5m towards the project, is to set up
a special training centre for Samsung.
'Teesside must be doing something right if it can get a big player like
that,' says Iveson, who sees scope for promoting a greater team approach
between the area's employers, local authorities, educational establishments
and economic regeneration bodies.
He believes his MMB experience of negotiating with UK government departments
and the European Community, representing the UK dairy industry, will be of
use in his new role.
'I understand how we might get these relationships working for Teesside,' he
says.
Originally from Derbyshire but based in Surrey for the MMB, Iveson welcomes
the chance to move back to the north of England. Ironically, his predecessor
as the Tec chief executive, John Howell, has gone in the reverse direction:
originally from south London, last month he became chief executive of
Solotec, covering Bexley, Bromley, Croydon and Sutton.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Drugs imports advert ban upheld -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A German ban on advertising of pharmaceuticals imported from other EU member
countries was justified under Rome treaty free movement rules, the European
Court of Justice ruled last week.
The Court said the ban was a restriction on internal market trade which
could be prohibited under the Rome treaty, but was justified on public
health grounds.
In the absence of Community harmonisation measures, therefore, the ban
benefited from the exception to the treaty prohibition of free movement of
goods restrictions.
The Saarbrucken Landgericht had referred two questions on the interpretation
of the Treaty free movement of goods rules to the ECJ.
The questions arose in the context of litigation between Lucien Ortscheit
and Eurim-Pharm, two German pharmaceutical importers. Lucien Ortscheit
sought an order that its competitor cease advertising foreign imports which
had not been approved by the German authorities. Under German law, all
pharmaceuticals, including imports, must be approved by the responsible
Federal authority prior to marketing in Germany. But there is an exception
for certain pharmaceuticals authorised in their country of origin which may
be lawfully marketed when ordered by pharmacists in limited quantities to
supply prescriptions.
The advertising of this specific category of imports is prohibited by the
German law (Heilmittelwerbegesetz) relied on by Lucien Ortscheit. Since
April 1992, Eurim-Pharm had advertised in the professional medical press the
availability of imported pharmaceuticals unauthorised in Germany.
The ECJ said the advertising ban was a restriction on the free movement of
goods since it applied only to imports.
It did not affect the marketing of domestic products in the same way as
imports originating in other member countries. Therefore, it could not
escape the Rome treaty prohibition of restrictions on the free movement of
goods.
In particular, the advertising ban could potentially restrict the volume of
pharmaceutical imports concerned by depriving the market of information on
their availability.
On whether the ban was justified on public health grounds, the Court said it
was covered by the treaty exception to the prohibition of import
restrictions for a number of reasons. First, the treaty exception remained
applicable in the field of production and marketing of pharmaceuticals
insofar as Community harmonisation of national rules was incomplete. In
particular, the 1992 directive (Directive 92/28/EEC) on the advertising of
drugs for human use was not in force at the time material to the German
dispute.
The ECJ then confirmed that public health was among the foremost interests
protected by the exception to the treaty prohibition of free movement of
goods restrictions. The Court said the member countries were free to decide
the degree of health protection they provided subject to the limits imposed
by the treaty. The exception, therefore, would apply only if there was no
method less restrictive of trade than the advertising which was equally
effective for its purpose.
It concluded that the advertising ban was necessary to prevent evasion of
the German pharmaceutical authorisation regime. Since there was not yet a
Community approval system or reciprocal recognition of national
authorisations, member countries were required by the 1965 pharmaceutical
harmonisation directive (modified in 1989) only to permit the marketing of
pharmaceuticals authorised by their responsible national authority.
The advertising ban was intended to maintain the exceptional character of
the specific authorisation exception for imports so that the normal
authorisation requirement would not be systematically evaded. If there was
no such ban, there was a risk that manufacturers would obtain authorisation
in member countries where standards were less strict, and then import the
pharmaceuticals into Germany on the basis of orders resulting from
advertising campaigns.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: High risk of a poor financial product
 -A legal challenge is likely to plans to compensate people badly advised on
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals published last month by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief regulator, for compensating people who took out a personal
pension on poor advice were clearly designed to reduce the risk of court
battles on the issue.
For individual victims of poor advice, the SIB scheme may well have removed
the need to sue. But several of the life companies and independent financial
advisers, which must foot the compensation bill, are far from happy with the
scheme and some have consulted lawyers about possibly mounting a court
challenge.
No life company has expressed qualms about compensating those wrongly
advised by its direct sales force or by a 'tied agent' - a company which
sells only the insurer's policies. They are less sanguine about liability
for poor advice from independent financial advisers (IFAs) selling their
products.
Life companies also believe others have responsibilities to bear. First
among them is the government, which promoted personal pensions with such
enthusiasm. Second are the occupational pension schemes whose rules for
calculating the value of a lump sum which could be transferred by someone
moving to a personal plan is open to challenge.
No legal actions have been launched yet by insurance companies challenging
SIB's proposals. Mr Dominic Clarke, a partner of City solicitors Herbert
Smith, says nobody wants to be the first to challenge the compensation
scheme because of the bad publicity it may generate. But the potential for
litigation is enormous.
In theory the SIB proposals are directed at the front line regulators, such
as the Personal Investment Authority, which are supposed to turn them into
rules or guidance for the life companies which they could be penalised for
not following. But it is clear that the very status of the proposals may be
the subject of a legal challenge.
The SIB plan urges occupational schemes to take back people who have opted
out of an occupational pension scheme and to allow retrospective admission
to those who decided on poor advice not to join a scheme in the first place.
If scheme trustees do not want to take people back, the life company or IFA
is supposed to 'top-up' the personal pension so that, at retirement, the
benefits the occupational scheme would have offered can be matched.
In the case of transferees - those people who have left a company and then
transferred their occupational pension entitlement to a personal plan (where
occupational schemes are likely to be less keen to have people back) - a
top-up is also SIB's preferred method of compensation.
Only where someone has already retired would compensation be an immediate
cash sum.
But, says Mr Clarke, if you take the case of a transferee who received poor
advice from an IFA, his remedy in law would be an action for damages for
negligence against the IFA - proceedings to which neither the trustees of an
occupational scheme nor the life company would be party.
The SIB scheme is proposing a form of remedy for the loss suffered by
victims of poor advice which has no apparent basis in law. The principle of
a non-cash based compensation scheme may be sound, he says, but there is
some doubt as to whether it is enforceable in law.
Mr Ian Gault, another Herbert Smith pensions partner, says it is not
difficult to see the potential for conflict between occupational scheme
trustees and life companies.
The big questions are under what circumstances will trustees allow
reinstatement of those who opted out, and on what terms? If schemes prove
reluctant to have people back life companies and advisers are going to be
left holding the baby.
This could be particularly hard for mutuals, (building societies), which
sold through IFAs who will be left with no alternative but to dip into
reserves set aside for 'with-profits' policyholders to meet the costs of
top-ups.
In life companies, the burden of paying for top-ups will fall on
shareholders. Neither group is likely to be happy with this prospect and
both may decide to sue the company or its directors for negligence or for
breach of fiduciary duty.
That may force life companies into pre-emptive defensive legal action, not
in the belief they can escape without contributing to compensation
altogether, but to establish that the company had no option but to
contribute, thus protecting it from challenge by its own policyholders or
shareholders.
But the most difficult and immediate questions relate to policies sold by
IFAs. Here, says Mr Clarke, there is a potentional for dispute in almost all
cases.
The expectation is that where the business was sold through an IFA, the IFA
will foot the bill because it gave the poor advice. The SIB scheme envisages
IFAs relying on their professional indemnity insurance to meet compensation
claims.
But professional indemnity cover can often be lost if a firm makes a
settlement or admits liability to a client without the agreement of its
insurer. Or the IFA may have received misleading marketing information from
the life company which it relied on in selling the personal pension. So
there is significant potential for litigation between professional indemnity
insurers, life companies and IFAs.
The life companies' most aggressive noises, however, relate to the payment
of compensation for wrongly-advised clients of independent advisers which
have already gone out of business or which do so in the course of reviewing
their potential liability for poor advice.
This may end up being a relatively small part of the total compensation bill
 -which some estimates put at about Pounds 2bn - but the very uncertainty
increases the inclination to consider legal action.
In the usual way, the bill for such compensation would be met by the
Investors' Compensation Scheme, which is funded by the financial services
industry. The retail financial services sector - where the personal
investment authority is the main regulator - would be expected to foot the
bill for compensating clients of companies which have gone out of business
in its own sector, up to an annual limit of Pounds 100m.
There is a formula for assessing how the ICS bill each year should be
divided within the sector, but the SIB plan deliberately failed to provide a
formula for dividing costs for personal pension claims after next spring.
BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, said this
month it would consider legal action against the SIB if life companies which
operate mainly through a direct sales force, as it does, were made to
contribute towards compensating clients of former independent advisers.
Another potential area of challenge would be if other businesses within the
retail financial services sector - such as unit trust companies - found
themselves drawn into the compensation arrangements through paying levies to
the Investors' Compensation Scheme simply as a result of being in the same
sector, even though they had not sold any pensions at all.
Mr John Pearson, a pensions partner of City solicitors Lovell White Durrant,
believes a note of realism needs to be struck, however. All the dire
predictions about the total compensation bill assume that most investors
will be able to establish liability by a life company or an IFA. But this
may be harder than it looks, he says.
For an investor to succeed in proving an entitlement to compensation, he or
she will have to show: first, that the poor advice amounted to a material
compliance fault under the regulations in force at the time; second, that
the investor suffered actual or prospective loss; and third, that the loss
was a result of the compliance default.
The assumption, he says, is that if an investor can prove the first two
elements the third will follow automatically. But in many cases that is not
at all certain.
Amid the talk about legal action, two points of realism are already coming
through.
The first is that the probability of a challenge to the SIB's proposals is
directly related to the likely size of the compensation bill, and how
quickly the amount is known.
The bad publicity and costs of a legal action to resist contributing to
compensation for pension victims are easier to justify the higher and more
uncertain the potential payments involved.
The second point is that even if the law is unclear now about the ability of
life companies to contribute towards compensating the clients of others, the
prospects of a successful and effective legal challenge by a life company
may be slight. One life company chief executive explained why he put no
faith in a legal action: 'If there is any doubt, the government will simply
make sure that the law is clarified so that we can contribute,' he said.
IFAs may have less qualms about litigating, however, particularly if the
alternative is bankruptcy. Either way the lawyers are agreed: a legal
challenge is inevitable.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Wanted, a braver Budget -
Why last year's moves to encourage more investment may have been too
cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, introduced three
measures in his Budget that were designed to increase the flow of equity
capital to small companies.
The Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Investment Trusts and
extension of capital gains tax roll-over relief together represent one of
the most concerted efforts to use fiscal incentives to coax life into young
companies.
Small-business watchers described the Budget as 'the best ever' for small
business. But as the chancellor polishes his plans for another Budget on
November 29, how have last year's measures affected small companies' ability
to raise capital?
The answer is very little at the moment, as investors have been slow to come
forward. Some accountants and intermediaries say the tax breaks are a
well-intentioned attempt to address a shortage of early-stage finance, but
that there must be changes if they are to be effective.
Enterprise Investment Scheme. Intended to finance non-property-based trading
companies, the EIS replaced the Business Expansion Scheme last December
after the latter had become a vehicle almost exclusively used for assured
tenancy investment schemes.
The ghost of the 1980s property boom lives on in the new EIS rules, however.
To prevent the growth of property-based schemes, the new rules require a
qualifying company to have no more than 50 per cent of gross assets in land
and buildings.
As John Orpen, partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand says, there are many companies,
including small manufacturers, whose main asset is their building.
A number of EIS schemes designed to finance perfectly legitimate trading
companies have therefore fallen at this property hurdle; investors have been
worried that if balance sheets weaken as a result of poor trading, they risk
losing their EIS tax benefits by breaching this property rule.
Orpen believes speculation on property value inflation no longer figures in
the minds of investors. The Enterprise Investment and Business Expansion
Schemes Association agrees and has asked the chancellor in its Budget
submission to drop the property rule.
There is also a problem of perception. The most recent BES schemes were
tax-driven. Now the EIS is addressing investors whose prime concern must be
the prospects of the underlying business.
The 20 per cent up-front tax relief, down from 40 per cent under the most
recent BES schemes, is not wildly exciting - sponsors will charge about 8
per cent to issue an EIS prospectus, leaving a net tax break of only 12 per
cent.
The uptake has consequently been low. Where the government was expecting
about Pounds 125m to be invested in EIS schemes this year, Tim Villiers,
chairman of the EIBESA, says a fraction of this has been raised.
'Jerry's Home Stores was quickly over-subscribed but nothing else has raised
its full subscription,' Villiers says of the schemes. The EIS Company, a
London-based consultancy, says only about a dozen schemes have been
launched.
Robert Lowe, director of Johnson Fry, the largest sponsor of BES, says his
company has launched no EIS schemes. 'We don't think it makes sense for
major sponsors,' Lowe says. 'What may be happening is that a sort of cottage
industry is developing at a regional level with local accountants putting
together deals. Maybe this is what was intended (by the government)'.
Capital gains tax roll-over relief. The most recent change to this law last
November allows investors to shelter capital gains by reinvesting in a
private trading company up to three years after the gain is realised.
Not only was the deferral of capital gains tax liability extended to cover
the sale of almost any asset, the investor need now only re-invest the gain
to receive the relief.
Orpen and other intermediaries believe roll-over relief could be the most
significant of the chancellor's capital-raising instruments as there are no
restrictions on the amounts that can be invested.
Inevitably, tax-based products are beginning to emerge. Johnson Fry has
launched a scheme to raise up to Pounds 50m for Pioneer Oil and Gas, a
private company that will buy North Sea assets already producing gas and oil
and with proven reserves. Because investors are deferring their CGT
liability, they are effectively receiving an interest-free loan from the
Inland Revenue. It is within the new CGT roll-over relief rules, but it
hardly constitutes support for capital-constrained trading companies.
Venture Capital Investment Trusts. After months of listening to the pleas of
the investment trust and venture capital communities, the government is
likely to produce new rules in the next finance bill. The most recent
proposals suggested the VCITs would look like personal equity plans that
invest in unquoted companies.
Much of the lobbying suggested the VCITs would fail if the government did
not raise the proposed maximum investment in each portfolio company from
Pounds 1m and did not introduce some form of front-end or CGT roll-over
relief.
It is early days for all three schemes. None of the schemes are well
established - or well understood yet by investors. Furthermore, the stock
market's recent performance has not encouraged investors to think of buying
shares, let alone hold some of their portfolio in unquoted investments.
No one expects the government to make sweeping changes in this year's
budget. But the government would appear to have erred too far on the side of
caution, some small company observers say. Unless it listens to some of the
criticism, the schemes may flush out only a minimal amount of expansion
capital despite the early promise.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Second-hand goods treated
as new - EU consumer product safety laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New EU consumer protection and product safety laws which took force in the
UK last month have introduced criminal penalties of which many UK companies
are still unaware, according to the Institute of Export's legal advisers.
A statutory instrument amending UK company law came into effect on October
3, enforcing a 1992 directive from the Council of Ministers. The main thrust
is to extend consumer protection and product safety regulations to
second-hand goods which were previously exempt.
Second-hand goods are now expected to perform as new, however illogical and
unsound this may seem. The new law is enforceable throughout the EU by local
trading standards officers.
'No one is sure how big the market is for reconditioned goods, but it must
be worth hundreds of millions of pounds domestically,' says Michael
Thornton, a partner in Laytons, the institute's solicitors. 'The bulk of the
trade is in white goods, brown goods and teltronics.'
There are some large and medium-sized companies supplying second-hand and
reconditioned goods to world markets - eastern Europe and parts of the Third
World are targets - but much of the trade is among hundreds of small
businesses, often operating from poorly-sited, retail units long abandoned
by high street traders.
They repair and recondition consumer durables such as refrigerators,
microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, lawnmowers, television sets, video
recorders, cameras, and electronic equipment. Many are sole traders whose
business has grown from doing local repairs.
'Our experience so far is that people haven't really thought about whether
their commercial terms of trading still protect them,' Thornton says. 'If
someone sells second-hand vacuum cleaners, he or she is now treated as a
manufacturer of primary goods.
'Moreover, if they import their supplies into the EU already reconditioned,
they are now regarded under EU and UK law as their manufacturer.'
Previously, no warranties applied to second-hand goods other than the normal
ones under the Sale of Goods Act, which meant they had to be basically fit
for the purpose for which they were sold. Thornton says a Warrington
supplier of reconditioned white goods to Spain has already provided a
foretaste of what may be coming.
Spain enforced the directive ahead of the UK but the owners of the
Warrington company did not worry because they felt its BS5750 quality
controls, coupled with a relatively high margin on many of its second-hand
goods, would enable them to absorb the costs of putting faults right or
giving people their money back.
But this proved optimistic once the second-hand goods could be treated by
customers as though they had been bought brand new. The company has been
forced into insolvency because the cost of rectifying comparatively few
faults has wiped out its margin.
An additional aspect of the directive which is concerning lawyers is that
manufacturers and suppliers must also worry about what use a product might
be put to, even if it is far removed from the purpose for which it was sold.
Thornton says: 'The seller now has to ask who is going to use these goods,
or who might use them. Will this lead to liabilities over and above what
they have been used to?'
The new regulations also allow the authorities - in the UK's case, local
trading standards officers - to force a general recall of goods sold, with
attendant publicity, if a recurring fault is found.
Prosecution is possible if a supplier fails to recall goods when ordered to
do so. Trading standards officers will also be able to contribute details to
a Europe-wide database as part of a trans-EU monitoring system.
Criminal sanctions now include three months' prison for guilty directors and
senior managers and fines of up to Pounds 5,000 on summary conviction. The
regulations are silent on penalties that might be imposed by higher courts
for conviction on indictment.

afloat - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A third of businesses fail in their first three years mainly because of poor
planning, Barclays says. Most companies that have survived their first year
recognise the value of developing a proper business plan before setting out.
Barclays is offering a free video on planning, sales and marketing and
market research to any business opening an account before next February.
A more comprehensive description, including a model business plan, can be
found in the forward to the seventh annual Guide to Venture Capital in the
UK and Europe, published by Venture Capital Report.
Including appendices on cash flow projections, the loan guarantee scheme and
other sources of finance like the DTI's Smart technology awards, the guide
provides useful material for pre start-up businesses.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Heavy load for directors
 -In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent surge of legislation has multiplied the responsibilities of
directors and increased the chances that they will incur personal liability,
says accountants firm Kidsons Impey. Acting with honesty and integrity may
not be enough to ensure directors do not fall foul of civil and criminal
law.
In a 22-page booklet, Kidsons Impey sets out the responsibilities, looks at
director's liabilities, how they should handle transactions with their
companies and possible protective measures. Kidsons Impey says smaller
company directors are most at risk when they do not have adequate financial
information and stresses the need for up-to-date management accounts.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Murdoch pays off former editor of Sunday Times
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times for a decade, yesterday severed
most of his links with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in a pay-off
reported to be in the region of Pounds 1m.
Mr Neil, 45, has turned down the offer of a nightly US TV show after Mr
Murdoch's Fox Television network axed his planned weekly current affairs
programme.
He will now concentrate on a freelance broadcasting and writing career,
including a book about his years as TheSunday Times' editor.
Mr Neil said yesterday: 'It's not divorce, it's an amicable separation.' He
denied a rift with Mr Murdoch although he admitted his stint in Los Angeles
had left him 'frustrated'. Asked to confirm the Pounds 1m pay-off, Mr Neil
said: 'It's not far off.'
Mr Murdoch described Mr Neil's contribution to The Sunday Times as 'immense
in every respect of its success'.
Mr Neil will still write The Sunday Times leader column and will be retained
as a special correspondent for Fox TV when he steps down on December 31.
He has returned from Los Angeles to prepare for a new BBC2 parliamentary
programme, The Midnight Hour, which starts on Wednesday.
Mr Neil is one of four presenters who will work on the four-times-a-week
show.
Explaining why he turned down Mr Murdoch's offer of a nightly TV show, Mr
Neil stressed: 'I said I didn't want to spend the next six months doing a
show that again doesn't get on the air.
'I made it clear I was very disappointed he hadn't stayed with his original
instinct which was to go for the weekly show. I feel he almost regrets
that.'
Mr Neil said the problem was that there were too many Fox executives
interfering and they came from entertainment rather than news backgrounds.
'Although it's disappointing that the weekly show in the end never got off
the ground, the past seven months have been a mixture of the best paid
sabbatical and seminar I have ever had,' he said.
His immediate plans included moving temporarily to his new home in the south
of France to concentrate on the Sunday Times book.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Raw materials push prices up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in the price of the raw materials used in the plastics sector forced
plastics manufacturers to raise their prices last month, the Central
Statistical Office said yesterday.
Meanwhile, the chemicals sector and the pulp, paper and publishing sector
also reported significant rises in the cost of their raw materials. However,
the cost of coffee and metals fell back last month, following the surge in
these commodity prices earlier this year.
Overall, the CSO said output prices for all manufacturing sectors rose by
0.1 per cent in October, compared with September, and by 2.3 per cent in the
year to October.
This yearly rise was considerably lower than the growth in raw material
costs, suggesting many manufacturers are still forced to absorb input price
increases themselves.
Input prices rose by 6.9 per cent in the year to October, and by 0.4 per
cent between September and October.
Nevertheless, the breakdown of the data painted a mixed picture of the
underlying inflationary pressures, with some manufacturing sectors
continuing to hold down their prices, while others are now passing recent
rises in raw materials costs on to their customers.
Output prices in the rubber and plastics sector, for example, rose by 1.7
per cent between September and October, and by 2.7 per cent in the three
months to October.
The CSO said several large plastics manufacturers reported that these price
rises had been forced on them by rising raw materials costs, which grew by
7.7 per cent between July and October.
The cost of raw materials in the chemicals sector also rose 1.2 per cent
last month. Some of this rise was passed on to customers, with output prices
growing by 0.7 per cent in the month. Meanwhile publishing, paper and pulp
input prices rose by 1.2 per cent in the month, while output prices grew by
0.6 per cent.
These rises were partly offset by the fall in some commodity prices. Coffee
costs, for example,fell by 5 per cent between September and October.
However, this followed a dramatic surge in coffee prices earlier this year,
with coffee costs still three times higher than last October.
The monthly drop in coffee prices caused imported food costs to fall by 2.3
per cent in the month, although prices still stand 24 per cent higher than
last October.
Metal input prices fell by 1 per cent on the month, due to lower gold and
silver prices. However, this drop was not enough to offset the impact of
sharp metal price rises earlier this year, with metal costs standing 15.9
per cent higher than a year ago.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Housing market 'stuck in doldrums'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market remains 'stuck in the doldrums' with homeowners keeping
properties off the market 'in a seemingly futile wait for meaningful house
prices', a survey of more than 100 estate agents said today.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors revealed that
less than 5 per cent of agents in England and Wales reported price increases
during the three months to the end of October.
This compared with 72 per cent reporting static prices and more than a fifth
reporting price falls.
Almost three-quarters of the agents said inquiries and viewings requested by
potential purchasers had fallen compared with the previous three months.
Some 16 per cent said that activity had remained the same. Only 10 per cent
reported an increase in viewings and inquiries.
The traditional recovery in the housing market during September and October,
following the end of the school summer holidays, has failed to occur in the
past two years.
Some estate agents and builders believe this may be due to the government's
decision to move its annual Budget statement to late autumn. They argue that
potential purchasers, fearing that they may become worse off in the Budget,
may be dissuaded from buying homes.
Sentiment may not have been helped this autumn by the decision in September
to raise bank interest rates by a half percentage point.
Mr Peter Miller, the institution's housing spokesman, said yesterday that
marked house price increases appeared unlikely for the foreseeable future
with the government determined that Britain should have low inflation.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Retailers report sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers reported a drop in annual sales volumes last month for the first
time since December 1992, according to the latest Confederation of British
Industry survey of distributive trades, published today.
The weakness detected in the survey comes as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, prepares his Budget, which is set to impose already announced
tax increases on UK consumers. It also reflects the first full shopping
month since UK interest rates were increased by a half a percentage point in
September. Official retail sales figures for October will be published on
Thursday.
While retailing was lacklustre, the wholesaling sector continued to be
strong in October, reporting the fastest growth since September 1987. But
motor sales remained depressed, with annual sales volumes falling at their
sharpest rate since July 1992. The CBI survey found that more retailers
reported a fall in sales volumes in October than reported an increase. The
negative balance of three percentage points compares with a positive balance
of 28 points in September.
October sales also fell well short of retailers' expectations. In the CBI's
September survey, a positive balance of 27 percentage points of retailers
had expected an increase over the next month.
The survey's retailing reports over the past three months have been
volatile, but the trend continues to show modest, but slowing, growth in
sales volumes. Over the three months to July the average positive balance
was 17 points; over the three months to October the average balance was nine
points.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive traders survey panel,
said: 'The levelling off in high-street sales in October is typical of the
uneven pattern in sales experienced by most retailers this year. It shows
the uncertain trading conditions that retailers still face.'
The strongest sectors over the year to October were footwear and leather,
durable household goods and off licences. There were sharp declines at
furniture and carpet stores, specialist food outlets and chemists.
Some sectors have produced volatile results. Clothing stores moved from a
positive balance of 59 percentage points in September to a negative balance
of five points in October. Furniture and carpet stores moved from plus 60
points to minus 59 points over the same period.
The recent divergent performances of the wholesaling and retailing
industries differs sharply from the late 1980s, when survey data from the
two sectors was closely correlated. Since then wholesalers have built up new
markets with customers such as government departments and hotels.
A balance of 65 per cent of wholesalers reported annual increases in volumes
in October, compared with 55 per cent in September. Unlike the retail
sector, reported sales volumes have repeatedly been ahead of expectations.
In the motor trade a balance of 31 per cent of dealers reported a fall in
sales volumes. This was much worse than the negative balance of 4 per cent
in September and compared badly with traders' expectations.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Customer's Pounds 3m Lloyds claim fails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A businessman whose company collapsed after he was introduced to a
consultant - who was later convicted of fraud - yesterday lost his Pounds 3m
compensation claim against Lloyds Bank.
Mr Vince McGee has waged a six-year war on Lloyds Bank, including dropping
stink bombs in branches, placing 'out of order' signs over cashpoint
machines, and singing outside its headquarters at Canons Marsh, Bristol,
while wearing a bath towel.
After losing his case at Bristol County Court yesterday, Mr McGee said he
was considering an appeal.
Mr McGee had argued that the bank was liable for the collapse of his
company, South West Piping Services, after introducing him to a consultant
who was later convicted on fraud charges.
Judge Raymond Jack QC said the manager of the bank's branch at Chippenham,
Wiltshire, had introduced Mr McGee to the consultant, but had not
recommended him.
The judge said he accepted the manager's evidence that he warned Mr McGee
about making inquiries about the consultant's source of capital. 'This
warning appears to have fallen on deaf ears,' the judge said.
During the hearing Mr McGee, of Lilley, near Newbury, Berkshire, who
represented himself, told the judge his pipe-laying business collapsed
because Lloyds recommended him to the consultant.
He said that at the time his company employed 46 people and had a Pounds 3m
a year turnover.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Merseyside's Klondikers given a shake: Businesses have been
warned oil profits will not fall into their laps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'Klondike mentality' on Merseyside is preventing some companies in the
region from seizing the opportunities offered by big investments in oil and
gas fields off Liverpool.
This is the conclusion of Mr Alan Kennedy, an adviser to Sefton Borough
Council, which covers Bootle, Crosby and Southport.
Mr Kennedy, a recently retired Shell executive with more than 20 years'
experience of the offshore industry, says local companies will have to fight
hard to win business arising from the oil finds.
He claims some are not ambitious enough and expect orders to come to them
simply because they are on the spot.
'The oil industry doesn't need Liverpool and Merseyside,' he warns. 'It is
self-contained and can import everything it needs.'
His attitude is echoed by Mr John Carne, operations director of US-owned
Cooper Energy Services in Bootle. 'I discourage the belief that this will be
another Klondike,' he says. 'You have to take a more measured approach. One
should not predict success on the back of a few oil and gas fields - we have
to be cautious.'
Those 'few' fields could be significant. They are in Liverpool Bay, the
stretch of Irish Sea in the right-angle formed by Lancashire and north
Wales. There are 200m barrels of oil, mainly in Douglas, a field 15 miles
north of Point of Ayr on the Welsh side of the Dee estuary. The rest is in a
field called Lennox, five miles west of Southport.
Lennox also contains gas - part of 1,000bn cu ft found there and in two
other fields by Hamilton Oil, a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary, the
Australian steel, minerals and energy group. Gas has also been found in
nearby fields called Hamilton and Hamilton North. Field life is estimated at
17 years, but the Hamilton consortium - its partners in the exploration are
Lasmo and Monument - expects to find more. Sixteen companies have obtained
exploration licences for the area.
Hamilton chose the unused docks at Bootle as the onshore supply base for the
project, against bids from several other areas, including Barrow-in-Furness
in Cumbria, Heysham in Lancashire and Point of Ayr.
The activity has raised local expectations, which political and business
leaders are trying to curb so local people will not be disappointed when
they discover there may not be a bonanza.
Ms Rita Darwin, head of economic development for the Merseyside borough of
Sefton, says: 'At the most superficial level, people have watched Dallas on
television and think this is what happens when oil is discovered on your
doorstep.
'They look at the growth of Aberdeen 20 years ago and hope for something
similar. But Aberdeen became a boom town with an oil price of Dollars 30 a
barrel. Something similar is not going to happen here with the price down to
Dollars 18.'
As margins have tightened, oil companies have become increasingly
cost-conscious. 'We don't expect Hamilton to employ a lot of people,' Ms
Darwin says. 'Meeting technical specifications locally may also require a
lot of investment as well as a new understanding of what is meant by service
in an industry that expects it instantly, 24 hours a day.
'But we also know they will want wires, slings, furniture, taxis, painting,
security, hotels, food, videos and day-to-day consumables. This is where we
are already beginning to see immediate benefits to the local economy.'
These may be merely the crumbs of Hamilton's total Pounds 350m budget for
all onshore and offshore spending on the Liverpool Bay project - but they
can sustain a lot of small companies.
Mr Mike Swift, director of Sefton Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says:
'To get any of this new money into the local economy, we have had to learn
how the oil and gas industry buys its goods and services. We have also had
to understand it's not another Klondike where fortunes will be made easily.'
Others have shown that cautious optimism is not misplaced. Mr Tony
Cafferkey, owner-manager of Southport's Scarisbrick Hotel, has spent Pounds
1.2m on upgrading it in the past three years. The result has been to push a
seasonal seaside holiday hotel into the business-traveller market, achieving
an 85 per cent year-round occupancy rate.
'People think it's all high-tech,' says Mr Swift. 'It isn't. The supply of
paper clips will be a significant piece of business. We need it locally.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Producers' body to accuse BBC of unfair practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pact, the main body representing independent television and film producers,
will this week formally accuse the BBC of being guilty of a restraint of
trade.
Mr Tom Gutteridge, chairman of Pact - the Producers Alliance for Cinema and
TV - will make the complaint of unfairness to Mr Will Wyatt, managing
director of BBC Television.
Pact, which represents more than 800 independent production companies,
claims independents are denied fair access to programme proposals.
In the ITV system, independent producers have the right to take their ideas
directly to the Network Centre, the main programme-commissioning body for
the national ITV network. This right is underpinned by an agreement
monitored by the Office of Fair Trading, whose role was spelled out in the
1990 Broadcasting Act. No such formal rules govern the relations between the
BBC and independents.
The main complaint is that independents do not have guaranteed access to the
BBC's channel controllers, Mr Alan Yentob at BBC 1 and Mr Michael Jackson at
BBC 2. Ideas have to be filtered first through heads of department, who are
at the same time promoting in-house ideas.
Pact believes this amounts to a conflict of interest and fears many ideas
from independents never reach the channel controllers.
The alliance claims this lack of direct access amounts to a restraint of
trade, and has communicated its worries to the government. The National
Heritage Department is in the process of drawing up legislation for the
renewal of the BBC's royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
Pact has not ruled out taking the issue to the OFT if the BBC does not
change its procedures.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Convenience food sales rise steeply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ready-made meals comprised almost 35 per cent of the average household's
food bill last year, a rise of nearly 10 per cent since the early 1980s,
according to the 1993 National Food Survey.
Sales of pizzas, frozen chips, crisps and other potato snacks also rose,
while consumption of beef and lamb has dropped, according to the survey,
which was published yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and
Food.
The Meat and Livestock Commission said high lamb prices probably accounted
for the drop in consumption, while beef sales had been influenced by adverse
publicity about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy - mad cow disease.
The survey showed that fresh potatoes accounted for 40 per cent of household
consumption by weight in 1993 compared with 48 per cent in 1983, but frozen
vegetable sales rose.
Fresh fruit sales were the same, except for bananas, which grew in
popularity.
Consumers in the south-east and East Anglia ate most frozen foods, while
shoppers in Scotland and the north of England spent most on convenience
foods.
The Fruit and Vegetable Information Bureau said bananas were increasingly
popular because they were easy to peel. 'Vegetables like cauliflower and
broccoli which are easy to prepare and cook are also increasing in
popularity. But it's not the same with root vegetables which take longer to
cook, which is a pity because they are cheaper and very nutritious.
'Salad vegetables are also selling well because they are easy to prepare and
go with many convenience meals like pizzas.'
Families were drinking less full-fat milk than skimmed and fat-reduced milk.
Cheese was also less popular, the survey said.
The survey also showed:
Bread sales - particularly white bread - were lower in the south of England
than in the north and Midlands.
Consumption of frozen cakes and pastry increased, while biscuit and
breakfast cereal sales fell.
Convenience foods provided 28 per cent of the total intake of energy in
1993, up from 20 per cent in 1983.
Spending on food was 2.2 per cent higher in 1993 than in 1992 at Pounds
13.21 per person per week.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Independent schools say exam tables omit 5% of pupils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent schools yesterday claimed that government 'league tables' of
academic performance to be published next week will omit at least 5 per cent
of their pupils.
They complained that rankings of the percentage of pupils passing five GCSE
exams with a grade C or better (equivalent to an old O-level pass) would
therefore be inaccurate.
However, a few schools benefit. St Mary's, a girls' boarding school in
Ascot, is credited with a pass rate of 117 per cent.
The discrepancies were caused by the Department for Education's decision to
publish only the results achieved by candidates whose 16th birthday fell
during the academic year 1993/94. If pupils take them early, they are
counted in the year they eventually reach the age of 16  - as happened at St
Mary's. If they take them late, their results are never counted.
The Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) said pass rates should
instead be measured across a school's year groups, with 'over-age'
candidates counted in the year when they attempted the exams.
Isis found 61 schools with GCSE results that had been understated by 10
percentage points or more.
Several prestigious boarding schools have a much lower pass rate under the
government's assumptions than when all of the pupils attempting GCSE are
taken into account. For example, only 86.5 per cent of Harrow School's
16-year-old pupils reached the five-GCSE figure, according to the
government. When Isis measured this by year group, rather than age group,
Harrow had a pass rate of 99.4 per cent - a discrepancy of 12.9 percentage
points.
Other well-known boarding schools whose GCSE pass rates were sharply
understated included Gresham's (88 rather than 100 per cent), Haileybury
(86.7 per cent rather than 98.9 per cent), Stowe (78.6 rather than 93.7 per
cent), and Uppingham School (81.8 rather than 92.6 per cent).
Isis said there were a 'variety of good reasons' why candidates took exams
late: 'They may have moved schools at a crucial stage: they might be late
developers; some may be only a matter of weeks, even days, outside the
qualifying age range.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / BT expands trial of video-on-demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications will announce today that it is going ahead with a
full commercial trial of its ambitious video-on-demand technology early next
year.
A first trial involving 60 homes, mainly of BT employees, was a technical
success. But because the service was free, little useful information was
gained about consumer demand.
BT will begin next month recruiting consumers in 2,500 homes in the
Colchester and Ipswich areas for commercial trials starting in spring.
BT's video-on-demand technology involves sending television pictures in
digital form from a database down ordinary telephone lines. The capacity of
the line is enough to carry a film and an ordinary voice conversation at the
same time.
In the Colchester trial the converter boxes needed to turn the digits back
into a television picture will probably be supplied free. However, consumers
are likely to be charged for the use they make of the service.
BT sees video-on-demand providing eventually a large range of services but
the initial trials are likely to centre on films.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Gas price 'too low to make money'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is making little effort to regain market share in the industrial
sector because it says the present low prices are unsustainable.
Mr Simon Kirk, managing director of Business Gas, the new name for the
contract trading division which sells gas to industrial and commercial
users, said yesterday that customers were getting 'a wonderful deal' because
of intense competition in the sector.
But he said industrial gas prices had fallen 'too low for gas companies to
make money on a long-term basis'.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, recently lifted restrictions which prevented
British Gas from offering discounts to commercial customers. The
restrictions were imposed to encourage the growth of competition in the
industrial segment of the market.
Mr Kirk said British Gas's share of the overall market - which consumes more
than 2,500 therms a year - had fallen to 51 per cent, and could fall
further. In the large-company market - above 25,000 therms - its share had
fallen to 14 per cent.
But the company was not intent on rebuilding market share because of the low
prices. Instead it would focus on profitability.
Mr Kirk - who said the adoption of the Business Gas name was intended to
help create a new competitive culture within the division - called on Ofgas
to lift the remaining restrictions on the company next year.
He said present rules prevented it from tendering for multi-site contracts
which included locations that used less than 25,000 therms a year.
He predicted that the competitive pressures in the sector were unlikely to
ease soon. Some executives at independent gas marketing companies do not
expect the market to improve for at least a year.

An investigation is being launched into the cause of a suspected virus that
partly paralysed bathers at two popular tourist beaches.
Two teenagers are confined to wheelchairs after contracting the virus, which
attacks the nervous system. Both lost the use of their legs within hours of
swimming at Oxwich Bay on the Gower coast, West Glamorgan, in the summer.
Bathers at nearby Mewslade Bay were seriously weakened.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Hill is to stand down as political secretary to the prime
minister amid signs that Mr John Major wishes to revamp his team of personal
advisers in the run-up to the next election.
Mr Hill has held the job since 1992. He is one of the longest serving
members of the Downing Street staff, having been an important figure in
political strategy and planning for more than four years.
However, colleagues have said that he lacks inside experience at Westminster
and there have been indications that Mr Major is looking for a more
heavyweight figure.
Mr Hill took over as political secretary from the late Mrs Judith Chaplin,
who later became MP for Newbury. Unlike departmental special advisers, the
political secretaryship at No 10 is not a civil service post and is paid for
out of Conservative party funds.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Howard tries to defuse row over crime plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday tried to defuse a growing
row over cuts in compensation for crime victims by announcing that they
would have a greater say over when prisoners should be released.
Following a court ruling last week that he had acted unlawfully in cutting
levels of compensation for victims, Mr Howard said he would set up a Prison
Helpline on which crime victims could state why particular prisoners should
not be released from jail.
Mr Howard vigorously defended recent cuts in the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme, in spite of a High Court ruling last week that he had
abused his powers by introducing new tariffs.
In a bid to reassert his authority on the issue, he claimed all the changes
were made after taking legal advice and he renewed his pledge to fight the
Court of Appeal ruling in the House of Lords.
However, Mr Howard immediately came under fire from prison governors and
pressure groups who argued that they had not been consulted over the
creation of the helpline and that it was an unworkable idea.
Mr Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Probation
Officers' Association, said a hotline was totally impractical with some
140,000 cases of home and temporary leave each year.
'Who on earth is to tell the victims of crime that the prisoners are coming
up for consideration? Certainly the probation officers can't do it because
there are no resources,' he said on BBC Radio 4's prog-ramme The World at
One.
Mr Paul Cavadino, chair of the Penal Affairs Consortium, an alliance of 23
organisations concerned with the penal system, said that it would be wrong
to refuse parole or home leave 'simply because the victim felt that the
offender should be punished more severely'.
Mr Howard, addressing the Victim Support organisation in London, said it had
been difficult for victims of crime to get their voices heard.
'I also know that some victims of crime have seen or been contacted by
serving prisoners - people are understandably afraid or distressed by that
contact,' he said.
He added: 'In future, victims will be able to pass on those concerns
immediately and confidentially in the knowledge that something will be
done.'
However, his difficulties over the victim compensation issue have further
undermined his authority as home secretary after a year of difficulties over
the Criminal Justice Bill.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Peace in Ireland finds itself at mercy of peace in Dail: The
government imbroglio and possible effects on progress of the framework
document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned yesterday
by reporters about the prospect of a collapse of the Irish government as he
arrived in Dublin for talks with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister.
'Mayhew stays out of coalition crisis,' Mr Mayhew said, quoting an Irish
newspaper headline. 'I wish we all had the same options,' Mr Spring replied.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, today addresses the Dail, the Irish
parliament, where his Fianna Fail party is under attack from Mr Spring over
the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the Irish attorney-general, as
president of the High Court.
Mr Whelehan's mishandling of a child abuse case had already put pressure on
the governing coalition of Fianna Fail and Mr Spring's Labour party. Mr
Reynolds' decision last week to appoint Mr Whelehan as president of the High
Court pushed the coalition to the brink of collapse.
The common view yesterday was that whatever Mr Reynolds may say in the Dail,
a deepening crisis can be averted only by the resignation of Mr Whelehan,
which few observers think likely. If he stays, Ireland seems likely to have
a new government - either through an election or a new alliance of parties
in the Dail.
For Northern protestants, there will be a certain irony if the Dublin
government is to fall on this particular question - it concerns a warrant to
have a Roman Catholic priest extradited by the Royal Ulster Constabulary
from the republic.
Few officials doubt that a period of political uncertainty will disrupt the
peace process. All Ireland's political parties are committed to the search
for peace but Fianna Fail, more than other parties, is rooted in the
republican tradition - although it is said of Mr Reynolds that he carries
the ideological baggage more lightly than earlier party leaders.
Mr Reynolds has been pivotal in the peace effort - in particular his
understanding with Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's moderate
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, has provided a bridge to Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.
Under his leadership, the Irish government has been concerned to sustain the
momentum of the peace process - sometimes provoking criticism that it was
moving too quickly. There is as yet no pressure on Mr Reynolds's leadership
within his party.
Irish civil servants no doubt find it galling to be lectured about
parliamentary democracy by the likes of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
which has voiced concern about possible disruption of the peace process by
the coalition crisis.
But if the callers to one Irish radio programme are any measure, many
ordinary people are perplexed that the coalition should break down at this
critical stage of the peace process - which comes at a time when progress is
also being made on the economy and the legislative agenda.
In seeking an explanation for the crisis, observers point to the personality
of Mr Reynolds - an abrasive, instinctive politician, unusual in Ireland in
being a successful self-made businessman, a petfood magnate and showband
impresario. And as Ms Mary Harney, head of the Progressive Democrats,
pointed out, Mr Reynolds has been here before. His attacks on Mr Des
O'Malley, former PD leader, led to the break up of the Fianna Fail-PD
government and triggered the general election in November 1992.
Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, said over the weekend that a
change of government would be 'very, very unhelpful' and voiced misgivings
about working with some of the other political parties which he accused of
being 'less than helpful' in support of the peace effort.
In particular, Sinn Fein has made clear its misgivings about working with Mr
John Bruton, who since 1990 has been leader of Fine Gael, the main
opposition party. A farmer, economist and barrister, Mr Bruton's spell as
finance minister was marked by the pursuit of market-oriented economic
policies.
Mr Reynolds mistakenly referred to Mr Bruton as 'John Unionist' in an
interview during the last election campaign.
Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support. Since
the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January last year,
it has had some internal difficulties, culminating in a leadership challenge
to Mr Bruton in February.
Sinn Fein must feel almost as uncomfortable about the prospect that one
party which might have a role in forming a new government is the Democratic
Left, a breakaway from the Workers party which itself was formed when the
Official IRA broke ranks with the Provisionals in the 1970s.
On current calculations, Labour could join forces with centre-right Fine
Gael and the Democratic Left - with a total of 85 seats, such a coalition
would have a narrow majority in the 166-seat house.
If that fails to materialise, Fianna Fail could look for new partners,
though after its unhappy alliances with PD and now Labour, the most likely
candidates would be the Democratic Left or independents.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Labour warns on injuries scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party warned yesterday that Treasury plans to scrap the
Industrial Injuries Scheme would cause severe hardship for thousands of
victims of workplace accidents.
Amid growing signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce the
end of the scheme in his Budget this month, Labour argued that vital health
and safety legislation would be undermined and that many workers would be
forced to take out private insurance.
Scrapping the compensation scheme, which costs taxpayers Pounds 600m a year,
would put the onus on employees to sue employers for negligence in order to
gain compensation for injuries suffered in the workplace.
'We have already seen the government pass on the cost of sickness benefit
and maternity benefit to the employer, and this is the next stage in that
process,' said Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow social security minister.
'People injured at work may well find they are not employable, that whatever
scheme is put in place does not cover their particular injury, or that the
amount of compensation is so low that they will find themselves in severe
hardship.'
However, the move would appease rightwing Conservative MPs who are unhappy
at the shelving of Post Office privatisation and who have accused the
government of lacking credible and radical policies.
They believe the Pounds 88bn-a-year social security budget is far too large,
and are pressing for public spending cuts to create scope for income tax
reductions next year.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Skills strategy launched for construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction industry yesterday launched recruitment targets for its new
skills training strategy in a move to standardise requirements across the
industry.
The Construction Industry Training Board said it planned to recruit 10,200
trainees in 1994-1995, rising to 17,000 by 1996-97, in anticipation of a 1
per cent annual growth in construction output.
However, Sir Clifford Chetwood, the board's chairman, said this would only
cover half the number of construction employees lost from the industry each
year through death or retirement.
Warwick University's Institute for Employment Research forecast recently
that there would be 1.4m employees in the construction industry by 1997.
Sir Clifford said half of all construction workers currently had no formal
qualifications.
The board's strategy for training skilled craftsmen, such as carpenters,
bricklayers and joiners, as well as manual labourers provides six
alternative 'flexible routes' to training, which accommodate changes in
education and the industry itself.
Recognising the increasing use of self-employed and labour-only
sub-contractors rather than employee craftsmen, the board has introduced
grants for contractors to provide work experience or apprenticeships.
It will give a Pounds 300 grant per trainee every year to each main
contractor which places a candidate with one of its labour-only
sub-contractors or self-employed workers.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Nirex dump 'in earthquake zone'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed nuclear waste dump in Cumbria should be abandoned because it is
in an earthquake zone, says Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group.
It said the safety risk at the underground Nirex site at Sellafield was
being ignored by the government and nuclear industry, which had chosen the
site for political, not geological reasons.
Nirex dismissed the claim as 'nonsense'. A decision on planning permission
is at least four years away.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Bathers paralysed by mystery virus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation is being launched into the cause of a suspected virus that
partly paralysed bathers at two popular tourist beaches.
Two teenagers are confined to wheelchairs after contracting the virus, which
attacks the nervous system. Both lost the use of their legs within hours of
swimming at Oxwich Bay on the Gower coast in West Glamorgan. Bathers at
nearby Mewslade Bay were seriously weakened.
Doctors have been unable to find the cause of their conditions, diagnosed as
transverse myelitis.
The National Rivers Authority, Welsh Water and Swansea City Council said
yesterday there was no scientific evidence of a direct link between the
virus and quality of water at the beaches.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Ian Craig, architect of FT Statistics structure: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Craig, who died in a car accident on Saturday aged 53, was the architect
of some of the most delicate and far-reaching technical changes carried out
at the Financial Times. As systems manager of FT Statistics, he designed a
modern structure for collecting and processing the vast array of market data
printed daily in the FT and distributed to clients.
He did not see every part of this complex operation transferred to the new
suite of databases. But his disciplined mind, rigorous attention to detail
and sheer professionalism not only took the FT's statistical operations from
hot metal printing to the first generation of computerisation but set out an
elegant design that will last well into the next century.
Born in East Lothian, Ian Craig graduated as an engineer and served in the
Queen's Flight of the RAF. He worked in the printing machinery industry
before joining the FT in the mid-1970s when it was first exploring
computerised production. He combined deep knowledge of the intricacies of
typesetting with a creative mastery of computer technology.
The kindest and most considerate of colleagues, he was always as willing to
explain difficult technical issues patiently to lay people as he was open to
new ideas.
Sailing was Ian's spare-time passion, shared with the family he was devoted
to. He leaves a widow, Carol, and their three children, Alastair, Nick and
Sheena.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Government seeks way round Pergau ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain may use its overseas aid budget to fund Malaysia's Pergau dam
project, in spite of a High Court ruling last week that the government had
acted illegally in making such donations.
Amid growing controversy about the link between aid and international arms
deals, officials at the Treasury, Foreign Office and Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) have been examining ways to pay more than Pounds 200m
to Malaysia without contravening the judgment.
The High Court ruled last week that the ODA could not make direct payments
for the Pergau dam project because it does not promote the development of a
country's economy, as required by UK law.
Treasury officials are now examining a scheme whereby the ODA could be
required to make the payments indirectly so that Britain continues to meet a
commitment made by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, three years ago.
Under the proposal, the cost of Britain's aid donation to Malaysia would be
met from the Treasury's contingency fund. The Treasury would then make
commensurate cuts in the ODA's budget.
The Foreign Office is understood to have warned that this method of paying
the Malaysians could run counter to the spirit of the High Court judgment
and might invoke further legal penalties. However, Foreign Office officials
will be keen to ensure that the payments do not come from their own budget.
Under the agreement with the Malaysian government, the ODA agreed to use its
aid and trade provision to provide Pounds 234m in staged payments to help
build the dam.
The government still has to pay a total of Pounds 216m of these payments,
which meet the costs of borrowing at concessionary interest rates to help
fund the dam. The next payment, of Pounds 15m, is due on December 20.
The controversy over the Pergau dam comes amid speculation that the UK has
used development aid to forge a Pounds 6.1bn arms deal with Indonesia. Last
night Baroness Chalker, the overseas aid minister, denied any connection
between weapons contracts and aid to President Suharto's government.
'Our programme is targeted on human resource development, the environment,
good government and transportation,' she said.
'We have repeatedly expressed our concern about Indonesia's human rights
record. The Indonesian government recognises the need for improvement. I can
confirm that at no stage has there been any linkage between our aid
programme to Indonesia and the sale of arms.'
However, UK military officials are planning a four-month military tour of
Indonesia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region next year to
promote UK naval equipment. It is understood that Westland-built Lynx
helicopters will be demonstrated to potential buyers.
The aid-for-arms allegations are set to be the focus of a Commons foreign
affairs debate on Thursday, when Mr Hurd will face questions over claims
that the UK's aid budget has been targeted at countries buying military
equipment.
The government is also facing a renewed public challenge over its defence
policy with the launch today of a national campaign against official credit
cover for arms sales.
The campaign over the Export Credits Guarantee Department is being organised
by the World Development Movement, the lobby group which won the High Court
ruling against Mr Hurd over the Pergau dam funding. The group said the
export credits department was being inundated with letters calling for an
end to an estimated Pounds 322m annual subsidy to the defence sector.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Depleted Democrats battle for party's soul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After taking a severe beating at the hands of their Republican opponents in
last week's elections, the Democrats yesterday started to fight among
themselves over who should control what remains of their party.
Congressman Charlie Rose of North Carolina was expected to announce
yesterday that he would challenge Congressman Dick Gephardt of Missouri for
the minority leadership, setting the scene for a pitched battle between the
Democrats' competing wings.
If the Democrats had kept a majority in the House of Representatives, Mr
Rose might well have challenged Congressman Tom Foley for the speakership.
But in the Democrats' general defeat, Mr Foley lost his own bid for
re-election in eastern Washington state by the slimmest of margins.
As majority leader in the outgoing Congress, Mr Gephardt ranks second in his
party to the Speaker. With no speaker, the minority party's leader ranks
first.
Mr Rose represents the more conservative southern wing of the Democratic
party, strongly supporting tobacco growers - the mainstay of his North
Carolina district - and playing behind-the-scenes politics from his current
position as chairman of the House administration committee.
Mr Gephardt, meanwhile, began as a moderate and was one of the founders of
the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group which claims President
Bill Clinton as one of its principal members but has often despaired of
getting him to stick to its philosophy. In the mid-1980s, however, Mr
Gephardt moved to the left, and ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1988 as a pro-union protectionist.
Generally recognised as an extraordinarily skilful manager of the Democratic
congressional caucus, Mr Gephardt starts the contest with a clear edge over
Mr Rose.
Even more tellingly, the election has moved the Democratic congressional
party to the left. Many old-school southern Democrats will not return to
Washington when the new Congress meets in January, through either retirement
or defeat. In Mr Rose's own state of North Carolina the Democrats lost four
of the eight House seats they had held.
Of the expected 204 Democrats in the new House (results from some districts
are not yet final) a clear majority represent districts in the northeast and
midwest. Among the remaining southern Democrats, a much larger proportion
now represents black and Hispanic districts. Both groups are shifting the
party's centre of gravity to the left.
In the Senate, a rather different leadership contest is brewing. Senator Jim
Sasser had been expected to succeed Senator George Mitchell, retiring
majority leader, but lost his re-election bid in Tennessee.
That leaves Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who is viewed as having a
philosophy very similar to Mr Gephardt's, to compete against Senator
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, another of the Senate's liberals.

FT  15 NOV 94 / SEC to review Nasdaq market
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Commission said last night it was undertaking a
review of the Nasdaq stock market, in the light of allegations that dealers
on the market illegally fixed their prices to profit at the expense of
investors.
The review by the US financial markets watchdog will seek to determine if
the dealers broke SEC rules, and comes on the heels of an inquiry launched
last month by the US Justice Department into whether dealers violated
anti-trust laws by colluding to keep spreads - the difference between the
prices at which they buy and sell shares for investors - unnecessarily wide
to maximise their profits.
Nasdaq is the second largest stock market in the US, after the New York
Stock Exchange, listing the shares of such well known companies as Apple
Computer and Microsoft. Investors buy and sell stocks at prices quoted to
them on computer screens by Nasdaq's 500 or so dealers, who include all of
Wall Street's biggest securities firms.
The wider the spread, the more money the dealers make on each trade.
The Justice Department and SEC investigations follow the publication this
year of two academic studies which claimed to have found evidence of such
collusion.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Peru victim of its own success: The search for a debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful economic recovery could well hamper the Peruvian government's
quest for an advantageous debt deal with its bank creditors. With the
economy likely to grow at the fastest rate in Latin America for the second
straight year, and its foreign exchange reserves at a record Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.6bn), it could be tough convincing banks that Peru deserves
generous treatment.
Recent announcements by economy and finance minister Mr Jorge Camet suggest
talks with leading bank creditors may start in mid-December.
Not before time, says Mr Carlos Bolona, former economy minister and
architect of Peru's far-reaching economic liberalisation and reform
programme. According to Mr Bolona, Peru had made substantial advances
towards a 'Brady' debt reduction accord in 1992 'when negotiating conditions
were considerably more propitious than today'.
'The time was right, when both the debt price and international reserves
were still low,' says Mr Bolona. 'Now you can't go crying to the banks, and
negotiating will be much harder.' Peru's debt is trading in the secondary
market at around 56 per cent face value, compared with less than 20 per cent
at the end of 1992.
A deal in 1992 was stymied, however, by the still unexplained sacking of Mr
Bolona and a battle over a disputed Dollars 72m debt to two New York banks -
which was formally recognised by the Peruvian Congress only after 10 months
of deliberations.
Ministry advisers are now saying they would like to see a Brady deal in
place some time next year. Many bankers think this may be difficult,
particularly given presidential elections next April. Two technical
obstacles must be cleared. The banks insist that Peru pay some Dollars 1.5m
in legal fees they incurred in legal actions against the government, and the
government insists the banks withdraw all pending lawsuits.
The main complication will be the huge amounts of interest arrears owed
dating back to 1984. 'Peru is the country with the largest ratio of arrears
to principal; that's going to involve some hard negotiations,' says Mr Peter
West of the London-based West Merchant Bank.
Banks have always resisted giving generous terms on arrears to discourage
debtors from delaying interest payments. The sticking point will not be the
terms on the roughly Dollars 3.5bn of principal - that is likely to be
fairly rapidly settled, say bankers, at a discount of 45 per cent (as in
Ecuador's just completed deal) or 50 per cent (as in Bulgaria). The sticking
point will be what happens over the more than Dollars 4.2bn in overdue
interest.
Some economists think that a generous settlement on interest is needed,
given that Peru's overall debt position remains critical despite the
breathers given under a generous September 1992 rescheduling deal with the
Paris Club of creditor governments. The country owes more than Dollars 22bn,
almost six times current annual export earnings and probably not far short
of actual GDP.
Many bankers think Peru's high reserves should allow a buy-back of some of
the debt for cash. Furthermore, a prolonged negotiation could allow further
debt to be liquidated through debt-to-equity swaps in the government's
privatisation programme. Peru has raked in large amounts of cash from state
company sell-offs. The total so far exceeds Dollars 2.7bn.
Economy ministry officials say privatisation has added some Dollars 2bn to
the reserves and this cannot, by law, be diverted into debt repayments. In
addition, bank reserve requirements mean that 45 per cent of all dollar
deposits in Peru are placed in the central bank, hugely swelling reserves.
Peru also has a large deficit on current account - around Dollars 1bn for
the first half year alone. Export earnings, though on target for a record
Dollars 4bn this year, remain vulnerable to fluctuations in raw materials
prices. Peru's real capacity to service debt has thus changed little in 15
years.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Gramm, Specter eye White House: Republicans look to 1996
presidential election after last week's congressional victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Republicans have barely savoured the triumph of last week's crushing
victory in the US congressional elections before setting their sights on the
presidential election in 1996.
Small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states to hold ballots in
the 1996 primaries, have been crowded over the last three days with hopeful
Republican candidates, as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Senator Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania formally threw their hats into the ring for their
party's presidential nomination.
It came as no surprise that Mr Gramm, an abrasively conservative economics
professor, should announce that he was filing papers this week with the
Federal Election Commission to put the legal structure in place for a
campaign.
Mr Gramm has made no secret of his plans, and clearly wishes to capitalise
on last week's election success, for which, as chairman of the Republican
senate campaign committee, he can claim at least partial credit.
But Mr Specter's announcement that he is 'exploring' a candidacy is seen as
a more quixotic venture - and perhaps a sign that the Republicans' prospects
are not so unclouded as they might appear after last week's triumph, which
has led many in the party to conclude that President Bill Clinton is
destined to follow the last Democrat in the White House as a one-term
president.
For a moderate such as Mr Specter to run, with minimal hopes of winning,
suggests that the party could have trouble remaining united after its tilt
to the right in recent years.
His candidacy would resemble in some respects that of Mr Paul Tsongas in the
1992 Democratic primaries - a bid to pull his party back towards the centre,
more than a realistic quest for the nomination.
In his announcement yesterday Mr Specter took aim at 'spoilers' such as Mr
Pat Robertson, the conservative Christian leader, and Mr Pat Buchanan, the
former Nixon speechwriter whose maverick candidacy so irked former President
George Bush in 1992.
'It is important at the outset to focus on the far-right fringe,' Mr Specter
said.
A host of other Republican hopefuls could enter the lists. Senator Robert
Dole, the acid-tongued leader of the new Senate majority, said he would make
up his mind by February 15. At least six members of Mr Bush's cabinet -
secretary of state James Baker, defence secretary Dick Cheney, labour
secretary Lynn Martin, housing secretary Jack Kemp, vice-president Dan
Quayle and education secretary Lamar Alexander - are also possible
candidates.
Of these, Mr Kemp started with the most public esteem but it is Mr Alexander
who now appears to have the best position.
A former governor of Tennessee, he is not widely known but has built a
strong political network, and is likely to win wider support among the 31
Republican governors than other candidates more rooted in Washington.
Iowa, which holds party caucuses in January of a presidential election year
to decide who to nominate for the presidency, counted for little in 1992
because Senator Tom Harkin, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, was
widely expected to sweep his home state. New Hampshire holds the first
presidential primary in the country.
Both states have in the past provided an important springboard for
candidates to raise their national profiles and to attract money for their
campaigns in the rest of the country.
In 1996, however, California and New York will both hold their primaries
much earlier in the process, instead of waiting to the end.
Campaign managers believe, therefore, that a serious candidate will need a
good organisation and at least Dollars 30m in hand by January 1996.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Peru's success hampers quest for debt deal: A difficult case
for generosity
</HEADLINE>

A powerful economic recovery could well hamper the Peruvian government's
quest for an advantageous debt deal with its bank creditors. With the
economy likely to grow at the fastest rate in Latin America for the second

(Pounds 3.6bn), it could be tough convincing banks that Peru deserves

Recent announcements by economy and finance minister Mr Jorge Camet suggest
talks with leading bank creditors may start in mid-December.
Not before time, says Mr Carlos Bolona, former economy minister and

'The time was right, when both the debt price and international reserves
were still low,' says Mr Bolona. 'Now you can't go crying to the banks, and
negotiating will be much harder.' Peru's debt is trading in the secondary

at the end of 1992.
A deal in 1992 was stymied, however, by the still-unexplained sacking of Mr

which was formally recognised by the Peruvian Congress only after 10 months

particularly given presidential elections next April.
Two technical obstacles must be cleared. The banks insist that Peru pay some
Dollars 1.5m in legal fees they incurred in legal actions against the

lawsuits.
The main complication will be the huge amounts of interest arrears owed
dating back to 1984. 'Peru is the country with the largest ratio of arrears
to principal; that's going to involve some hard negotiations,' says Mr Peter
West of the London-based West Merchant Bank. According to calculations by
the Institute of International Finance, an international bank think-tank in
Washington, using contractual interest rates the ratio of interest arrears
to principal will be 142 per cent by the year end, and 162 per cent by the
end of next year.
Banks have always resisted giving generous terms on arrears to discourage
debtors from delaying interest payments. The sticking point will not be the
terms on the roughly Dollars 3.5bn of principal - that is likely to be
fairly rapidly settled, say bankers, at a discount of 45 per cent (as in
Ecuador's just completed deal) or 50 per cent (as in Bulgaria). The sticking

Some economists think that a generous settlement on interest is needed,
given that Peru's overall debt position remains critical despite the
breathers given under a generous September 1992 rescheduling deal with the
Paris Club of creditor governments. The country owes more than Dollars 22bn,
almost six times current annual export earnings and probably not far short
of actual GDP.
Mr Paul Luke of Morgan Grenfell in London argues that the banks will be
forced to write off some of Peru's past due interest. Without this, he
argues, it will be impossible to finance the debt deal from the country's
tax revenues - which have proved notoriously difficult in the past to
increase beyond present low levels of around 11 per cent of GDP.
Mr Roberto Abusada, now an adviser in the economy ministry and a former
vice-minister, agrees. 'We're at the limits of our fiscal possibilities and
we need a highly advantageous deal.'
Mr David Atkinson of Standard Bank in London believes the negotiations will
not be easy, but thinks banks may well worry less about setting precedents
with a relatively generous settlement on interest arrears.
Many bankers think that Peru's high reserves should allow a buy-back of some
of the debt for cash - something Ecuador could not afford. Furthermore, a
prolonged negotiation could allow further debt to be liquidated through
debt-to-equity swaps in the government's privatisation programme.
Peru has raked in large amounts of cash from state company sell-offs. The
total so far exceeds Dollars 2.7bn and there are important assets, including
electricity generating companies, fishmeal plants, oilfields and refineries
and the giant state-owned mining and refining company Centromin, still to go
under the hammer.
Economy ministry officials say privatisation has added some Dollars 2bn to
the reserves and this cannot, by law, be diverted into debt repayments. In
addition, bank reserve requirements mean that 45 per cent of all dollar
deposits in Peru - about two-thirds of total deposits - are placed in the
central bank, hugely swelling the reserve total.
Peru also has a large deficit on current account - around Dollars 1bn for
the first half year alone. It is being financed by the inflow of long-term
capital, mainly from privatisations and the short-term capital still
flooding into the high-performance Lima stock market.
Neither of these sources can be counted on to continue for more than a year
or two. Export earnings, though on target for a record Dollars 4bn this

Mr Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, China's third largest city, signed a
clutch of agreements or letters of intent during a recent trip to the US,
garnering a total of nearly Dollars 1bn in planned investments. Motorola has
agreed to invest Dollars 360m to build its second manufacturing facility in
the city, and General Electric plans a Dollars 246m expansion which would
add four production lines to produce air conditioning units, refrigerators,
washing machines and microwaves.
Competition for foreign investment between China's provinces and cities has
become increasingly intense. With its population of 9.2m, Tianjin is
stressing its huge market, skilled workforce and 'stable society and fine
public order'. However a survey of foreign investors said laws and
regulations were ignored, intellectual property protection was inadequate,
and its bureaucrats are incompetent, especially at the lower levels.

British Telecommunications has been awarded a substantial contract by
Microsoft, the world's largest software house, to develop a data
communications network in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The UK group
declined yesterday to give the value of the contract but said it ran into
many millions of pounds and was one of the largest international contracts
the company had won.
The network will be used as part of Microsoft's newly announced worldwide
on-line information service, The Microsoft Network, which is expected to
represent a challenge to existing information providers such as Compuserve
and American Online. BT will use Concert, its joint venture with MCI of the
US, to provide the basis of the network. Customers with a personal computer
running Windows 95 and a modem will be able to connect from anywhere in
Europe or Asia/Pacific over the public telephone network to a BT node, and
from there to Microsoft in Seattle over Concert's high-speed lines.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi in Taiwan chip venture -
Japanese group makes early foray into Asian semiconductor plant investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Electric yesterday announced it is to invest in a joint venture
semiconductor facility in Taiwan to produce advanced memory chips. It will
be one of the first big investments by a Japanese semiconductor maker in an
Asian manufacturing facility outside Japan.
Mitsubishi is to co-operate with Umax Data Systems, the parent company of
Taiwan's largest printed circuit board maker, and Kanematsu, a Japanese
trading company. The Taiwanese stake in the joint venture will be about 60
per cent, with Mitsubishi taking 15 per cent, Kanematsu 16 per cent and
Japanese venture capital funds the remainder.
Mitsubishi's move reflects growing competition in the memory chip market to
increase capacity in order to meet forecast demand. It also consolidates
Taiwan's status as one of Asia's leading high-technology manufacturing
bases.
The joint venture facility will be in an industrial park north of Taipei,
and will start production of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips
next autumn.
Mitsubishi's investment decision was based on Taiwan's increasing importance
as a manufacturing base for computers, the main users of memory chips.
Taiwan probably makes about one-third of the world's PCs, a Mitsubishi
spokesman said.
Taiwan's comparatively well developed infrastructure and the availability of
gas, water and electricity were also a factor, Mitsubishi said.
A third element was the enthusiasm of the Taiwanese government, which is
keen to develop an indigenous semiconductor industry. Although Taiwan is a
big manufacturing base for computers, it does not have sufficient
semiconductor manufacturing capacity to meet computer industry demand. At
the same time, a large part of its growing trade deficit with Japan has been
in electronic components, such as semiconductors.
The joint venture in Taiwan will enable Mitsubishi to share the cost of
setting up a semiconductor manufacturing facility. Although the total
investment in the facility was not disclosed, building a semiconductor plant
was not likely to cost less than Y50bn (Dollars 512m), Mitsubishi said.
The project will also give Mitsubishi a valuable overseas manufacturing base
for memories, which are expected to become the dominant product in the
market from around 1995. The company has plans to expand semiconductor
manufacturing at its facility in Japan but its overseas operations are seen
to have lagged behind those of other leading Japanese semiconductor makers.
Mitsubishi's investment follows announcements by NEC, Hitachi and Toshiba of
increased investments in memory chip production. Japanese chip makers
believe market demand will continue to be strong, particularly with the
advent of multimedia technologies which require a lot of memory capacity.

FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US signs big UK aircraft order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jetstream Aircraft, the troubled turbo-prop subsidiary of British Aerospace,
has signed a contract to sell up to 60 of its Jetstream 41 commuter
aircraft. The contract, which could be worth as much as Dollars 420m, is
with Trans States Airlines of the US.
The order will boost substantially the workload at Jetstream's sole plant at
Prestwick in Ayrshire, Scotland. It will also strengthen Jetstream's hand in
negotiations with other European manufacturers on a strategic alliance of
turbo-prop aircraft producers.
Trans States has placed firm orders for 25 Jetstream 41s, with an option for
an additional 35. The first aircraft will be delivered to Trans States in St
Louis, Missouri, next February, with the rest delivered during 1995 and
1996.
Trans States is a regional airline which has code-sharing alliances with
TWA, USAir, Northwest and Alaska. It already operates the 19-seat Jetstream
31 aircraft.
Mr Hulas Kunodia, president of Trans States, said the 30-seater aircraft was
selected for its ability 'to contribute to the bottom line'. It had the
lowest operating cost of any 30-seat aircraft available.
Large aircraft orders are particularly prized among turbo-prop aircraft
producers, who have large overcapacity and a dire shortage of contracts. In
October 1993 Jet- stream announced a cut of 630 in its workforce of 2,500 at
Prestwick. It made an operating loss of Pounds 120m (Dollars 196.8m) in 1993
and British Aerospace made a Pounds 250m provision to cover turbo-prop
leasing liabilities.
Jetstream has been in talks with the Franco-Italian ATR consortium, a joint
venture between Aerospatiale and Alenia, on a proposed strategic alliance on
regional aircraft of 30 to 80 seats. Although there has been speculation in
the industry that agreement was near, British Aeropsace yesterday refused to
confirm this, and said it was also in talks with other companies.
The Trans States order will strengthen Jetstream's hand in any negotiations.
It has been suggested in the industry press that under an agreement with
ATR, Jetstream would continue to make the Jetstream 41, but would eventually
drop the less successful 70-seat Jetstream 61, a direct competitor with the
Franco-Italian ATR 72. It would become involved in developing and
manufacturing the 84-seat ATR 82, which ATR wants to launch early in 1995.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are
currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All
trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

Kobe Steel, one of Japan's leading integrated steelmakers, has set up its
first European production facility in the Netherlands. The new facility in
the De Beitel industrial park will be Europe's largest producer of material
for welding stainless steel, and is expected to be completed in May 1995,
with commercial production starting in October next year.
The new facility will enable Kobe to avoid the impact of the yen's rapid
appreciation, high delivery costs and import duties. Kobe plans to supply
Europe and the US from its new facility. By 2000, it hopes to expand product
lines to become a comprehensive producer of welding materials to supply the
shipbuilding, construction and machinery industries. The European market for
advanced welding materials is expected to grow to 1,400 tonnes by 2000 from
an estimated 1,000 tonnes this year. Kobe Steel has a 40 per cent share of
the Japanese market for welding materials.

<TEXT>
Politely disguised anguish may be present beneath the smiles of Japan's
senior politicians as they welcome their latest batch of guests to trade
talks in Tokyo this week.
Delegations from Japan's two biggest trade partners, the US and the European
Union, will arrive in Tokyo to obtain fresh promises that Japan realise its
much vaunted plans to reduce the more than 10,000 regulations which protect
and constrain an estimated 40 per cent of industrial activity.
Trade tactics employed by Washington and Brussels over Japan have converged
in substance as well as in timing. The US will take a more co-operative line
with Japan, because it is tired of being accused of bullying, while the
European Commission will take a tougher line because it is tired of being
accused of failing to get results.
Washington has turned away, at least for the moment, from its former
strategy of pushing for import targets and promises to be less
confrontational, though no less demanding.
Brussels will, for the first time in several years, demand tangible
progress. The message is that there is a limit to the EU's patient trade
diplomacy with Japan, until now limited to polite statistical studies of
foreign shares in each others' markets.
The commission has a second objective. Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner
responsible for external economic affairs, wants to return home with a
promise that European companies will not be cut out of Japanese trade deals
with the US. Some member states are uneasy that well mannered Europe wins
none of the big trade prizes achieved by US table-thumping. Motorola's
access to the mobile telephone market, won early this year, and US dominance
of Japanese defence procurement are pointed to as examples.
Pressure is building up from European suppliers, such as France's Dassault
Aviation, which wants the airforce to buy its Mystere Falcon business jet
for transporting officers. Another is Britain's GEC-Marconi, hoping that
Japan's defence agency will be allowed the political freedom to carry out
its wish to buy UK instead of US minesweeping sonar.
The US delegation today begins two days of talks, in which it will present
Japan with a list of deregulation steps across 10 industries. Sir Leon and
two Commissioner colleagues meet ministers on Saturday with a similar
shopping list covering eight sectors.
Examples of long standing demands, shared by the US and EU, include:
An end to the mass of planning and operating restrictions that impede the
growth of supermarkets, a move which would spell death for the 1.5m small,
family-run businesses that dominate Japanese high streets, but high profits
for the budding discount sector.
Lay open the maze of restrictions that ensure that foreign investment
managers handle a mere 0.2 per cent of Japan's Y170,000bn (Pounds 1,075bn)
pension funds.
Streamline the arcane car inspection system, which requires each new vehicle
to be checked twice, by two different government agencies, before it reaches
the road. This ensures most car makers can only make a profit if they sell
high volumes.
Review the statutes of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the domestic
telecommunications monopoly, to make it cheaper for private sector operators
to plug international or long distance calls into NTT's local networks.
Ensure that Japanese government policies for more open public procurement
are carried out.
The signs are that the Japanese government and the behind-the-scenes power
of big business also impede foreign competition.
Retailing is a good example because it touches everyday lives. Japan's large
scale retail law, governing opening hours and planning consent, has been
revised twice in the past two years to make life easier for new shops. Since
the second revision last May, the number of supermarkets to open in Japan
has quadrupled to about 80 a month as a result. Yet still less than 10 per
cent of supermarket goods are foreign.
Meanwhile, Reuter reports that Japanese officials yesterday said they were
sticking to their guns in their dispute with the US over access to Tokyo's
car and car parts market, despite an agreement to re-open stalled talks on
the issue.
'It's fine to re-open the talks, but Japan has not given up its basic
conditions (for re-opening),' Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister for
international trade and industry, said in Tokyo. He said Japan was waiting
for the US to move to restart the talks, adding that Japan had outlined
three conditions for doing so.
Last Thursday Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said he and
Japanese trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had agreed to re-open vehicle
sector talks, but set no date. The talks have been stalled since the two
sides failed to reach agreement at the end of September.
Yesterday Mr Kantor warned Japan that he intended to pry open its automotive
market, even if that meant resorting to unilateral trade measures.
'We are going to make sure we make progress one way or another,' Mr Kantor,
in Jakarta for broader Asian-Pacific trade talks, said.
President Bill Clinton, also attending the Asian-Pacific trade talks in
Indonesia, told prime minister Tomiichi Murayama yesterday that more
progress on trade - especially cars and car parts - was needed, a US
official said.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Bold campaigner for reform in Japan: A call for
privatisation of the country's postal ministry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan's much touted drive to reform its bloated bureaucracy, one force
that has been woefully absent is clear leadership from the country's
politicians.
In spite of all the talk by the authorities, the pace of reform to date has
been slow and the steps taken or being proposed have been half-hearted and
superficial.
As Japanese industry, and the US government, become more vocal in pressing
for further deregulation, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, an eighth-term member of the
House of Representatives and former minister of posts and
telecommunications, has emerged as a rare politician with a recipe for
dramatic change.
The soft-spoken Mr Koizumi has ruffled many feathers in the Japanese
political and bureaucratic community by calling for the break-up of the
postal ministry as the key to reducing the role of government in the
country's affairs.
'The best way to tackle the issue of administrative reform is to privatise
the activities of the postal ministry,' Mr Koizumi declares.
'The aim of administrative and fiscal reform is small government. I believe
that means that what private business can do should be left to the private
sector and the government's role should be restricted to a small number of
essential functions.'
In that respect the postal ministry is clearly a leading candidate for
reform because so many of its businesses are easily transferred to the
private sector, Mr Koizumi says.
Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications, apart from being
responsible for delivering the nation's mail, runs the largest savings
system and the largest insurance company in the world. Deposits in postal
savings accounts as of March, 1994 amounted to Y183,535bn (Pounds 1,177bn)
while the assets of the postal insurance fund totalled Y74,345bn.
The postal ministry thus competes not only with private delivery services
but with private banks and insurance companies as well. Putting the postal
ministry's businesses into private hands would reduce the role of government
in economic affairs and could serve as a model for privatising many other
activities performed by the government, Mr Koizumi argues.
Mr Koizumi's contention has less to do with championing free market forces
than with concern over Japan's future finances. 'If the government continues
to do what private businesses can do just as well, the size of the
administration will continue to swell. People need to realise that in order
to avoid having to continuously raise taxes, it is crucial to reduce the
functions of the government's bloated administration.'
Unless measures are taken to reduce government functions, 'no matter how
much taxes are raised, it will be like a drop in a bucket that has a hole in
it,' he warns.
Mr Koizumi's campaign to privatise the postal ministry as a first step
towards genuine administrative reform is an unusually bold act in a country
where politicians have long been expected to leave policy up to the
mandarins in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall.
But a third generation politician who has served twice as minister of
welfare, Mr Koizumi is used to controversy. Two years ago he became the man
whom bureaucrats love to hate when on the very day he was appointed postal
minister he broke a Kasumigaseki taboo by speaking out against a key policy
of his bureaucrats.
His latest mission also appears so far to have won him more enemies than
friends.
As in the UK, where efforts to privatise the post office were recently
thwarted by the resistance of several politicians, Mr Koizumi's idea of
privatising many of the functions of Japan's postal ministry faces
opposition not only from bureaucrats but from every political party,
including his own Liberal Democrats. Neither is it particularly popular
among the general public.
'Most people still think it is not necessary to take such a drastic step,'
he concedes. Few politicians, not to mention the mass media or the general
public, are as exercised as Mr Koizumi about the need to adopt radical
measures in order to tackle the financial squeeze on the public purse that
is bound to come.
But politicians are also afraid of the consequences of speaking out. The
postal unions are a formidable force in Japanese elections because of the
size of the post office.
Direction must therefore come from the very top - from the prime minister
himself, who will need to present the idea of privatising the post office as
a cabinet policy. If that can be done, Mr Koizumi is sure there are many
politicians who will be willing to follow the lead.
He does not expect such leadership to come from Mr Tomiichi Murayama, prime
minister, whose Social Democratic party would be unlikely to risk alienating
the postal unions.
He believes Mr Murayama will do a reasonable job in carrying out some
aspects of administrative reform and deregulation. But the reform of a few
state-controlled organisations does not go to the heart of the problem.
Politicians and the public will realise what needs to be done and be willing
to act only when the financial situation of the government becomes more
desperate. 'Until then,' Mr Koizumi says, 'I will have to proceed with
patience.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Taiwanese vote to settle their island's identity: Divisions
over whether Taiwan will seek to be a Chinese province or a sovereign state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwanese voters will cast a ballot for the island's identity as much as for
cleaner streets in local elections early next month.
The long-ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang (KMT), is marshalling all
the considerable forces at its disposal to maintain control of the two
biggest cities and a governorship on the island it officially calls a
province of China - the Republic of China, that is, not the People's
Republic of China.
The KMT, which retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after defeat at the hands of Mao
Zedong's communist armies, now faces a formidable challenge to its political
survival in the shape of the Democratic Progressive party, which advocates
an independent Taiwan. It also suffered from attrition when disaffected
conservative KMT members broke away to form the New Party last year.
Ironically, old foes have become allies as the Nationalists have been aided
in their electoral campaign by Chinese officials, who have in recent days
reiterated Beijing's longstanding threat to use force against Taiwan should
circumstances warrant. President Jiang Zemin yesterday reportedly told US
President Bill Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in
Jakarta that if Taiwanese authorities declare independence, China would
certainly not stand by and do nothing.
Next month's polls represent the penultimate stage in a process of
democratisation which began in the mid-1980s, marked by successive elections
starting from the lowest levels of government and culminating in direct
presidential elections in early 1996.
In the December 3 elections, voters will for the first time choose mayors
for the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, where about a quarter of Taiwan's
21m residents live, and a governor for Taiwan province, comprised of
territory other than the two cities and a few outlying islands. The posts
were previously appointed.
Should a DPP candidate win, it would be the first time the leading
opposition party would have captured a significant administrative post. The
KMT accuses the DPP of being irresponsible and incapable of governing, while
the DPP says the ruling party is irredeemably corrupt and inefficient.
The Taipei mayoral seat is widely expected to go to Mr Chen Shui-bian, a
popular DPP lawmaker in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament. Mr Wu
Dun-yih, the KMT incumbent, is seen likely to retain the mayorship of
Kaohsiung.
But it is the symbolically significant post of provincial governor which is
especially critical to the KMT, and it has spared no expense in drawing on
its vast financial resources to ensure victory for the incumbent candidate,
Mr James Soong. Mr Soong is one of the few remaining top Taiwanese
politicians to have been born in mainland China, the others having been
shunted out of the KMT's mainstream faction in recent years.
The KMT cannot afford to lose the provincial governorship poll because it is
seen as a referendum on the identity of Taiwan and future relations with
China. The KMT says Taiwan is a province of China and supports eventual
reunification with China under condition of peace and democracy on both
sides of Taiwan Strait. The DPP says Taiwan is not a Chinese province but an
independent nation and thus the entire provincial government structure is
redundant and should be abolished.
The KMT also fears that if the DPP wins control of the provincial
government, which administers three-quarters of the island's territory and
population, something analogous to the 'Yeltsin effect' could materialise,
at least in theory - a reference to how the power of the head of the Russian
republic eclipsed that of the leader of the former Soviet Union.
Political analysts say that a win by the DPP's candidate, Mr Chen Ting-nan,
would pose an indirect threat to the legitimacy of the president himself, as
he was in effect installed by a rubber-stamp parliament rather than popular
mandate.
In practice, President Lee Teng-hui enjoys enormous popular support, even
among many DPP members, because he is a native Taiwanese and it is widely
believed that he secretly favours the island's independence. As the polling
day draws nearer, the KMT will likely play the 'president card', in the
parlance of the local media, and bring Mr Lee on an extensive tour of the
island to win votes. The same strategy helped carry the KMT to victory in
islandwide polls a year ago which the DPP was predicted to win.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Brokers fight for private savings

<TEXT>
Branch managers at Nikko Securities, a leading Japanese broker, have been
scrambling to gather their ideas together ahead of the stock market seminars
for individual investors held today.
Over the next few weeks, the brokers are expected to pursue a fierce media
campaign against the commercial banks in bidding for the ordinary
salaryman's seasonal bonus. But many officials of the broker's 126 retail
branches are uncertain how much interest they can muster among their
individual clients in time to get them to invest their winter bonus
payments, to be distributed next month, in shares.
With the Nikkei index down 3.6 per cent since the start of the month, and
many traders nervous over the benchmark's possible fall below the 19,000
psychological support level, some Nikko managers do not expect high
participation.
What worries the officials, and the Tokyo financial community, is that while
overseas, corporate and large institutional investors have been cautiously
investing in the stock market over the past few years, retail investors, who
have shunned shares since the market started its decline in 1990, have shown
no signs of returning.
Participation in daily stock market trading has declined steadily, with last
month's activity by private individual investors totalling 14.4 per cent of
total market turnover, a sharp fall from 43 per cent 10 years ago.
Many retail investors are still licking their wounds from the post 'bubble'
era plunge in share prices, with the bulk of them sitting on unrealised
losses. The problem has been exacerbated by disastrous privatisations of
state owned enterprises.
The government and brokers had hoped that flotation of such companies as
East Japan Railway, part of the former Japan National Railways, and Japan
Tobacco, the tobacco and salt monopoly, would lure private investors back.
Instead, the Nikkei plunged 20 per cent in a month subsequent to JR East's
listing in October last year, while Japan Tobacco has fallen 33 per cent
from its public offering price.
Mr Jason James, strategist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo, says a gradual
rise in interest rates has damaged the case for a boom in retail stock
investment seen in the US and the UK over past few years. While low interest
rates prompted US and UK retail investments into equities, in Japan, the
rise in bank deposit rates has kept individual investors from the equity
market.
So how will the brokers try and entice retail clients to invest their hard
earned cash? Many hope that by steering clear of the stocks, they can appeal
to their clients.
'We're offering them deposit type investments,' says one Nikko branch
manager. 'We have to convince people that we also offer safe and profitable
products,' he says.

FT  15 NOV 94 / China to overhaul social security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans sweeping reforms of its welfare system to provide a social
security net for urban employees, many of whose jobs are under threat in
ailing state enterprises.
The official Xinhua news agency yesterday reported that next year 'top
priority' would be given to building a better insurance system for
unemployment, pensions and medical care.
China's plans to overhaul its existing rudimentary social security system
reflects growing concern about the effects of changes that have all but
wiped out the previous cradle-to-grave welfare arrangements based on
individual work units.
Municipalities such as Shanghai have been experimenting with new social
security measures for the past year or so, but Beijing has clearly decided
that political pressures oblige it to overhaul its existing schemes.
Plans to construct a comprehensive social security net for China's
approximately 100m urban workers come in response to strong pressures from
increasing numbers of unemployed and under-employed workers.
China's official urban unemployment stands at 2.6 per cent, but this figure
vastly understates the problem. Numbers of jobless in some industrial cities
may be as high as 20 per cent of the workforce.
Under the proposed new scheme all enterprises, including state-owned,
collective, joint venture and private ones, will have to take out
unemployment insurance at a cost of 1 per cent of pay-roll. This money will
be paid into a nationally administered fund.
The government is also planning to establish new superannuation and medical
care arrangements for pensioners. This move reflects official concern over
the fate of many pensioners buffeted by rising prices.
The authorities also announced they would set up a special insurance fund
for people laid off from bankrupt enterprises and enterprises undergoing
reorganisation.
Beijing has made reform of its state enterprises, including liquidation of
the worst cases, its main priority, but has hesitated to implement its plans
because of fears of worker unrest.
The establishment of a new system is an attempt to put in place social
security arrangements for the long term. But China faces technical
difficulties establishing such comprehensive schemes. New welfare
arrangements are expected to be a drain on the budget as China proceeds with
a painful rationalisation of its state sector where an estimated 50 per cent
of enterprises are losing money.
China has completed a draft law to cover safety in its nuclear power
industry and expects the legislation to be ratified soon by its parliament,
the National People's Congress, the official People's Daily said yesterday,
Reuter adds from Beijing.
The Nuclear Safety Department, responsible for drafting the law, has already
announced 16 regulations governing nuclear safety and issued 60 documents to
serve as guidelines for nuclear safety, the newspaper said. Nineteen more
regulations on nuclear safety are still being drafted. 'This will enable
administration of our nuclear safety to come on track through a law,' the
newspaper said.
China's fledgling nuclear industry has never reported an accident or
polluted the environment, it said. China plans to have 10,000 MW of nuclear
generating capacity operational or under construction by the year 2001.

FT  15 NOV 94 / US rallies support for N Korea accord: Clinton uses Apec to
win backing for deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is using the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum
to drum up support for his deal with North Korea whereby Pyongyang has
undertaken to abandon efforts to manufacture and stockpile nuclear weapons.
Speaking after meetings with leaders from China, Japan, South Korea and
Australia, he said the North Korean accord had been the most important topic
of their discussions.
All of them had indicated support for the agreement, 'which marks an
historic step to freeze, and ultimately to end, the greatest security threat
in this region'.
An explicit gesture of support for the deal would not only help rebuild the
credibility of US foreign policy after the landslide Republican victory in
last week's mid-term elections, but would also go some way to distract
attention from the persistent intrusion of human rights issues into a summit
supposed to be primarily devoted to trade policy.
It may also help persuade North Korea to live up to its undertakings. The
deal has proved controversial in the west because it will be difficult to
police and enforce. It will be five years before North Korea has to disclose
to the outside world the extent of its existing ability to make nuclear
weapons. Meanwhile Pyongyang is to receive aid to pay for the installation
of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.4bn) worth of safer light water reactors.
Mr Clinton's discussions yesterday focused particularly on Japan and South
Korea, which are to provide most of the finance, but he also secured
valuable support from China, one of the few countries with influence in
North Korea.
China was pleased with the deal and 'will play a positive role in promoting
peace and stability in the Korean peninsula', the Foreign Ministry said
after Mr Clinton met President Jiang Zemin.
The US president also urged South Korea and North Korea, which has reacted
coolly to recent overtures on investment from Seoul, to resume bilateral
contacts over security and other matters. 'These two countries have some
things to resolve between themselves that the rest of us separately cannot
do for them,' he said.
Specific matters were also raised in yesterday's meeting with President
Jiang, including human rights. 'We made it absolutely clear that in order
for the US relationship to fully flower, there has to be progress on all
fronts,' Mr Clinton said.
He offered Mr Jiang a compromise to resolve a contentious arms issue,
described by the Americans as a 'potential time bomb' for US/China
relations. The proposal would absolve China of penalties if it disclosed
sales of M-11 missiles to Pakistan, US officials said.
As the issue of East Timor continued to dog the talks, Mr Clinton, asked
whether the US had softened its stance on human rights in favour of trade
deals, said Washington continued to raise the issue with Indonesia.
The US had obtained assurances from Indonesia that the students who had
invaded the US embassy compound in Jakarta over the weekend would not face
retribution, he added. East Timor remains, however, strongly in the
limelight. About 80 East Timorese were arrested after a further student
protests in Dili yesterday.

Switzerland said yesterday it would provide technical and financial aid to
the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan under a new co-operation agreement.
A finance ministry spokesman said Swiss President Otto Stich and Mr Askar
Akayev, his Kyrgyz counterpart, who arrived with a delegation in Switzerland
for a three-day official visit, signed the deal in the capital Berne.
Switzerland will provide SFr4m (Pounds 1.95m) of technical aid a year,
covering agriculture, forestry, the dairy industry, privatisation, and help
to non-governmental organisations. It will also provide financial assistance
for energy and healthcare projects. The two countries have had links since
Switzerland joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in May
1992. Kyrgyzstan was one of several former Soviet republics which joined
Poland in a group that then let Switzerland represent it on the IMF's
executive board.

Hunger and malnutrition are growing in eastern Africa and the continent
needs exceptional aid, according to a report to be presented to a council
meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) today.
Mr Jacques Diouf, who promised to make Africa his priority when elected head
of the UN's main food agency last year, will detail a worsening hunger
situation when he opens the meeting. 'Fifteen countries in the region are
currently facing exceptional food emergencies and half of these countries
are also being affected by civil strife,' the report said. Rwanda and
Burundi were listed as being extreme cases, and in need of continued
international aid and 'extreme agricultural rehabilitation'.
The report also said famine conditions were emerging in several parts of the
Horn of Africa including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan.
Mr Diouf, a Senegalese who is the FAO's first African director-general, will
address a 49-nation governing council, which is meeting for 10 days to
discuss and vote on a range of agency business.

Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka's new president, yesterday appointed
her mother to a third term as prime minister, but made few other changes in
the cabinet for the sake of continuity. Mrs Kumaratunga, who won a sweeping
victory in last week's presidential polls, swore in the elderly Mrs Sirima
Bandaranaike along with other cabinet ministers, keeping alive a family
tradition of ruling the island nation. Mrs Bandaranaike, 78, was the world's
first woman to head a national government when she became Sri Lanka's prime
minister after her husband Solomon Bandaranaike was assassinated in 1959.
She served two terms as prime minister in the 1960s and 1970s and was leader
of the Sri Lanka Freedom party formed by her assassinated husband.
Mrs Kumaratunga kept the finance portfolio and took over the defence
ministry, a portfolio which under the constitution resides with the
executive president along with the post of commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
Political analysts said Mrs Kumaratunga's decision to nominate her mother as
prime minister would enable them to swap roles easily after the new
government met its election pledge to make the presidency a ceremonial
position.

FT  15 NOV 94 / UN to maintain Iraq sanctions
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council agreed last night to maintain sanctions against
Iraq, ignoring Baghdad's formal recognition of Kuwaiti sovereignty and of
the UN-demarcated common border. The decision to recognise Kuwait by the
revolutionary Command Council was conveyed personally by Mr Tariq Aziz, the
deputy prime minister, to Ms Madeleine Albright, US delegate and current
Security Council president, before the council held its regular 60-day
sanctions review. She and other members said afterwards that the Iraqi move
was not even discussed during the review. The Security Council scheduled a
second private meeting to consider how to deal with the developments. In the
meantime sanctions will remain in place at least until January 14, the date
for the next review, and probably well into 1995 or even longer, officials
said.
The US bolstered its case against the relaxation of sanctions by presenting
satellite photographs of lavish building projects, including a retreat for
President Saddam Hussein on a 90-acre man-made lake, estimated to have cost
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 731.7m).
Sir David Hannay, UK delegate to the Security Council, called the evidence
'quite startling' and insisted that if the Iraqi people were suffering as a
result of the embargo, Mr Saddam's obduracy was to blame and not the
council.
In a statement to the council which was made public afterwards, Ms Albright
said the US did not even accept the recognition of Kuwaiti sovereignty 'at
face value'.
Referring to the high living standards of top Iraqis, she said Mr Saddam had
spent at least Dollars 500m on opulent new palaces for himself and his
family, who continued to 'enjoy uninterrupted supplies of ice cream,
cigarettes, liquor and other imported luxuries'. However, reporters noted
that Mr Aziz was without his customary Havana cigars yesterday.

FT  15 NOV 94 / In Angola, a ceasefire may not mean peace: The economic
implications of an expected conclusion to the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS SHAXSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a hillside overlooking Luanda's docks, bands of children trawl through
rubbish bins near a large, partly finished building, now overgrown.
The children are refugees from a civil war which erupted again after a short
peace when Unita rebels rejected defeat in UN-sponsored elections in late
1992 and returned to war.
The building was started by a Portuguese company as foreign investment
flowed into oil- and diamond-rich Angola after peace accords in 1991. It was
abandoned when it was discovered that peace had turned sour.
Negotiators in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, have initialled another peace
agreement which was due to be signed today. But this was last night
postponed to November 20 amid reports that Unita had refused to sign while
the government intensified the war. In the past fortnight, since initialling
of the pact, government forces have overrun the rebel stronghold of Huambo.
Leaders of southern African states due to meet in Lusaka today were reported
to be drafting a tough statement calling for a stop to the fighting. UN
officials said the warring sides had agreed to discuss cessation of
hostilities.
Uncertainty about peace, however, means that foreigners and Angolans alike
are increasingly cautious about the country's prospects. 'A lot of money
flowed recklessly into Angola last time,' one economist said. 'People will
be careful now.'
The civil war, which erupted on independence from Portugal in 1975, has
carved Angola into a patchwork of government and rebel control with towns
cut off from one another by fighting and landmines. More than a third of
Angola's 10.5m people depend on a humanitarian aid operation costing Dollars
250m a year, the main burden of which has been left to foreign organisations
while the government has pursued its war.
An economic programme launched in March set out to reduce state control of
the economy. Central to the plan was the aim to end official exchange rates
previously used to subsidise selected sectors of the economy.
Mr Severim de Morais, vice-minister of planning and economic co-ordination,
said last month Angola would have a fully floating exchange rate by the end
of the year.
The programme had early successes in reining in spending and reducing annual
inflation from 1,800 per cent in January to 930 per cent in July, according
to official figures. But Luanda's elite successfully derailed a similar
programme last year.
The new economic team has failed to get the political support needed to curb
spending and bring the budget deficit, last year officially estimated at 29
per cent of gross domestic product, near the programme's target of 4 per
cent.
The free market exchange rate rose rapidly from around 280,000 kwanza to the
dollar in mid-September to 640,000 by mid-October, as dollars became scarce
because of demand from the secretive defence sector. Monthly inflation rose
from 7 per cent in June to 23 per cent in August and public sector strikes
broke out.
The volatile kwanza strengthened to 350,000 in mid-month amid signs of a
peace agreement, with some business people saying they expected a rush of
new lending to Angola which would temper the dollar's scarcity. But little
new money has come in to date. Official requests for IMF support have so far
been met with polite refusal. Financial institutions are cautious about
lending to a country with an external debt approaching Dollars 11bn and one
collapsed peace agreement behind it.
The disaster of the last accords stirred up new mistrust. Early disarmament
and large cuts in defence spending are unlikely as long as there is any
chance that war will erupt again.
If peace holds, foreigners seeking to invest in Angola's non-mineral economy
stand to be frustrated not just by continued political uncertainty but also
by bureaucracy, an under-educated workforce and confused property laws.
But three sectors of the official economy could grow if a ceasefire holds.
First, despite an estimated 10m to 20m landmines scattered across the
country, refugees could return to their fields in many parts of the country
and April's harvests could increase sharply from an estimated 250,000 tonnes
this year.
Long-term agricultural potential is large: before independence Angola
exported food and was the world's fourth largest coffee producer.
Second, if a peace agreement were to hold and Unita, which has been funding
its war effort mostly with diamond sales, were persuaded to co-operate in
the anarchic north-eastern diamond areas, the government could raise
official production from Dollars 2m last year closer to the Dollars 250m
reckoned to have leaked out from the Unita areas.
Third, Angola's mostly offshore oil industry has largely been unaffected by
fighting. Oil production is expected to rise gently from around 550,000
barrels a day to 700,000 in 1996, as new fields come on stream.
But Pedro Manuel, an Angolan businessman, echoed a widely held caution about
his country's prospects. 'There is so much hatred after what happened last
time. A ceasefire may happen but that is not the same as peace.'

Iraq formally submitted a series of documents affirming its recognition of
Kuwait's sovereignty and the United Nations-designated border between them
to the UN security council yesterday. Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister,
insisted that this justified an early lifting of the economic embargo, but a
US spokesman said no change was in prospect as the result of the council's
60-day sanctions review period. He also linked Baghdad's belated concession
to the firmness of the US and other council members in response to menacing
Iraqi troop movements near the border last month. Before the US and Britain,
which have veto power, will consider lifting sanctions Iraq must fulfil
other obligations including the return of captured Kuwaiti armaments and
property. There must also be total compliance with the UN commission charged
with eliminating Iraq's nuclear, long-range missile,and chemical and
biological capability.
Mr Aziz's case has not been helped by information from American officials
that funds have still been found to rebuild President Saddam Hussain's
palace and other buildings at a cost of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 610m). Mr Aziz
termed this 'rubbish'.
Ms Madeleine Albright, US representative and council president, who received
the documents from him, acknowledged that members would be very pleased.
Iraq had finally done what the international community had long demanded.
But continuing American scepticism was evident in the brevity and coolness
of the meeting, which lasted barely two minutes and at which Mr Aziz was
characterised as 'not his usual ebullient self'. For the occasion, Ms
Albright wore a brooch in the form of a reptile on her plain blue dress.
This was her response to the recent publication by an Iraqi newspaper of an
unflattering poem in which she was called a snake.

Norway's Labour government yesterday stepped up its campaign to win approval
for joining the European Union in a referendum on November 28, following
neighbouring Sweden's vote in favour of membership on Sunday.
With both Sweden and Finland now set to join the Union on January 1, the
pro-EU camp is hoping to swing Norwegian opinion to a Yes vote with an
appeal not to leave the country isolated. Up until now the opposition has
held a strong lead in the opinion polls, reflecting deep-seated suspicions
in Norway that membership will erode Oslo's independence and control over
its rich oil and fish resources.
'Norwegians are well aware that Sweden is both our closest and most
important neighbour. It's our main trading partner and that has implications
for Norwegian jobs,' said Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister.
She underlined the belief on both sides of the campaign in Norway that the
outcome will be strongly influenced by the Swedish vote. 'Many people waited
until the Swedish vote was known before making up their minds and many more
are not likely to decide until the last week or even during the last days
before the referendum,' Mrs Brundtland said.
The prime minister will have an important platform this week to press home
the Yes message as she hosts a regular meeting of her fellow Nordic prime
ministers in the northern city of Tromso. Among them, only she and the
Icelandic prime minister will be a non-member, or non-member elect.
Norway is the last to vote of the four European Free Trade Area applicants
aiming to expand the EU to 16 members. Austria voted heavily in favour last
June. The Swedish parliament will ratify accession by the end of December.
The Finnish parliament is expected to complete ratification of its October
referendum approval by the end of this week. It had been held up until after
Sweden had voted
In Norway, the Yes campaign plans a big push in the final two weeks, arguing
that EU membership will help secure jobs at a time of high unemployment,
warning that investment, production and jobs would be moved outside the
country if it is rejected. 'It would be a nightmare for Norwegian companies
should we decide to stay outside the European co-operation,' said Mr Svein
Aaser, president of the Confederation of Business and Industry.
But Mrs Anne Enger Lahnstein, head of the Centre party and the leading
anti-EU campaigner, called for anti-EU activists to mobilise all their
resources in the final battle. 'I believe our arguments against the EU will
remain valid irrespective of Sweden's decision to join,' she said.
On Saturday, one opinion poll put EU opposition at 48 per cent, with the Yes
camp at just 29 per cent. But some surveys have suggested that Norway's
Eurosceptics would be more inclined to vote for membership if Sweden joined.
Reflecting this was another poll giving the Yes camp 49 per cent and the Nos
51 per cent.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Industry hails Swedish Yes: Rise of krona fails to dent mood
of optimism among big business

The Swedish krona rose sharply yesterday in response to Sunday's referendum
vote backing entry to the European Union. But though the increase might have
damaged the earnings prospects of the country's big export-oriented
multinationals, business leaders did not mind in the least.
The clear endorsement of EU membership was exactly what they wanted - even
though a weaker currency might have benefited them in the short term. 'It is
the long term which is important,' said Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of
Volvo, Sweden's biggest industrial group. Mr Magnus Lemmel, head of the
Federation of Swedish Industries, said: 'We can now begin our way back to
our lost position at the top of the world's industrial countries.'
Sweden's current economic recovery, after three years of recession, has been
driven by the success of its exporters. It was not surprising, therefore,
that the importance of EU membership for its big companies was highlighted
repeatedly during the referendum campaign.
The bosses of the country's multinationals stressed that they had to be able
to operate under the same conditions as their competitors, as well as to
influence the outcome of decisions affecting the business climate in Europe
 -by far their largest market.
'Sweden's entire wellbeing stands or falls on its nearness to its markets,
in particular to Europe,' said Mr Leif Johansson, president of Electrolux,
the world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances.
Membership was particularly important for the pulp and paper sector,
Sweden's largest net export earning industry. Ever since Finland voted last
month in favour of EU entry, Swedish forestry executives were worried they
would lose out to their main European competitor if they were left outside
the Union.
Equally, they wanted to be able to influence directives coming out of
Brussels, particularly where - as in the case of waste paper recycling  -
there is a direct impact on the amount of Swedish virgin fibre going into
the paper system.
A further reason for business to back membership was the belief that EU
monetary convergence criteria would force the government to be more
disciplined in reducing the country's large budget deficit and fast-growing
debt. They believe tougher government action will bring down interest rates,
stimulating investment and creating jobs.
Yesterday brought a glimpse of this brighter future. Long-term interest
rates fell sharply, with the yield on the five-year benchmark bond dropping
19 basis points to 10.35. The stock market also celebrated, rising 2.34 per
cent.
A climate of greater investor confidence in Sweden should bring both
increased domestic investment and a spurt in much needed foreign investment
in the country.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government was yesterday accused of doing too
little to help integrate Germany's 6.8m foreigners.
As Mr Kohl presented his programme for the next four years in government,
opposition parties homed in on the one issue which had caused the three
coalition partners the most difficulties in their talks over the past three
weeks.
The new government will introduce laws which will give foreign children
German nationality until they are 18. They must then choose whether to keep
their parents' nationality or to continue with German nationality.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democrat party,
said the changes amounted to a 'political and legal nothing'.
The Inter-Cultural Council in Germany said: 'This attempt, allegedly to make
integration of foreigners easier, will do nothing to change the fact that 7m
foreigners live in this country with diminished rights.'
The programme also outlines measures to combat unemployment while keeping a
tight control on government expenditure.
After almost three weeks of negotiation between his Christian Democratic
Union, its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union, and the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), the government has
pledged to reduce federal bureaucracy by at least 1 per cent a year - around
13,000 jobs - and do all it can to increase privatisation at state and
municipal level.
Efforts will also be made to reduce the proportion of gross national product
consumed by government spending from 51 per cent to 46 per cent, where it
was before German reunification in 1989.
Laws to combat crime would be updated and efforts made to introduce
Europe-wide measures.
The new cabinet is expected to contain 16 ministers, two fewer following
fusion of the education and science ministries and the ministries for family
and women. No important changes are expected, but Mr Kohl would not name his
new team until he has been confirmed as chancellor in a Bundestag vote
today.
The FDP, which has been under pressure to cede ministries following its poor
election result, will hold on to the foreign, economics and justice
ministries.
It remained unclear whether Mr Gunter Rexrodt, FDP economics minister, would
keep his job or have to give way to forces within the party who want him
out.
Feverish speculation continued yesterday about whether Mr Kohl would be
re-elected as chancellor given that he can only afford to give away four
votes without losing the absolute majority.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday unveiled his programme for the next four

Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, said
the programme agreed by the three parties had avoided discussion of all
important issues. It was a 'coalition of weakness', he said.
He said the new laws for foreigners - the one subject on which the coalition
had been specific - amounted to a 'political and legal nothing'. They would
give third-generation immigrant children dual nationality until 18 and then
offer them full citizenship if they give up their foreign passport. The
Inter-Cultural Council in Germany said: 'This attempt, allegedly to make
integration of foreigners easier, will do nothing to change the fact that 7m

votes without losing the absolute majority. To avoid any last minute mishaps
all Bundestag deputies were told to report to Bonn last night.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Yeltsin sees greater friction with US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday forecast new friction between Russia and a
US in which the Republican party was ascendant. He also warned of an
increased nuclear threat from developing countries, scolded his military
chiefs for inefficiency and told his prime minister not to cut too much from
armed forces funds.
In a wide-ranging series of remarks to military commanders, the Russian
president sounded a more bellicose note than he has before, though his
speech was cast in the form of requiring his forces to be on guard against
an increasingly dangerous world.
In his first public comment on last week's US elections which returned
Republican majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr
Yeltsin said that 'after the victory of the conservatives in the US mid-term
elections we can expect a certain toughening of the US stand in foreign
policy and military issues. We should acquire contacts with the Republicans,
to balance our relations'.
Remarking that the 'international situation is quite unstable' - a marked
longer had any enemies - Mr Yeltsin said that Russia could find itself drawn
into political, ethnic and economic conflicts. 'There is only one solution:
to increase the readiness of its armed forces,' he said.
He told Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who also attended the
meeting with the commanders, to ensure that the military had enough funds so
that 'they are not pushed down the road of commerce - they have their own
objectives. You gave your word to guarantee the financing of the army and I
believe you'. His remarks appeared to provide a rationale for widespread
claims that military commanders are engaging in illegal commercial
operations.
The Interfax news agency quoted him as saying that 385,000 personnel had
been cut this year making an official total of 1,917,400 under arms. The aim
was to reduce the military to 1.7m by January 1996.
He said that the military leadership, headed by General Pavel Grachev, the
defence minister, 'does not fully carry out my orders to tighten military
discipline, law and order'. Gen Grachev has been under pressure from all
parties in the state duma (lower house of parliament) to resign following
corruption allegations in the high command. So far, the president has
protected him.
However, Mr Yeltsin's remarks came as Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the
duma's defence committee, announced that it would take a vote of confidence
in the minister on Thursday.

Maastricht pact, Mr Alain Lamassoure, EU affairs minister, said yesterday.
He was reacting to the call with which Mr Jacques Chirac recently opened his
presidential campaign for France to hold a second referendum on adopting a
single currency, in addition to its 1992 plebiscite approving Maastricht.
The issue of a single currency 'is already settled', Mr Lamassoure told
French radio. But Mr Chirac's Emu referendum call, clearly designed to give
fresh hope to the anti-Maastricht camp unreconciled to its narrow defeat two
years ago, unsettled the financial markets and called down criticism from
the Balladur government's more pro-European ministers on Mr Chirac's head.
Mr Lamassoure's remarks were carefully co-ordinated with Mr Alain Juppe, the
foreign minister who is also Mr Chirac's main backer within the government
and who on Saturday succeeded him as interim president of the Gaullist RPR
party. Their initiative is designed to get the French government off the
hook on which Mr Chirac's Emu referendum idea threatened to impale it as
well as himself.
Domestic elections will make France's presidency of the EU in the first half
of next year hard enough without France appearing to cast doubt on its
existing Maastricht commitment through the mouth of Mr Chirac. But, said Mr
Lamassoure, the challenge of enlarging the EU to the east, as well as
improving its foreign and defence policy co-ordination, would almost
certainly give rise to institutional changes in 1996 meriting a referendum.
Mr Lamassoure fully acknowledged yesterday that the French presidential
campaign 'unquestionably poses us a problem' in the smooth chairing of Union
business. France will begin its EU presidency under one president and finish
it under another. Another certainty is a new government after the May 7
election. This means that June 1995 - which would otherwise be the busiest
month of the France's EU presidency as it scrambles to chalk up new
directives to its credit - will see new French faces chairing most or all of
the various Union councils.
Meanwhile, Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing European Commission president,
yesterday appeared to reduce by a month the suspense over whether he will
run as Socialist candidate for the presidency. He said on radio that he
would say 'before Christmas' if he decided not to run. It seems, therefore,
that the nearer his silence is maintained to January 25 - the new likely
date for installation of the new Commission - the likelier it is that he
will run.

<TEXT>
Norway's trade surplus in October rose to NKr6.143bn (Pounds 600m) compared
with NKr5.523bn in the same month a year earlier, said Statistics Norway,
the official statistical agency. The increase was largely due to a surge in
exports of goods such as fish, fish products and metals, said the agency.
Total exports, which include Norway's substantial oil and gas exports, rose
by 16 per cent in October to NKr22.888bn compared with NKr19.757bn for the
month a year earlier. Total imports in October rose 18 per cent from a year
earlier, with the largest increases seen in cars, metals, timber and
machinery, said the agency.
Portuguese consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent in October after a 0.2 per cent
increase in September, to put year-on-year inflation at 4.5 per cent, down
from 4.7 per cent previously, the National Statistics Institute said.
Average annual inflation was 5.6 per cent in October compared with a 5.8 per
cent average recorded in September.
The Bank of Spain has forecast growth in gross domestic product of more than
2.0 per cent in the third quarter of 1994 compared with the same period a
year earlier. The bank said in its quarterly economic report that growth was
fuelled by a recovery in domestic demand.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces huge flood aid bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi is searching for ways to find some
L7,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn) in additional aid to cover the damage caused by last
week's catastrophic flooding in northern Italy.
As an immediate response, the right-wing coalition pledged L3,000bn drawn
from existing funds.
But the final assessment of flood damage in Piedmont is expected this week
and initial estimates of more than L10,000bn worth of damage could prove
conservative.
With very limited personal and corporate insurance cover, especially in the
agricultural sector, individuals, companies and local authorities are
looking to the government for financial help.
Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister who has taken charge of the relief
operation, has done nothing to dispel the impression that the government
will foot the bill. Indeed, the government seems more than ready to do this
to offset growing criticism over the authorities' handling of the disaster.
The cost of previous disasters, such as the 1980 Irpinia earthquake in
southern Italy, were financed by increasing taxes on petrol or tobacco. But
this could prove inflationary and the government may well opt to issue a
special bond or introduce a once-off income tax payment.
More than 700 towns and villages were hit by the floods which began on
November 5.
Italy's right-wing coalition government last night won a vote of confidence
in the chamber of deputies on a revenue-raising measure in the budget.
The result of the vote, on an amnesty in the budget bill for Italians guilty
of illegal building work in exchange for a one-off payment, was 321-134.
Opposition filibustering delayed the vote by several hours and many
opposition deputies boycotted the ballot.
The government has signalled it could also seek a confidence vote on
pensions reforms, an area in which the Northern League, a member of the
coalition, is seeking significant changes.

<TEXT>
Profits in west German industry could jump 150 per cent in 1994 as a result
of economic recovery and higher productivity, according to the Munich-based
Ifo economic research institute. The institute said total profits could
surge to around DM50bn (Pounds 20.4bn) in 1994 after falling an estimated
11.9 per cent to around DM20bn in 1993. Ifo said its figures were fairly
speculative but were based on established relationships between economic
growth and production factors such as labour costs and employment levels. If
the forecasts are correct, 1994 profits would show a return to profit levels
last seen in 1989 and 1990. Ifo forecast a real improvement of 5.4 per cent
in labour productivity in 1994, the highest increase since 1979 and compared
with a 2.2 per cent rise in 1993. Unit labour costs were likely to fall 1.2
per cent in 1994 after rising 3.6 per cent in 1993 and net production in
industry was forecast to rise 3.5 per cent after falling 7.7 per cent last
year.

<TEXT>
A rapid growth in exports and high investment is pushing the Hungarian
economy towards an unexpectedly high 4 per cent growth in gross domestic
product this year. But sustainable growth will remain elusive unless the
government cuts spending and tightens fiscal policy, Mr Peter Akos Bod,
governor of Hungary's independent central bank, said yesterday. Addressing
an FT conference on Investing in Hungary, Mr Bod said industrial output was
now growing at 7 per cent annually while construction was booming, with 15
per cent growth. After two years of drought-stricken harvests and a
disruptive transition to private land ownership, agricultural output, which
usually accounts for one third of total exports, is also expected to rise by
5 per cent this year. The growth is export and investment led, Mr Bod said.

FT  15 NOV 94 / EU recovery strengthening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in the European Union is gathering in strength as
confidence grows in the industrial and construction sectors and among
consumers, the European Commission reported yesterday. The preliminary
results of its business and consumer survey for October disclosed a sharp
improvement in industrial confidence last month and a recovery in capacity
utilisation in manufacturing industry to the average of the past 11 years.
The Commission said its October survey showed that capacity utilisation,
which is measured every three months, jumped to 81.5 per cent among
manufacturers in the 12 member states, from 80.4 per cent in July.
Utilisation was up 4.1 percentage points from the 77.4 per cent level of
October 1993 and halfway between the most recent 77.2 per cent low of July
last year and the most recent high of 85.8 per cent registered in the late
1980s. Britain, according to Commission estimates, had the highest level of
capacity utilisation at 85.3 per cent and was narrowly ahead of the
Netherlands and France. Ireland and Spain had the lowest levels of capacity
use in the EU. However, the improvement in manufacturing activity will not
lead to higher employment in the EU. Only in Denmark, did the number of
manufacturers saying they expected to boost employment exceed those
expecting to shed labour.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean Gandois, the former head of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium and
packaging group, is set to become the next president of the Patronat, the
French employers' federation, after winning a clear majority in a vote by
the organisation's executive council. Mr Jean-Louis Giral, the other
candidate in the contest, said he would withdraw following his 25-10 defeat
in yesterday's poll. Mr Gandois should now be confirmed as the next head of
the Patronat at a meeting of the organisation's 536-member general assembly
which is scheduled for December 13. The contest to succeed Mr Francois
Perigot as president of the Patronat has been one of the most fiercely
fought of recent years. Mr Gandois, a pro-European, has said he wants to
revitalise the organisation and give it a stronger voice in the debate over
political and social reforms. Mr Giral, head of the family-run building
contractor Desquenne et Giral, was regarded as the champion of small and
medium-sized industry. He is close to Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist
candidate for next spring's presidential elections.

The third French government minister to resign in recent weeks amid
allegations of corruption was formally placed under investigation by the
French authorities yesterday. Mr Michel Roussin, the co-operation minister
who resigned over the weekend, was questioned yesterday afternoon for two
hours by Mr Eric Halphen, investigating magistrate in Creteil outside Paris.
The minister, who has since been replaced in the French cabinet by Mr
Bernard Debre, is under investigation for alleged improper receipt of
corporate funds in connection with the funding of the Gaullist RPR. He
denies any wrongdoing.
Meanwhile, further allegations of the links between French companies and
political parties emerged yesterday with a report in Le Monde connecting
Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications group, with the Republican party,
which is a member of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Union for French
Democracy (UDF), which governs in coalition with the RPR. Shares dipped
temporarily on the Paris bourse after Le Monde carried an article suggesting
that one of the company's subsidiaries had paid FFr3.2m (Pounds 380m) to the
Republican party to support its 1988 political campaign. The article claimed
the money was paid into a bank account in Luxembourg controlled by a
Panamanian company used as a slush fund for the Republican party and created
by Mr Alain Crellier, now managing director of Nomura Bank in Paris and an
associate of Mr Gerard Longuet, the former industry minister forced to
resign over Republican party funding investigations. Alcatel Alsthom refused
to comment yesterday. Mr Crellier said 'I have nothing to say. I am talking
to my lawyers.'

European allies of the US pledged yesterday to maintain the arms embargo
against Bosnia, despite Washington's abrupt withdrawal from the operation,
which they almost unanimously regretted.
The nine full members of the Western European Union - a defence club which
is emerging as the European pillar of Nato - also agreed on the need to
solve the Bosnian war by peaceful means, including the efforts of the
'contact group' of senior officials from five nations. Experts of the
contact group, which has had credibility problems recently, will meet in
London on Thursday.
Several WEU countries deplored the US position on grounds that it implied
support for a military solution in Bosnia. Turkey - an associate member of
the WEU - was alone in voicing approval for President Bill Clinton's move
last week, which took his allies by surprise.
The Bosnian issue dominated a meeting in this windswept Dutch seaside town
of nine WEU nations and 15 other countries - nine of them ex-communist -
which enjoy an associate or observer status.
Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian politician who has just taken over as
secretary-general of Nato, will fly to the US this week with a warning that
transatlantic differences could scupper any efforts by the west to provide
security and stability for ex-communist countries.
'On both sides of the Atlantic, we must avoid decisions which can endanger
solidarity,' Mr Claes said.
Mr Claes added that Nato would continue to enforce the embargo against
Bosnia because it had been mandated to do so by the United Nations. His
implied criticism of the move, forced on the US president by Congress,
marked one of the few occasions in Nato history when the holder of the top
job in the alliance has censured Nato's most powerful member state.
The WEU gave broad approval yesterday to a Dutch paper on upgrading defence
co-operation in Europe but lively discussion over Bosnia left less time than
expected to discuss the proposal, which Britain has reservations over.
However, UK officials confirmed that they were softening their traditionally
sceptical attitude to purely European security initiatives by cautiously
approving a Franco-German move to set up a joint armaments agency, as long
as it was open to all WEU members and efficiently managed.
Croatia yesterday threatened to intervene if Bihac, the north-western Moslem
enclave, was in danger of falling to Serb forces, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade. At the same time, the Bosnian Serbs kept up their assault on
Bihac. Serb forces have recovered 80 per cent of the land seized by Moslems
during their two-week offensive there, the UN said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's right-wing coalition government last night looked set to remain
together in voting on a self-imposed confidence motion on part of the 1995
budget. The confidence motion had been introduced in the chamber of deputies
where the coalition has a majority of 120 to ensure that the populist
Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi did not defect from the government's
ranks. But as the debate began, a League spokesman told the chamber his
party would back its partners even though it disliked the imposition of the
confidence motion. The government's move related to the introduction of a
pardon on buildings built without proper planning permission. The pardon is
expected to lead to a huge influx of new property registration fees to the
tune of L7,000bn (Pounds 2.76bn). But members of the government coalition,
mostly the League, proposed almost 200 amendments. The opposition also
proposed others to limit the scope and prevent a blanket approval for
illicit construction over the past five years. Government business managers
argued that only by a confidence motion could discussion be speeded up.

<TEXT>
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is threatening to ban the last
independent newspaper in Belgrade, its editors said yesterday.
The move comes at a time when the Serbian economy appears in danger of
collapse and the president is facing criticism within his own party and the
country for his embargo against the Bosnian Serbs. But also it appears to
reflect his renewed confidence after being courted by the international
community as the man willing to make peace in Bosnia.
Last week, Mr Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Serbia's ruling socialists,
criticised Borba, the independent Belgrade daily, as an 'anti-state'
newspaper. Government lawyers invoked a legal technicality, saying the
newspaper was not legally registered, and therefore, does not exist. Borba's
editors dismissed this charge as 'nonsense', printing their three-year-old
registration petition.
Mr Branislav Milosevic, managing director of Borba, yesterday said the
Serbian president had a 'carte blanche to do whatever he likes in Serbia
after being hired as a peacemaker'.
Since imposing a political and economic embargo on the Bosnian Serbs three
months ago, the Serbian president has sacked the editor of Politika
television. The Politika daily newspaper, once the flagship of Serbian
journalism, has become a government mouthpiece. Studio B, the financially
strapped independent broadcaster, is also threatened by a
government-orchestrated takeover.
No relation to the president, Mr Milosevic of Borba says the move may be a
pre-emptive strike against potential dissent in Serbia. Economic
deprivations have risen. The Yugoslav dinar, stable for nearly a year, is
crumbling. Despite severe penalties, a black market has re-emerged.
Electricity has been restricted and shortages of staple foods are frequent.
Mr Milosevic may also come under increasing pressure to review his policy on
the Bosnian Serbs if they continue to suffer military setbacks.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Factory gate prices ease interest rate pressures: Fall in
cost of petrol helps figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of goods leaving UK factories rose by less than expected last
month, easing fears that inflation pressures will soon prompt a rise in
interest rates.
However, underlying price pressures in industry continue to grow, suggesting
that fresh impetus for a rate rise will emerge in the months ahead.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the cost of goods
produced by UK manufacturers for the home market rose by 0.1 per cent in
October, compared with September, and 2.3 per cent in the year to October.
The figures were flattered by a fall in petrol prices. Measured without the
volatile sectors of food, drinks, tobacco and fuel, output prices rose by
0.4 per cent in the month.
Nevertheless, the data were better than the City had expected and prompted
some analysts to suggest that further rate rises are unlikely this month.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, are understood to have agreed to leave interest rates unchanged
at 5.75 per cent.
However, expectations of a rise in US interest rates fuelled speculation
that a UK base rate rise might be imminent. The US federal open markets
committee meets in Washington today, and is widely expected to raise rates
by at least 0.5 per cent.
It is thought that a meeting between Mr George and Mr Clarke would be
required ahead of their next scheduled meeting on December 7 for the UK to
follow any US lead immediately.
However, most analysts believe that a UK interest rate rise is likely to be
delayed until after the Budget on November 29.
Yesterday's data painted a mixed picture. The price of fuels and materials
purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in
October, compared with September, the lowest monthly rise since January.
Over the year to October, input prices rose by 6.9 per cent.
The subdued rise in output prices indicates that most of the annual input
price increase is still being absorbed by industry. But the Treasury expects
that output prices will accelerate next year, and yesterday's data suggest
that manufacturers in some sectors, such as plastics, are already passing
input price increases on to customers. Measured on a three-monthly basis,
output prices, excluding volatile elements, rose by 0.8 per cent in the
three months to October, compared with 0.4 per cent in the three months to
July.
It remains uncertain whether retailers will be able to pass manufacturers'
price increases on to consumers, given the fragile state of consumer
confidence.
A Confederation of British Industry survey yesterday showed that retailers
reported a dip in annual sales volumes in October, for the first time since
December 1992. Sales were well below expectations, after a relatively strong
September.
Official retail sales figures and and the retail prices index for October
are due later this week.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Lottery sells 7m tickets in 12 hours: Major tells launch
party all will benefit and country will be richer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, operator of the UK's first national lottery for more than 150
years, said it was 'absolutely delighted' with sales of more than 7m tickets
in the 12 hours since yesterday's 7am launch.
The total was nearly three times as much as its estimates for the first day.
In some places, people queued outside retail outlets selling the Pounds 1
tickets. More than 10,000 outlets had on-line computer terminals, and a
further 2,500 are expected to be connected before Christmas.
The lottery hopes to raise Pounds 32bn over seven years, with an estimated
Pounds 9bn going to causes such as charities and the arts. It was launched
in London in a marquee in the grounds of the Tower with the help of a string
octet, a group of Morris dancers and a fireworks display.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, pronounced it 'a people's lottery'. He
said everyone would benefit.
At exactly 7am Sir Ron Dearing, the Camelot chairman, pushed a wooden
plunger, apparently to initiate ticket sales around the country. The plunger
was precisely that - and not connected to anything.
Early morning Guests in the grounds of the Tower - there were also official
launches in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh - could not, however, buy
tickets. As a result Mr Major had to be driven to a newsagent in central
London, where he spent Pounds 5 and promised to donate the more than Pounds
2m jackpot to Mencap, the mental health charity, if he won.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, secretary for the national heritage, the department
responsible for the National Lottery, also promised to buy tickets and to
give any winnings to Age Concern.
Mr Dorrell warned he had no early plans to change the rules on how money for
the arts - one of the five beneficiaries - from the proceeds of the lottery
should be used.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage spokesman, welcomed the launch but wanted to
see the benefits felt in every community.
The main questioning voice came from the Salvation Army, which suggested
that punters should give all their lottery stake to charity rather than the
28p in the Pounds 1 that the lottery will give to good causes.

FT  15 NOV 94 / MPs want code to ensure impartial civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An influential cross-party committee of MPs is set to call for a statutory
code of conduct to guarantee the political independence of the civil
service.
In a report critical of the stance adopted by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet
secretary, the committee is expected also to insist that ministers remain
directly responsible to parliament for semi-independent executive agencies.
The report by the Treasury and civil service committee is understood to
reject Sir Robin's view that existing rules and procedures provide
sufficient protection for the impartiality of the civil service.
The report's publication next week will echo disquiet among Sir Robin's
colleagues in Whitehall about his high-profile role in a number of political
controversies. These include his investigation of ministers in the
'cash-for-questions' row and his exoneration of Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
Treasury chief secretary, in the dispute over payment of a bill for a
weekend stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Some members of the committee, which has been carrying out its investigation
for more than 18 months, have been irritated by Sir Robin's response. He
refused to allow the MPs survey civil service opinion. Subsequently it was
reported to the committee that Sir Robin had remarked casually during a
Whitehall social function that he did not expect it to 'come up with much'.
The committee, which has already questioned Sir Robin, may ask him to appear
again to justify the present arrangement, which combines the job of cabinet
secretary and head of the home civil service.
The report, to be published on November 24, has been drawn up by a
subcommittee chaired by Mr Giles Radice, a Labour MP. But its conclusions
have been endorsed by the full committee, which has a Conservative majority.
The proposal for a code of conduct with statutory backing to replace the
dozen separate sets of rules under which civil servants now operate, falls
short of the more prescriptive Civil Service Act favoured by some MPs.
But the new code would set out in simple terms the obligation of civil
servants to be impartial and objective and would highlight the duty of
ministers to respect their officials' political neutrality.
It would also end the present system in which the cabinet secretary is the
final arbiter in cases where civil servants claim they are being pressured
to act improperly.
They recommend an independent appeals system.

FT  15 NOV 94 / BASF in Pounds 850m deal to acquire Boots' drugs-making
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots is to end 80 years of prescription medicine manufacture with the sale
of its drugs business to BASF of Germany for 'about Pounds 850m'.
The proposed deal, still subject to contract discussions, ends speculation
over Boots' intentions. Its decision commits the UK company to developing as
a retailer, after trying to combine healthcare with shopkeeping.
Conversely, as BASF's biggest purchase in healthcare, the deal reinforces
the German chemicals group's commitment to expansion in drugs.
In global terms, however, the deal is relatively small. The combined
business would be about 30th in the world in terms of sales in the
pharmaceuticals sector, about 10 places ahead of their current standing.
BASF said yesterday the rationale was 'both therapeutic and geographic'.
Boots is strong in the US, UK and Commonwealth countries while BASF is best
placed in continental Europe.
BASF also wants Boots' expertise in nervous system drugs. Boots has licences
to develop two such drugs with projected launch dates at the end of the
decade. Until then, BASF will have to make do with an old and small product
portfolio.
Most of Boots' prescription drug sales and profits come from Synthroid, a
thyroid drug available only in the US. which had first-half sales of Dollars
117m (Pounds 73.1m) - outside the world's top 100 bestsellers. Synthroid,
like other Boots products, has no patent protection.
In the first half of 1994, Boots achieved prescription drugs sales of Pounds
226m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.8m.
Boots put its prescription drugs business up for sale when adverse
side-effects forced it in July 1993 to abandon its most promising drug, the
heart treatment Manoplax.
It has had talks with several drugs companies in recent months, including
Zeneca and Medeva of the UK, but no agreement was reached on price.
By last week, only BASF and a management buy-out team were left in the
running. The buy-out team yesterday refused to give up the chase, saying it
awaited the outcome of the final contract negotiations.
BASF and its German rivals Bayer and Hoechst have made a string of drug
sector purchases in the past year in an effort to increase their activities
outside the German domestic market, the largest in Europe.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Bankers Trust moves derivatives staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the US bank that faces two lawsuits over derivative
instruments it sold, has moved six executives out of their jobs after the
discovery of apparent irregularities in its derivatives operations.
They include three managing directors, among them Mr Jack Lavin, one of the
bank's most senior executives and the head of its corporate derivatives
business. All six have been put on 'special assignment' while an internal
investigation continues.
The actions, taken on Thursday but not announced, were prompted by the
findings of an internal review the bank launched after it came under attack
this year from two customers, Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greetings.
Both companies have since launched legal actions against Bankers Trust,
saying they were misled about the real risks involved in the derivatives
they bought. The bank has strongly denied both claims.
Bankers Trust's investigation is believed to have uncovered breaches of its
record-keeping regulations, as well as sales methods that did not meet its
rules.
The discovery of those apparent internal irregularities will come as a
serious setback for the bank, which has been a pioneer in the development of
the fast-growing derivatives markets. It will also add to the pressure on it
to settle the lawsuits quickly.
All the apparent breaches are believed to involve leveraged swaps, the type
of instruments sold to P&amp;G and Gibson.
Under a normal swap, the bank and its customer agree to exchange payments in
the future based on the level of interest rates. Such instruments are used
by companies as protection against changes in interest rates, or to lower
their borrowing costs.
In a leveraged transaction, interest rate changes are magnified, making such
instruments far more volatile when rates move.
Procter &amp; Gamble is suing Bankers Trust for Dollars 130m (Pounds 81.5m)
after losses this year after US interest rates started to rise. In an
interview last week before the executives were relieved of their
responsibilities, Mr Brian Walsh, head of derivatives, said the bank had
sold leveraged swaps to 'less than a dozen' companies, all of them in the
US. The bank refused to say how many possible breaches of its rules it had
uncovered.
Five of the people moved worked on the bank's corporate derivatives desk,
which sold these financial instruments to companies, while the sixth was in
a support area.
In a further move, Bankers Trust has merged the corporate desk, which had
employed around 20 people, with its institutional derivatives operation,
which sells derivatives to investors and financial institutions.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Sony expected to pull out of
economic downturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the consumer electronics maker, is expected to indicate that it is
pulling out of the economic downturn when it reports its mid-term results on
Thursday. The company has been working to increase its overseas
manufacturing to shield itself from the impact of the high yen. Sales growth
in Asia, outside of Japan, and the benefits of new products such as
wide-screen television are forecast to have a positive impact on profits.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Economists warn on skills training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government should take steps in the Budget to encourage skills
training if the UK manufacturing revival is to be sustained. Economists from
Lloyds Bank argue, in their latest monthly bulletin, that low skills levels
are 'probably the single greatest threat to the improved condition of UK
manufacturing.'
UK manufacturing output has been rising for over two years, and is now
growing at close to 4 per cent per year. The bulletin says this reflects the
changing nature of the economic recovery, with investments and exports
providing more impetus for growth. It predicts that manufacturing output as
a whole should accelerate into 1995.
The Lloyds Bank economists, Mr Sheldon Warton-Woods and Mr Patrick Moon,
cite these growth rates as evidence that the long-term decline in UK
manufacturing has bottomed out. The past 25 years have seen manufacturing's
share of UK GDP decline from around one-third to close to one-fifth.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (10): The importance
of saying 'maybe' - The chequered fortunes of the state-owned Credit
Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade ago, Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, launched a publicity
slogan that has haunted it ever since: 'The power to say yes.' In the past
few months, its directors, customers and shareholders have all wished that,
instead, it had exercised its power to say 'no' rather more often.
A string of activities that look extremely embarrassing in hindsight
continues to hover over its future prosperity: loans to MGM, the film
comany, an extraordinarily unprofitable property portfolio, and financial
support to Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and
politician, to name just a few.
While the French government, the controlling shareholder in the bank, claims
that it spotted troubles starting to emerge in 1992, action took rather
longer. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer was removed as head of the bank last November -
although initially to be given another important banking job. In his place,
the state appointed Mr Jean Peyrelevade, formerly head of UAP, the French
insurance group.
However, the financial problems at Credit Lyonnais were brought into sharp
focus only in March this year when the bank declared record losses of
FFr6.9bn, and the state underwrote FFr42bn worth of its property portfolio.
This was followed by a FFr4.9bn capital increase announced over the summer
with money from the state and other - somewhat reluctant - shareholders.
In July, a parliamentary inquiry criticised the bank and its directors,
attacking its property investments but also - more controversially - the
extent to which the state itself had pushed the bank into propping up
state-owned industries.
But the bad news did not end there. At the end of September, Credit Lyonnais
reported further losses for the half-year of FFr4.5bn. It announced further
provisions of FFr10.1bn, and is widely expected to require perhaps the same
amount again before dispensing with the legacy of the past.
Meanwhile, Mr Peyrelevade has been playing a delicate game against the
state. While he pleaded for additional financial support to prevent the risk
of the bank falling below minimum solvency levels, the government held back
from publicly providing the necessary reassurance at the time of a high
budget deficit.
The result has been a diplomatic compromise. Mr Peyrelevade simply states in
the passive voice that the problems of the past will no longer be an issue
after the start of next year. The government emphasises that it will support
depositors but everything must happen in the right order, meaning a full
evaluation of the provisions that are really necessary before there is any
offer of unconditional extra support.
Observers have questioned whether Credit Lyonnais has yet gone far enough in
its strategy for reform. It is proceeding with an asset disposal programme
agreed by the government at the time of the recapitalisation, but the signs
are that it is already falling behind in its timetable and in the value of
realisations.
It is also resisting attempts to sell any of its core activities, notably
its operations in Europe including perhaps the most comprehensive retail
branch network across the continent: something which it is convinced is the
secret of success for the future. Others are less convinced.
The events of the last few months have certainly had a powerfully
detrimental effect on the bank's certificats d'investissement, its only
publicly traded shares, although a number of analysts now believe the worst
is over. But Mr Peyrelevade admits that the negative publicity may have also
reduced the number of new customers attracted over the last few months.
In an unprecedented effort to boost morale for clients and staff alike,
Credit Lyonnais launched a FFr18m advertising campaign in some 70 newspapers
early last month. The centrepiece was an 'open doors evening' at local
branches across France to pose questions to the staff about its losses and
financial stability.
An estimated 40,000 people turned up between 5pm and 9pm to quiz several
thousand volunteer staff in 1,900 of Credit Lyonnais' 2,100 branches around
the country. Mr Peyrelevade himself went to a branch in his home town of
Marseilles, with many other senior and middle-ranking headquarters staff
getting out to different offices.
An internal briefing document circulated to the bank's staff in the past few
days gave them detailed responses to a number of Credit Lyonnais' critics.
It told them to be natural, professional and positive, and advised them in
the event of 'an incident' to take more emotional clients to a more isolated
place to discuss and maintain the bank's position 'but always with a smile'.
Much of the French press was sceptical about the success of this event.
Certainly, many customers in the bank's branches in Paris seemed more
concerned about withdrawing cash from wall dispensers and struggling home in
the rush hour rather than asking questions - although one manager suggested
the problem was the competition from three televised football matches that
evening.
But, speaking on French radio, Mr Peyrelevade said that the critical
reaction was typically Parisian, and that in many other parts of the country
the evening was well received. An opinion poll conducted by Credit Lyonnais
with 500 of the branches that participated suggested three-quarters came to
ask questions, just over half to express support and 19 per cent to
complain.
Nevertheless, in the view of the staff afterwards, about 30 per cent of
customers left still bearing concerns about the bank's financial
difficulties or scandals. Such opinions will continue to haunt Credit
Lyonnais, and remind its managers - if they get the chance - of the
importance of continuing to say 'maybe' rather more often.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (9): For more than
just farmers / Profile of Credit Agricole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty minutes into the conversation, Mr Lucien Douroux, the chairman of
Credit Agricole, heaves a sigh of relief as the questioning shifts away from
the bank's agricultural loans. 'At last,' he says, raising his hands in a
mix of exasperation and delight.
Past history and the legacy implied by its name have helped fuel two
misconceptions about Credit Agricole, which celebrated its centenary in
September: that it is still subsidised by the French government, and
predominantly involved in agriculture.
As a result, its officials believe it has often been misunderstood -
particularly by Anglo-Saxon journalists, but more importantly by potential
clients, which some insiders concede may have periodically prejudiced its
chances of gaining business outside its traditional sphere of operations.
Certainly Credit Agricole stands apart from its competitors in a number of
ways - not least the modern headquarters hidden behind the Montparnasse
station south of the Seine, in stark contrast to the ornate offices of most
of France's other large banks located more centrally around Place de
l'Opera.
At a time when most French banks are laying emphasis on cutting back on the
number of branches, Credit Agricole remains proud of its extensive network:
with 8,400 outlets serving 15m personal customers, it is the largest
numerically in the country.
Like rural English churches, it has some branches which open only on certain
days of the week with staff rotating between a succession of centres. It
also operates some 10,000 'green points' or banking centres in butchers' and
bakers' shops in small villages.
Modern art celebrating the furrow in a farmer's field, photos of the
countryside liberally illustrating its annual report, and the persistent
refusal to change its name - with all its valuable long-standing
associations - do nothing to help change its image and reflect its broader
portfolio of activities today.
There is no doubt that Credit Agricole remains pre-eminent in rural areas
and in loans to farmers. Its literature continues to talk about its link to
the soil, its roots and its regional strength. It continues to hold about 80
per cent of the market share of farmers' business against its competitors.
'That is a stable percentage, one we intend to retain,' says Mr Douroux.
'It's an activity we know well and where we have a lot of expertise. It is
not an easy sector to understand. We have advantages.'
Nevertheless, Mr Douroux says that the agricultural sector is becoming
increasingly uncertain in the light of reforms to the common agricultural
policy and the changing policy of Gatt. Equally, the proportion of the
French population that is employed in farming - and their contribution to
the economy - is in continuing decline.
At the same time, Credit Agricole has come under new competitive pressures.
Financial deregulation in the 1980s altered the environment. The bank was
privatised in 1988 - converted into an unquoted joint stock company with 10
per cent of the shares held by employees and the remainder by the network of
regional banks that make up the co-operative structure.
'We have no state support and no privileges,' says Mr Douroux. 'We are just
one bank among others. In the past there was a monopoly and it was right,
just as using oil-lamps were right at one stage. But it's over.'
It still dominates in providing state-subsidised low interest loans to
agriculture - a legacy of the 19th century. But it must now bid in the
annual auction against other banks which want the business.
On the other hand, it can now function more freely. In the past, tight
government controls on credit in general, and on the operation of the bank
in particular, restricted its expansion into other areas. It was allowed to
provide services to small and medium-sized companies only in 1981, and to
larger companies in 1991.
Just 5 per cent of its customers are farmers, who represent 15 per cent of
outstanding loans. Two-fifths are domestic loans - mainly for mortgages.
Small business and local authorities are also important parts of the
portfolio.
As to the future, Mr Douroux highlights three areas. The first is to improve
productivity by reducing costs. The regional banks controlling Credit
Agricole are being enlarged and regrouped. Where there were 94 in 1986-87,
there are 68 now, and it is estimated that there will be just 35-40 by the
turn of the century. Mr Douroux talks of a 'progressive reduction' of costs
each year.
The second target, he says, is 'to reinforce our basic activities: loans to
households, agriculture, local authorities, and small and medium-sized
businesses.'
Finally, he aims to develop some new markets, primarily in existing areas of
strength in other countries where domestic clients are expanding, or in
specialist niches such as private banking, capital markets and treasury
management. He also wants to extend partnership through buying stakes in and
working more closely with other co-operative banks in Europe 'to provide a
full array of services,' using local stakes.
But he stresses that many banks have made too many mistakes by expanding
abroad. 'Our main strength is domestic,' he says. 'We will continue to
develop our international network, but not too fast.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (8): The Matif
success story - Andrew Jack talks to the chairman of the financial futures
exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Matif, the French financial futures exchange, was a quoted company, its
shares would have been unlikely to have suffered as much as many on the
malaise-ridden national markets over the last few months.
The marche a terme international de France (Matif) began operating in
February 1986, the result of a law passed in the previous year as part of a
wide-ranging series of liberalisation measures designed to modernise the
French capital markets.
During 1993, the last full year for which information is available, it had
grown to a point at which more than 72m contracts were exchanged - with
trading volumes up more than 30 per cent on the previous 12 months. Net
banking income jumped by 7 per cent to FFr606m, and total assets stood at
FFr11.19bn.
But Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman, sees no reason to blush at the apparent
embarrassment of riches. 'We have to guarantee every trade and we are a
clearing house so we need assets like every insurance company to ensure our
guarantee is as good as gold,' he says.
He also points out that much of the money has been reinvested: in a new
trading floor opened this autumn, in a new registration system, in
developing new markets and products, and in a wide range of other
technological and strategic innovations.
However, the profitability of Matif has certainly triggered some
frustrations among those who cannot share the spoils. It was created as a
unique tripartite initiative, a corporate entity with the shareholders
equally split between banks, brokers and insurance companies. Now some of
those who did not originally take part are calling for a share of the
equity.
There is another potential problem with Matif's heady expansion. Much of the
growth has come from demand in other countries. At the end of 1993,
non-residents' share of open positions on the market was substantial: 42 per
cent on the notional contract, and up to 83 per cent for the Ecu long bond,
for example.
This partly reflects the organisation's success in its increasingly
aggressive international marketing campaign - with recent presentations in
countries including the US and UK. But it may also present future
challenges, and reflects the relative weakness of French domestic markets to
use financial derivatives to a greater extent.
Sit down to chat with Mr Pfauwadel and it is difficult to get him to stop.
'I can talk for 24 hours,' he says. 'I love this job.' It is one he is well
suited for. In effect, he has been forced to swallow his own medicine, as
the deputy under-secretary at the French treasury who drafted the laws in
1985 that still dictate the framework within which Matif operates.
Mr Pfauwadel says the organisation was developed 'in French style': largely
through the work of civil servants, who were not suspicious of the market,
but in fact extremely keen to develop an efficient, workable futures
exchange to modernise the country's capital markets and compete with those
in other countries.
The result is that he sees no need for great changes to the law. Nor does he
see the need for enormous restructuring of the services currently provided.
After rapid growth in its first eight years, Mr Pfauwadel looks more on the
next few as being primarily time for consolidation of existing strategies.
Matif has developed a series of new financial products, and now offers long,
medium and short-term interest rate contracts; stock index futures on the
Paris bourse's CAC 40; and currency options; as well as commodity contracts
in white sugar and potatoes.
Now Mr Pfauwadel believes that most products for which there is currently
demand are catered for. 'It is becoming more difficult to innovate,' he
says. However, he argues that there may be scope still in commodities -
notably agriculture, in a reflection of France's strength in the sector.
So, at the end of October Matif launched a rapeseed futures market, two
years after the European price of the product was wrested from the control
of civil servants in Brussels. As other commodities such as wheat are
liberalised, Mr Pfauwadel believes there may be scope to provide futures in
these crops too.
Not all have been so successful, however. Matif has had to abandon several
of its financial contracts, and has also had to close its commodity futures
in coffee and cocoa, for example. However, Mr Pfauwadel says he is in no
hurry to look for quick returns on rapeseed, and stresses that providing new
services is far more important than generating a profit in the short to
medium term.
An arguably more significant set of new developments is in expanding the
range of products available by connections to other exchanges.
Traditionally, Matif has been an 'open outcry' market, with deals done by
traders on a physical floor. However, Mr Pfauwadel is far from dogmatic
about this approach continuing to dominate in the future.
In 1993, Matif members gained access to Globex, the 24-hour screen-based
electronic trading system developed by Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, and which now accounts for an estimated 80 per cent of its total
volumes.
At least equally important, at the end of the same year, it signed a
co-operation agreement with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) in Frankfurt, its
opposite number. This allows members to trade electronically in two German
products. Reciprocally, two French products will be available within the
next few months.
If all goes well, new products will be developed in both directions, and a
clearing system between the two exchanges put in place by the end of next
year. Mr Pfauwadel says he is already in discussions with his equivalents in
other European countries to do the same: notably the Dutch, Spaniards and
Swiss.
One country is strikingly absent from the list: the UK, represented by its
London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). Mr Pfauwadel says
he approached the market before going to the Germans, but officials refused
to take part.
'The British have another strategy,' he says. 'They want an open outcry
system, with a big market in the City to quote all European products. It is
in conflict with our strategy to develop a domestic niche and link to other
exchanges by a network.'
It may be that these two different and opposing approaches which, more than
anything, set the tone for the competition for the markets for futures and
options across Europe over the next few years.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (8): Visitors are spending less / A look at
tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusually warm autumn and a rush to the Aegean by eastern Europeans
should add up to a record year for Greece's tourist industry. According to
several projections, arrivals in 1994 will reach almost 11m.
The region with highest growth was Halkidiki in northern Greece where the
number of summer visitors grew by 54 per cent to 485,000 and hotel occupancy
rates approached 90 per cent.
Yet two years ago, local hoteliers worried about being driven out of
business by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the main source of
tourists to northern Greece.
Thanks to an energetic promotion campaign by the Halkidiki hoteliers' union,
charter flights filled with British, German and Russian tourists have
replaced the streams of Yugoslav cars heading south to Thessaloniki.
However, improved occupancy rates this year brought little consolation to
hoteliers elsewhere in the country. Greece has 6,500 hotels with 235,000
beds, but many of these are family-owned operations with fewer than 100 beds
each and have little margin for bargaining with the international tour
operators who dominate the market.
'We're squeezed on room prices so we rely on the bar and other extras for
earnings,' says a hotelier on Rhodes. 'But the northern Europeans are more
careful with their money now - they're not drinking whiskies by the pool.'
The state development bank, ETVA, recently agreed to reschedule about
Dr100bn in debts owed by 700 hoteliers following the government's refusal to
subsidise interest rates on outstanding hotel loans. According to some
estimates, about 20 per cent of Greece's hotel stock is up for sale.
Another reason for the hotel industry's problems is that Greece has become a
'sun and sea' market for package tourism rather than an exotic destination
for better-off visitors looking for ancient sites and traditional village
life and tourism earnings have failed to keep pace with the increase in
numbers.
Tourist arrivals rose from 5.2m in 1983 to 9.9m in 1993, while revenues grew
from Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 6bn during the same period. But the average
European tourist spent less than Dollars 250 in Greece last year, compared
with about Dollars 350 a decade ago.
'The tourist season is only six months long. Revenues would be much higher
if it could be extended by providing more sports and entertainment
facilities for visitors,' says Vassilis Avramopoulos, an adviser to the
tourism ministry on foreign investment.
The government's plans for moving Greece's tourist industry upmarket are
based on the creation of resort complexes that will include casinos. Last
month, the tourism ministry awarded four casino licences to international
gaming operators for a total of Dr13.2bn.
Another six licences, including two in the Athens area and others on Rhodes,
Crete and Corfu, are to be granted in the next two months.
Hyatt Casino Corporation, the gaming arm of the US hotel chain, paid Dr9.2bn
for a 12-year licence to build and operate a casino resort on a greenfield
site outside Thessaloniki. The Dollars 120m investment will include a
120-bed luxury hotel, a conference centre and a park.
Hyatt is also bidding for one of the Athens licences, which are valued at
about Dr10bn each, while London Clubs, the UK casino operator, is a
frontrunner for the second licence, which would involve the building of a
luxury hotel, marina and park on the sea-front near Piraeus.
'The casino projects will do much to upgrade Greek tourism over the next
five years by setting higher standards of accommodation and entertainment in
the main tourist areas,' says Christos Vlachos of Eurofin, an investment
consultancy.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (10): Slow to catch on - Spending on R&amp;D is
low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few Greek companies make research and development a priority. Most
prefer to pay royalties on imported technology.
Greece lags far behind its European Union partners in R&amp;D, spending only 0.4
per cent of gross domestic product on research, compared to an average of
2.5 per cent in northern European countries.
The lack of opportunity at home drives Greek research students abroad,
usually for good. There are now more than 5,000 Greek researchers working
permanently in western Europe and the US.
Nikos Christodoulakis, head of the Greek government's research secretariat,
believes this will change. The catalyst, he says, will be increased funding
for science and technology from the EU's new structural aid package,
amounting to Ecu150m over the next three years.
'We want to raise research spending to 1 per cent of GDP by the end of the
1990s and fund several hundred more researchers here in Greece,' he says.
In the past decade the number of government-backed research operations,
including new research centres, technology development companies in
different sectors and technology parks, has grown from 114 to 270.
But technology parks attract relatively few applicants, while private
companies show little interest in co-operating with the development
companies.
Mr Christodoulakis is trying to link companies directly with researchers in
order to work on specific projects. From next year, companies joining in the
programme will contribute an average Dr5m over three years, with additional
funding for small teams of in-house researchers coming from the government.
'There's no doubt that we have the talent. Greece handles over 3 per cent of
the EU's competitive R&amp;D programmes, though it has only 0.6 per cent of the
union's research population,' he says.
The scheme is attracting more participants than expected, as Greek companies
start looking for ways to remain competitive in the single market
One of the biggest research spenders is Econ Industries, an electronics and
precision components manufacturer, which allocates 10 per cent of its Dr20bn
turnover on R&amp;D.
After rapid expansion in the late 1980s, the result of winning co-production
work in offset deals linked with Greek government weapons contracts, the
company wants to diversify.
'We do well out of retro-fit kits to upgrade Greek army tanks, and we have
an export market for our power amplifiers and night vision equipment but our
growth prospects are better in the civilian market,' says Dimitrios
Economides, managing director.
Econ's night vision camera, originally designed for military use is being
adapted both for civilian electronic surveillance and security systems and
for use on yachts.
Alex Economides, Econ's plant manager, says: 'To stay competitive, we have
to design our own electronic products and devise something new every year.
But as there are few jobs at home for Greek optical engineers, we have a
very high quality workforce.'
But the market for research in Greece is limited. In northern Greece, the
Adhesives Research Institute, the research arm of ACM Wood Chemicals, a
Greek-owned company based in Switzerland with manufacturing ventures in
Canada and Belgium, provides technology almost exclusively for export.
ARI has found a way of eliminating formaldehyde emissions, increasingly seen
as hazardous to health, from resins and additives used in making particle
board and other wood products.
But its products are not in demand in Greece, where timber processors are
not required by law to limit formaldehyde emissions and export mainly to
countries without strict environmental controls.
ARI makes cost savings through being based in Thessaloniki, where
researchers' salaries are lower than in western Europe. Through its parent
company, it develops close relationships with customers abroad to make up
for the lack of interest among local maufacturers.
Pavlos Mouratides, assistant head of research, says: 'We cooperate with some
local manufacturers in testing our products, but they don't go into regular
production.'

Kallithea, a noisy middle-class Athenian district of apartment blocks and
small businesses, is the site of what Citibank executives call their banking
laboratory.
Citibank's Kallithea branch, one of 18 around the Greek capital, is the
model for developing the US bank's consumer operations worldwide. Its
know-how is now being transferred to Hungary, where Citibank will become the
first international bank to enter the retail market.
Avul Vohra, general manager for consumer banking in Hungary, says: 'We
expect to follow the pattern of Greece, because of some basic similarities
in the market. Like Greece, Hungary is a cash society with a large number of
small businesses.'
Citibank's first consumer branch in Hungary will open next spring in
Budapest, where the bank already has a sizeable corporate presence. The
consumer network is expected to grow to five branches within three years.
The bank's new Hungarian staff have had training in Greece using systems
developed in Athens for the local market. The Hungarian network will also be
supervised from Greece and linked with Citibank's technology platform for
Europe, based in Germany.
Mr Vohra says: 'We're introducing 1995 technology for customers right away
and combining it with local needs.'
Citibank intends to offer its Hungarian customers a savings and checking
account, to be followed by credit cards and investment products, also on the
Greek model.
The Kallithea branch has pioneered new electronic services such as 24-hour
telephone banking and paperless deposits and withdrawals, which will be
available in Budapest.
'As one of the bank's most successful operations abroad, Greece was a
suitable place for experimenting. We had lots of resources and a very
committed staff,' says Sophie Palimeri, business manager for consumer
banking.
Citibank has the largest operation of any foreign bank in Greece, with
assets of Dr540bn and extensive shipping finance and investment banking
activities.
In Kallithea, where the branch caters to small depositors and local
businesses, the number of accounts has increased by 20 per cent since the
new services were launched.
Traffic through the branch has also increased by 20 per cent since it was
redesigned to eliminate queues by providing a 'greeting' service to
customers and making account officers more accessible.
Circe Psychogiou, branch manager, says: 'The day we re-opened after the
changeover, the customers looked quite bemused. But it changed the quality
of the relationships: everyone's much more polite.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (7): Privatisation
spurs share ownership / A look at the progress of the government's ambitious
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bureaucrats at Bercy, the economics and finance ministry in eastern
Paris, have reason to be satisfied with the progress of the French
government's ambitious privatisation programme.
Since Banque Nationale de Paris was dispatched to the private sector in the
autumn of last year, the plan to sell all or part of 21 public sector groups
has advanced smoothly. Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Elf Aquitaine,
the oil company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurer, have
followed BNP into private hands, netting the state a cool FFr94.4bn in
receipts.
The successful start to the programme has important implications. In
addition to boosting the government's coffers - a vital element in its
budget deficit reduction strategy - the sales of state companies have also
spurred private share ownership. A survey sponsored by the Bank of France
and the COB, the stock exchange watchdog, shows that privatisations have
pushed the number of private shareholders in France from 4.5m in 1992 to
5.7m this year.
The revenues, and public interest, are set to continue - for the time being
at least. The partial privatisation of Renault, one of the state's most
attractive assets, is nearing completion. Aimed at the public, the sale of
almost 40 per cent of the capital of the motor group is expected further to
boost popular share ownership. In so doing, it should bring the government a
further FFr8bn or so in receipts.
After Renault, however, the process of privatisation is likely to become
more delicate, and more complex. For 1995, as for this year, the government
has set a target of FFr55bn for privatisation receipts. But with many of the
more attractive assets already sold, and with the stock market in the
doldrums, it faces a challenge in maintaining the momentum of its
privatisation drive.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, is taking steps to prepare the
next candidates for sale. He has launched the process of selecting adviser
banks for the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly which
manufactures such famous brands as Gitanes and Gauloises.
Two insurance groups, Assurance Generales de France, and Caisse Nationale de
Prevoyance, are both primed for sale, although the latter is expected to
remain majority controlled by the French state.
The minister has said that he is keen to privatise AGF as soon as possible.
But the operation is complicated by the sharp fall in insurance shares this
year which has resulted from the decline in bond prices and the consequent
impact on the portfolios of insurance groups. AGF, for example, has seen its
share price tumble by more than 35 per cent since the beginning of January.
For the French government, this poses a dilemma. 'They want to sell AGF, but
cannot be seen to flogging off the silverware too cheaply,' says one
industry observer. The partial privatisation of CNP is similarly affected by
the depressed state of the insurance sector.
Such considerations help explain the moves to prepare for a sale of Seita.
But in terms of revenues, it is a less lucrative operation. The expected
receipts from the sale of the tobacco group, however, which are estimated at
about FFr6bn, pale beside the FFr20bn which could come from selling the
government's 65 per cent holding in AGF and the receipts from the first
batch of privatisations. Elf alone brought FFr35bn to the state's coffers.
Beyond the immediate candidates, there are also complications. Many of the
larger companies left in the state's corporate portfolio are in need of
significant restructuring before they can be offered to private investors.
Credit Lyonnais and Air France, for example, continue to incur substantial
losses. Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steel producer, has burst back into
the black after a net deficit of FFr5.7bn last year, but must still reduce
its debt burden of FFr20bn before it can be sold.
An added headache as the government ponders the next steps in its
privatisation programme relates to the weakness of the stock market. The
decline in insurance shares, although dramatic, comes against a background
of depression on the Paris bourse. The CAC 40 index of leading shares has
fallen by about 20 per cent this year as interest rates have headed upwards.
As a consequence, all of the privatisation issues, with the exception of
BNP, are trading below their issue price.
'The decline in share prices is likely to dampen investor enthusiasm for new
issues,' says one Paris stockbroker. 'There are many competing alternatives
for their savings which they may find more attractive.' One such is a new
scheme which allows individuals to buy directly 10-year government bonds.
With yields of about 7.5 per cent, they are proving highly popular.
Despite these various challenges, however, the government is optimistic
about the future prospects for its privatisation plans. Officials cite the
strong demand that the issues have received from individual, institutional
and industrial investors and claim that the weakness of the stock market
raises the prospect of a strong upswing and hence increased incentives for
investors.
They add that the recovery in the French economy, which has revived much
more dynamically than forecast and is due to grow by 3.1 per cent next year,
should ease the process of restructuring for many of the privatisation
candidates. 'We will get them in shape for sale,' says one official at the
industry ministry. 'Look at how Renault was transformed from a big
loss-maker over recent years.'
Such transformations, however, take time. The ability of many of the lame
ducks of the public sector to turn themselves into swans, and the course of
the French and international financial markets over the next few months,
will determine whether the government has enough time to achieve its
privatisation objectives.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (5): Time is running out - Relations with
the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece is used to its near-traditional role as both the bete noire and the
enfant terrible of the European Union. In the economic field, it is the
state furthest away from the meeting the 'convergence criteria' determining
members' readiness for economic and monetary union at the end of the
century.
During the 1980s, Greece differed sharply from Spain and Portugal by
suffering a continued fall in prosperity compared with its European
partners. In foreign policy, Greece has frequently angered the rest of the
EU over its intransigent position on the recognition of neighbouring
Yugoslavia. During the summer, Greece was dogged by a series of problems
over disbursement of EU funds earmarked for much-needed infrastructure
projects.
At the root of Greece's fraught relationship with the rest of the EU lies
the task of achieving better economic convergence with the rest of Europe.
The Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou is dependent on funding from
Brussels to ease budget revenue shortfalls caused by the sluggish state of
the economy. However, hopes faded soon after his return to power in October
1993 that Mr Papandreou would bring in urgent action to correct the
country's economic imbalances.
Formal EU monitoring of the Greek economy, put into place in 1991 after the
granting of a loan from Brussels to shore up the balance of payments, has
now lapsed, so the EU has no clear-cut lever to set conditions for the
disbursement of Brussels largesse. However, annual transfers from the EU
make up roughly 5 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product, so the Athens
government is clearly vulnerable to vexation in the rest of the EU that it
is not living up to standards of economic policy prudence.
Greece is not the only EU country to have overshot earlier targets to bring
down budget deficits. But its wayward economic record often results in its
forecasts of improvement - particularly in the budgetary field - being
treated with more than usual scepticism.
Projections of increased fiscal revenue have proved grossly over-optimistic
in recent years - one reason why the government's hopes of holding its
budget deficit to a mere 10.4 per cent of GDP this year have been widely
disbelieved. However, a new tax law aimed at reducing VAT evasion, combined
with a generous settlement system for disputes involving back tax, has
resulted in better than expected tax receipts this year.
More than any other EU member, Greece remains beset by stagflation. At a
time when the EU inflation average has fallen to 3 per cent, the Greek
inflation rate is still about 12 per cent - and no lasting economic recovery
is expected until 1996. While this degree of divergence persists, bringing
the drachma into a formal exchange rate link to the European Monetary System
will remain a pipe dream.
As for the long-term goal of economic and monetary union, it is evident that
countries in eastern and central Europe are far more likely than Greece to
join a de facto European D-Mark zone later in the 1990s.
Indeed, a chief strategic worry for the Athens government must be that, as
the EU's centre of gravity moves to the north and east, the attitude of its
partners towards economically divergent southern states will become steadily
frostier.
That could spell problems for Greece as the rules for disbursements of
structural funds for poorer states are redrawn later in the 1990s. Present
structural fund arrangements run until 1999. But in view of the likelihood
that new members from central and eastern Europe will be competing for
funding early in the next century, later conditions for distributing EU
funds are likely to be much more stringent. Time for Greece to put its
economic house in order has not yet run out. But by the end of the century,
it may have done.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (7): Currency crisis triggers losses / A
look at the banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek banking profits will shrink this year because of a three-week currency
crisis, triggered by the removal last May of all remaining exchange
controls.
The drachma's struggle to fend off devaluation also revealed the mutual
dependence between the big state banks which dominate the banking market and
the finance ministry.
National Bank, the biggest state-owned bank, raised short-term interest
rates above 70 per cent during the crisis to help protect the currency.
One banker said: 'The fact that the finance ministry can use the big state
banks as a policy tool meant the drachma could resist speculative attack.
But it weakens the banking system.'
Estimates for the banks' total losses from the currency crisis vary from
Dr70bn to more than Dr100bn. Last year, net profits at Greece's top 10 banks
rose by 14 per cent to Dr130bn. This year's projection has been revised
downwards from 15 to about 8 per cent.
'The banking system as a whole lost money in the crisis because it couldn't
pass on high interest costs and couldn't protect its funding base,' a Greek
banker said.
It was not just the state banks' willingness to raise interest rates to
record levels that enabled the drachma to ride out the crisis unscathed.
The small size of Greece's mortgage lending market made it possible to
sustain such high rates over a longer period. Total mortgage loans, mainly
handled by two specialist subsidiaries of National Bank, are estimated at
less than Dr1,000bn.
Consumer lending, mostly in the hands of small new private banks is also
underdeveloped. The market received a boost a few weeks before the crisis,
when the ceiling on consumer loans was raised to Dr8m, only to collapse when
interest rates rose sharply.
'The small private banks did better when the currency was under attack
because they have a drachma surplus. But mortgage and consumer lending
suffered a real setback,' says Stathis Papageorgiou, managing director of
Aspis Bank, a new private bank that specialises in mortgage lending.
The central bank rewarded the banks for their part in defending the drachma
by paying interest for six months on the interest-free portion of their
compulsory reserve requirement.
But the banks, which have big holdings of tax-free treasury bills, the main
debt instrument, also benefited from a surge in interest rates on government
paper in May and June, aimed at preventing a flight of capital.
Interest rates have since dropped almost to pre-crisis levels. Nevertheless,
the squeeze on lending continues, with many banks still reluctant to take on
new borrowers or extend additional credit to existing clients.
The tight relationship between the government and the big state banks, whose
governors were directly appointed by the ruling socialists, accounts for the
state banks' readiness to acquire extra government securities when
requested.
Thanks to their help, the finance ministry has avoided rescheduling part of
the public debt.
The big state banks agreed to underwrite about Dr600bn of Dr1,300bn needed
last month to cover a hump in debt financing, in return for increased
commissions.
National Bank is being paid off for its role during the drachma crisis by
becoming lead underwriter for future government bond issues, which could add
more than Dr10bn to its 1994 earnings.
'Much of the banking system operates for the benefit of the government
rather than the private borrower,' says one local analyst.
While the state banks control 73 per cent of total deposits, they account
for only 60 per cent of lending. By contrast, the private banks control just
16.5 per cent of deposits but cover 18.4 per cent of lending.
The state banks' role in lending is in fact much smaller, given that a high
percentage of their portfolio consists of non-performing loans. For example,
some Dr900bn of National Bank's Dr1,400bn loan book is said to consist of
doubtful loans, the result of years of lending on political not banking
criteria.
Not suprisingly, their market share is shrinking as Greeks turn to the more
efficient private banks.
Both Credit Bank and Ergobank, the country's two largest private banks are
expanding aggressively, opening new branches, investing heavily in new
technology and improving their retail products.
National Bank's share of Greek deposits has fallen from 50 to 40 per cent in
the past five years. While total deposits doubled in the same period, the
state banks' share declined by 7 percentage points.
Smaller state banks need fresh capital and better management. Investors'
appetites have sharpened with the successful privatisation of three small
state banks under the previous conservative government.
Nevertheless the government seems reluctant to make state banks more
competitive. For example, Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, is
to retain control of Ionian Bank by taking up its full share of a Dr20bn
rights issue planned for early next year.
Ionian was cleaning up its balance sheet, increasing provisions for doubtful
loans, preparing to sell its hotel subsidiary and launching new products
with the aim of attracting an outside investor.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (6): Banks breathe a sigh of relief /
Profile of Loukas Papademos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle lines were already drawn when Loukas Papademos took over last
month as Greece's central bank governor. Mr Papademos, 46, found himself
unexpectedly promoted from deputy governor to replace Yannis Boutos, a
political appointee who ran the Bank of Greece for less than a year.
Mr Boutos, a former economy minister, was sacked by the governing socialists
in a dispute over privatising the Bank of Crete, controlled by the central
bank since a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal was uncovered there in 1988.
Greece's banking community breathed a collective sigh of relief when Mr
Papademos's appointment was announced.
A former Columbia University economics professor who joined the central bank
a decade ago as a macro-economic adviser, he has remained aloof from the
quarrels souring relations between the bank and government policy-makers in
recent years.
Mr Papademos agrees with the economy ministry on expediting the Bank of
Crete disposal, by splitting off its non-performing assets and offering the
remainder, including an extensive branch network, for sale. The bank moved
into the red last year, posting losses of Dr1.2bn, and concern is growing
over a rising percentage of bad loans.
More difficult is the task of persuading the finance ministry, burdened with
funding a rising public debt, that it cannot afford more than a marginal
decline in interest rates on government paper if the drachma is to remain
stable. As recession continues, some socialist officials are pressing for
substantial interest rate cuts in the next few months.
Mr Papademos says firmly that the course of interest rates 'must depend on
inflation developments, conditions in foreign exchange markets and progress
in meeting monetary targets'.
As the architect of the central bank's successful defence of the drachma
following the removal of capital controls last May, Mr Papademos's views
should carry considerable weight.
To deter speculative attacks on the currency, short-term interest rates were
raised to high levels, while the Bank of Greece controlled liquidity by
auctioning drachmas to commercial banks in return for foreign exchange.
Mr Papademos is well aware that a smooth relationship between the central
bank and the finance ministry, which sets interest rates on treasury bills
and recently assumed overall responsibility for debt management, is crucial
to maintaining confidence in the drachma.
He points out that the cost of financing Greece's public debt could be
reduced by developing the market in government securities 'introducing
auctions of treasury bills and promoting a secondary market in government
paper'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (6): The banks'
scars begin to heal - After the difficulties of the past few months,
prospects are brighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the storm, the calm. Prospects are beginning to improve for French
banks as they digest the difficulties of the last few months and raise their
eyes to look towards the rather hazy future ahead.
It has not been an easy time for the sector. The latest set of results in
the last few weeks still show some of the scars caused by turmoil in the
cap- ital markets and the overhang of enormous property and bad debt
provisions following extravagant lending turned sour.
One of the low points of 1994 - without which no com- mentary on the sector
would be complete - refers to the continuing saga of Credit Lyonnais, the
embattled state-controlled banking group, which has been hit by one piece of
bad publicity after another.
Its rival banks - many now in the private sector - have looked on with some
annoyance at the additional state support provided without much evidence so
far of a particularly aggressive strategy to sell any of the more profitable
or core parts of the bank.
However, most grudgingly admit that Mr Jean Peyrel- evade, the chairman
appointed by the state last November in place of Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, has
played a shrewd political game in his efforts to nurse the bank towards
recovery.
In a battle that became public at the end of September this year, the bank
was forced to delay publication of its half-year results as a dispute raged
between its directors, the auditors, the treasury and the banking commission
over the size of provisions necessary to cover past losses.
It finally reported losses of FFr4.5bn for the first six months of the year,
and an additional FFr10.1bn in provisions - on top of losses for 1993
announced in March of FFr6.9bn, a ring-fenced property portfolio of FFr40bn
underwritten by the state, and a recapitalisation over the summer.
Substantial further provisions are likely, and - while stressing that
everything must done in the right order, starting with a detailed
justification of the provisions that will be necessary - the government
seems set ultimately to provide the support to keep the bank solvent. That
has helped start to boost the price of its non-voting certificats
d'investissement, its only traded shares, albeit from a record low.
Elsewhere across the sector, analysts are more confident. 'The first half
figures have got the banks off to a nice beginning,' says Ms Sheila Garrard,
an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. 'Their two big problems were real
estate lending and the small and medium-sized companies.'
She argues that 'things have stopped getting any worse' regarding
provisions, while economic recovery in France should begin to make loans to
companies more stable again from the start of next year.
Mr Jean Sassus, an analyst with Societe Generale in Paris, says: 'Things are
not bad at all. European banks have not suffered from the drop people
expected because of the decline in capital markets business.'
The primary reason, he argues, is that most banks 'dramatically
over-provided' in 1993 on their loan losses. They were then able to feed
back the provisions against their capital markets activities, which
inevitably dropped back this year after an extremely profitable but
exceptional previous few months.
'One of the advantages of universal banking is that you cannot lose at the
same time in every business. The investor is quite sure they will get a
dividend,' he says.
One outstanding challenge for the banks is to continue to cut costs -
particularly through staffing reductions. Unlike the dramatic job losses in
a short period in the UK and US, in France the process has been moderated by
sensitivities to unions and employment legislation.
But reducing costs is not the only challenge. 'The big question-mark is:
where is the revenue going to come from?' says Ms Garrard. 'It's much
tougher and there is no obvious area that the banks can develop that they
are not working on already.'
One battle that the banks seem to have won is for the sale of life
assurance. Their existing customer base and wide retail network has allowed
them to dominate the market in the face of competition from the insurance
companies when handling effectively a simple savings product.
This diversification of activity is set to continue, with international
growth and capital markets expansion being high up the list. Credit
Lyonnais, for example, remains committed to the high-cost, long-term
strategy of building a strong retail branch network across Europe.
Mr Sassus says the future for banks lies in the provision of more
value-added services such as asset management, capital markets and possibly
a battle for control of pension funds as the French industry begins to
develop over the next few years.
Certainly Mr Marc Vienot, head of Societe Generale, says: 'I am personally
totally convinced about the role of capital markets. Derivatives will
continue to develop with or without international supervision.'
Equally, Ms Garrard sees the scope for greater packaging of financial
products, with banks beginning to start charging more systematically for
services provided to customers.
Meanwhile, banks need to face changes to the distribution systems of their
products. In late September, Paribas launched a telephone banking service
amid much publicity, modelled along the lines of the success of the similar
provision in the UK.
This may herald an important trend for the future, although rival banks have
been keen to point out the existence of their own long-standing equivalents
 -not least the services accessible through Minitel, the computer
information network available by phone to every French household.
More controversially, Mr Sassus suggests there is still scope for reform of
current French legislation, which prevents banks paying interest on current
accounts. The traditional fear has been that this may cause inflationary
pressure, and that the corresponding increase in charges on accounts will
act against the interests of customers on lower incomes. 'That really would
change the banking landscape,' he says.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (5): Strains start
to show - Pensions reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For French financial markets, there are few issues more important over the
next few decades, or more sensitive, than the future of the country's
pensions system.
The burden of an ageing population is placing a strain on the present
pay-as-you-go system, whereby the pensions of today's retirees are paid by
contributions from the active workforce. Reform of the system, and the
possible creation of capitalised pension funds, promise a significant boost
to the French stock market, the venture capital industry and to long-term
savings. The implications are profound, ranging from improved financing for
industry, to the reshaping of France's brand of capitalism.
The problem is that reform also promises a welter of complications, from
opposition from trade union groups to disputes between banks and insurance
companies about how new schemes should be structured, and to the
government's concern not to stifle consumption. As a result, the
centre-right administration is treading cautiously on the issue. Legislation
on the pension fund reform, due originally in the first half of this year,
and then this autumn, now appears unlikely before next spring's presidential
elections.
The needs of France's social security system, however, and of its financial
markets, suggest that some steps will have to be taken. 'At the end of the
day we need capitalised pension products to help strengthen our financial
system and to respond to demographic pressures,' says Mr Alain Leclair,
deputy president of asset management at Banque Paribas.
The demographic pressures are clear. France's ageing population means that
the proportion of over-60s will increase from about 20 per cent of the
population today to about 27 per cent in 2020 and one-third in 2050. 'This
may seem like a long-term problem, but the younger generation are already
finding it hard to finance the retirement of the older,' says an executive
at one French insurance company.
The strains have prompted a series of reforms to the existing system. Mrs
Simone Veil, the minister for social affairs, has eased the burden on the
pay-as-you-go scheme by extending the period of contributions from 37.5
years to 40 years and increasing the number of best-paid years on which
pension payments are calculated, hence reducing the average.
Separately, Mr Alain Madelin, the minister for enterprises and economic
development, has introduced a reform which provides tax incentives for
artisans and independent workers who invest in private pension schemes. The
law, passed through parliament in the summer, has recently taken effect.
Mrs Veil's measures have already had an impact. 'The deficit under the
existing system seemed set to reach about FFr300bn by the year 2020,' says
one pensions expert at a French merchant bank. 'It now seems more likely to
be in the region of FFr100bn by that date.'
It is still, however, a big gap. Proponents of pensions reform argue that
the case for the creation of capitalised pension funds is further buttressed
by the potential benefits to industry and financial markets.
The Patronat employers' federation, for example, is urging the creation of
pension funds which can be managed by the companies themselves and used to
buttress their balance sheets. Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the finance
committee in the national assembly and a champion of pensions reform,
recommends that banks, insurance companies and individual businesses should
get incentives to establish pension funds and that at least half of employee
contributions should be invested in their own companies.
The French government has itself emphasised the potential benefits of
reform. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has claimed that the
development of capitalised pension funds would represent a significant boost
for the Paris Bourse. 'As long as important privatisations are in the
pipeline, we need funds that have a majority of their holdings in shares,'
he said.
Some industry observers see the potential for a further important change in
French capitalism. By creating powerful pension funds, like those in Britain
and the US, French companies would be less dependent on cross-shareholdings
with other businesses in their search for stable investors. 'Obviously such
a change does not take place overnight,' says one analyst at a securities
company in Paris. 'But pension funds could provide the answer to the
perennial French problem of capitalism without capital.'
The government's willingness to act and the prospects for the various
proposals hinge on political considerations. Reform of the pension system is
a sensitive subject and with presidential elections less than seven months
away, the administration is now demonstrating caution.
French trade unions, which are represented in the management of the existing
system, oppose reform. 'It is a policy that would benefit the rich. It is
they who can afford to pay for a supplementary scheme and get the tax
deductions to do so,' says an official at the Confederation Generale du
Travial, the communist-led union organisation.
Mr Marc Blondel, the general secretary of Force Ouvriere, a more moderate
union, advances both social and economic arguments against the formation of
capitalised pension funds. 'Reform would end the solidarity between age
groups and social classes . . . it would put a brake on economic recovery,'
he says, pointing to the dampening effects it might have on consumption.
For most observers, the sensitivity of the subject and the potentially
complex nature of reforms suggest that reforms must await the presidential
polls. 'The idea may appear to have lost some of its urgency,' says one
insurance executive. 'But it is a vital issue which cannot be put into
retirement.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (4): Alliance a risky business - Greek
joint ventures with eastern European shippers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE BRIGGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's largest tug, now working out of Piraeus, recently hoisted the
Russian flag to mark the end of an 18-month dispute with Tsavliris, the
Greek shipping group that specialises in salvage and towing.
The quarrel over the Tsavliris Giant - now the Fotiykrylov - says much about
the risks faced by Greek shipowners in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
Tsavliris chartered the tug and its sister vessel, which had both belonged
to the Russian navy, from a Maltese company. But Russian authorities later
claimed the tugs were illegally registered in Malta and demanded them back.
Now they are being operated by Tsavliris-Russ, a Cyprus-based joint venture
between the Greek group and the Russian navy, managed by Tsvaliris.
Several Greek shipowners have formed joint ventures with shipping concerns
in Romania and the former Soviet Union, or are managing ships chartered from
them on a bareboat basis.
Shipyards in eastern Europe have more than 60 ships under construction, on
order or with options pending for Greek owners. Ex-Soviet seamen are also in
demand among Greek operators. 'Ex-Soviet crews had 12 years' training, so
they're more skilled than most seamen. The disadvantage is that they don't
have a lot of initiative,' says one analyst.
Greek shipowners' interest in Romania sharpened in 1990 after the collapse
of communism, as much of the country's large commercial fleet had been laid
up under the Ceausescu regime. However, several Greek ventures in Romania
have run into trouble.
Forum Maritime's controversial attempt last year to acquire 51 per cent of
Petromin, the state-owned Romanian tanker and bulk carrier company, came
close to bringing down the Romanian government. The Dollars 335m deal,
billed as the largest investment to date in eastern Europe, fell through
following objections by the Romanian Development Agency, the country's
investment watchdog and other state organisations, over financing
arrangements.
Minerva Maritime - a joint venture set up by Petromin and a Greek owner,
John Alafouzos to manage and operate 10 vessels - came close to being
dissolved this year amid claims that funds were mismanaged. Four Petromin
officials involved in making over vessels to the joint venture were jailed
on charges of illegally exporting Romanian assets.
Greek owners involved in charter and management deals with eastern European
shipping concerns complain that their partners lack market know-how. The
eastern Europeans fear they may be outmanoeuvred by their Greek partners.
Most joint venture agreements involve a cash investment by the Greek side to
upgrade eastern European ships to market standard, to be recovered out of
operating profits.
Yet despite the prickly relationships, the joint ventures offer
opportunities for making a quick return. They provide available tonnage
which can be upgraded at a fraction of the cost of buying modern second-hand
vessels and much faster than it would take to order and build a new ship.
On the shipbuilding side, low labour costs at eastern European yards help
make prices competitive. The Vardinoyannis group is building nine 45,000 DWT
tankers at the Chernomorsky yard at Nikolayev in the Ukraine at a cost of
Dollars 270m. Discussions are under way on extending the series to 24
vessels.
The Laskarides group, which operates specialises in refrigated tonnage, is
building 17 vessels at another yard in Nikolayev. There is no price tag for
the ships, since specialised equipment is ordered from western suppliers and
paid for by the shipowners.
Eletson Corporation, which recently ordered a series of product carriers to
be built at Newport News Shipbuilding in the US, is building three 68,000
DWT tankers on behalf of an associated company at a price of Dollars 34-36m
each.
East European yards have difficulty in financing equipment and material
purchases, while they may also require expert assistance in building to high
specifications. Greek owners have the flexibility to provide both where
needed.
Blue Flag Navigation has a 30-member team of experts based at Romanian yards
where it is building 15 sophisticated vessels, inluding chemical, products
and bulk carriers.
Greek owners have also been able to take advantage of failed order at
eastern European yards. Two months ago, Enterprises Shipping and Trading
took over a collapsed deal at Poland's Gdansk yard from Latvian Shipping
Company.
Enterprises was able to pick up the contract for two high-specification
400,000 cubic foot reefers at a considerable discount, paying Dollars 23m
instead of Dollars 28m for each ship.
One of the biggest commitments to the eastern European market has been made
by Sumo Trust, set up as the shipowning and management arm of the Manley
Hopkins, the UK-based shipping services group.
The company started by financing and upgrading seven Petromin ships at a
cost of Dollars 15m. It is now building seven river and ocean-going products
tankers in Bulgaria, to be chartered by Russia's Volga Tankers, and has a
joint venture with Azov Shipping Company of the Ukraine.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (2): Walking the economic tightrope -
Meeting targets on reducing inflation and the budget deficit is vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's budget planners are well aware that 1995 will be a decisive year
for the economy. If targets on reducing inflation and the budget deficit can
be met, Greece still has an outside chance of joining its European partners
in monetary union at the end of the 1990s.
Otherwise, as a foreign economist put it, the downward spiral of deficit and
debt will 'consign Greece permanently to Europe's economic margins'.
Greece won grudging approval in September from its EU partners for a revised
convergence plan, aimed at meeting the Maastricht requirements on inflation
and the deficit by the end of 1998 and substantially reducing the public
debt, now at more than 110 per cent of gross domestic product.
With this year's budget deficit now likely to be held just below the target
of 13.2 per cent of GDP, the socialist government's commitment to reducing
fiscal imbalances is starting to look more convincing.
The government is also confident that inflation can be held at about 11 per
cent this year, down from 13.7 per cent in 1993. But that is outside this
year's single-digit target and still more than three times the EU average.
'There will be no revenue shortfall this year, which gives us something
positive to build on,' says Yannis Stournaras, a senior government economic
adviser.
The finance ministry's success in boosting tax revenues after a disastrous
start to the year, together with cuts in the public investment budget
because of delays in launching EU-funded projects, is expected to wipe out a
Dr200bn revenue shortfall forecast earlier.
But next year's budget is causing headaches at the finance ministry, mainly
because the government wants to avoid the political cost of introducing new
taxes in what may be an election year.
The convergence plan calls for cutting the budget deficit to 10.7 per cent
of GDP and annual inflation to 7.8 per cent. However, Yannos Papantoniou,
the economy minister, will have to put together a new fiscal package if it
appears Greece will not meet these targets.
Income from one-off privatisations and asset sales cannot be assigned to
help cover a revenue shortfall under current EU rules, but must be used to
offset debt. For the moment, revenue increases depend on reinforcing the
campaign against tax evasion, with the help of a new financial police force,
empowered to arrest suspected tax evaders and seize their books.
Corruption in tax offices, together with protracted legal disputes over tax
settlement, is blamed for past failures to improve revenue collection.
Much of this year's boost in revenues came from introducing an automatic
settlement procedure to resolve 7.5m outstanding disputes involving
Dr1,300bn in tax arrears. The system is now being extended, with
self-employed professionals being automatically assessed for unpaid taxes
over the past five years.
The resilience of the underground economy, estimated at more than 30 per
cent of GDP, is also due to the removal of customs controls under single
market rules. 'Smuggling of fuel and cigarettes is reaching epidemic
proportions. That is one area where the financial police should prove
effective,' says a finance ministry official.
However, the government has no plans to reduce outlays through public sector
reform. It gave a generous capital injection to a loss-making state
development bank, wrote down substantial amounts of debt owed by farm
co-operatives and continues to subsidise debt-ridden defence concerns.
Government ministries and state enterprises this year ignored guidelines for
hiring one employee to replace three who took retirement. As a result, the
public sector has added more than 30,000 jobs.
This will place considerable strain on the finance ministry's efforts to cap
government spending at 1993 levels next year, despite restricting public
sector wage increases to a nominal 6 per cent.
Still, the effort to impose fiscal discipline, as well as the effects of
recession on consumer demand, is helping the external balance. Imports rose
by only 3.8 per cent in the first half of 1994, while a steady rise in EU
transfers kept the current account deficit at Dollars 1.1bn.
Greece has little chance of being able to climb out of recession next year.
Growth in 1995 is set to rise marginally to 1.2 per cent, based on the
launch of infrastructure projects financed by the EU's new structural aid
package for poor member-states. But there are hints that recovery may be on
the way. Private investment is projected to grow by about 1 per cent next
year, despite interest rates on working capital above 25 per cent. Greece's
industrial sector, which accounts for only 17 per cent of GDP, is picking
up, with output forecast to rise by this year by almost 2 per cent after
four years of decline.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (3): Telecoms flotation is delayed - The
privatisation programme has suffered a setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Yannos Papantoniou, Greece's economy minister, rounding up
deputies in the corridors of parliament before a crucial vote on the
flotation of the state telecoms company, illustrates the importance the
governing socialists now place on partial privatisation.
The law opening the way for 25 per cent of OTE, the telecoms monopoly, to be
sold on the Athens stock exchange was finally approved last Monday. But two
days later, the government decided to postpone the flotation, set for early
December.
Advisers to the issue warned early last week that under present conditions
the government's target of raising more than Dr320bn from the flotation
would not be met. The offering is now expected in February. Mr Papantoniou
hopes for a better price then, with OTE's full-year results available, a new
board of directors in place and a less charged political atmosphere.
The economy ministry forecasts revenues of Dr400bn from privatisation in the
next three years. Studies are under way to identify state enterprises that
could be listed on the bourse, offered to private investors, or restructured
with a view to selling off subsidiaries.
Although it took only a few months in power for the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement to reverse its opposition to unbundling the state, the OTE delay
indicates that the party's radical faction still has reservations. However,
a shift in public opinion in favour of privatisation reflects frustration
with poor services offered by the state-owned corporations that control an
estimated 60 per cent of the economy.
The telecommunications, airline, electricity, petroleum and shipbuilding
industries are dominated by the state, while more than 60 per cent of the
banking market is held by the two biggest state banks. Management is deeply
politicised, with senior executives' jobs being handed out by the governing
party. The patronage system extends well beyond the board-room, with the
result that state corporations are all heavily overstaffed.
The disastrous condition of public finances makes flotations of state
enterprises an appealing method of raising funds for new investment. The
government hoped to reassure Pasok's doubters by offering only minority
stakes in public sector corporations and allowing the state to retain
management control.
The OTE public offering remains pivotal to the economy ministry's
privatisation plans. Despite last week's problems, Mr Papantoniou has
benefited from the conservatives' failed attempt to sell a 49 per cent stake
in the company last year. He had little difficulty in recalling CS First
Boston and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the international investment banks chosen
by the conservatives to handle the OTE deal, since their fees had not been
paid.
OTE is one of only a few profitable Greek state enterprises, with pre-tax
profits last year of Dr129bn on turnover of Dr389bn. First-half results this
year, published for the first time, showed pre-tax profits of Dr77.8bn on
turnover of Dr210.8bn.
Prof Christos Kazantzis, a financial adviser on the OTE sale, dismisses
investor concerns over the quality of state management. He says: 'More
important is the tremendous potential for growth, considering that income
per line in Greece is less than half the European Union average.'
Most Greek commercial banks were invited to share in underwriting the
domestic tranche of 7 per cent, to ensure wide distribution of the issue.
The new law also aims to reassure investors by providing for share price
support by the underwriting banks for several months after the flotation.
Regardless of when the OTE sale goes through, DEP, the state-controlled oil
refining and petroleum products group wants to come to market next year.
Both DEP, a holding company, and the two state refineries it owns are to be
floated, along with an oil trading subsidiary.
DEP is handing over Dr50bn to the government this year ahead of its
flotation. With consolidated profits for 1994 projected at Dr36bn on sales
of Dr642bn, the group intends to expand ahead of the flotation.
DEP's two oil refineries control 60 per cent of the local market, while its
chain of petrol stations has a 20 per cent market share.
Manolis Daskalakis, DEP's managing director, says: 'There will be a series
of listings starting late in 1995 but we won't be disposing of more than 25
per cent of any of our companies.'
DEP plans to use funds from the flotation to finance a Dollars 500m
five-year investment plan, which includes expanding into other markets in
the southern Balkans.
However, the next stage of privatisation will be more difficult. Other
companies on the list such as the Public Power Corporation, the power
utility, have moved into loss because of restrictions on tariff increases
and are heavily burdened with accumulated debt.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (4): French way of
doing things - The economics minister explains his government's distinctive
approach towards economic management / Profile of Edmond Alphandery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, is no stranger to
foreign lands - but he remains convinced that his country's way of doing
things has much to commend it.
Formerly a professor of economics and a graduate of the Institute for
Political Studies in Paris, he also attended both the universities of
Chicago and Berkeley.
At a breakfast meeting last week at Bercy, the modernistic headquarters of
the ministry of finance and economic affairs, he was in a reflective mood
about the distinctive French approach after a busy travel schedule to other
countries.
'There is a difference in perception between the strength of French economy
and how it is perceived overseas,' he says. He points to sustained growth in
the last few months. 'I'm very confident of the prospects for the economy.'
He adds: 'The momentum has been maintained in the second half of the year.
People thought it might slow down but it hasn't. Consumption has taken up
the baton, particularly in consumer durables, and the last motor of the
economy - investment - is now firing. Even small and medium-sized companies
are more optimistic.'
One of the distinctive elements of the French approach to economic
management is the way it has tackled privatisation. He says the experience
has been favourable compared to other countries, 'many of which have been a
failure'.
Most recently, he points to the partial privatisation of Renault, which was
more than 15 times over-subscribed by institutions and has also received a
high level of demand from private investors. He points out that the state
has so far raised a total of FFr103bn from sales.
But he stresses that 'you don't judge the success of a privatisation simply
by the number of subscribers.' He says the objective has instead been
primarily to disengage the state from business activities. 'The public
sector is too big.' He calls the 1982 nationalisation law in France 'archaic
and astonishing for an industrial modern economy at that time.'
Mr Alphandery defends what he calls the noyaux stable or the idea of a core
group of long-term shareholders as part of the success of French
privatisation. 'It is sometimes criticised by other countries, but it has
proved flexible and supple - an effective way to let companies pass smoothly
into the private sector.'
He also highlights other distinctive French approaches to the process: the
idea of an independent privatisation commission to select advisers and make
decisions about the sale of state assets, transparency and the scope for
employees to become shareholders. 'Privatisation is an art and very
complicated,' he says. 'We have the savoir-faire.'
Looking forward, he says that no decision has yet been taken on whether to
proceed with the sale of Seita, the state- controlled tobacco monopoly which
sells Gitanes and Gauloises, and for which the search has now begun for an
adviser to consider the possibility of a sale.
He says that Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group, will be
next in line to offer shares to the public. 'It will be sold as soon as
possible depending on market conditions,' he says. 'There are no particular
obstacles.'
Mr Alphandery argues that there are four principal challenges for the French
economy. The first is the amelioration of unemployment. 'There is
insufficient flexibility in the labour market,' he says. 'Many measures need
to be taken.'
He highlights the role of professional training, particularly within
companies, and argues that there is 'a lot of room for manoeuvre' in
reducing the social security taxes paid by companies. He is less convinced
that the minimum wage is a real problem.
His second challenge is the social security system. He says France must do
more to modify the existing retirement system schemes, reform pensions and
cut health care expenditure. He stresses 'an important first step' through
the tax reforms over the summer which encourage private pension schemes for
artisans and independent workers.
'The big problem is to develop a pension scheme for workers,' he says. 'It's
a big problem for French society. I am confident in the months to come that
there will be legislation but it would be a bit hurried before the
presidential election.'
His third challenge - which he stresses is far from unique to France - is to
tackle national training and the education system, which he says are still
too centralised. 'There is a lot to do.'
That leaves an important fourth challenge: to continue efforts to reduce the
budget deficit, which has a current target of FFr301bn for the end of this
year and FFr275bn for next year.
In the run-up to next May's presidential elections, he is also keen to
reassure the financial markets. He does not believe there is any significant
difference between the principal candidates on economic matters. Any
divergence from the current approach would, he argues, 'be absolutely
irresponsible and damage their credibility'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (2): The patient
seems cured - The economy is becoming more cyclical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, the French will not like it. But the fact that the French
economy is becoming more cyclical has, for the moment, its pleasant upside -
with Insee, the official stat- istics agency, recently raising its 1994
growth forecast to 2.2 per cent and its prediction for 1995 to above 3 per
cent.
Previously paranoid that its estimates for 1994-95 would be considered
influenced by the imminence of presidential elections and therefore
over-optimistic, the govern- ment was thrilled to find its growth
predictions exceeded by more neutral bodies.
Insee, for instance, has predicted that by next month the French economy
will be growing at a year-on-year rate of 3.1 per cent. In its 1995 budget,
the government also had a figure of 3.1 per cent - but as average growth for
the whole year, rather than the initial momentum with which Insee now
forecasts the French economy will enter the 1995 election year. Two other
institutes - OFCE and COE - are estimating growth next year at 3.5 per cent
and 3.2 per cent respectively.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, concludes that all this showed
'our diagnosis and therapy were the right ones'. And, indeed, the government
deserves praise for not letting the gloom and doom of 1993 rush it into an
indiscriminate stimulation package for the economy. However, the
government's wise self-restraint also stemmed from the yawning deficits of
the central government and welfare system, and from the need to bring them
eventually within the bounds prescribed by the Maastricht treaty.
The nature of the French recovery has now changed. One of the factors
frightening many French companies last year was that they found themselves
holding stocks which were actually falling in price. So they started to shed
stocks, which in turn cut production even further and so aggravated the
mini-recession of 1993. At the start of this year, this destocking started
to slow down inside France, but internal demand was still weak and the main
boost to growth came from strong external demand for French goods.
But the economy is now beginning to fire more strongly on its internal
demand piston, and, aptly, nowhere more vigorously than in the automobile
sector. This has provided the big surprise. 'It was generally expected that
car sales would fall back after a strong second quarter,' said Insee in its
mid-October fore- casting note. 'Not a bit of it - registrations, seasonally
corrected, have stayed at the same level in the summer as in the spring.'
But it is not just Renault and Peugeot benefiting from the upturn. Other
more humble leading indicators of recovery, such as demand for packaging
cardboard, indicate the breadth of the improvement, which has been sustained
through the summer. Output of manu- factures in the July-August period was
1.2 per cent higher than in April-June. And Insee forecasts that household
consumption will rise by 1.7 per cent in the second half of this year, after
a 0.5 per cent increase in the first half.
Psychologically, what has persuaded the French to dip into their wallets and
purses has been the stemming, at least, of what had seemed an inexorably
rising tide of unemployment.
According to Insee, some 120,000 jobs were created in the first half of the
year, and perhaps a total of 180,000 to 200,000 over the whole of 1994,
thereby slightly shortening the dole queues.
Linked to this marginally rosier employment picture is the behaviour of
savers. Since mid-1993 France's high savings rate has been falling,
reflecting either people's belief in imminent pay rises or, more likely,
their relief at not having to keep 'precautionary savings' to guard against
imminent unemployment.
After falling year on year in the early 1980s, like water cascading down a
series of fountains, investment is at last picking up and is expected to
accelerate. For instance, OFCE predicts that, on an annual average, 1994
will see only a 0.7 per cent growth in investment, but that by the end of
1994 the level will be 5 per cent higher than at end-1993.
This year's rise in long-term rates would have cramped the investment
increase, if it were not the fact that most French companies have more than
enough cash on hand to fund new capital spending without the bank manager's
help. But some experts cast doubt on the duration of this recovery in
investment - forecast to increase by 7-9 per cent in 1995.
Another worry for the medium-term future is, of course, the budget deficit,
which the government intends to rein in to FFr275bn next year or 4.6 per
cent of gross domestic product, but which most analysts expect will turn out
nearer 5 per cent.
In addition to the central government budget, there is also the chronic
shortfall in the social security system, which leads a large number of
observers to predict tax increases after the May 1995 presidential election.
These will probably take the form of a rise in the so-called contribution
sociale generalise, a tax levied on all forms of income (earned and
unearned) and more and more necessary to balance all the loopholes in the
income tax system.
But apart from these longer-term shadows, the sky is reasonably clear over
the French economy, with one exception - the persistent clouds over French
financial markets which have seen 2.5 percentage points added to long-term
rates this year and some 15 per cent shaved off the Bourse's 250-company
index.
There is just an outside danger that further trouble on the markets could
hurt the real economy; a further fall in equities would make people feel
poorer, with knock-on effects on the property market.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (3): Cloud hovers
over insurers - A business sector that is still in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As other sectors of French business begin to climb out of recession, a
continuing dark cloud hovers over many of the country's insurance companies
 -highlighted by their most recent gloomy results.
'The first half results were quite disappointing,' says Ms Clotilde
Basselier, an analyst with Societe Generale in Paris. 'The real estate
crisis had a strong effect and caused the insurers to make huge provisions.'
A large part of these property losses have nothing to do with direct
investment as part of the insurers' portfolios, however. They reflect
instead a historical legacy, with companies such as GAN, UAP and AGF
controlling banks which, in turn, have heavy outstanding mortgage
commitments.
One vivid example was GAN. The group reported losses of FFr840m in the six
months to June 30. Yet this was primarily result of provisions against Union
Industrielle de Credit, which reported losses of FFr925m alongside agreeing
a restructuring which included ring-fencing its FFr18.9bn property
portfolio.
'The insurance companies were till very recently state-owned and many of the
businesses they acquired were as a result of state pressure and were not
part of their core strategies,' says one analyst. Divestment from this
approach may prove one of the most significant challenges for the sector.
However, while this process of empire building in domestic activities has
perhaps already begun to fade with the privatisation of groups such as UAP,
international ambitions remain at the forefront of many of the companies.
Take Mr Jacques Friedman, head of UAP, who goes to China at the end of this
month to prepare the way for a representative office in Beijing for his
company. 'I'm convinced that within the next three to 15 years - no-one can
say when - that there will be a very important increase in insurance in
Asia,' he says.
Mr Claude Bebear, head of Axa, says: 'Business is becoming more global and
the market more concentrated. I need to be a big business myself to
compete.' For him too, China and India represent vital markets for the next
century.
Axa is just one of several companies which is equally busy scrutinising
markets more close to home. It just announced a Dollars 10m joint venture in
Turkey and - like UAP - has an eye on increasing its non-life business in
the UK.
However, Mr Tim Dawson, an insurance analyst with Lehman Brothers in London,
says: 'I have yet to see much evidence of European insurance companies
becoming serious profit- and shareholder-oriented organisations. They dilute
their intrinsic worth with acquisitions outside the home market. I would
like to see them not thinking about being number one in Europe but aiming
instead for a 15 per cent return on equity.'
Another highly significant structural problem for the French insurance
industry to resolve relates to its distribution network. For many years,
insurance sales have been dominated by a network of tied sales agents
protected by law. These are now increasingly becoming a burden.
'People always talked about agents as a barrier to entry to the market,'
says Mr Dawson. 'Paradoxically, they have also become a barrier to exit.'
Agents can act as a powerful lobby to prevent any commercially-justifiable
increase in premiums that may lose them business to their competitors, for
example.
The cost and obstructiveness of the agents helped explain why a number of
mutuals - with their own sales staff with low, fixed costs and an ability to
screen potential clients effectively - have been able to do so well in the
market. The effect was painful, with GAN, for example, cutting premiums
heavily to gain market share - but more recently reaping the costs. 'There
has been crazy competition because of the mutuals,' says Mr Claude Tendil,
director general of Axa.
Now there are now new challenges as well. The first is bancassurance, with
many of the banks now dominating the market for the sale of individual life
assurance. 'There has been very hard competition with the banks on life
assurance for individuals,' says UAP's Mr Friedman. He adds that more
complex non-life products require more experience of claims records and
remain more the preserve of insurers.
Equally, there is the growth of telephone insurance operations. Compared to
other parts of Europe - notably the UK with its widely-copied Direct Line
innovator - France remains underdeveloped. Thus AGF now has a highly
successful direct car insurance arm in Spain but no equivalent in France.
Axa has begun experimenting with a service in France, but only under a
different name, and an attempt to keep it low profile to avoid tensions with
its agents.
On the other hand, insurers also have great opportunities. Life assurance
sales continue to boom, which analysts put down to the demand for long-term
savings products in the absence of a developed private pensions industry. It
is this which is likely to prove one of the most important battlegrounds in
the coming years as the industry develops and insurers fight over it with
banks and other financial institutions.
The risk, according to Mr Dawson, is that the government may play off
pensions reform against other revenue generators. There have periodically
been discussions about removing the existing tax exemption for investment
income on policies more than eight years old, for example.
Over the next few months, observers of the insurance scene also have two
other important events to track: the scheduled privatisations of both CNP
and AGF.
Mention of CNP in particular causes many rivals to grind their teeth. It has
a virtual monopoly of life assurance sales through post offices, tax offices
and state deposit bureaux. But current discussions in the run-up to the
share sales could remove this network, leaving the company with next to no
goodwill.
Meanwhile, Ms Basselier argues that insurers may have to get used to
fundamental changes such as a drop in capital gains. But she remains
relatively optimistic. 'We are expecting 1996 and 1997 results to reach more
normal levels,' she says.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (1): European prosperity proves elusive -
Disputes with its neighbours, political uncertainty and continuing recession
are pushing Greece further from convergence with the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are difficult times for Greece.
Its superficial gloss of European prosperity can no longer disguise the
structural problems that are blocking prospects for long-term growth.
The political parties, obsessed with personal rivalries and keeping alive
the pervasive patronage system, show little awareness of the country's
economic predicament.
And disputes with its neighbours in the Balkans have further distanced the
country from its European Union partners.
The mood of frustration is reinforced by the refusal of Andreas Papandreou,
the 76-year-old prime minister, to retire or appoint a deputy premier. Mr
Papandreou's weakening health, which allows him to work for only a few hours
a day, feeds media speculation over the succession struggle in the governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Pasok.
But strict self-censorship by Greek newspapers and television suppresses any
debate about when or even whether the ailing Mr Papandreou should make way
for a younger leader.
The waiting period will go on at least until parliament votes for a new
president, a largely ceremonial job due to be relinquished next spring by
another frail elderly statesman, Constantine Karamanlis. Mr Papandreou is
the obvious candidate to take over, but Pasok controls only 170 of the 180
votes needed and he is not prepared to risk a humiliating defeat that would
trigger a general election.
A search has begun for a compromise presidential candidate who would be
supported by some conservative and leftwing deputies in the 300-member
house.
Most opposition deputies are anxious to avoid an early poll, in spite of
assertions by Miltiades Evert, who took over as leader of the conservative
New Democracy party after its election defeat last year, that he could
capture power.
The conservatives are looking less ragged than before, as Mr Evert has
enticed back a group of deputies who defected last year to the rightwing
splinter group Political Spring, but he still cannot persuade the party's
feuding factions to rally behind him.
The results of last month's local government elections underlined the fact
that support for Pasok is still strong, particularly in the countryside
where the effects of recession have been less harsh.
Although conservative candidates were elected as mayors of Athens and
Thessaloniki, the cities where unemployment is highest, the socialists'
popularity has survived their decision to abandon the generous wage and
welfare spending of their first term in the 1980s in favour of tighter
policies.
The election in Athens of Dimitris Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat with
virtually no political experience, demonstrated, however, that voters are
rejecting traditional party and ideological divisions. Significant, too, was
the high nationwide abstention rate, indicating rising dissatisfaction with
the politicians.
After three decades in which many Greeks became city residents for the first
time, while attaining a standard of living comparable to that elsewhere in
southern Europe, attitudes are undergoing a radical change. Social and
environmental problems, ranging from drug use to atmospheric pollution and
the dumping of toxic waste, assume a much higher profile.
The urge to modernise cuts across political boundaries. The pro-European
technocrats in charge of economic policy under the socialists and the
liberal faction in New Democracyhave more in common with each other than
with old-style politicians in their own parties.
But the present lack of leadership is undermining the technocrats' chances
of pushing through structural reforms needed to help the economy catch up
with the rest of the EU.
The government's decision last week to postpone the partial flotation of
OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, until next year is just one
example of how special interest groups, in this case the telecoms company's
powerful union, can obstruct the reform process. Political opposition to the
flotation, together with the socialists' commitment to continued state
management, had a negative impact on overseas investors' interest in the
offering.
It is not just the possibility of losing some Dr300bn (Pounds 790m) in
revenues that worries the economy ministry. Failure to float the telecoms
company would raise doubts about the partial privatisations being planned
and put at risk Greece's convergence programme for participating in EU
economic and monetary union. Moreover, with the state still controlling some
60 per cent of the economy, overhauling public corporations is important in
trying to shrink the public sector deficit.
Low productivity at state-controlled banks, transport companies and
government agencies, where payrolls are crammed with patronage appointees,
makes it harder to reduce inflation, which has been stuck for most of this
year at about 11 per cent.
Greece's hopes of economic recovery are based on its Ecu14.8bn (Pounds
11.64bn) share of the EU's new structural package designed to help its poor
members achieve economic convergence.
Infrastructure improvements, with the EU providing up to 80 per cent of
funding, should promote growth and competitiveness. Yet only one EU-backed
project has been awarded - a sea-bed tunnel linking two ports in western
Greece - while disputes with the European Commission over contract terms are
blocking the start of construction of a new Athens airport, port
improvements and several hundred kilometres of motorways.
Without strong political backing, the finance ministry's new campaign to
curb corruption at tax offices, broaden the tax base and cut tax evasion
could quickly crumble.
Plans for including credit card payments and mortgage loans, as well as
obvious items such as yachts and luxury cars, into the new list of 'wealth
indicators' that are being used to calculate tax liability have been met
with fierce opposition.
Whatever happens, next year marks a turning point. Economy ministry planners
know that unless progress is made towards convergence, by 1996, when the EU
reviews its future, Greece's status will decline further with the arrival of
new entrants from eastern Europe. But with EU transfers to Greece to amount
to almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product in the next five years, few
Greek politicians seem aware that the years of generous hand-outs from
Brussels may soon be over.
It does not help, either, that Greece is quarrelling with two out of three
of its Balkan neighbours. Suspicion runs so deep in the region that even if
disputes with Albania and Macedonia can be patched up soon, trade and
investment prospects are likely to suffer in the future.
The eight-month trade embargo against Macedonia has frozen business contacts
and will also affect earnings this year at Greece's northern port of
Thessaloniki, formerly the main outlet for Macedonian exports.
In Albania where Greek investment was increasing, smaller projects have been
frozen and there are fears that Italian companies may now be preferred over
Greek companies in competitive bids for infrastructure projects.
Greek officials realise that readiness to implicate the EU in these
bilateral disputes, by vetoing European aid to both countries, damages their
own relationship with Brussels.
Yet in spite of a perceptible decline in nationalist feeling, which
triggered the rows over Macedonia's name and the status of the ethnic Greek
minority in southern Albania, Greek attitudes on minority rights at home
still reflect outdated policies.
Accusations persist of discrimination against Greece's Moslem minority in
Thrace, while the efforts of Slav-speakers in Greece's northern provinces -
who would be called the Macedonian minority if they lived anywhere but
Greece - to preserve their language and cultural traditions still face
political obstacles.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (1): Smiles that may
be a little bit forced - Prospects are starting to look up for the economy
but the forthcoming presidential elections may affect the mood of investors
and the stock market is yielding disappointing results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is easy to understand why Credit Lyonnais, the embattled state-controlled
banking group, felt the need to give staff a piece of advice last month as
they discussed with clients its legacy of past financial problems. Maintain
the official line, it said, 'but always with a smile'.
A few weeks after the bank reported losses for the first half of the year of
FFr4.5bn (Pounds 534m or Dollars 856m) on top of 1993 losses of FFr6.9bn,
that smile might finally be starting to seem justified. Mr Jean Peyrelevade,
the chairman, has claimed that the cost of its history of reckless loans is
firmly behind it.
In the same way, prospects are beginning to look up for the French economy
as a whole. Observers of the French scene are feeling more optimistic. 'All
the figures are starting to show quite a strong recovery,' says Mr Piers
Butler, head of French equity sales for Smith New Court.
Job creation is rising and other indicators such as business confidence,
investment and consumer spending are looking positive. Insee, the official
statistics agency, recently raised its growth forecast for this year to 2.2
per cent, and to 3.1 per cent for 1995.
Equally, analysts predict that the CAC-40, the index of leading quoted
companies on the Paris Bourse, is set to start rising again after
languishing for more than two years. Performance for smaller and more
entrepreneurial companies may look more promising still.
Matif, the French financial futures exchange, has continued to develop new
products and report substantially increased volumes in derivative trades,
much of it coming from business in other countries.
The government's privatisation programme has been proceeding well, with a
sharp rise in the number of private investors and both personal and
institutional over-subscription for shares in formerly state-controlled
giants such as Renault, the motor group so symbolic of the nation.
In the wake of the success of the 'Balladur bonds' issued last year, take-up
figures are looking promising for the FFr20bn in government bonds announced
over the summer which are geared for the first time at the retail sector.
One element of uncertainty likely to affect the mood of investors in France
is the forthcoming presidential election. The race for the Elysee Palace is
scheduled for next May, although illness or political tactics from Mr
Francois Mitterrand may bring the date forward.
Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris and head of the Gaullist RPR Party,
became the first serious politician to declare his candidacy at the start of
November. The move is likely to trigger a divisive struggle on the political
right against Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
This in turn may boost further the prospects for Mr Jacques Delors, the
socialist whose term as president of the European Commission ends in
December, and who looks likely to declare his candidature. He is already
neck-and-neck with Mr Balladur in the polls.
Nevertheless, Mr Edmond Alphandery, economics minister, argues that the
markets should not be affected by the election because it is unlikely that
any of these candidates would change the fundamental direction of economic
policy. 'It would be absolutely irresponsible and would damage their
credibility to do so,' he says.
More generally, the future challenges for the French economy are far from
over. While there is optimism for the future on equities, current
performance still leaves much to be desired with the stock market yielding
disappointing results since late 1992.
Privatisation has so far generated some FFr103bn for the French government.
But the remaining potential candidates include some state-controlled
companies - such as Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the insurance group, and
Seita, the tobacco monopoly - which could prove far more complex and less
remunerative to sell.
While job creation in France has been rising, new job seekers and other
factors wiped out any gains. After a temporary dip over the summer, the
September jobless figures showed unemployment at a record high of 3.35m or
12.7 per cent of the labour force.
Mr Gwinn Hacche, an economist with James Capel, says unemployment during
recessions has been proportionately much higher in France than other
countries and seems to continue to ratchet up while the government's
investment in training seems to have had little effect.
Mr Chirac has already made the problem of employment, which he said
threatens the destruction of society, a central theme of his election
campaign. He is reflecting a widespread fear, which is set to make
unemployment a centrepoint of the political debate over the next few months.
Mr Alphandery concedes that labour market inflexibility is one of the most
important challenges for the French economy over the coming months. He
rejects as 'neo-classical' suggestions that the minimum wage presents a
problem. He calls instead for greater investment in training, reform of the
education system, and the possible lessening of social security charges on
companies.
He highlights two other significant problems. The first is the budget
deficit, which the government is forecasting at FFr301bn for this year and
FFr275bn for 1995, or 4.6 per cent of GDP. Most analysts expect it to end up
being nearer to 5 per cent.
The second is the funding shortfall of the social security system, which
could trigger tax increases next year. Mr Alphandery says there is a need to
reform the retirement system, pensions and the costs of health care
provision.
Pensions reform is set to be one of the key debates over the next few years.
The economics minister does not expect any legislative proposals before the
next presidential election, but the development of funds will radically
change the shape of the financial sector.
French business will face a broader range of increasingly tough challenges.
Deregulation and privatisation are introducing more competition to the
domestic market. The influence of the European Union will also intensify.
European court challenges to the restricted access to Orly airport outside
Paris and to state financial support to Air France are just two recent
examples.
Meanwhile, there are factors which will strike home in particular business
sectors. For instance, the banks are likely to need to cut staffing
considerably from current levels, in a delicate process to weave their way
through employment legislation and the fear of strikes.
Insurers will have to face up to the growing tensions between their tied
agents around the country, and lower-cost alternative forms of distribution
system, such as insurance by telephone, which are spreading rapidly across
Europe.
There may also be growing pressure on some of the more distinctive
characteristics of capitalism French-style. The rise of the power of
institutional investors accompanying the growth of pension funds could
reduce the need for the noyaux durs network of cross-shareholdings between
different companies.
Many are questioning the extent to which French state- controlled companies
and even those in the private sector hold large equity stakes and exert
management influence in businesses in sectors entirely unrelated to their
own. For instance, several of the largest insurance companies control banks,
the bad property loans of which have dragged down results substantially.
Institutional pressure - from abroad as well as within the country - may
also help trigger a far broader debate on corporate governance within the
country. Traditionally many French companies have tended to be extremely
hierarchical and run like personal fiefdoms, with a close-knit network of
directors under the control of a single all-too-powerful chairman-chief
executive.
One illustration cited by Mr Butler of Smith New Court is the fact that many
French chief executives refer in their companies' annual reports to what
'je' did and not - as they would in Anglo-Saxon enterprises - what 'we' did.
He also highlights the continuing and controversial role of the
tightly-networked French intellectual elite in rotating between the boards
of companies: individuals who have graduated with top academic marks from
the top colleges and administrative corps, rather than rising through the
ranks based on management ability and knowledge of their business.
Meanwhile, there are still pressures for further reforms to improve the
rights of minority shareholders. In spite of new regulations, takeover
conditions in practice seem all too often to give too much power to dominant
shareholders and leave little voice to their smaller brethren.
While the French may be content as they reflect on the renewed expansion of
the economy, they ought perhaps to admit that their smile is still just a
little bit forced.

Review of Iraq sanctions
The four-year-old sanctions against Iraq come under review at the United
Nations, with pressure mounting from Russia, China, Turkey and other
Security Council members to ease the oil embargo following Iraq's formal
recognition of Kuwait last week. The US and Britain have indicated they
oppose taking any such measures yet.
Western European Union, the fledgling defence arm of the European Union,
meets in Noordwijk in the Netherlands, along with associated partners from
central and eastern Europe. Delegates will approve a document setting out
the bones of a common European defence policy, covering ties with Nato, and
co-operation on arms and operations.
Channel Tunnel: Regular Eurostar passenger train services are due to start,
linking London, Paris and Brussels. There will be two cross-channel trains a
day to each destination. The three-hour journey to Paris (3 1/4 hours to
Brussels) costs between Pounds 95 return for journeys booked up to two weeks
in advance and Pounds 195 for first class travel.
The Nordic Council, representing Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and
Iceland, begins its annual meeting in Tromsoe, northern Norway (to Nov 15).
The gathering will be preoccupied with Sweden's vote by a clear margin to
join the European Union. Yesterday's result showed 52.2 per cent in favour
of membership. Norway will be hard-pressed to gain support for membership
from its reluctant electorate in its referendum on November 28.
Turkish trial: Akin Birdal, president of Turkey's Human Rights Association,
goes before a state security court in Ankara, charged with infringing
security laws. He is accused of advocating separatism and terrorism. If
convicted, Birdal faces a 2 to 5 year jail sentence on each count.
The European Parliament begins a four-day plenary session in Strasbourg.
Highlights include a debate on the European Commission's plans for closer
co-operation with the southern Mediterranean and Mercosur, the Latin America
trade grouping.
UK national lottery:
Tickets go on sale nationwide from 7am for Britain's first state lottery
since its predecessor folded igno miniously in 1826. The first draw will
take place on November 19.
FT Surveys: Greece and French Finance and Investment.
Holidays: Indonesia, Jordan.
Summit of Apec leaders
Bogor, Indonesia: Informal summit of APEC leaders; US President Bill Clinton
and other leaders give news conferences later in the day in Jakarta. After
the summit, Japan takes over from Indonesia as chair of the 18-member trade
grouping.
US economy: The Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets interest rate
policy for the Federal Reserve, meets in Washington for the first time since
September. The FOMC is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a
percentage point to cool down an economy growing at an annual rate well
above 3 per cent.
Gatt ruling: The European Court of Justice rules in a dispute between the
European Commission and EU member states over which has the power to
negotiate in certain trade areas to be co-ordinated by Gatt's successor
body, the World Trade Organisation.
Germany's Bundestag holds a formal vote to elect a chancellor for the next
four years. Incumbent Helmut Kohl is the only candidate, but as his
three-party coalition has a majority of just 10, it would take only five
stray votes to knock him off course.
Nepal holds parliamentary elections two years early, after rebel MPs brought
down the Nepali Congress Party government of Girija Prasad Koirala in July.
The 36 rebels and Mr Koirala have since made up, but a hung parliament is
likely.
Brazil holds second-round run-off elections for governor in 18 of its 27
states, the remaining nine races having been decided outright in the first
round last month. The states up for grabs include Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro.
Angola's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and Unita rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi, are due to sign a peace accord to end the country's 19-year civil
war. A ceasefire should follow two days later.
The government has promised to halt its assault on the rebel stronghold of
Huambo to avoid jeopardising the peace accord, but doubts persist on whether
both sides are willing to put a permanent end to the conflict.
Hungary's foreign minister Laszlo Kovacs and defence minister Gyorgy Keleti
visit Nato headquarters in Belgium to sign Hungary's bi-lateral Partnership
for Peace agreement.
UK-Argentine relations: Britain's Prince Andrew starts an official visit to
Argentina, marking further progress in efforts to normalise relations. Ties
were severed after the 1982 Falklands war but restored in 1990.
FT Surveys: European Airports and Computers in Finance.
Holidays: Brazil (Republic Day), Indonesia.
International Seabed Law
The inaugural meeting of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica will
establish the latest specialised agency of the United Nations. Its birth
follows almost 20 years of contentious negotiations between industrialised
and developing countries. The Authority will monitor the exploitation of
billions of dollars worth of several metals on the international seabed,
outside the economic zone of any country.
Britain's parliament reopens with the Queen's Speech, outlining the
government's legislative plans. A pensions reform bill equalising the
pension age at 65, measures to establish an allowance for job-seekers, and
moves to deregulate the domestic gas market are expected. The government has
dropped plans to privatise the Post Office.
UK economy: Today's inflation figures are expected to show a small rise in
the annual rate. Some analysts think September's 2 per cent underlying
increase, the lowest for 27 years, will have been the trough of the current
cycle. Economists expect the headline figure, boosted by the recent rise in
mortgage rates, to jump to 2.6 per cent in October, with the underlying rate
edging up to 2.2 per cent.
Somalia: International donors and humanitarian agencies meet in Geneva (to
Nov 17) to discuss aid to strife-torn Somalia after United Nations
peacekeepers pull out next March. The UN Development Programme, the
meeting's sponsor, hopes governments will go on funding rehabilitation and
reconstruction programmes.
Saleroom:
The Winter Egg, made by the jeweller Carl Faberge for Tsar Nicholas II to
give to his mother, the Dowager Empress at Easter 1913, comes up for sale at
Christie's in Geneva. Inside a frosty exterior is the original 'surprise', a
basket of spring flowers, made of crystal and rose diamonds. This Imperial
Egg, one of only 47 known to have survived, is expected to make between
Dollars 2.5m-Dollars 4.5m.
The straight-sided 'Balkenkreuz' insignia, cut from 'The Red Baron' von
Richthofen's triplane when it was brought down behind Allied lines in April
1918, goes on sale at Phillips in London. Bids of up to Pounds 50,000 are
expected for this rare relic. The Baron, credited with shooting down 80
Allied aircraft, was killed in the crash.
FT Surveys: Derivatives and Denmark.
Holidays: Germany (Day of Penance).
EU telecoms liberalisation
Telecommunications ministers from European Union member states meet in
Brussels to push for further liberalisation of the sector. High on the
agenda is discussion of a European Commission green paper on the
deregulation of telecoms infrastructure and cable television networks.
The commission is eager to shake up so-called alternative infrastructures,
such as energy and transport networks to allow competition in all but basic
voice telephone services.
Kenya's president, Daniel arap Moi, will open an investors' conference in
London. The Kenyan government is hoping to attract new foreign investors,
following the recent introduction of economic reforms which have
substantially improved the business environment.
De nos caves:
The first consignment of Beaujolais Nouveau wine is scheduled to arrive in
Britain, making its way for the first time through the Channel Tunnel.
FT Survey: Massachusetts.
Holidays: Sri Lanka.
Finnish vote on EU treaty
The delayed parliamentary vote on Finland's plans to join the European Union
is due today. In a referendum last month, 56.9 per cent of Finns backed
membership. A few anti-EU MPs still hope to thwart the move which requires a
two-thirds majority in the 200-seat legislature.
Franco-German summit: UK prime minister John Major and six ministers fly to
the French cathedral town of Chartres to meet President Francois Mitterrand,
prime minister, Edouard Balladur and French counterparts.
The one-day summit will touch on economic and transport issues, including
the row over access to Orly airport, but is expected to be dominated by
defence and security issues where the two countries are far more in tune.
Their air forces are to set up a planning cell for speedy joint responses to
crises outside Europe.
Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
whose leader John Hume has played a pivotal role in the peace process, open
a three-day annual conference in Cookstown, amid signs of moves towards a
political settlement despite last week's republican murder of a postal
worker in Newry.
FT Survey: Latvia.
Holidays: India (Bombay only), Latvia (Independence Day), Morocco
(Independence Day).
Chernomyrdin visits Gulf
Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin is scheduled to begin a trip
through the Persian Gulf states. Mr Chernomyrdin, who, as the former head of
Gasprom, Russia's gas monopoly, plays a major role in the development of
Russia's oil and gas sectors, plans to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Oman.
The visit to Kuwait could reignite the controversy begun last week when
Russian diplomacy helped to facilitate Iraq's decision to drop all
territorial claims to Kuwait. Western countries have remained sceptical
about Iraq's declaration.
Japan-EU trade: Three European commissioners are to discuss trade with the
Japanese government on Saturday. They want to ensure that the European Union
is not cut out of trade advantages accorded to the US during the latest
trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo.
Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, is due to leave for a trip to the US on
Saturday, during which he will hold talks with President Bill Clinton. Mr
Kuchma will be trying to encourage US investment in the hope that this
will prompt other countries to follow suit.

Monday: The strength of UK producer prices was the main worry cited by the
Bank of England in its latest inflation report. Rising raw material prices
have increased industry's costs. October's annual rise in producer input
prices, announced today, is expected to be 7 per cent. But costs have yet to
be fully reflected in output prices (where the annual rise is forecast at
2.5 per cent), let alone in consumer prices.
Wednesday: As well as inflation figures, Britain's Department of Employment
will release statistics on unemployment and average earnings. The steady
drop in unemployment, of 20,000-25,000 a month, is expected to have
continued in October, while September's underlying annual average earnings
growth is forecast to be stable at 3.75 per cent.
The minutes of the September 26 meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor
of the exchequer and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England will be
published. Rates have been left unchanged since their meeting.
Thursday: Retail sales figures for October will be one of the last
indicators of consumer confidence before the November 29 Budget.

James Capel's technical analysis team last week said large-scale investment
decisions were not taking place in Japan: 'the largest percentage movements
are currently in stocks like Sega and Nintendo.'
However, this week investors have another opportunity to relent. Economic
data include trade figures and wholesale prices tomorrow, and money supply
on Friday.
The results list takes in Matsushita Electric Industrial tomorrow and East
Japan Railway on Wednesday; on Thursday, Sony reports, with a clutch of
trading houses, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Marubeni.
In a review of trading houses Baring Securities says the sector should be
aggressively overweighted in the light of recent strong moves in world
commodity markets, and the beginnings of recovery in the domestic economy.

Investors in the Hong Kong market are likely to stay on the sidelines early
this week, awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's US Federal Reserve open market
committee meeting.
Asian markets are expected to be weaker ahead of any decision on US interest
rates.
Market speculation is that the FOMC will increase interest rates by up to 75
basis points, and Hong Kong rates will subsequently be pushed upwards.
If the rise in US rates is kept to 50 points, brokers reckon Hong Kong
stocks could be in for a slight rebound. If the rise is 75 points, trading
is expected to remain in a narrow range, with investors taking their cue
from Wall Street.
With little news on the corporate front, turnover is likely to remain thin -
it was only HKDollars 1.7bn last Thursday, one of the quietest days of the
year. Takeover rumours will continue to haunt second and third liners.

Equities face a volatile week, but whether they move up or down will depend
on the outcome of yesterday's referendum on EU membership and nine-month
figures from several big companies, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
Two of the industrial heavyweights, Volvo and Ericsson, present their
figures tomorrow and on Thursday respectively.
In Ericsson's case, expectations are running high due to the spectacular
growth in sales of the group's cellular products and a strong set of
eight-month figures from its Finnish rival, Nokia.
Goldman Sachs in London is expecting nine-month profits of SKr3.5bn, up from
SKr1.86bn a year ago, and full-year profits of SKr5.5bn.
AssiDoman and SCA, two of the leading forestry groups, will also announce
figures. With the pulp and paper sector in a clear uptrend, they are
expected to be strong.
SCA, which reports on Friday, is expected to disclose a profit of around
SKr1.6bn. The main interest will be in how its Molnlycke hygiene unit is
weathering increasing competition in the nappies (diapers) market.
Analysts say that whatever the outcome of the referendum, concern about the
state of Sweden's finances will continue to affect equities via the bond
market. Another cloud on the horizon for the export-orientated
multinationals is the strengthening krona, which could harm next year's
earnings significantly if the trend continues.

The stock market this week faces one of its most critical tests in several
months. First, investors and traders will probably have to withstand an
interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, whose open market committee
meets tomorrow to decide whether to tighten monetary policy for the sixth
time in 10 months.
Second, the market will have to cope with more pronouncements from
Republican leaders in Washington about what they plan to do now they have a
majority in both houses of Congress. Some reckless talk from victorious
Republicans unsettled the market at the end of last week - talk of big tax
cuts (including the outright elimination of income tax) and increases in
defence spending conjured up unwelcome images of ballooning deficits and
rising interest rates.
Euphoria over the elections should begin to die down this week, and the
Republican party is likely to present a more carefully-considered agenda for
the new Congress in the coming days. But Wall Street remains divided over
whether the Republicans' mid-term triumphs will be good or bad for shares.
Among those who see a brighter future under a Republican Congress are Mr
Joseph Liro and Mr Timothy Hiscock, economists with SG Warburg. Pronouncing
the Clinton agenda dead, they say proposals put forward by Republicans since
the election - measures to cut taxes, resist a minimum wage increase and
reduce government regulation - are all positive for stocks.
Others disagree. Mr David Shulman, chief strategist at Salomon Brothers,
says euphoria over the victory of the more market-oriented Republicans will
soon give way to a variety of concerns, such as the possibility that a
Republican-controlled Congress will block the passage of free trade
legislation, and the possibility that aggressive tax-cutting measures could
unsettle a bond market worried about the deficit and an overheating economy.
The outlook for share prices, concludes Mr Shulman, is bleak, and late last
week he was recommending clients to sell into any post-election rally.
That rally, however, never really materialised, and probably never will.
Share prices did jump sharply the morning after the mid-term election, but
they soon fell back, and the market ended the week nursing losses.
How the equity market will respond to another monetary tightening depends on
the extent of any rate increase. Most analysts believe the Fed will raise
its target for the federal funds rate from 4 3/4 to 5 1/4 per cent. Any
increase larger than 50 basis points could spell trouble for share prices,
because it would deepen fears that the economic recovery and corporate
earnings growth would be choked off if interest rates rose too far too fast.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Slowdown in trading makes for caution -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing mood of bullishness towards the UK equity market at the close of
last week distinctly cooled as trading ground to a halt on a dismally quiet
Friday afternoon.
Formerly optimistic about short-term prospects after the mid-week rally
following the US elections, some dealers now view the market with extreme
caution in the short term, worried about the recent lack of business and the
chances of a big sell-off on Wall Street. There is, however, increasing
optimism for the rest of the year.
But before UK equities attempt to reach some of the more realistic year-end
forecasts, they have to face a significant hurdle in the form of the US
Federal Reserve open market committee meeting in Washington tomorrow.
Forecasts that the US Fed funds rate could be increased by up to a full
point were scaled back to 50 basis points after last week's economic news,
which indicated a slowing of the economy. Any less or any more than that may
be interpreted as bad news for markets.
Some London market strategists argue that, US influences apart, there are
many good reasons for buying UK stocks. They say London traditionally enjoys
a pre-Christmas run and that this year should be no exception.
The Budget, scheduled for November 29, could cause problems but again most
analysts are looking for a neutral outcome.
Mr Edmond Warner of Kleinwort Benson, who expects a year-end FT-SE 100
standing at 3,300, says: 'Rarely can a budget have been approached with as
little investor concern; prudence and rectitude have been the chancellor's
watchwords since assuming office and, February's rate cut apart, he has
stuck to the script.' Mr Warner adds a note of caution, however, pointing
out that 'complacency is a dangerous state of mind and investors should not
assume that November 29 will be without either risk or opportunity'.
NatWest Securities, in its Equity Market Analysis for November, expects a
cautious budget 'which will underpin rising credibility in the UK'. The
securities house is in the bullish camp regarding the end-year rally and
maintains a year-end forecast of 3,400. It highlights the favourable
domestic factors: profits upgrades; strong cash flow which funds 6 per cent
real dividend growth; and rising sterling and gilt credibility.
Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tiley Securities insists there is room
for the equity market to move 200 points higher before the year-end.
The market was satisfied with last week's important company trading
statements, which included double-digit dividend increases from Marks and
Spencer, British Airways and BAA, and this week should see another cluster
of big pay-outs.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Honeymoon may be over for French
privatisations - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday morning, officials from the French economy ministry will
announce the results of the public offer for Renault's flotation.
They will do so with mixed emotions. The issue is set to be oversubscribed.
But the motor group, one of the stars of the French public sector, has not
seen the strength of demand enjoyed by previous sales in France's ambitious
privatisation programme.
Most industry analysts expect the partial privatisation to draw between 1.5m
and 2m private investors, compared with an average of between 2.5m and 3m
for the previous four big privatisation sales.
Last-minute buying may push up the number but an important question is
emerging: Are French privatisations losing their pulling power?
The answer depends on where one looks. While private investors have held
back, institutional investors - comprising the bulk of the foreign interest
in French privatisations - have rushed to buy Renault shares. The
institutional tranche, less than 40 per cent of the overall issue, has been
oversubscribed a healthy 15 times.
For individuals and institutions alike, however, future French privatisation
issues are likely to be greeted with an increasingly sober response.
For the French government, and the investment banks which place the
privatisation shares, therefore, the going may become more difficult. 'The
honeymoon could be over,' says Mr Michel Fleuriet, president of Merrill
Lynch Finance in Paris.
There are several reasons. The depressed stock market, which has seen the
CAC-40 index of leading shares fall by almost 20 per cent since its February
peak, is one factor that has weighed on Renault and which will continue to
complicate privatisation issues. Of the previous four big privatisations,
only Banque Nationale de Paris is trading above its issue price.
On the institutional side, such factors are compounded by the international
competition for investors' funds. 'Renault was a dream sale, with people
approaching us,' says one banker in London. 'But institutions have a lot of
options coming up next year with Italian and Scandinavian privatisations
coming to market.'
In spite of these obstacles, the French government and its investment bank
advisers are sanguine. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, argues
that the strength of demand for the initial privatisations has been
abnormal, and that momentum can be maintained in the privatisation drive.
Many observers agree. Mr Fleuriet at Merrill Lynch claims that there remain
a number of potentially attractive assets in the public sector, citing
Usinor Sacilor, the steel group, as a company which will benefit from an
upturn in the industry cycle. But he argues that the appeal of privatisation
issues from now on will be on a case-by-case basis.
Most are expected to draw continued competition from investment banks
seeking a slice of the privatisation business. The placings, if not the
advisory roles in the issues, have proved profitable.
'The commission rates have totalled about 3 per cent of the amount raised,
which has created a fairly lucrative business,' says one foreign banker
involved in some of the issues.
A counterpart at another foreign investment bank says that pricing will
remain the key. 'Renault was nicely priced, at about nine times prospective
earnings,' he says. 'So long as the government remains realistic about its
pricing then I don't see any major problems.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Turbulent week ahead for the dollar -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The week ahead promises to be a volatile one for the dollar with a critical
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and a bevy of important
financial data, providing markets with much food for thought.
These developments take place amid a market still trying to understand the
implications of last week's shift in power towards the Republicans at the
mid-term congressional elections.
The dollar rally, prompted by Fed intervention to support the currency at
the beginning of the month, was given further momentum by the election
results. This has led a number of observers to call a turn in the dollar,
after nine months of decline.
Decisive action from the Fed tomorrow could bolster the dollar's rally. On
the other hand, should the Fed disappoint the market, the dollar will be
very vulnerable to renewed selling pressure, especially following its
recovery over the past 10 days.
There will be no shortage of possible triggers for market concern. Prominent
among these will be the retail sales and capacity utilisation figures, out
tomorrow; the consumer price index for October, out on Wednesday; and the
September merchandise trade report, released on Friday.
The key issue, however, will clearly be the FOMC meeting. Most analysts are
predicting a 50 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. Indeed, a
Reuters poll of 30 analysts last week found them to be unanimous on this
point.
Whether this will satisfy the market probably depends on the message which
accompanies it. The Fed is widely seen to have undermined the effectiveness
of its last move, three months ago, by saying that it did not expect to have
to tighten rates again for some time. This time round, the market view is
that 50 basis points will only be seen to be sufficient if the Fed indicates
the possibility of a similar rise at the December FOMC meeting. Those
analysts predicting a moderate response from the Fed say the US economy is
not far outside the desired 'box' of 2 1/2 per cent (growth) by 2 1/2 per
cent (inflation).
In Europe the main focus will be on the Nordic currencies, in the aftermath
of yesterday's Swedish vote in favour of joining the European Union.
Analysts had speculated that a 'yes' vote could help the Swedish krona reach
SKr4.65 against the D-Mark, from around SKr4.75 on Friday.
Other Nordic currencies will probably rise on the back of the krona,
although the Norwegian krone will be constrained by uncertainties over a
similar EU poll there, on November 28.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Sun set to shine on Latin America -
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the political storm clouds that worried investors in Latin American
stock markets earlier this year appear to have blown away.
Presidential candidates pledging adherence to market-oriented economics have
been returned by voters in the two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico. In
Argentina and Peru, the current leaders, whose policies have met the
approval of foreign investors, look set for victory in elections next year.
Furthermore, some economists are starting to scale up their growth forecasts
for 1995.
'Growth prospects for Latin America are really extremely good. We are
expecting growth could be as high as 5 per cent next year and that would
make it the best year since 1980,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns
in New York. This year's growth expectation averages about 3.5 per cent.
Yet the feelgood factor has yet to assert itself. 'The unease in Latin
American markets is because of US events that have tended to outweigh a
quite substantial improvement in the background fundamentals of the region,'
said Mr Dennis.
Since US interest rates began to turn upwards in February, Latin American
markets have been nervous. The nervousness was compounded by political
assassinations and other events in Mexico.
Yet given the supposed dependence of the Latin markets on the US interest
rate cycle, 1994 has not been too bad. Up to November 4, according to the
International Finance Corporation, Latin American equity markets were up
12.4 per cent in dollar terms. Those investors who fought shy of Mexico, as
well as Venezuela and Argentina, and invested in Brazil, which rose 77 per
cent, Chile, up 47 per cent, and Peru, up 58 per cent, have done best of
all.
While for non-dollar investors the weakness of the US currency this year
pares these gains, they still look reasonable when compared with most stock
markets and wonderful compared with the dollar-based fixed-income markets.
Returns in the US Treasury market could be the lowest since 1968. In
emerging markets, holders of Brady bonds are nursing heavy losses.
Latin markets also look good when compared with most of their Asian
counterparts. Asia's emergers, according to the IFC, are down 6.6 per cent
since the start of the year. Only South Korea, up 29.5 per cent, and India,
up 14.6 per cent, stand out.
The outperformance of Latin America is somewhat illusory, though. Asian
markets peaked late last year and were falling at the start of 1994 as the
Latin markets were still rising.
Most emerging market analysts reckon Asia's longer-standing growth record
justifies the higher price/earnings ratios commanded by Asian companies, but
a number believe the gap between the two regions should begin to close as
Latin American growth proves persistent.
Many say that this year's political and economic developments in Brazil, in
particular the prospects for success of the current anti-inflation plan,
could provide the trigger for a more positive regional outlook.
Mr Jaime de Pinies, managing director at Santander Investment in Madrid,
said prospects for Brazilian growth in the coming year or so 'will defy the
logic of US interest rates'.
According to his company's Latin American strategist: 'The stabilisation of
Brazil will not only result in extraordinary returns for those willing to
share the risks, but redraw the whole economic map of the region.' He is
recommending investors go overweight in Brazil, as well as Chile. Mr de
Pinies recommends an underweight position in Mexico to compensate.
According to Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort
Benson Securities in London, most investment institutions are so underweight
in Brazil that those seeking even a neutral position there could drive the
market substantially higher.
But Mr Richard Watkins of LatInvest, a London-based broker specialising in
the region, sounded some notes of caution.
The importance of choosing the right stocks is growing. It is no longer just
enough to have chosen the right market. And he saw government policies as
increasingly reflecting concerns about social welfare and income
distribution.
He also saw potential difficulties for the utility stocks which dominate
many of the Latin markets.
Over the next few years, time will run out on the monopoly positions that
were granted by governments at the time of privatisation. to many utilities.
Competition is about to enter the fray. While that may be good for economic
efficiency, it could also shake some of the region's most prominent stocks.

SOUTH AFRICA
The Johannesburg stock exchange last week reversed its long-standing
opposition to dual capacity trading and screen trading, and also said that
it would permit brokerages to be 100 per cent foreign owned within a year of
amendments to the stock exchange act being passed, writes Mark Suzman in
Johannesburg.
This follows intensive discussions over a special report on the
restructuring of the South African market which was released in August. That
document had proposed only that an initial 30 per cent of local brokers
could be bought by foreigners and said that the introduction of dual
capacity trading, whereby brokers can act as both agents and principals,
would have to be preceded by the abolition of domestic exchange controls.
However, after vociferous complaints by domestic and international banking
groups, who had threatened to form a rival exchange if more radical reforms
were not pursued, the JSE committee announced the modifications. It also
said that 'informal but constructive' discussions between domestic banks and
the JSE on the question of admitting banks as members of the exchange had
taken place and that formal negotiations would begin shortly.
But the committee warned that the granting of permission to JSE members to
participate in dual capacity trading would be contingent on the development
of proper surveillance systems and changes to the exchange's official rules
to provide for the full transparency of such transactions, as well as
amended capital requirements for brokers.
The acceptance in principle of having domestic broking companies wholly
owned by foreigners is merely an acknowledgment of the inevitable. Most of
South Africa's main broking houses have already announced alliances with
international partners and have declared their intention to formalise these
as soon as the necessary legislative amendments have been accepted.
GREECE
The Athens stock exchange was hit hard by the government's decision to
postpone floating 25 per cent of OTE, the telecoms monopoly, writes Kerin
Hope in Athens.
Mr Yannis Tegopoulos of Midland Pantelakis Securities said: 'The mood was
gloomy already, so there was some heavy selling on the news. People are
worried that the postponement may be indefinite.'
The flotation, set for early December, was called off on Tuesday when the
government was informed by CS First Boston, advising on the sale, that the
asking price was too high. The government had hoped to raise about Dr320bn
(Dollars 1.4bn), with 18 per cent of the company being placed with
institutions abroad through a book-building procedure. The other 7 per cent
was to be offered to domestic investors. However, first soundings indicated
a share price 15 per cent lower than the government projection. The
flotation is now provisionally set for February.
Potential investors were concerned over the government's insistence that OTE
would remain under state management. Uncertainties over OTE's business plan,
the size of its licence fee and the absence of audits to western European
standards, also had an impact, analysts said.
Nonetheless, DEP, the state-owned oil refining and petroleum products group,
which was due to follow OTE to the market next year, said its plans for a
partial flotation would not be affected by the postponement.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Telmex volatility upsets Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Telmex, one of Latin America's most traded stocks, went on a
roller coaster ride last week. And, as usual, took the Mexican market with
it, writes Ted Bardacke from Mexico City.
On news that AT&amp;T would join Grupo Alfa, the industrial conglomerate, to
offer telecommunications services when the Mexican market is opened up to
competition in 1997, Telmex ADRs fell more than 10 per cent over a two-day
period before recovering nearly half that amount in Friday's trading session
to close at Dollars 53.
The Mexican IPC index declined 2.12 per cent on the week after falling 4.83
per cent on Thursday.
Although both Telmex and the market knew that serious competition was
coming, there had always been an assumption that AT&amp;T would go with Telmex,
dominating the rapidly growing Mexican market for years to come.
Last week's tumble was a correction resulting from those dashed
expectations, brokers said. Future fluctuations of will be dependent on
three main factors: how much protection Telmex receives from the Mexican
government when it makes its announcement of new telecommunications
regulations; a detailed examination of its preparations for competition in
light of those regulations and AT&amp;T's recent decision and potential exchange
rate losses, should the peso be devalued.
By the end of trading on Friday, there appeared to be a consensus that the
price of Telmex ADRs in New York would settle in the Dollars 50 to Dollars
55 range, slightly lower than the Dollars 55 to Dollars 60 range it had been
trading in prior to AT&amp;T's announcement.

FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Italy prepares to re-enter the fray -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy looks set to be in the spotlight over the next few days in the
international bond markets. Political uncertainty, which has been worrying
the bond markets for much of the year, has been highlighted by this
weekend's demonstrations in Rome against the budget proposals of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government.
A parliamentary vote of confidence, called by the government on Friday and
scheduled to take place today, will provide a further immediate focus while
debates on the budget are expected to continue until the end of the year.
In addition, Italy is widely expected to re-enter the euromarkets soon, with
a Y400bn eurobond, in tranches of three-, 10-and 20-year maturities,
reported to be in the offing.
That deal, which has not been confirmed, would be consistent with the
government's long-term strategy of broadening its investor base and
lengthening the maturity profile of its debt.
After making considerable headway in 1992 and 1993, the government has run
into problems. On top of a general disenchantment with bonds generally,
triggered by the February increase in US interest rates, overseas investors
have been particularly worried by Italy's debt, which is expected to reach
128 per cent of GDP in 1995, and its fiscal deficit.
Since May, bond prices have fallen and yields risen, both in absolute terms
and relative to the German bund. The yield spread between the 10-year
Italian bond and the bund narrowed from more than 650 basis points in early
1993 to fewer than 300 points earlier this year.
Since May, however, it has climbed steadily, hovering around 450 basis
points in trading over the past two months.
Foreigners have led the sell-off, with overseas investors accounting for
less than 10 per cent of the overall lira debt compared with about 15 per
cent last year. Analysts also suggest the average maturity of the debt -
extended by six months to three years and five months since the end of 1992
 -may have been shortened since the summer because the treasury has been
forced to rely on shorter-term paper to cover its financing needs.
After an initial welcome for Mr Berlusconi's election 'the euphoria has
waned', says Mr Jose Luis Alzola, analyst with Salomon Brothers.
The delay in publication of the government's financial programme in July
contributed to scepticism, while in August an increase in the discount rate
from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent followed selling pressure on bonds and on
the lira.
Investors have become concerned that measures to reduce the fiscal deficit
contained in the 1995 budget proposals, currently before parliament, are
insufficiently radical and that political tensions may interfere with the
budget's approval.
'The budget relies excessively on one-off measures, thereby postponing more
significant action for subsequent years,' insists Mr Alzola.
'The markets are pretty sceptical. Longer-term, the risk remains that
persistently high fiscal deficits will trigger further currency weakness and
high inflation,' he adds.
Inflation reached a 25-year low of 3.6 per cent in the summer, but the
markets are still worried or, in the words of Mr Richard Benzie, analyst
with UBS, 'deeply spooked' by the prospect of rising prices.
'It is hard to get bullish,' agrees Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with
Paribas Capital Markets, who says that part of the problem is the character
of Italy's political process. 'It is so drawn out, so painful,' he says of
the discussions surrounding the 1995 budget. 'The budget will be a focus for
the markets until the end of the year.'
There are grounds to suggest that these fears are overdone. Worries that the
debt burden will directly increase pressure on interest rates - by
increasing government pressure on a limited pool of savings - may be
exaggerated.
This is partly because the government is no longer so dependent on the
domestic markets because of changes both in the international market and in
Italy's own financial system.
Italy's capital market is now much more open and integrated with the rest of
the world, notes Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist with Lehman Brothers
International. He suggests that the emphasis on debt as a percentage of
gross domestic product is misplaced and that the ratio between debt and
private financial wealth is a more appropriate benchmark.
'What drives real yields down in the long run is the ratio between debt and
private financial wealth. Prospects for this ratio are neutral to good,' he
says.
Also, Italy has 'so far under-utilised foreign currency issuance as a source
of funds,' he explains. Italy followed up a Y300bn eurobond issue in
January, co-led by JP Morgan and Daiwa, with a Dollars 4bn five-year deal in
D-Marks, dollars and yen in July.
Even after those issues, foreign currency debt still amounted to less than 4
per cent of total debt: further grounds, perhaps, for the markets to believe
that a new euro issue is in the pipeline.

The most important event in the US credit markets this week will be
tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, at
which Fed officials will decide to what extent another round of monetary
tightening is required.
Analysts think the starting point for the Fed's deliberations will be an
increase of half a percentage point in its target for the Fed funds rate,
pushing it up to 5 1/4 per cent. Anything less - or indeed, nothing - would
ring alarm bells, provoking fears that the Fed was not being tough enough on
inflation.
Since a half-point increase is already discounted by bond prices, such an
outcome could provoke little action. But the more tantalising question is
whether the Fed will demonstrate its resolve - and, incidentally, provide
some welcome relief for the dollar - by lifting the target rate by up to a
full percentage point.
Any such move is likely to be greeted positively by the bond market, on the
basis that it would signal a tough inflationary stance.
The Fed apart, it is a busy week for economic data; but the figures that
will be most closely watched are those for consumer prices, due out on
Wednesday. Salomon Brothers forecasts that, excluding food and energy, the
October year-on-year figure will remain at 3.0 per cent.

FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Bears look for aggressive move by the
Fed - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All eyes are on the Federal Reserve now as bond traders wait to see how
aggressive the central bank is willing to be in tackling inflationary
pressures in the economy.
News last week that the producer price index fell by 0.5 per cent in October
 -analysts had expected a 0.1 per cent increase - did little to change the
opinions of those economists who believe the Federal Reserve will boost the
federal funds rate target by at least 50 basis points, to 5 1/4 per cent, at
its open market committee meeting tomorrow.
Analysts say this anti-inflationary stance should cheer the bond market, but
most believe investors have already accounted for such a rise.
If the Fed decides not to act, however, the market could take a serious
tumble. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers says: 'Inaction
would be a significant negative for the market as it would fly in the face
of recent data that the economy is above trend, instead of decelerating, as
the Fed said it had expected.'
The Salomon economist is one of a number on Wall Street who believes
inflation is a bigger threat than the decrease in producer prices would
indicate, because declining car and energy prices within the producer price
index masked a 0.3 per cent increase in intermediate (partially-processed)
goods.
He believes the Fed might well increase the interest rate target to 5 1/2
per cent in order to 'convey immediately somewhat more aggressive action and
suggest that more action would come soon'.
Mr Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, believes a full
point increase would be the best way to put the brake on inflation, but does
not see this as likely in the absence of clear signs of dangerously
resurgent inflation.
The key to managing inflation is timing, says Mr Sinai. 'The game is to
prevent inflation from picking up, but by the time it is accelerating and
the producer and consumer price indices are picking up, I believe it is too
late to prevent the inflationary process from getting out of hand.'
He believes the Fed is attempting to act early and moderately to prevent
inflation. 'I regret that members of the central bank have done so little to
explain to the public what they are doing and why.'
However, not all economists are so worried by inflation.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, believes the bond
market is reacting bearishly to a phantasm of inflation. By his
calculations, increases in commodity prices have been nearly wiped out by
decreases in durable goods labour costs, which he puts at down 5.2 per cent
from the same period last year.
'People have a tendency to emphasise things they see a lot,' he says. 'You
see commodity prices every day, labour only comes out four times a year.'
This is the only explanation Mr Brusca sees for the bearish mood exhibited
by the market last week.
Markets were buoyed only for the briefest of moments on Thursday morning by
the positive producer price figures before falling by  13/32 to 92 23/32
late in that session, which was the last of the week because the market was
closed on Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday.
'On the one hand I have to say this is crazy,' Mr Brusca says of Thursday's
extremely volatile session. 'On the other, you have to say people are
sceptical that inflation can stay low.'
Mr Brusca worries that overly tight monetary policy will depress the economy
next year. While others ask whether a 50 basis point increase in rates may
not be enough, Brusca turns the query around: 'The question is: is 50 points
too much?' he says.
Certainly, traders will now be looking to Wednesday's release of consumer
price information for more clues about inflationary pressures.
Uncertainty about the impact of strong Republican gains in last Tuesday's
mid-term elections will also play out in the markets.
Initially, news that the party would control both houses of Congress sparked
a rally but later, comments by Republican leaders that they planned to
decrease taxes and increase defence spending caused consternation and helped
push markets down.
Some analysts fear that grid-lock between the Republican Congress and
Democratic president could hurt the value of the dollar and hit bonds by
deterring foreigners from investing in US instruments, but few are willing
to predict the long-term effect of divided government.
In addition to promising more tax cuts and defence spending, the Republicans
have pledged to work toward a balanced budget.
Salomon's Mr Lipsky believes the debate over whether to approve the Uruguay
Round agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will provide
an important indication of future relations between the Congress and the
executive. But he adds, 'in the near-term the defining events are going to
be economic fundamentals and monetary policy'.

The gilts market faces a busy week, with traders awaiting a host of UK
economic statistics and a potential rise in US interest rates.
The prices data will the focus of most attention, with producer price
details out today and consumer prices on Wednesday. The Bank of England
expressed concern in its last inflation report that higher input prices
(reflecting the rising costs of raw materials) might be passed through to
producer output prices and then to the consumer.
With October's input prices expected to show an annual rise of 7 per cent,
the gilts market might take inflationary fright. Retail price inflation is
also expected to edge up in October, with the headline figure rising faster
than the underlying, because of the recent rise in mortgage rates.
Recent statistics have pointed to continued economic strength, and Ms Katy
Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks third-quarter gross
domestic product figures, released on Friday, will be revised up to 0.8 per
cent growth from the previously estimated 0.7 per cent.
Whatever the UK news, the gilts market will find it difficult to escape the
influence of the US. Ms Peters thinks the market would respond better to a
substantial rise in rates, of say a full percentage point, which would show
that the Fed is ahead of the game.

Bond market investors have, at least for the moment, welcomed last week's
appointment of Mr Yasuo Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank, a leading
commercial bank, as the new Bank of Japan governor.
That Mr Matsushita, a former vice-minister of finance, has had 10 years
experience in the private sector has triggered hopes of lower interest
rates.
Many investors expect him to be more sympathetic to banks' bad-loan problem
and the sluggish demand for funds among corporations.
They hope that he will relax monetary policy, in contrast to his
predecessor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, who is known for his efforts to burst the
asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s.
Traders on the bond futures markets said the March 1995 futures contract had
moved firmly since the announcement.
High demand for funds among banks and companies, on the other hand, is
expected to limit any rise in bond prices. Banks looking to raise year-end
funds are expected to turn to the two-month money markets.
Financial institutions are avoiding funding in the three-month certificate
of deposit market, their usual source of capital, since they want to avoid a
rise in the short-term prime lending rate, which is linked to three-month CD
rates, when lending is stagnant.

Last week, it was the US mid-term elections. This week, it is the open
market committee meeting of the US Federal Reserve.
The first has consequences for the speed of interest rate rises next year,
the second for rates in the immediate future. Both are at the centre of the
German bond market's interest.
The Republican victory in Congress could accelerate the rise in US interest
rates if tax cuts are passed, Mr George Magnus, SG Warburg's chief
economist, told German investors. This would cause the Fed to act faster to
ward off inflation.
'We could then see US interest rates rising more significantly,' he said.
He forecast a further two point rise in the federal funds rate in 1995 after
tomorrow's expected move of half a point or more.
'There is uncertainty over when the Fed will really push rates up into the 7
per cent area - that's effectively where we think they will go.' Real
interest rates are 'much too low' against Germany's and Japan's.
German rates are also expected to move up again next year, says Mr Stefan
Schneider, Warburg's German economist.
With a strong economic recovery and upward wage pressures, 'the Bundesbank
will step on the brakes for the first time early next year'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Confusion lies with statistics - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Globalisation is one of the buzzwords of the 1990s. But although it is
bringing profound changes to national economies, the way companies conduct
their business and the world of work, nobody seems to know how to measure
it.
What constitutes globalisation is fairly clear. The Paris-based Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says it is a widening and
deepening of companies' operations across borders to produce and sell goods
and services in more markets.
Globalisation's most dynamic element since the mid-1980s has been foreign
investment, although it can also take the form of trade and collaboration
for purposes such as product development, production and sourcing.
However, the way these activities translate into pounds and pence or dollars
and cents is unclear, largely because of gaps in the statistics.
Among the problems:
recorded flows fail to include direct investment financed through capital
markets in the host country or from other sources that do not pass through
the country of the original investor;
not all countries have adopted OECD guidelines setting 10 per cent ownership
as the minimum for an investment to be counted as foreign direct investment
as opposed to portfolio investment;
less than transparent ownership structures mean some companies which are
foreign controlled may be categorised as domestic owned;
once past the flows, there are difficulties with data on stocks of foreign
investment because these are usually based on the historical value of an
investment and not updated at market prices.
This list implies that the total value of foreign direct investment and
hence the scale of globalisation has been underestimated. Current
statistical methods almost certainly fail to reflect how globalisation is
changing the nature of the world economy.
Foreign affiliates are frequently, if not always, established to preserve or
expand exports. They therefore boost the parent company's and country's
international competitiveness.
For this reason, Ms DeAnne Julius, chief economist at British Airways, has
suggested that their activities should be taken into account with more
traditional trade figures.
The US is about the only country to have suitable statistics with which to
begin this exercise. But the accompanying table, based on a US Commerce
Department study, suggests that it is fraught with difficulty.
The traditional balance of payments-based measure of US cross-border trade
in goods and services showed a deficit of Dollars 28bn in 1991. Although
this was smaller than many recent deficits, it was still redolent of
relative economic decline.
The picture changes significantly, however, if sales of US affiliates in
their country of location are included. All alternative measures produce
surpluses, suggesting that the US is a rather more potent contributor to
world trade than statistics say.
But the table also shows how the estimates vary greatly: net US surpluses
range from Dollars 24bn to Dollars 164bn while the numbers for sales and
purchases differ even more. Clearly, there is no neat statistical way of
pinning down globalisation.
The OECD has a small team under Mr Thomas Hatzichronoglou of its science,
technology and industry directorate which is trying to make sense of such
confusion.
Its recent first study* of foreign affiliates in 15 OECD countries focused
on the effect of foreign investment on employment, productivity, research,
technology and trade in host countries.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team's findings were overwhelmingly positive.
The survey found that overall the foreign affiliates added to employment and
paid higher wages than domestic companies. Although research and development
as a share of turnover and production tended to be lower than in home grown
companies, it was growing.
Moreover, foreign investors frequently introduced 'best practices' in terms
of industrial skills, management methods and new technologies that spread
rapidly through the host economy.
Potentially more controversial is the impact of foreign investment on the
country where the investment originates. The table below suggests that the
country of origin may gain in terms of the competitiveness of its companies.
However, this must be weighed against the likely impact on employment of
locating production abroad and the political storms and protectionist
pressures that such investments can unleash.
The OECD has only three people working in this area and their next survey,
which will probably be on the effect of globalisation on investing
economies, could take two years to appear.
Globalisation is therefore an area in which the OECD could usefully consider
investing some resources of its own - if it can take its mind off the still
unresolved issue of who should have the organisation's top job.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Palladium puts on a show - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of palladium has doubled in the past 12 months to a five-year
peak.
The metal is a key material in multi-layer ceramic capacitors for which
demand is booming because they are used in a wide variety of electronic
equipment such as mobile telephones and personal computers. So analysts and
traders will be looking for clues about where the palladium price is likely
to go next when Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum group metals
marketing group, presents its interim review tomorrow.
In its annual review in May, JM pointed out that Russia, the biggest
palladium producer, was likely to feed the market with extra metal whenever
the price increased substantially and therefore palladium would remain
relatively stable in a range between Dollars 125 and Dollars 145 a troy
ounce. The price has been above Dollars 160 recently but the strength of the
yen against the US dollar has made palladium look relatively cheap to the
Japanese who produce most of the world's multi-layer capacitors.
While it might have second thoughts about palladium, JM seems unlikely to
change its platinum price forecast which has proven to be very accurate so
far. In May JM suggested platinum, used mainly in catalysts, would range
between Dollars 380 and Dollars 430 an ounce and was likely to average
Dollars 400 in 1994.
Other events this week include Metal Bulletin's China Metals Conference in
Beijing, starting on Wednesday, while the World Gold Council on Tuesday will
release in London its latest gold demand trends report. On Thursday RTZ, the
world's biggest mining company, will give a briefing to the UK Association
of Mining Analysts.
In Brussels, meanwhile, a two-day meeting of European Union agriculture
ministers commences today. The ministers are expected to give guidelines to
the European Commission on its powers to implement agricultural changes to
respect the new Gatt world trade accord.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Work harder, or not at all - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some curious and significant trends lurked in the latest crop of US
quarterly results. Profits, as might be expected at this stage in the cycle,
were up strongly: by 39 per cent for a sample of larger companies, according
to the Wall Street Journal. Sales volume was also up sharply. The odd fact
was that many manufacturers said they were still shedding labour: odder
still, quite a few were unable to raise their prices.
An extreme but not isolated example was the chemicals giant DuPont, whose
earnings nearly doubled in the quarter. In its polymers division, sales
volume was up a remarkable 15 per cent (and profits by 150 per cent);
prices, however, were 1 per cent lower. Job cuts were continuing across the
group, a representative said. 'Hopefully,' he added, 'we're getting near the
end.'
Here is productivity and no mistake. If this is what the peak of the cycle
looks like, God help the workers in the next downturn. However, the
conventional business cycle may have little to do with it. What we have here
is a real revolution based on information technology and new approaches to
manufacturing.
Nor is it confined to productivity of labour. The inability of manufacturers
to raise their prices is slightly mysterious, but one important reason must
be that they continue to find new ways to raise the productivity of their
plant.
For years, pioneers like General Electric have been using Japanese-style
ingenuity to wring more output from existing machinery. Today, even a car
manufacturer like Ford talks almost casually of moving its output towards
130 per cent of rated capacity. Since this increased flexibility is hard to
capture in official data, it risks distorting monetary policy. If the Fed
puts too much trust in its own figures on capacity utilisation, it could end
up raising rates for the wrong reason.
Other official data point the other way. Although monthly inflation figures
are notoriously unreliable, it is worth recalling that US factory gate
prices (excluding food and oil) fell 0.5 per cent in October, with capital
goods down 1 per cent. The price of cars fell 2.6 per cent - and this at a
time when General Motors was incurring strike action for excessive use of
overtime.
Also last week came figures showing an annualised rise in productivity of
2.7 per cent in the third quarter. This may be small beer to a star
performer like the manufacturer AlliedSignal, which looks on course this
year to hit its regular target of 6 per cent (and which is still laying off
workers, despite having just recorded a double digit sales increase for the
first time in six years). But the figure is still above the average for the
previous 13 quarters.
At the same time, unit labour costs are running only 0.9 per cent up on last
year. Mr Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley, calculates that over
the past four cycles in the US the average rise at this point in the cycle
has been 6.1 per cent. Since, as he observes, labour accounts for 70 per
cent of production costs, this leaves room for further rises in corporate
profits.
From a stock market viewpoint, the productivity revolution might seem
unambiguously good news. So it is, subject to two provisos. First, the
social divisions created by the revolution must be containable. Second, even
those workers who keep their jobs must agree to work increasingly long hours
for the same money or less (see chart).
After all, one of the effects of the revolution from a stock market
perspective is to make labour an expensive nuisance. The biggest industrial
employer in the US is General Motors, with a workforce of 711,000. Dividing
that figure into its market capitalisation gives a stock market value per
worker of some Dollars 63,000. As you drop down the list of top employers,
the valuation rises: Pepsico Dollars 72,000, Ford Dollars 101,000, IBM
Dollars 115,000, General Electric Dollars 403,000. At the other extreme
comes Microsoft, whose 15,000-odd employees carry a price tag of Dollars
2.5m apiece.
Not everyone can become a software designer at Microsoft, while fewer and
fewer blue collar workers can expect to find jobs in Detroit. One of the
most topical and contentious books in America at the moment is The Bell
Curve, by the social scientists Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein. They
argue that America is creating a 'cognitive elite', to which only those of
high intelligence are admitted; also, that intelligence is largely inherited
and thus immutable. One does not have to accept the argument to take the
point: one way or another, the technological revolution is social dynamite.
Even for those who emerge on top, life may be getting tougher. There have
been productivity increases in the service industries, but much of it has
consisted of cutting out layers of bureaucracy. For the survivors,
especially those who work purely with their brains, the only way to increase
output is to work longer hours. According to Mr Roach of Morgan Stanley, the
average work week in US factories is now longer than at any time since the
second world war. Something similar seems to be happening to white collar
workers.
As he also observes, greater exertion is not the same as greater efficiency.
So lengthening hours do not represent true growth in productivity, even if
it shows up as such in the official statistics. If it is not true
productivity, nor is it true wealth. And if, in the long run, harder work
fails to translate into a higher standard of living, the American worker is
likely to rebel.
In a wider context such rebellion may be futile. One does not have to be Sir
James Goldsmith to accept that the blessings of free trade are not unmixed.
Americans and Europeans consume a hugely disproportionate slice of the
global pie. It may be that, in a world without trade barriers, fairer shares
are inevitable.
As the defenders of free trade will point out, there is no reason that the
pie should not become big enough for everyone to be better off; and even in
the short run, those few who stay at the forefront of knowledge may hold on
to their bigger slices. Meanwhile, the average American or European worker
could face a starker choice: work harder for less, or do not work at all.
Again, of course, this is splendid news for the world's stock markets. In
the period of transition to global equilibrium, the providers of capital can
secure skilled labour at cheaper rates than before. For workers, too, this
makes the stock market all the more attractive. After all, if the machine is
going to put you out of work, you might as well have shares in it.

The president of Renown, Japan's largest producer of clothing, has been
demoted in a rare gesture to demonstrate the loss-making company's
determination to reduce the workforce, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Mr Mahiro Matsuzuka, Renown's president since March 1991, will become
vice-president.
The move coincides with the announcement that Renown will cut 700 of its
4,000 jobs by February 1996 in an attempt to pull out of five years of
losses.

<TEXT>
Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment specialist, lifted pre-tax profits by
17 per cent in the nine months to September to SKr837m, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
The improvement, from SKr715m, reflected an 11 per cent jump in sales to
SKr7.27bn and reduced interest costs. The group is optimistic about
prospects. In 1993 full-year profits amounted to SKr976m.
Gambro became part of Incentive, one of the most important companies in the
Wallenberg sphere, in June.
Nine-month sales grew by 9 per cent, excluding currency factors and the sale
of the group's intensive care and anaesthesia division.
Operating profits were 8 per cent higher at SKr1.05bn.

<TEXT>
Telia, the Swedish state-owned telecommunications group, more than doubled
profits in the first nine months, lifting its income after financial items
to SKr4.68bn (Dollars 645m) from SKr1.98bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes
in Stockholm.
Cost-cutting enabled it to overcome intensifying competition in its home
market. The company has shed more than 15,000 jobs in the past three years,
cutting its workforce to less than 33,000.
The recovery in the Swedish economy contributed to a 4 per cent rise in
operating revenues to SKr27.38bn. However, domestic demand has been
restricted by reduced public spending and a slowdown in residential
construction.
The company predicts full-year results substantially higher than last year,
when profits were SKr3.95bn.

nine months

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aegon, the Netherlands' second-largest insurance group, reported a 19 per
cent increase in third-quarter net profit to Fl 285m (Dollars 167m), from Fl
240m a year earlier, and said it was lifting its forecast slightly for
full-year results. Aegon has not given a specific target for 1994 profit.
The rise in the latest quarter takes results for the nine months to
September to Fl 835.6m, up 13.4 per cent.
Premium turnover in the first three quarters jumped by 45 per cent to Fl
10.74bn from Fl 7.41bn. Much of the increase was due to the first-time
consolidation of Scottish Equitable Life in the UK. Without this factor,
premium turnover would have risen by around 6.6 per cent.
Aegon said it would be using a new method of accounting for capital gains
and losses on share and property investments for its own account.
The new calculations, which anticipate impending European Union regulations,
would have 'positive implications' for the level of future dividends, it
said.

FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Inco to proceed with Indonesian
expansion

<TEXT>
Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, is going ahead with a USDollars
500m expansion at PT Inco, its 58 per cent-owned subsidiary in Indonesia.
The project, which will boost PT Inco's annual production by half over the
next six years to about 150m lbs of nickel, is part of the Canadian parent's
plan to lift its production by 20 per cent by the end of the decade. Inco's
output totalled 370m lbs in 1993, about one quarter of worldwide supplies.
The expansion follows the go-ahead for several other projects at Inco's
mines in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba.
The viability of these projects has been improved by a recent surge in
nickel prices. The London Metal Exchange price has climbed from a low of
Dollars 1.80 a lb in Sept 1993 to about Dollars 3.35 at the end of last
week.
The expansion at PT Inco, located in Sulawesi, will include the construction
of a fourth smelting line at Soroako and additional hydro-electric
generating capacity on the Larona River.
Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining owns 20 per cent of PT Inco, with the balance
held by public shareholders and five other Japanese companies.
PT Inco is one of the world's lowest-cost nickel producers, with about 25
years of reserves at planned production rates.

venture

<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Telstra, Australia's large
government-owned telecommunications group, have formed a ADollars 1bn
(USDollars 752m) joint venture to provide pay-TV services via the Telstra
cable network.
They will have equal shares in the venture, although Telstra will own 100
per cent of the cable infrastructure.
Confirmation of the tie-up, which has been rumoured for many weeks, comes
two months after Optus, the rival national telecommunications carrier,
announced plans to link with Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, Seven Network,
and Continental Cablevision of the US, to develop a similar cable network.
Nine is Australia's biggest commercial TV operation, while Seven is a
smaller network.
However, the Optus joint venture, known as Optus Vision, aims to deliver
local telephone calls, as well as pay-TV and other interactive services, and
will involve considerable aerial (rather than underground) cabling.
The Telstra/News joint venture will focus on 'broadband home entertainment
services, and pay-TV in particular'.
Optus Vision plans to spend ADollars 3bn over the next four years.
News/Telstra put the initial outlay at ADollars 300m - split equally -
although the total investment over the next five to seven years could rise
to around ADollars 1bn.
In addition, Telstra's expenditure on the cable infrastructure is put at
around ADollars 3.5bn.
Telstra said its new cabling had now 'passed' more than 50,000 homes -
although final connections to individual homes would still have to be
installed - and it hoped to reach 100,000 homes by the end of 1994.
The aim is to be able to serve 4m homes by 1999.
The partners hope to start providing pay-TV services 'early in 1995'. There
have been numerous promises about pay-TV facilities in Australia, but as yet
consumers have yet to see a package go on sale.
There are now the two cable-based consortia, plus the three satellite
licence holders - Australis Media, Continental Century, and the
publicly-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Greyhound agrees terms of
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greyhound Lines, the loss-making US bus company, has staved off a threat to
force it into bankruptcy by agreeing fresh terms for a financial
restructuring with a group of dissident bondholders.
Earlier this month, a group of convertible debenture holders filed an
involuntary bankruptcy petition against the company because they considered
they were getting a bad deal under the original restructuring terms.
On Friday, the company and its bondholders said that they had agreed in
principle to a deal under which bondholders would receive 45 per cent of the
recapitalised company's common stock in exchange for their Dollars 98.9m
worth of convertible debentures. The bondholders will also get two seats on
the board.
The joint statement said the bankruptcy petition would be withdrawn as soon
as the restructuring was complete.
Although the imminent threat of bankruptcy has been averted, Greyhound
remains troubled.
Since emerging from its last bankruptcy in October 1991, it has been been
pummelled by competition from low-cost airlines and regional bus companies.
Passenger numbers were down nearly 9 per cent in the nine months to
September and the company has reported a series of quarterly losses.
In July, Greyhound announced it would cease to operate long-distance bus
services all over the US and would become a regional operator of relatively
short-distance services in selected markets.
This was followed in August by the departure of the company's chief
executive and in September by proposals for a financial restructuring.
However, bondholders disagreed with the plan because they were offered only
40 per cent of the company's common stock in exchange for their bonds.
Under the revised plan, bondholders will own 45 per cent of the company and
Greyhound will raise Dollars 35m by the issue of new stock equivalent to 29
per cent of the company. As a result, existing shareholders will see their
stake diluted to 26 per cent.
Greyhound hopes the injection of cash will see it through the lean winter
months and provide the basis for a return to profitability.

FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Weak Japanese recovery hits
results at steelmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness of Japan's economic recovery and worldwide competition put
pressure on the country's integrated steel makers, which reported
disappointing half-year results and passed their interim dividends.
Losses by the five large steel companies more than doubled in aggregate at
the recurring level, but analysts pointed out that recovery is on the way.
The companies expect restructuring to result in a substantial improvement in
the second half, enabling them to cut losses substantially or return to
profitability.
'The benefits of restructuring will definitely come through in the second
half, so we believe we will be able to make a small profit,' Nippon Steel
said.
Nevertheless, the companies warned that the outlook for the second half
remained uncertain. Private capital spending in Japan is not expected to
pick up strongly and the foreign exchange situation is still unpredictable.
In the first half, firm demand from overseas markets, particularly the US,
failed to make up for the fall in capital spending in the Japanese market,
the impact of falling unit prices and the high yen. There was a moderate
pick-up in demand from the motor vehicle and electrical industries, but
falling steel prices prevented the companies from reaping the benefits of
the upturn.
Large domestic users in the shipbuilding, automotive and electrical
industries have pointed to the price differential between Japanese
steelmakers and those based overseas, such as in Brazil and Korea, and
requested price cuts from domestic suppliers. The differential has been
widened by the yen's continuing rise against other leading currencies.
Domestic manufacturers have generally complied with the requests, partly
because 'the quality of Korean steel, in particular, is improving,' noted an
official at Sumitomo Metal Industries, which reduced unit prices by 8 per
cent in the period.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barclays sells US credit arm at Dollars
290m premium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Barclays has reached agreement to sell its asset-based lending business in
the US for a premium of Dollars 290m (Pounds 177m) over its book value, a
price which reflects the company's strong track record.
The sale of Barclays Business Credit, which is expected to be completed
early next year, is the latest in a series of disposals intended to leave
the UK banking group with a focus on investment banking business in the US.
The company, which had receivables of Dollars 2.1bn at the end of September
and 15 offices around the US, is being bought by Shawmut, the New
England-based banking group.
Barclays Business Credit, which made profits of Dollars 67.5m before tax
last year and Dollars 58.1m in the nine months to end-September, had net
assets of Dollars 213.7m at the end of last year.
The price paid by Shawmut represents a substantial multiple of this 1993
book value, reflecting the highly profitable nature of its business.
However, Mr Joel Balvard, the US bank's chairman and chief executive, said
the deal was 'financially attractive and immediately accretive to earnings
per share' for Shawmut.
The credit company, which has 300 employees, originates and syndicates loans
of between Dollars 5m and Dollars 150m to medium-sized companies. It had
been part of Aetna, the US insurance group before Barclays bought it in
1980. The sale will result in a pre-tax profit to Barclays of Dollars 271m.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ushers aims to double pubs after cash
raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer, aims to double the size of its pub chain
after coming to market later this month.
The group, which publishes its pathfinder document tomorrow wants to clear
existing debt before expanding its estate of more than 460 pubs.
At present its financing includes Pounds 35m of senior debt and an interest
rate 'collar' which cost Pounds 1.6m this year. Further borrowings are
subject to the agreement of a syndicate of 11 banks.
The cash raising is expected to value the company at Pounds 100m.
Ushers, whose Trowbridge brewery dates back to 1824, was formed in 1991
after a Pounds 71m management buy-in from Courage.
Mr Roger North, chief executive, said the company would benefit from the
large breweries selling pubs in the south-west, where it is the largest
regional brewery.
'We are looking for the small town and village community pub, rather than
the town centre boozer,' he said.
The group has already paid off Pounds 15m of debt in its three years of
existence and invested another Pounds 13m in modernising its pubs and
brewery.
The brewery's first results are also due tomorrow. Analysts forecast
operating profits of Pounds 14.9m on turnover of Pounds 54m, compared to
last year's profits of Pounds 13.4m on Pounds 48.8m turnover.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cookson and JM may merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and Cookson, the specialist
industrial materials group, are considering a merger.
The two companies, which have grown closer over the past 12 months, said
yesterday that discussions were at a relatively early stage. But it is
understood that if a deal is done, events will move quickly, possibly being
completed by the end of the year.
Any recommendations to shareholders would 'be based on the relative
contributions of each company to the merged group,' the two companies said.
Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive of Johnson Matthey, has made
no secret of his ambition to take the company into the FT-SE 100 Index.
The two companies would have a combined market capitalisation of about
Pounds 2.5bn, annual sales of Pounds 3.5bn and forecast profits of more than
Pounds 200m.
JM, which reports its interim results on November 24, is expected to make
pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 90m for the financial year ending March.
Cookson, which is expected to make profits of about Pounds 115m in the year
to end-December before restructuring costs, has been turned round by Mr
Richard Oster, its flamboyant US chief executive. He has taken the group out
of its non-core businesses, selling 25 engineering subsidiaries earlier this
year.
Last December Cookson bought JM's jewellery materials operations for Pounds
37m, and in March the two linked their ceramics interests in a venture that
made them number two in the world market. The latter deal was described by
Mr Oster at the time as 'a sort of dream come true'.
The logical step towards a full-blown merger is thought to have been
instigated by Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson's chairman. He would be likely to
remain on the board of the new company as a non-executive director.
Mr Davies is expected to be chairman. He took on the additional role of
chief executive at JM only in March after Mr Richard Wakeling resigned.
Mr Oster would be chief executive.
It is not the first time that Cookson has taken an interest in JM; it took a
stake in the late 1980s, but had to sell.
The deals between the two companies over the last year have led to a much
more friendly atmosphere this time.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Toad Innovations raising Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toad Innovations, a car security company, is planning to raise about Pounds
2.5m through a private placing of shares that will be traded under the Stock
Exchange's lightly regulated Rule 4.2 facility.
The shares will move to the Alternative Investment Market when it is
launched next year as a replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market.
Toad has negligible sales but is developing a range of products to protect
car and commercial vehicles, including an in-car camera which records
attempted break-ins.
Mr Chris Evans, founder and non-executive chairman, has raised money in the
last two years for two other companies - Chiroscience and Celsis - both of
which availed themselves of Stock Exchange rules allowing biotechnology
companies to float on the main list without an established record. Both were
lossmakers.
Other private backers from Toad's launch in March 1993 include Mr John
Precious, chairman of Celsis and former finance director of Wellcome, and Mr
Bill Edge, director of Grosvenor Venture Managers.
The Toad issue is sponsored by Henry Cooke, an active promoter of issues
under Rule 4.2, formerly known as Rule 535.2.
It said there had been a steady flow of new issues this year, many of which
planned to move to the AIM.
Rule 4.2 issues are particularly tax efficient for some investors. Although
they have quoted shares they are considered private companies, which means
investors can shelter capital gains tax liabilities crystallised on the sale
of almost any asset by investing the gains in shares of companies traded
under the rule.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Asprey furious at Pounds 20m loan 'leak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Scotland will today be launching an investigation into how
documentation purporting to come from the bank on a Pounds 20m loan facility
for Asprey was made public.
Asprey, jeweller to the super-rich, said yesterday that it would be taking
legal action against the Mail on Sunday, which published a story saying that
the company was in potential default of the facility and might face
receivership - a suggestion Asprey dismissed as absurd.
The bank is considering making a statement of its own later this week.
Yesterday it said the loan facility was 'being conducted in accordance with
the terms of the agreement between the bank and the company, and is
therefore fully available'.
Asprey, which will announce its interim results on November 23, said the
Mail on Sunday story 'appears to have been designed to cause maximum damage
to Asprey's reputation and standing in the market place'.
The company's shares tumbled from 310p to 200p in early September after a
warning that the loss of a few big-spending customers would depress profits.
Last month market rumours about its financial position knocked the shares
back to 135p.
The company was forced to put out a statement to the Stock Exchange
asserting that the rumours were 'without basis in fact'.
The shares closed on Friday at 157p.
Asprey said the Mail on Sunday had not contacted the company or the Bank of
Scotland about its story, which appeared to be 'based on a draft, unsigned,
internal memorandum purporting to emanate from the bank'.
Asprey added: 'If the document is genuine, the company believes that it may
have been obtained by unlawful means.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Union sells Sabre for Pounds 8.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union, the discount house, is selling Sabre, its sales aid leasing division
to GE Capital, the financial services side of General Electric of the US,
for Pounds 8.4m cash.
The move marks the conclusion of Union's withdrawal from sales aid leasing.
Payment of Pounds 2.7m is deferred for three years.
The sale will release Pounds 30m of inter-company funding used to finance
Sabre and generate profits of about Pounds 1.5m. Sabre was acquired in 1988
and provides sales aid finance on small ticket items such as office
equipment.
For the 1993 year it achieved profits before tax - and Pounds 1.1m of group
management costs - of Pounds 3.68m, against losses of Pounds 3.26m, on
turnover of Pounds 14m (Pounds 19.6m). The results were helped by lower debt
provisions of Pounds 1.37m, compared with Pounds 5.73m.
Net asset value at completion is expected to be about Pounds 3.6m.
Union said that Sabre had been restrained from writing as much new business
as it would have liked by the fall in the group's capital base in 1991-92.
That had resulted in an ageing portfolio.
If it had remained in the group, Sabre's growth and profitability would have
been constrained for the foreseeable future.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hardy seeks Pounds 9m for syndicate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trickle of extra corporate capital into Lloyd's of London continues
today with the announcement of a new company that plans to raise up to
Pounds 9m to invest in the 1995 underwriting year.
Hardy Underwriting plans to invest exclusively in Lloyd's syndicate 382,
managed by Hardy (Underwriting Agencies), which specialises in helicopters
among other business.
The company intends to raise the cash via an offer of 4.5m units of one
ordinary share at 100p and Pounds 1 of 10 per cent convertible unsecured
loan stock at par.
Other companies expected to announce plans to raise funds in time for 1995
include the Brockbank managing agency, which runs some of the largest
Lloyd's syndicates. Brockbank is aiming to raise up to Pounds 50m,
sufficient to underwrite about Pounds 95m of business on Brockbank
syndicates.
Meanwhile Wellington Underwriting, which is seeking a stock market listing,
is due to complete arrangements this week for placing 30m shares at 100p.
Its efforts have been hindered by the failure of Lloyd's council last week
to approve new arrangements allowing corporate companies to invest in each
other.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, estimates that corporate
investment next year will be only about Pounds 250m more than the total
Pounds 900m committed in 1994, the first year in which corporate capital was
allowed.

FT  14 NOV 94 / BSkyB to float with 19 on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An enormous 19-strong board has been created for the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.5bn
flotation of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting, including five
non-executive directors from outside the entertainment industry.
The move, which will more than double the size of the board, will be
outlined today in the pathfinder prospectus. The price range for the shares
is expected to be 233p-268p.
Another point of interest is likely to be the latest BSkyB subscription
figures. By the end of June, BSkyB said it had 3.45m cable and satellite
subscribers. Recent estimates of a 60,000-a-month growth rate would suggest
that demand is slowing. .
The new directors include Sir John Collins, chairman of Vestey Group and
former chief executive of Shell UK, and Mr Dennis Stevenson, chairman of SRU
consultancy and a director of the Tate Gallery as well as Pearson, the media
group that owns the Financial Times.
Mr Sam Chisholm, BSkyB's chief executive, will remain a director but with a
new contract directly with BSkyB. Concern has been expressed that Mr
Chisholm, who has played an important role in BSkyB's turnround, was
contracted to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, at present owner of 50
per cent of BSkyB.
Other new non-executives are Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive of Philip
Morris, Bass director Mr Philip Bowman and Mr John Thornton of Goldman
Sachs, who set up an auction between News Corp and Pearson over Star TV in
Hong Kong.
The existing two non-executives - Lord St John Stevas and Dame Anne Mueller
 -continue. Mr David Chance, deputy managing director, and Mr Richard
Brooke, finance director, also join the board.
Other News Corp representatives will be Mr Murdoch, Mr Dave Devoe, Mr Gus
Fischer and Mr Arthur Siskind.
On the old BSB side Mr Frank Barlow will remain chairman, Mr Gerry Robinson,
Granada chief executive, will join, as will Mr Jerome Seydoux, Chargeurs
chairman. Mr David Sneddon, chairman of Trinity International, will
represent the old BSB minorities.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Company News this Week: Anxious wait to read the runes on
rent rises - UK Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market will be anxious for signals that rents are rising
and occupiers are taking additional space when Land Securities and Great
Portland Estates, which together make up almost one-third of the quoted
property sector, report interim results next this week.
Neither company revalues its property portfolio at the half-year stage, but
for property values to increase in the long term it is necessary for rents
to rise.
Unless investors see signs of stronger demand for business space, property
shares will remain in the doldrums.
The sector has under-performed
the wider equity market by 15 per
cent since its peak in December last year.
As the UK's largest quoted property company, Land Securities' figures on
Thursday will be especially important for sentiment.
In the first half of last year the company reported rental income of Pounds
192m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 118.9m, including a contribution from
sales of investment property.
Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 118m this time
around.
Great Portland, which cut its dividend in June for the first time in its
35-year history, is expected to show a marked improvement over last year's
Pounds 40m rental income when it announces figures on Tuesday.
In 1993, Great Portland raised Pounds 95m through a rights issue and has
since made a string of acquisitions. Last week it announced the purchase of
seven freehold properties located in Cardiff and Plymouth from a private
company for Pounds 18.9m.
Analysts expect pre-tax profit of around Pounds 17.6m, against Pounds 16m in
the first half of last year.
Both Great Portland and Land Securities are expected to increase interim
dividends by up to 10 per cent.

FT  14 NOV 94 / NPC to reveal buy-out proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Parking Corporation is set to reveal details of a leveraged buy-out
by venture capital institutions, expected to value the business at about
Pounds 650m. The deal, due to be announced at NPC's annual meeting on
December 5, is likely to be the largest UK venture capital buy-out so far
this year.
Prudential Venture Managers should unveil the agreed purchase of around 72
per cent of NPC's shares, primarily owned by founders Mr Ronald Hobson and
Sir Donald Gosling, and charitable foundations of which they are directors.
NPC owns National Car Parks, the biggest operator of car parks in the UK.
Prudential has brought in backers Charterhouse Development Capital, Cinven,
Electra, Montagu Private Equity, NatWest Ventures and Royal Bank Development
Capital. They are expected to put up about 50 per cent of the cost as
equity. The remainder will be funded by bank debt, to be arranged by a
syndicate led by National Westminster Bank.
The founders sold 28 per cent of the company to a number of financial
institutions in 1986, and these are likely to be offered shares in the new
company, as an alternative to the cash offer.
It is understood that no final agreement on pricing has been reached.
However, due diligence is complete, and NPC has written to shareholders
saying: 'We hope to be able to give shareholders further information at the
AGM', when the final offer should be revealed. Shareholders will also be
asked to approve the adoption of new Articles of Association, paving the way
for a change in ownership.
The letter to shareholders accompanied NPC's latest set of profit figures,
for the year to March 1994. Profits before exceptional items rose from
Pounds 48.6m to Pounds 50.4m. However, total pre-tax profits fell to Pounds
50.5m (Pounds 53.3m).
NPC was set up by Mr Hobson and Sir Donald in 1949, but for the past year
the founders have been keen to sell.
The joint chairmen were keen to ensure continuity for the existing
management and turned down the option of a share disposal, via flotation.
Other offers were received by their advisers, Morgan Grenfell, but the
venture capital consortium put forward the highest bid.
The attraction for the new investors is the strong and predictable cashflow
from the UK's largest car parking group, and the potential earnings growth
offered by its more dynamic subsidiary, Green Flag, which controls National
Breakdown.
Green Flag has been aggressively expanding National Breakdown into Europe,
as well as setting up Home Emergency Service, a domestic repair group. A
separate flotation could be launched once these businesses have matured.
The share price of NPC, which trades on a matched bargain basis, has tailed
off in recent weeks, closing at 537 1/2 p on Friday, compared with a 1994
high of 630p, which followed suggestions of a potential price tag of up to
Pounds 800m. At Friday's closing price, NPC has a market capitalisation of
Pounds 632m.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Company News this Week: Go-it-alone group in profits
overdrive - Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo has never looked back since shareholders scuppered its plans to merge
with France's Renault, a fact that will be underlined when it presents
nine-month figures tomorrow.
Sweden's biggest industrial group is expected to report pre-tax profits of
more than SKr12bn (Pounds 1bn) for the period, compared with last year's
SKr1.06bn. Swiss Bank Corp in London forecasts a profit of SKr12.3bn for the
nine months and SKr15.5bn for the full year. The nine-month figures will
include around SKr5bn of one-off gains, mainly from non-core disposals.
Underlying profits have benefited from a big rise in car and truck sales.
Competitiveness has been enhanced by the weak krona and by productivity
gains after three years of cost-cutting.
In the third quarter, profits should exceed SKr3bn, including more than
SKr900m in gains from winding up Protorp, the investment group.
Investors will be hoping to hear more about the group's disposal plans. The
company has said it plans to sell SKr40bn of non-core assets before the end
of 1996 to focus on its core automotive businesses.
The big candidate on the list is BCP, the food and drinks group, which is
worth more than SKr20bn.
The priority on the car side remains model development, which will almost
certainly include deeper collaboration with other manufacturers.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Sweet and sour flow from British Steel: Good results may be
mixed with a tirade against subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If tradition is anything to go by, British Steel's half-year results today
will be accompanied by a molten flow of rhetoric from Mr Brian Moffat,
chairman and chief executive, on the iniquity of subsidies to rival European
Union producers.
Less than a week after the partial withdrawal of the European Commission's
rescue plan for the industry, Mr Moffat is likely to warn that the failure
to achieve required cuts in EU overcapacity, and to tackle the subsidies
issue adequately, will only store up problems for the next downturn.
The company's irritation, however, contrasts strikingly with the gleaming
numbers it is likely to produce today. Analysts are expecting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 130m-Pounds 150m for the half-year to the end of
September, up from Pounds 27m a year ago.
This would put the company on course for expected full-year profits of
Pounds 400m-Pounds 425m, dwarfing last year's Pounds 80m, which included a
Pounds 24m provision for an EU fine. And this from a company which had
combined losses of Pounds 204m in the two previous years.
British Steel has been consistently critical of subsidies in Europe because
it wants a level playing field in an important market. In 1993-94, EU
countries excluding the UK accounted for Pounds 1.03bn of its Pounds 4.19bn
of sales.
But, in the short term at least, market conditions have made the ill-fated
EU rescue plan almost irrelevant. An upturn in demand that began in the UK
last year and has since spread to the continent, along with supply
shortages, has transformed the trading environment.
In sterling terms, prices for strip products are back up to 1989 levels, and
nearly there for sections and plates, says Mr Euan Fraser at James Capel.
Price rises will be 'overwhelmingly the most important' factor in the
results today, he says. The results will provide an important indicator of
how quickly British Steel's profit and loss account is benefiting from the
price rises.
Contracts with big customers are fixed annually, which complicates any
forecast. But Mr Tim Bennett at Albert E. Sharp, the Birmingham-based
brokers, says half-year profits above Pounds 130m could make his full-year
forecast of Pounds 425m - already revised upwards from Pounds 320m - look
conservative.
Mr Fraser believes there is scope for British Steel to raise prices further.
Other positive factors are lower raw material costs and interest charges,
and a much better performance from associated companies, especially Avesta
Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer. In September, British
Steel raised its stake in Avesta from 40 to 49.9 per cent.
British Steel could easily make Pounds 650m in 1995-96 and Pounds 900m in
the following year, says Mr Fraser at James Capel. He warns, however, that
'once you look that far out it is guesswork'.
It is in the later 1990s, when the next dip in a historically cyclical steel
market may be expected, that the failure of the EU's rescue plan could
become more relevant to British Steel and its ambitions in Europe.
In evidence to the House of Commons trade and industry committee earlier
this month, the company said the outcome of the EU restructuring plan had
brought it minimal benefits.
The required shake-out of excess steel capacity in the EU, which would have
taken place in the recession under free market conditions, had not occurred,
it said. 'The fundamental overcapacity will still be there at the next
downturn,' it added, 'putting a number of producers which have benefited
from subsidies/debt forgiveness in a considerably stronger position.'
In a falling market British Steel is unlikely to find it any easier to make
profits in Europe than it does now. It places the blame on subsidies, and
the significant level of state ownership in the industry. In only two of the
last 20 years, it says, have the EU producers earned a level of operating
profit adequate to ensure long-term viability - 13 per cent of turnover
according to the commission (see table).
This scenario explains why, in recent months, British Steel's more confident
post-recession stance on investment has been mainly directed towards
projects outside Europe, where profits long-term are likely to be higher.
The most important was the Dollars 154m investment, announced last month, to
build a plate mini-mill at the Tuscaloosa Steel subsidiary in Alabama, but
expansion in the Far East is also continuing.
In contrast British Steel's European investments, such as the Pounds 85m
being spent on increasing its Avesta Sheffield stake, are likely to remain
highly selective.

The result of Sweden's referendum on EU membership yesterday should ease
pressure on government bonds and give a boost to the Stockholm stock market.
Although a Yes vote had been mostly discounted, last-minute jitters caused
by adverse opinion polls had made the markets increasingly volatile. The
expectation that EU economic convergence will force tighter control over
government spending should reduce the spread between German and Swedish
bonds. The krona should also benefit in anticipation of greater inward
investment.

</HEADLINE>

Interim losses from Japan's steel industry, the world's largest, were as the
market expected: truly awful.
The best that can be said is that the industry is at the bottom of the
cycle. The companies believe losses will fall sharply in the second half.
But the reprieve will only be temporary. Restructuring during the recession
has been cosmetic by US and even European standards. Japan still has excess
capacity of around 20m tonnes on most estimates. It would be too much to
expect across-the-board capacity cuts during a cyclical upturn. But unless
the industry uses the next few years to reduce capacity, the next downturn
will be just as bad as the recent one.

FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Astra
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite worldwide constraints on healthcare spending, there is still a
bright future for pharmaceuticals companies with productive research and
development. Astra, the Swedish drugs group, demonstrated as much last week.
While most drugs groups are struggling to grow, Astra posted a 24 per cent
increase in earnings for the first nine months of the year. More is yet to
come. Astra should benefit from regaining control of distribution channels
for its medicines in the US and Japan. This month's Dollars 820m marketing
joint-venture with Merck will help it boost US sales of ulcer drug Losec,
its top-selling product. The medicine accounts for only 19 per cent of the
US ulcer market, where Glaxo's rival Zantac drug still has a clear lead,
compared with 40 per cent in the UK. Astra's sales will be further enhanced
when its second most important product, asthma drug Pulmicort, is approved
in the US.
Astra's shares are on a prospective p/e price earnings for 1995 of 14 - only
a slight premium to US drugs stocks. Yet analysts expect Astra to increase
earnings by nearly 20 per cent a year over the next five years. That
compares with not much over 10 per cent expected from the US pharmaceuticals
sector. There are two technical reasons why the group's market rating does
not reflect its fundamental value: Swedish institutions have been forced
sellers because of rules limiting their dependence on one stock; and US
investors have been put off by the lack of a US listing. With a New York
quote planned for early next year and the added interest in Swedish markets
from the country's EU membership, the shares should rise.

FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: German equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a tentative reordering of investors' priorities in the German
equity market. Bank stocks, poor performers for most of 1993 and 1994, have
recently picked up: shares in Deutsche Bank, for example, have outperformed
the market by 7 per cent since the beginning of October. By contrast
cyclicals, which helped drive the market to its peak in May, have lost some
of their lustre. Retailers too are down by 9 per cent relative to the market
in the past month.
These changes look like a search for a new direction in an equity market
overshadowed by gloom in the bond markets. In the case of retailers, there
has been no recent change in fundamentals, merely a heightened awareness of
the poor consumer spending climate. But the modest shift from cyclicals to
financials appears prompted by valuation anomalies. Share prices of
chemicals companies stand at a multiple of 14 times next year's earnings,
while those of steel group Thyssen are at 10 times. These ratings are high
by historical standards. The opposite is true for banks, whose shares stand
on extremely low valuations.
Until recently investors have been willing to wait patiently for the full
upsurge in profits from cyclical companies. But the moves over the past
month suggest that such patience is wearing thin and shareholders are
casting around for new areas of outperformance. For bank shares to rebound
strongly there will need to be a change of mood in the bond markets. Canny
investors may do well to make the switch now.

FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Marketing gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Should the Bank of England make the gilt market more investor-friendly? That
is the central question the Treasury will have to answer in its review,
launched last week, of the government debt arrangements. Traditionally, the
Bank has run the market more to suit its needs than those of investors.
Perhaps that matters little when it was a near-monopoly supplier of bonds to
UK investors. But as it increasingly competes for funds on global markets,
so the Bank needs to pay more attention to meeting investor demands.
Investors have a long list of changes they would like to see. The priority
is probably the inauguration of an 'open repo' market under which they would
be able to borrow and lend gilts freely. Such a system would increase
liquidity in the market and enable investors to go short. With the Bank
already investigating the idea, repos could be given the go-ahead before the
Treasury review is finished. Other items on investors' wish lists include:
streamlining the range of gilts available so there were fewer stocks with
greater liquidity; announcing in advance which stocks the Bank was to issue
so investors would have time to think what they wished to buy; and paying
interest gross, so removing the disadvantage gilts suffer by comparison with
many rival bonds.
The Bank may think it is beneath its dignity to woo investors in this way.
But taxpayers cannot be happy that gilts yield more than many other
governments' bonds despite the fact that UK inflation prospects are now
relatively good. It would be false to attribute all this spread to
technicalities about how the market operates. But if a more
investor-friendly approach could shave even a little off the cost of funding
government debt, it would be well worth it.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Brussels probes regional aid fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's anti-fraud unit is investigating a series of
alleged financial irregularities involving cash spent on projects to boost
the economies of European Union's poorer member states.
The inquiries are likely to be controversial because of the general view in
Brussels that the amount of fraud in its regional funds programme is
minimal.
However, an official in the anti-fraud unit, Uclaf, which is being expanded
because of mounting political concern about the scale of fraud, said it was
'naive' to think that there was little or no fraud in the EU's structural
aids programmes.
Structural aid covers transport, industry and sewage treatment projects in
the EU's poorer countries such as Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and parts
of Italy. In most cases, cash paid by Brussels is matched by similar amounts
from the member governments. Regional aid schemes account for about 25 per
cent of the EU's budget, but the proportion will rise sharply over the next
few years.
Of 90 current investigations by Uclaf, about a third involve cases of
suspected fraud in structural aid projects. The rest involve agriculture
spending, promotion of tourism and illicit import or export declarations.
Experts believe that between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of the EU's annual
Ecu70bn (Pounds 54.6bn) budget is wasted through fraud or related financial
irregularities. Most reported fraud cases concern agriculture spending.
The Uclaf view is that much of the fraud in the structural aid programme is
hidden by the failure of member states to report on where the spending is
taking place.
An Uclaf official said: 'When a member government spots an irregular payment
(in this type of programme) the tradition is for it to drop the project from
the list of schemes being funded and start a new one, without telling
Brussels. We have to fight against this kind of practice.'
Uclaf's stance may be helped by new rules, introduced in the summer, under
which Brussels could tell member states that they will be less likely to get
cash in future if they fail to comply.
Among the Uclaf cases involving structural funds are several instances of
cash apparently being diverted to companies or individuals instead of being
spent on training programmes.
In other investigations, officials are looking at a series of road building
projects which appeared to lead to excessive profits for specific
contractors.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Schumacher takes world title despite crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Michael Schumacher leading Britain's Damon Hill in the Adelaide
Grand Prix yesterday. On the 36th lap the pair crashed out of the race
spectacularly, which meant that Schumacher became the first German world
motor-racing champion, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
Schumacher was leading when Hill clipped the side of the German's
Benetton-Ford while trying to overtake on the inside of a turn. Out went
Schumacher. And out went Hill's Williams-Renault, which suffered structural
damage. The British driver had needed to pip Schumacher to snatch the title.
Yesterday's race was the climax to a Formula One season marked by tragedies
and controversies. In the end, though, motor racing confirmed its status as
one of the most glamorous of big-time, big-money sports.
Britain's Nigel Mansell won the Adelaide race in a Williams-Renault as his
team took the constructors' championship for a third year running.
Schumacher won the drivers' championship with 92 points. Hill had 91,
followed by Gerhard Berger of Austria (41). Schumacher won eight races this
season, Hill six.

FT  14 NOV 94 / China calls for summit over entry into world trade body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China said yesterday that its negotiations to become a founder member of the
World Trade Organisation next January faced stalemate unless government
leaders in Beijing and Washington intervened directly.
Speaking before a meeting in Jakarta today between President Bill Clinton of
the US and President Jiang Zemin of China, Mr Long Yong Tu, Beijing's chief
trade negotiator, said the talks had become so difficult that ministers and
officials could not complete them on their own.
He accused Washington of holding up the talks by making arbitrary and
frequently changing demands. Although China offered what Mr Long called
'very important' concessions - including a sharp increase in the number of
Chinese cities open to foreign banks - the US had not responded positively,
he said.
Mr Long also appeared cool towards recent US and EU suggestions that they
would be ready, if necessary, to extend the talks beyond the end of this
year.
'We are really at the end of our patience,' he said. He hinted that Beijing
might even walk away from the talks if no further progress was made soon.
'We know China can do very well without Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).'
However, Mr Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's trade representative,
insisted that progress in the talks depended on China. He said after a
meeting with Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, that most countries
on the Gatt committee dealing with China's application agreed that Beijing
had not moved far enough to open its market.
Mr Long did not rule out making more concessions in talks with the US next
month. However, he complained that every time China had sought to meet US
demands, Washington had responded by asking for more.
He also accused the US of 'double standards' in pursuing aggressive
unilateral trade policies while claiming to uphold the world trade system.
'They never take Gatt seriously.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Personal View: Fault line on road to monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM MATHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem perverse that the future of economic and monetary union in
Europe now looks dependent mainly on attitudes to institutional change and
to political union. Yet that is the picture emerging from the latest
discussions initiated by Karl Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman for the
Christian Democrats in Germany's Bundestag.
His insistence in last Monday's Financial Times (Personal View) that there
is a 'fundamental link between monetary and political unions' undoubtedly
reflects a powerful strand of opinion. For example, Mr Hans van den Broek,
the European Commissioner, declared in London recently that economic
integration was a means, not an end: the end was a political union.
Experts in the development of the Ecu believe that the critical next step in
Emu is to establish institutional parameters necessary for the Bundesbank to
lead a move forward through Maastricht's Emu stages.
Yet just as these issues become conjoined in key players' minds, there are
signs of basic divisions of opinion on all aspects of the institutional
agenda. For once, French opinion, and British, seems markedly at variance
with that in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU.
In Brussels recently, Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for Europe,
warned that a Maastricht-style attempt to push a 'federalist' agenda for the
1996 intergovernmental conference, or indeed one that was seen to attack
national sovereignty, would fail to pass either a referendum or through the
Assemblee Nationale.
His remarks were a pointed response to Mr Lamers' notorious paper which, in
the course of its clumsy advance across the national sensibilities of
virtually every Union member, had lectured France on her attachment to 'the
sovereignty of the etat nation which has long since become an empty shell'.
Moderate opinion in the CDU and the Christian Social Union, its more
Euro-sceptical sister party, has subsequently expressed concern about the
paper, especially its suggestion of a 'hard core' of fast-track Euro states.
Ironically, however, this is perhaps the most logical part of the paper. As
Mr Lamers, its co-author, said last week: 'Someone who, like John Major,
accepts the method of variable geometry in principle can neither disapprove
of nor prevent the establishment of a hard core.'
The deeper problem lies elsewhere and has received less attention: the
current German approach is strongly centralist. It explicitly envisages that
the European Commission will 'take on features of a European government'. It
downgrades the Council of Ministers to a second chamber of the European
Parliament. It seems to ignore the role of national parliaments.
In fact, it seeks to create a single European state. Karl Lamers in Paris
last week was quoted as arguing for a federal concept of Europe that would
eventually become 'a state and not just a confederation of states'. This is
precisely the fear of those who see Emu as a means to political union. Now
the shape of that political union is being blurted out by its most
influential advocates, Helmut Kohl's CDU.
It is no wonder that Dominique Baudis, French CDS leader in the European
Parliament and a CDU ally, objected to the use of the term 'federalism' in
any 1996 treaty, to the idea of the Commission achieving supranational
governmental powers, and to the downgrading of the Council of Ministers.
The Franco-German fault line is becoming clear, sharpened by France's
presidential elections. French opinion increasingly seeks to base European
reform on giving power to national governments, national parliaments and the
Council of Ministers. It is difficult to see how an Emu based on abolition
of national currencies and a political union strategy based on a
Commission/European parliament duopoly could satisfy French electors.
However closely economies may converge, without more agreement on the next
steps to political co-operation it is difficult to see how Emu could
progress. No wonder the distinguished European Parliament constitutional
expert, Fernand Herman, is gloomy. Observing that the chances of achieving
unanimity at the 1996 intergovernmental conference are practically
non-existent, he added: 'The chances of realising a lasting monetary union
without reinforcing the political union are just as slim'.
It has become conventional to praise the CDU/CSU paper and Mr Lamers himself
for having initiated a valuable debate. With its undiplomatic frankness it
has laid the key questions of Europe's political and economic future on the
table, in good time for 1996, while exposing profound differences between
Germany and her chief European partners. It is these differences that will
need to be overcome.
The author is an MEP and president of the European Policy Forum.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James Goldsmith is on a mission. Should the most flamboyant new member
of the European Parliament prove anywhere near as successful in politics as
he has been in business his colleagues had better look for new jobs.
Becoming an MEP was almost a spin-off for Goldsmith from his campaign
against Gatt. However, once inside the temples of Strasbourg and Brussels,
he has decided that the only rational response to a massive, wasteful
'Eurocracy' was to campaign fervently for its destruction.
'This place is a putrid pseudo-democracy, full of uprooted trash,' rages
Brussels' most outspoken new boy, who has set up his command post in the
drab office of the L'Autre Europe group he heads. Like a big cat abandoned
in Belgravia he stalks the halls of the labyrinthine parliament building,
bemused, appalled, but very far from intimidated.
Members encountered in the corridors are right to jump, as if they might be
eaten. It is his sole reason for being there. Despite his venture into
politics he does not regard himself as another Silvio Berlusconi or Ross
Perot. 'The only man ever to go into parliament with honest intent was Guy
Fawkes. I feel the same way,' says Goldsmith.

However, on reading the fine print it seems that the editors of Rupert

Things seem to be picking up for the family of the late Robert Maxwell, the
disgraced media tycoon. Betty Maxwell, his widow, has started popping up
everywhere giving her version of life with the megalomaniac.
Her new biography - A Mind of My Own - can only increase sympathy for young
Ian and Kevin Maxwell who are due to stand trial next year for their
involvement in alleged fraud relating to their late father's media empire.
However, it raises the question of whether the authorities acted correctly
in banning Maxwell the Musical on the grounds that it might prejudice a fair
trial for the Maxwell boys.
Talking of fair trials, a young jock looking remarkably like Ian Maxwell was
testing out the equipment last week at the Pounds 800-a-year Mecklenburgh
Health Club, normally a favoured haunt of slim-line lawyers rather than
recipients of legal aid.
Perhaps he is getting in training for next year's big fight with the Serious
Fraud Office?

FT  14 NOV 94 / More smoke than light: Could private sector borrowing for
the huge Channel tunnel project have been better managed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome it may be, but is it enough? That is the question worried bankers
are asking as passenger revenues finally pour into Eurotunnel's coffers this
week.
At the time of the rights issue in May, the projected cost of servicing the
Pounds 7.9bn mountain of debt raised to finance the cross-channel venture
was put at Pounds 546m for 1995.
Since then delays have eaten into forecast revenue, while short-term
interest rates have risen. Within 12 months, after a full season of
operations, it will be clear whether Eurotunnel is capable of surmounting
this awesome hurdle against a deteriorating financial background.
Meantime the markets are offering a provocative answer to the conundrum
about the bankers' huge exposure. In the secondary market in Eurotunnel's
main Pounds 6.8bn tranche of bank debt, the price quoted by a leading dealer
on Friday was 55 pence in the pound for those willing to sell and 62 for
would-be purchasers, against the par value of 100 at which most of the
220-odd banks involved still carry the loan on their books.
The market is small in relation to the total debt. But its assessment of the
prospects points to a potential write-down of just over Pounds 3bn and a
large negative net worth for the company.
Since the worst of the price fall came after the rights issue, the market
clearly believes the slender but positive year-end cash balances projected
in the rights document will be negative. Participants in this market,
including bank lenders to Eurotunnel, appear not to regard the tunnel
operator as financially viable in its present form.
As for the equity shares, they are down more than 70 per cent from their
peak and are worth a little less than when floated in 1987. The prospectus
then promised a dividend yield on the offer price of 16 per cent by 1994, 34
per cent by 1998 and 60 per cent by 2003. Now 2003 is the earliest date
Eurotunnel dares to forecast an initial payout.
According to one battle-weary trader last week, with tongue only slightly in
cheek, the market may still be 15 years too cheerful about the dividend
timetable. While Eurotunnel is a splendid engineering achievement, it is
hard to deny that it has been a financial fiasco so far.
Could private sector financing for such a large infrastructure project have
been better managed? Just possibly. In the heady banking climate of 1987 the
banks would have been better advised to demand a bigger cushion of equity
before advancing money. Whether it would have been available is a moot
point. British institutional investors, in particular, were reluctant. And
with good reason. The lessons of history are not encouraging. Indeed, the
first rule of big international infrastructure project financing in the 19th
century was that initial shareholders rarely emerge well.
That was certainly true of Egypt and Ferdinand de Lesseps' Suez Canal
project. The country lost Pounds 8m on the shares before defaulting on its
loans when the canal company's revenues were insufficient to service the
related debt. As for the Panama Canal, another project started by de Lesseps
with private finance, it had to be completed under US government ownership.
Domestic British infrastructure projects, including rail and tunnel
ventures, were not uniformly disastrous in the Victorian period. Yet many,
including the first tunnel under the Thames, generated rewards only for
later owners, sometimes after two or three bankruptcies.
This serves to underline the peculiar nature of project financing. In most
normal bank-lending business, the problem for the bank is that it knows less
about the project or business to be financed than the borrower. The
peculiarity of much large-scale project finance is that there is symmetry in
the lack of information: the borrower and lender may both be in the dark
given that such projects are inevitably one-offs. Small wonder the historic
record is so disheartening.
In the 19th century, English financiers sought to overcome the problem by
using uncalled capital. Investors were required to make an initial
down-payment, and could be called upon for further capital as money was
needed. The snag, apparent in the railway boom of the 1840s, was that this
encouraged speculation: speculators who found themselves unable to pay would
dump partly-paid shares, so depressing the market. Financiers responded with
innovations such as vendor shares for contractors, and preference shares and
debentures, giving secure income to investors.
Today forecasting for infrastructure projects is more scientific. Yet
neither Eurotunnel, the railways nor the banks really know how buoyant or
otherwise revenues will be. And, ironically, the banks have unwittingly
found themselves in the role of 19th century investors, since their original
loan has turned out to be no more than a down-payment, followed by urgent
calls from Eurotunnel for more.
Meantime financiers have come up with a possible answer to the 20th century
equivalent of the dumping problem. The development of secondary markets in
the debt of distressed companies means - or so their proponents claim - that
weak banks may not pose a threat to debt refinancing. They can pass the buck
to others by selling on the debt.
At Eurotunnel the market is still small. According to Mr Martin Dent, a
London-based vice-president of Bankers Trust, which reckons to have the
lion's share of the business, Pounds 120-130m of Eurotunnel's debt is now
traded in the secondary market. The reason the trade is limited is that the
sale of debt would force the banks to recognise a loss equivalent to 45 per
cent of their exposure. A specific provision would then have to be made
against profits.
This is an odd reflection on the nature of bank provisioning, which is
designed to deal with the problem of the lack of marketability of bank
assets. In the absence of a market, provisions and write-offs take place
only late in the day, when the loss of value is beyond dispute. Yet the
development of secondary markets in the debt of distressed companies appears
to make a nonsense of this traditional accounting practice.
A further reproach to the accounting profession is that the trade in bank
debt also reflects other forms of creative accounting. According to Gary
Klesch of Klesch &amp; Company, a London-based debt broker and analyst, much of
the Eurotunnel secondary market activity has been driven by banks swapping
Eurotunnel debt for paper in more creditworthy financial institutions
carrying a lower interest coupon.
In many continental European countries, auditors allow the new debt to be
put onto the books at the value of the old, despite the loss of income. The
bank then has the benefit of a less risky asset that has to be backed by
less regulatory capital.
Some banks are now beginning to make specific provisions against Eurotunnel
debt, so market activity is driven less by accountancy arbitrage than by
direct sales for cash. For once the provisions have been made, the trade no
longer has such unpleasant implications for the carrying value of the loan
in the banks' books. The message, not for the first time, is that bank
provisioning is driven more by an upturn in bank profitability than any
realistic assessment of loan assets by banks and their auditors.
The big question about this market, which has always worried the Bank of
England, is whether new investors will be willing participants in any
financial reconstruction of Eurotunnel. If the market's judgment about the
value of Eurotunnel's debt is right, an important test will come soon. A
serious shortfall of revenue next year would point to a stay of interest
payments and a capital reconstruction, probably involving the banks in
swapping debt for equity.
If, as Gary Klesch and others in the market argue, new investors have an
overwhelming interest in improving the company's financial position,
Eurotunnel could end up with a more viable capital structure. The secondary
market in debt would then take off, since the debt-equity swap would require
banks to make provisions in their accounts, making it easier for them to
sell out.
In theory, the trade could then grow from the present Pounds 130m to a
multi-billion pound market. That potential no doubt explains why big US
institutions like Bankers Trust and Continental Bank are prepared to trawl
in what, for the moment, is a very small pond.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Leading Article: An end to privilege
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers and chancellors seldom jump at the prospect of making the
tax system more efficient. Mostly they need the added incentive that reform
will be popular. By all accounts, Mr Kenneth Clarke is becoming convinced
that reducing biases against employment in the coming UK budget would meet
this condition, making the system fairer as well as more effective. What he
may not have realised is that improving the tax treatment of savings offers
the same prize.
Raising the UK's meagre gross saving rate is a worthy goal, but the evidence
is that governments can do little to make their citizens save more. What
they can determine, however, is the level of public dis-saving, and the
allocation of private savings. After his tough budget last year, Mr Clarke
can already claim to have done the first of these. He should explore the
other side of a pro-savings policy in his second budget, acting to ensure
that the resources he has freed do not have to be mangled by a distorting
tax system, but flow to the areas offering the highest pre-tax economic
return.
The best way to achieve such a neutral treatment of savings would be to move
to an expenditure system of taxation. Governments have understandably
baulked at the thought of such a drastic reform. But the introduction of
fiscally privileged forms of savings - personal equity plans, tax exempt
special savings accounts, and, most recently, the venture capital funds
which Mr Clarke announced last year - means that most personal saving now
receives close to an expenditure tax treatment.
Heavily penalised
Granting tax privileges incrementally is politically attractive, perhaps,
but it goes against the goal of taxing funds efficiently. Offering a mass of
different tax concessions only further encourages savers to select assets
for tax reasons rather than for the relative economic return. The system is
now less distortive than it used to be. But, as the Institute for Fiscal
Studies pointed out in its recent 'Green Budget', housing and pensions still
enjoy negative effective tax rates, whereas standard interest bearing
accounts are heavily penalised.
If there is one defence for the arbitrary extension of fiscal concessions,
it is that sooner or later a privilege becomes a right. This year, Mr Clarke
faces just such a moment of truth with regard to TESSAs, introduced in 1990.
TESSAs were a way of offering some of the advantages of PEPs to the
non-share-owning classes. By opening a TESSA, individuals could receive
tax-free interest on savings of up to Pounds 9,000, for a period of five
years. For the first TESSAs, that grace period will end in January.
Destabilising exodus
There are now 4m TESSAs, with combined funds of over Pounds 20bn. Little of
this money represents additional saving: by and large, account-holders
simply moved funds into TESSAs to earn the extra return. Letting the tax
concession lapse risks a highly destabilising exodus of funds, as
sophisticated savers rush to transfer their money elsewhere. It would also
imply that extending fiscal privilege to the less sophisticated was a
temporary gimmick, not a long-term commitment to treating savers more
equitably.
The least wealthy hold most of their wealth in interest-bearing accounts.
Rather than allowing the gap between rich and poor savers to widen, Mr
Clarke should decide to narrow it further, combining PEPs and TESSAs into a
single scheme. Individuals would be able to earn tax-free returns by
investing in any kind of financial asset, including ordinary cash deposits.
This could be achieved at little or no cost to the exchequer, if necessary,
by setting a limit on contributions somewhat lower than the existing Pounds
9,000 limit for PEPs.
Reform along these lines, when combined with the ongoing reduction in the
value of mortgage interest relief, would go a long way towards a neutral tax
treatment of household savings. Mr Clarke may think fiscal neutrality a
rather dull theme for budget day, but he could claim a more resounding
motive. Namely, that a government which wants more people to leave the
security of the dole, for the ups and downs of the labour market, has no
business penalising their attempts to provide themselves with the security
of easily accessible savings.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Brisk start for Mr Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's coalition has made a business-like start to the new legislative
period by rapidly completing talks on a new government programme ahead of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's planned re-election by parliament tomorrow. The
sharp decline in the coalition's majority to only 10 seats from 134 before
last month's election has resulted in a welcome reduction in the propensity
for squabbling between Mr Kohl's conservatives and the liberal Free
Democrats.
In its efforts to present an image of unity, the coalition has glossed over
some divisive issues in areas such as law and order and extending
citizenship to foreign residents. That leaves a risk of future conflict
open. However, in its general prescriptions for streamlining government,
lowering the tax burden and increasing incentives for employment, the
coalition is pointing in the right direction.
Policy proclamations are one thing, but delivery is another. The true test
of the government's mettle will be whether Mr Kohl shows not only the will
but also the capacity to improve Germany's economic structure and increase
its decision-making role on the international stage. In both areas,
reflecting his weakened domestic position and the complexity of post-cold
war politics in Europe, the chancellor will be fighting against adverse
circumstances.
On the international front, Mr Kohl's re-election comes at a particularly
difficult time. The US move to stop enforcing the United Nations arms
embargo against Bosnia will severely strain Europe's efforts to maintain a
consensus on the conflict in former Yugoslavia. The chancellor's need to
take greater account of the opposition Social Democrats will constrain
Germany's ability to play a fuller part in European defence arrangements, in
spite of the lifting of constitutional hurdles on deployment of troops
outside Nato.
Growing disarray
Having carved out a niche in history for accomplishing German unification,
Mr Kohl would like to leave the chancellorship in 1998 as the man who
brought about a matching unification of Europe. However, growing disarray in
France over European policies, as well as scepticism in Germany about wider
supranational European decision-making, may force Mr Kohl to trim his sails.
Foreign affairs played little part either in the election campaign or in the
past three weeks' coalition negotiations. It is on its domestic record,
above all on its handling of the economy, that Mr Kohl's coalition will
stand or fall. Necessary budgetary consolidation has been achieved so far
mainly through tax increases rather than spending reductions, making fresh
cuts in public expenditure a priority for the next four years.
Painful decisions
The Free Democrats have successfully pressed for a commitment to phase out
next year's 7.5 per cent tax surcharge as soon as possible, and to reassess
it annually. However, if it is to achieve the conditions for tax cuts, the
government will have to prepare the electorate for painful decisions on
pruning spending, above all on social security. In view of the Social
Democrats' strong position in the Lander (federal states), the government
will need a large measure of SPD compliance to carry out such policies.
Budgetary control will be a less onerous task if - as the Bonn finance
ministry is assuming - real economic growth continues during the next three
years at this year's rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent. However, a combination of
this year's 2 percentage point rise in long-term interest rates and next
year's sharp tax increases may make 1995 growth less buoyant than the
government is at present forecasting. Depending on the need for more
budgetary rigour, the Social Democrats may eventually try to engineer formal
entry into the government, in a grand coalition with the Christian
Democrats, as the price for supporting Mr Kohl's economic policies.
Unlike the apparent situation in President Bill Clinton's US, in Germany the
economy will continue to shape governmental fortunes. It will also determine
whether Mr Kohl can, during the next four years, realise his goal of big
steps forward in European integration at the 1996 EU inter-governmental
conference - or whether he has to settle for something rather less
ambitious.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery charities body will make
right start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SIEFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Permit me to present a more positive picture of the National Lottery
Charities Board than that in your article, 'Charities facing long delays for
funds from lottery' (November 11). Contrary to the impression given in the
article the NLCB is making good progress and has the full backing of many in
the voluntary sector, including the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations.
Since the board was appointed less than four months ago it has met regularly
and agreed its draft guidelines. As I mentioned in my speech at the
Charities Aid Foundation conference, we expect to appoint our chief
executive in early December and we will begin full consultation with the
voluntary sector in early January. I went on to say: 'We will be inviting
applications during the course of the coming year with the aim of making
grants towards the latter part of 1995 - if we can do it earlier, we will.
But we shall do it properly.'
With more than 700,000 voluntary groups eligible to apply to us and in
excess of Pounds 100m available to distribute in the first year alone, the
NLCB will be the UK's largest general grant-giving foundation. It would be
irresponsible in the extreme for us to promise to rush grants out early in
1995, before we have in place the professional staff and systems necessary
to ensure that we are fair, effective and transparent in all our actions.
The NLCB has a unique opportunity to make a tremendous impact on the lives
of the poor and disadvantaged in society, and to improve the quality of life
in the community. We are determined to be successful in this and we believe
that time spent in getting things right now will lay solid foundations for
the future.

FT  14 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: General of the assembly - Klaus Hansch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Hansch, the new president of the European Parliament, has made a
brisk start: his aim is to establish the assembly as a more powerful and
more credible force in the European Union.
Late last week, the parliament forced a delay in the investiture of the new
Commission, due to take office on January 7, until (probably) late January.
Under the Maastricht treaty, the parliament has the power to endorse or
reject the entire Commission. Mr Hansch argued that parliamentarians from
those states due to join the Union on January 1 - Austria, Finland, Norway
and Sweden - must take part in the parliament's vote if their commissioners
are part of the new Brussels executive. 'We must have a parliament of 16
voting on a Commission of 16,' said a senior aide to Mr Hansch.
A no-nonsense German Social Democrat, Mr Hansch's ambition is clear. He
wants the Strasbourg assembly to have rights in EU decisions almost equal to
the Council of Ministers. This would give him a weight nearly equal to the
president of the Commission, which proposes EU laws.
Already there are those in Brussels who sense that Mr Hansch could become a
front-rank Euro-player, particularly once presidency of the Commission has
fallen from Mr Jacques Delors, a powerful proponent of EU integration, to
the untested Mr Jacques Santer from Luxembourg.
Leading member states, moreover, are keen to clip Brussels' wings, while
Germany wants to enhance Strasbourg's powers in the course of the 1996
constitutional review of the Maastricht treaty.
With this moderately fair wind behind it, the parliament has, under Mr
Hansch, already seized an additional right to individual, public vetting of
appointees to the Commission - by threatening not to put the endorsement of
the entire Commission on its agenda. It now plans US Senate-style
confirmation hearings on the 21 new commissioners.
At the centre of Mr Hansch's programme is an appeal to democratic
legitimacy. 'He is a conviction politician,' the aide says, as well as a
pragmatic, procedurally-versed veteran who entered the parliament when it
was first directly elected in 1979.
Close collaborators describe him as on the right of the German Social
Democratic party, in the mould of Mr Helmut Schmidt, former German
chancellor.
Mr Hansch says he wants 'to concentrate on legislative work and the most
important priorities' and leave aside issues the parliament cannot
influence, such as EU policy on Bosnia.
The central idea is not an indiscriminate grab for more power but ensuring
what he calls 'double legitimacy'. Euro MPs should vote on decisions which
national assemblies have not examined, because they are taken without
parliamentary debate by ministers, or, more frequently, by their officials
meeting behind closed doors in Brussels.
This is not a zero-sum competition with national legislatures, he insists,
but an attempt 'to obtain control over European policy-making, to do what
national parliaments can not do'.
He is formalising joint committees of European and national MPs to
strengthen the role of elected lawmakers in EU decision-making processes and
to correct an imbalance which favours the executive.  'I don't see (national
parliaments) as rivals; I see them as partners,' he says.
Europe's parliament 'must have full rights of co-decision' in all laws where
the Council of Ministers can reach a decision by majority voting, he argues.
Maastricht partially gave the Strasbourg assembly this right of veto over
the Council, but excluded a number of areas such as environmental and
transport policy.
Mr Hansch would not extend the parliament's blocking rights into areas in
which Council decisions must be unanimous, such as on treaty, tax or nearly
all foreign policy questions. But 'where governments can be outvoted, all
legislation needs to be legitimised twice,' argues Mr Hansch. 'If there is
no consensus' between the European Parliament and Council, he says bluntly,
'then there will be no law'.
Euro-MPs have so far twice vetoed the Council, most recently over a voice
telephony law, on which the issue was not proposed liberalisation but the
assembly's right to detailed and early consultation on it.
Yet Mr Hansch is wary of too much inter-institutional muscle-flexing. 'We
have to be able to explain that there is real public interest and therefore
to choose very carefully' before saying No, he cautions.
He is concerned by public perception of the European Parliament as an
inefficient gravy train, and intends to keep a tight rein internally. MEPs'
expenses, and penchant for needless foreign travel, have been trimmed.
'The Bali express is off his agenda,' quips one European Parliament
official.
More quietly and importantly, Mr Hansch is insisting votes on laws take
place shortly after the plenary in which they were debated, and that debates
be structured so that commissioners and ministers can be scheduled to attend
them and be held to account. Since September, the Commission president has
attended a regular question-time. These are fairly obvious reforms, but no
previous parliament leader got close to achieving them.
In Commission confirmation hearings, says Mr Hansch, 'we will demonstrate
that we can have a proper debate at the (parliamentary) committee
appropriate to that commissioner'. He warns that 'we may find the competence
and attitudes of one or two commissioners so unacceptable that we have to
vote (the whole Commission) down' - but he thinks this improbable.
Use of such a nuclear weapon would be uncharacteristic of a man who above
all wants clear, efficient decisions, comprehensible to citizens mistrustful
of Europe. The prize, and his self-appointed task, is to bring the European
Parliament to the 1996 Maastricht review as an equal partner, achieved on
the basis of its record, which neither Brussels nor the member states could
any longer think of ignoring.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Engineers need body to exert
influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JOHN FAIRCLOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Rowland Morgan (Letters, November 5) seems intent on reliving old
battles and restricting the role of the new Engineering Council to being a
lobbyist for narrow sectional interests. What engineers need urgently is a
governing body that can speak with a powerful single voice to enable the
engineering profession to exert its proper influence on government and
society in general. In order to deliver this important objective, the new
arrangements must encompass the present Engineering Council, the engineering
institutions, industry and academe. The idea that we can have a unified
profession which excludes the institutions is a contradiction in terms. If
the new central body is to have credibility it must represent the whole
profession and not operate in some quasi-trade union role.
Rowland Morgan is wrong to suggest that the Engineering Assembly has not
been allowed to express an opinion on the new arrangements. In fact, when
the assembly met in July, I gave a presentation on the unification proposals
which was followed by a lively discussion. Also, a number of the motions
debated at the assembly covered the unification issue. More recently, I
presented the unification proposal to the chairmen of the Engineering
Council's regional branches and they gave their unanimous support.
The time is fast approaching when we have to take a decision. I hope that
all engineers will grasp the opportunity that we now have to unify the
profession and make its presence felt in the corridors of power.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consensus is way forward to a minimum
wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MONKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article on the TUC's budget submission ('TUC demands Pounds 1bn
boost for employment', November 7), Robert Taylor was good enough to report
my remarks on GMTV the previous day that the level of a national minimum
wage would need to be 'set in the light of the economic circumstances at the
time' of its introduction. However, this was just part of the picture.
First, the minimum wage should be fixed at around half male median earnings,
a position which has been TUC policy since 1991.
Second, the social partners should be consulted by government before the
precise level is fixed.
Third, there is a constructive role for trade unions to play in monitoring
its implementation and enforcement.
The hourly rate has dominated much of the debate to date on a national
minimum wage. But there are far-reaching institutional questions which arise
from the commitment. Our intention in the year ahead is both to campaign
against low pay and to build some consensus with employers on the way
forward. That we are making progress can be seen from the recent survey by
the Engineering Employers' Federation, which found 40 per cent of its
members favoured the introduction of a national minimum wage.

FT  14 NOV 94 / The feel-bad US factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visitor from Britain who spends even a few days in the US is struck by
parallels. In both countries a vigorous economic recovery is under way - in
the US more than 3 1/2 years old. In both countries it has been accompanied
by low consumer price inflation and even lower rises in producer prices. The
Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Bank of England governor, Eddie
George, have spoken about the best chance in 30 years of achieving stable
inflation-free growth. Yet the two countries conspicuously lack any
feel-good factor.
In the US this absence has been demonstrated not only by the sweeping
Republican congressional victories but by an election campaign, nasty even
by American standards. It was impossible to listen even to classical music
radio channels without being interrupted by knocking copy advertisements on
the lines of: 'Helen X is a liar. She says she is tough on crime. She voted
three times against the death penalty.'
Feel-bad is not only in the mind. I attended a Federal Reserve Bank of New
York colloquium on wage trends which echoed widespread concern at growing
'pay inequality'. But would so many people worry about inequality if
national pay levels had been rising sufficiently to bring up living
standards of the bottom 20 or 30 per cent? The root problem is that average
hourly pay peaked as long ago as 1978 and has since fallen by 14 per cent,
with no improvement even in the current upturn.
The conference papers concentrated on the rising premia for skill, education
and experience; which leaves a lot to explain. I suspect clues are to be
found in the less polite subjects of drugs and illegal immigration. Drug
prohibition lies behind a good half of US crime, which in turn offers a more
attractive, if high-risk, prospect to many young people than training for
promotion in fast food outlets or supermarkets. Immigration helps to raise
wages and reduce pay differentials in the North American continent but
increases the differentials inside the US. The now-approved California
Proposition 187, denying social services to illegal immigrants, is a
characteristic feel-nasty response.
The Clinton team helped to bring nemesis on itself by its 1992 election
slogan 'It's the economy, stupid' - itself a stupid slogan. This not only
made the boom look like a slump. Much worse: it whipped up already
unrealistic expectations of how much government action could achieve. These
disappointed expectations have been transformed into a vicious hatred of
everything to do with government, except the subsidies and payouts it
distributes.
The similarities between the US and the UK extend to monetary policy. Both
the Fed and the Bank of England have tightened policy and are expected to
tighten further, not because of actual inflation, but preemptively.
There are two sets of indicators which trigger US inflation alarms. First
there are signs of excessive growth. Real GDP has been rising at over 3 1/2
per cent per annum - maybe more - well above the estimated trend rates of 2
1/2 per cent. And, in contrast to the UK, official estimates show that the
recession's slack has already been more than absorbed and that capacity
utilisation is above normal. Unemployment is, at 5.8 per cent, below the
best guess for the 'natural rate' above which inflation is supposed to
accelerate.
Those sceptical of macroeconomics can point to a second set of warning
signals from the markets. Dollar commodity prices have risen by more than 30
per cent this year. This has been paralleled by a much less spectacular rise
in the inflation rate for non-food intermediate materials, from below 0 at
the turn of the year to above 3 1/2 per cent. The dollar has fallen by well
over 10 per cent against major currencies; and bond yields have increased by
over 2 percentage points. But the gold price has not risen.
Greenspan attributes the rise in bond rates to deep-seated forces. Like many
central bankers he worries most about the budget, saying in a recent speech
that 'entitlements are programmed to grow at a rate that will surely exceed
the growth of the tax base'. Even the Congressional Budget Office, which is
more pessimistic than the Administration, does not expect the federal
deficit to exceed 2 1/2 per cent of GDP in the years immediately ahead. But
there are widespread fears that the growth of social security payments and
existing Medicare programmes, could, as the population ages, push the
deficit up towards 10 per cent early in the next century. Greenspan spoke of
'higher long-term bond rates with both a greater inflation premium and an
expectation of higher real short-term rates in the future as government
spending increasingly crowds out private spending'.
The Clinton Administration intends to make the most of Republican rhetoric
about fiscal responsibility. But, in common with many in the financial
markets, it draws only limited comfort from the Republican commitment to a
balanced budget constitutional amendment. As this has Democrat support as
well, its chances are higher than they have ever been. But the texts in
circulation lack a means of enforcement; and nearly all the specific items
in the Republican 10-point 'Contract', used as a sort of manifesto during
the congressional elections, pledge either spending increases or tax
reductions. The more realistic hopes of the budget worriers centre round the
report of the Commission on budget entitlements chaired by Senator Bob Kerry
(Democrat, Nebraska) due soon to report. One idea is that the pension age
should be indexed to the actuarial expectation of life at the relevant age.
There are those who say that, for all its fiscal worries, the Fed itself has
been 'behind the curve' in its own monetary area. The Fed funds rate - the
one interest rate under its direct control - has hovered around 4 3/4 per
cent, only about 2 percentage points above the inflation rate and remarkably
low so far into an expansion. Henry Kaufman, the noted New York analyst, has
said even a funds rate 100 basis points higher would not be sufficient to
bring the growth rate down to trend. The Fed Open Market Committee meets
tomorrow; and David Hale of Kemper Financial Services plausibly suggests
there is a 95 per cent chance it will increase short-term rates by at least
50 basis points and a 50 per cent chance it will increase them by 75 to 100
basis points. Meanwhile short-term commercial paper rates have risen well
above the Federal funds rate in anticipation.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Franchised post offices popular with
customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE FLANAGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr David Erdman's comments (Letters, November 8) that Post Office
Counters advises its most valued customers (old-age pensioners) to open bank
accounts with our competition is preposterous.
Ninety-five per cent of Britain's post offices have been run by
sub-postmasters for the past 350 years. Business in post offices which we
have moved from Crown to sub-postmaster operations has grown twice as fast
as the rest of our network.
Our research shows these offices are popular with our customers. They are
conveniently located - often in smart new premises in shopping centres - and
are more accessible, too, with car parking facilities and significantly
longer opening hours.
Opening post offices in partnership with sub-postmasters is a cost-effective
way of operating them. The savings we make provide opportunities for
reinvestment elsewhere in the business and help to support the network of
rural sub-post offices which play such a vital role in the community.
Post offices franchised to leading supermarkets are a small but valuable
part of our network - just 130 out of a nationwide network of 20,000 post
offices. Franchising is just one of the ways in which we are developing our
network to improve services to customers by providing a mix of offices
catering to customers' needs.

This month's French-language performances of Donizetti's 'La fille du
regiment' at the Teatro Regio are unusual: opera houses in Italy have always
preferred the Italian versions of works which 19th century composers like
Donizetti and Verdi wrote for Paris. Bruno Campanella conducts a staging by
Luca Ronconi, with a cast headed by Eva Mei and Giuseppe Sabbatini. Opening
night is tomorrow.

The great British public are turning as one to BBC 2's Martin Chuzzlewit
tonight - or are they? Last week's opener tingled with a sense of occasion,
redoubtable British actors who are correctly hatchet-faced in Pinter going
wildly OTT at the nuzzle of a wing-collar or the swing of a corkscrew curl.
Thesps love Dickens and he loved them; no quarrel with the relish of Tom
Wilkinson's magnificent Pecksniff or Paul Scofield's double act as the
ill-matched Chuzzlewit brothers; and watch out for a touching John Mills
tonight. But irritatingly nudging film music and a cautious narrative pace
suggest slower-witted overseas markets are targeted for this slice of
English heritage. It even has a honking case of adenoids, in the form of
young Martin who swallows his words and breathes them out through his nose
(9.30).
From costume capers to Granada's launch of The War Machine, ITV's week-long
look at the arms trade. Tonight's World in Action coasts in on the scummy
crest of the sleaze wave, promising revelations of corruption among the men
from the ministry and a major British company (8.30).

FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Multiplied pianos - David Murray attunes to a strong
commercial pitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why should six pianists want to play six grand pianos all at once? Possible
answer: because doing that, in the current musical climate, might be a nice
little earner. It has novelty value on a grand scale (but portable, just,
with friendly help from Steinways), and promises the kind of noisy
excitement that early rock'n'roll - remember the hammered piano-triplets
that used to go on through every song? - shared with the popular minimalism
of Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the 1950s and '60s.
But is there any six-piano repertoire? Well, for a start there is Reich's
Music for Six Pianos; and in fact that was where Piano Circus started.
Having come together to perform it, they found the experience rewarding both
in personal satisfaction and in audience-response. Soon they were
commissioning new works for their sextet, and adaptations for 528 piano-keys
of other recent music, and they have expanded naturally into added
electronics. Their preferred composers are interested in what a team of
pianos can achieve best: not subtle nuances or timbrel contrasts, but
tingling articulacy, contrapuntal elaboration and rhythmic acuity, in or out
of phase as composers dictate.
Last week they displayed their range in four well-planned concerts at The
Place, along with the results of some 'dance-workshops' with Kingsway
College. The Place - primarily a dance-venue - proved to be an ideal place
for Piano Circus too. Big enough to let the giant rosette of pianos look
impressive (slick lighting by Jo Joelson: they go in for pop-style effects,
like the Kronos Quartet), airy enough for their fullest sound without
cramping it nor letting it become oppressive or strident; but not so big as
to reduce the individual players to faceless mechanics.
In these happy circumstances they sounded very good indeed. Their collective
address is vital and alert. Each plays up to and with the others, and nobody
lacks his or her own dramatic instinct. (Their make-up is of course PC,
three of each sex - though I fancied that their roles were sometimes
assigned on grounds of gender and physical strength.)
The concert I heard comprised Louis Andriessen's De Staat ('The Republic',
after Plato), adapted from a score that deploys a far greater variety of
instruments, and Graham Fitkin's purpose-written triptych Loud, Line and
Log. In Andriessen, energy and rhetoric had to do duty for the original
colour-contrasts, but at the hands of these players they really did. The
Fitkin pieces, which keep a friendly toe-hold in jazz and sophisticated pop,
exploit the unique medium in any number of ways, intricately and with lush
resource. 'Conservative' they may be, by austere modernist standards; but
the keen invention would grab any honest musical ear, and Piano Circus
revelled in it.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Sex and drugs . . . and - marketing of ancient songs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the sophisticated connoisseur of classical music, Carl Orff's Carmina
Burana is a stirring, if slightly excessive, paean to the rantings of a
group of 13th century Bavarian monks who probably spent too much time with
only their fevered imaginations to keep them company. To the less refined
listener it means only one thing - after-shave.
The memorable advertising campaign by Old Spice in the 1970s used Orff's
opening to the work, 'O Fortuna', to evoke in a few expensive seconds of
air-time the atmosphere of passion, danger and excitement which no
self-respecting, iron-pumping macho man could resist.
The ad became a classic. It was satirised by the hapless duo of the Carling
Black Label series, while Orff's exultant piece, composed in the 1930s,
continued to be plundered by the scavengers of popular culture: it was used
in the score of John Boorman's Excalibur, formed the basis of Damien's theme
in The Omen trilogy and, more recently, warmed up the pubescent audiences
waiting to see Michael Jackson perform during his Dangerous tour.
Now a record company has taken the classics-to-pop journey to its logical
conclusion: Decca is packaging and promoting the Carmina Burana in exactly
the same way it would treat a high-profile pop album. Although certain
classical musicians - Luciano Pavarotti, Nigel Kennedy - have achieved pop
status and sales figures, and themed compilations have made a certain impact
on the market, this is claimed to be the first time a single piece of
classical music is being made to take the strain all on its own.
From this week, British television viewers will be treated to the new
advertising campaign devised to promote the product. And it is little more
than an act of promotion: there is no new recording to push (the version
chosen by Decca is 10 years old), no big-name artist to splash across the
cover, no mention, even, of the composer.
Instead, we have loud music, writhing bodies and a semi-naked girl gyrating
in ecstasy before a hysterical audience. For keen followers of post-modern
semiotic theory in practice, there is even, in the opening seconds, the wave
from the Old Spice advertisement. 'We felt it was vital to establish that
link,' says Paul Moseley, head of marketing of Decca UK.
He says market research showed that, when played the piece of music, nearly
everyone recognised it but only 20-25 per cent of the sample knew what it
was. 'Because of the familiarity from the Old Spice ad, the Carmina Burana
has always been a best-seller, but there are more than 100 versions around
and sales have been dispersed.'
Now the company is hoping to tap that familiarity and persuade its target
audience - mostly male (that Old Spice connection again) 20-40 year-olds
whose resistance to asking for funny foreign names in a record shop is
breaking down all the time.
Moseley bridles when asked if his campaign is not vulgarising classical
music by its use of sex as a selling point. 'It is all there already, we are
not adding anything. The Carmina Burana are all about sex, drinking,
gambling and death.' He quotes cheerfully from one of the songs: 'This is
the Joyful Time': 'My virginity makes me frisky, my simplicity holds me back
Oh] Oh] Oh]'. It was not all purity and piety in the medieval monasteries,
after all.
Of the album's sleeve, which shows the girl from the advertisement posing in
front of a baying rock crowd, he says: 'Many of the sleeves from the past
have had similar themes, of nakedness and pagan celebrations, but they just
happen to have been paintings.' Just in case the point is missed, the album
promotion even has a slogan: 'Music for your basic instincts'.
The Decca campaign is costing the company around Pounds 500,000, for which
it expects an entry into the pop charts. The revamped Carmina Burana will
have to sell six-figure numbers to achieve that, which in these days would
be no mean feat for an old recording of a classical piece. 'After the boom
years of 1990 and 1991, when we had the Three Tenors, Nigel Kennedy and
Pavarotti, things have fallen off somewhat. It is more difficult to sell
more than 100,000 copies of a classical album now,' says Moseley.
The release of Orff's most famous work is not entirely an exercise in
cynical marketing; 'O Fortuna' is already used regularly in dance clubs to
get things going, much as New Age and ambient music is used at chill-out
time. There are few pieces of music better-suited to the Ecstasy-induced
adrenalin rush of a rave moving into top gear than the Carmina Burana's
triumphant opening. Proving, perhaps, that it is young music listeners who
care the least about traditional categories in the first place and that the
record companies are finally following in their wake.
