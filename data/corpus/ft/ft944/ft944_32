FT  10 NOV 94 / Technology: Specialists come to the patient - Telemedicine
may save time and money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A pregnant woman lies on an examination table at St Mary's Hospital on the
Isle of Wight. An ultrasound scan has picked up a potential abnormality in
her baby.
Eighty miles away, in Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, an expert is
watching the progress of the scan as it takes place on a TV screen. At
intervals, he freezes the screen and takes measurements of the image. Within
a few minutes, he is able to assure the sonographer and patient at the other
end of the line that the pregnancy is normal.
This system of transmitting scans at St Mary's to specialists in London via
an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) link is now in the early stage
of a six-month trial.
Several benefits of the system are already apparent, according to Nicholas
Fisk of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. It spares many women the anxiety of
waiting for a consultation and the expense of travelling to a specialist
centre. Because it is less stressful for the mother, sonographers are more
likely to get a second opinion for borderline cases.
The system may also save the specialist hospital time and money. The
equipment - provided by BT for the trial - costs around Pounds 60,000. But
it may allow the specialists to be more productive, reducing the Pounds 500
cost of the average consultation.
The Isle of Wight experiment is not unique. The falling cost of equipment is
encouraging hospitals around the world to experiment with telemedicine -
transmission of medical data and images between medical centres - in order
to improve services for remote areas or to make top specialists available to
countries that lack a particular expertise.
Last month, doctors in Saudi Arabia were linked to specialists in the
radiology and pathology departments in the Massachussetts General Hospital,
in what WellCare, the network provider, describes as the first international
telemedicine link.
The system works by digitising and compressing images of patients' X-rays,
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computerised tomography) scans.
These are then sent down telephone lines in the course of a few minutes to
specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital, who can respond in minutes if
the case is an emergency. Patients are charged the same fee as those who
visit the hospital in person.
The advantage is that this system depends on ordinary telephone lines.
'Doctors and patients most likely to need this service are those least
likely to have access to sophisticated telecommunications,' says Ricky
Richardson, executive vice-president of WellCare.
Video conferencing is another increasingly important strand of telemedicine.
Over the past year, a video connection between a community hospital at
Peterhead in Scotland and the Accident and Emergency Specialist Centre in
Aberdeen has saved many patients from having to make a 100-mile round trip
to Aber-deen.
A wide range of medical problems can be diagnosed in this way. Even
psychiatric patients can be interviewed using video links, according to
Steinar Pedersen, head of the department of Telemedicine at the University
Hospital in Tromso, Norway.
'The patient feels in complete control,' he says.
Doctors who have taken part in these experiments with telemedicine report
that problems have tended to be related to administrative, rather than
medical, matters. Telemedicine often cuts across existing funding
mechanisms. It also raises issues of medical accountability and liability.
But the champions of telemedicine believe these problems are surmountable
and should be offset by its numerous advantages.
They believe that telemedicine cuts the expense of consultations and so
offers a partial solution to the spiralling costs of hospital care. It fits
in with the ambitions of the UK government to decentralise the National
Health Service. It should also make specialist services more convenient and
accessible for patients.

<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, has promoted
Michael Sanderson, chief executive officer of Instinet, its fast-growing,
US-based equity brokerage service. From January 1, he will become chairman
of Reuters America Holdings, which oversees all the group's activities in
the Americas.
Sanderson, 51, who will continue as Instinet's chief executive, will report
in both roles to Andre Villeneuve, an executive director of the London-based
group who currently chairs Reuters America Holdings.
Instinet, Reuters America - responsible for the group's financial
information and media activities - and Reuters NewMedia, which has recently
made a series of small multimedia acquisitions in the US, will continue to
operate as separate entities. Brian Vaughan, president of Reuters America,
and Buford Smith, president of Reuters NewMedia, will report to Sanderson.
Villeneuve said the appointment was an important stage in the development of
the group's activities in the Americas. Including revenue from Instinet, the
US now outweighs the City of London as the group's biggest single market.
Sanderson joined Instinet as president and CEO in 1990. Before that he was
with Merrill Lynch, where he started in 1967 as an investment executive,
rising ultimately to the position of chairman and ceo of Merrill-Lynch
Canada.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Technology: Shoes that go one step ahead - Sports footwear
manufacturers use high technology to cater for all kinds of athletes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A young man triumphantly slams a basketball through the hoop while a woman
works out on the treadmill. Dozens of used running shoes are heaped in the
corner, and a golf player awaits his turn to try out his back swing on the
astroturf.
This is not an exclusive health club, but the research laboratories of
Reebok in Stoughton, Massachusetts. For Reebok, as for other high-tech
sports shoe makers such as Adidas, Nike, LA Gear and New Balance, recreation
is big business.
The basketball player is stepping on a sensitive 'force plate', a device
beneath the boards that measures the force of the player's landing after his
jump. The woman on the treadmill is wearing reflectors on strategic parts of
her legs and feet. The action is recorded on high-speed video - the
reflectors' movements are then isolated and fed into a computer, where they
will be studied in detail.
The heaps of running shoes will be inspected to determine how well they held
up over miles of use, and the golf player will eventually be converted into
a computer stick figure, so that scientists can study the movement of his
foot during the back swing.
Technology in the sports shoe industry has come a long way in the last 20
years. In the 1960s, most people expected no more from a sports shoe than a
little foam and rubber, with canvas or leather on top. The running craze of
the 1970s sparked the first interest in shoes tailored to a specific sport.
Since then, the sector has blossomed. Companies have tapped research in the
aerospace and transport industries to make improvements in design. Shoelaces
have been replaced on many models by a less complicated strap system. Sports
shoes are pumped up with air, reinforced with high-tech materials,
sculptured to the foot and manipulated to eliminate excess weight.
Consumers have responded enthusiastically. The global wholesale athletic
footwear industry reached Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in 1993, according
to the NPD Group, a market research firm. For 1994, the figure is forecast
to be even higher.
Manufacturers are always looking for new sports to add to their product
line. The recent enthusiasm for mountain biking inspired a crusade for the
perfect mountain-biking shoe. Adidas is considering developing a shoe for
snowboarding, a sport which has taken off in the US, and New Balance just
arrived on the market with a new boat shoe, an alternative to moccasins.
Companies are also trying to expand their market by making shoes for sports
more commonly played in Europe and Asia than in the US. Nike, for instance,
will introduce a new line next year that includes footgear for squash,
handball, volleyball, cricket and rugby.
Hiking boots are also attracting attention, and for good reason. While a
tennis shoe, for instance, rarely sells for more than Dollars 120 a pair,
hiking boots are often Dollars 200 or more. There is also much room for
improvement. Most hiking boots are unnecessarily uncomfortable, according to
Spencer White, head of research at Reebok.
Because every sport involves different foot movements, manufacturers say
athletic shoes need to be tailored for a specific use. Games such as
handball or tennis, for instance, require a great deal of lateral
(side-to-side) movement, requiring a more stable shoe than one worn by
walkers. Soccer players like a shoe that fits like a glove, and used to buy
footwear too small before manufacturers latched on.
American football players need good traction. However, if the shoe gets
stuck on a twisting movement, they can hurt their knees. Reebok is trying to
design a shoe that would offer both forward and lateral traction, but would
still give way on a twisting motion.
Even within one sport, athletes' needs may vary. A dribbler, or defence
player in basketball, for instance, needs to move fast and usually prefers a
lighter shoe. But offensive players are normally bigger and heavier, and
require more stability in the heel for jumping. 'Everything is important,
from the form on which the shoe is built to the heel width to the tread
pattern,' says Edith Harmon, product development manager for New Balance.
Besides laboratory testing, manufacturers rely on top athletes and testers,
often referred to as the 'weekend warriors', for input. 'The big athletes
are important, but we get even more feedback from people who play sports
casually,' says Guy Marshall, a footwear designer for Adidas.
One of the main challenges in the industry is to design a shoe that is both
light and strong. 'We are looking to take every last gramme of material out
while maintaining the shoe's stability,' says Harmon.
The right materials are of prime importance. Footwear manufacturers were met
with surprise when they showed up at aerospace and transport fairs in the
1980s. Now they have formed direct contacts with chemical firms and other
materials developers.
Nike, for example, uses a Du Pont concoction called Kevlar for its tennis
shoe line. 'One of the main problems in a tennis shoe is getting durability
in the forefoot, because players tend to drag their toes,' says Richard
Oldfield, product line manager for the group. 'Kevlar added strength to the
shoe without introducing heaviness.' The material was used in bullet-proof
vests and for brake pads on logging lorries before Nike took it up.
Makers of running shoes, which need to be especially lightweight, started
experimenting with mesh materials in the 1980s. Now meshes are everywhere.
Nike also uses a material called Ultralam, used in windsails for
windsurfing, for its cross-country training shoes. 'It is light-weight, thin
and strong, and we apply it in areas needing extra support,' says Oldfield.
One of Reebok's latest products, the InstaPump Fury, makes good use of
high-tech materials to achieve a lighter weight. The company's studies
revealed just how little pressure most runners place on the arch of their
foot. The manufacturer's response was to eliminate the central section,
concentrating material in the forefoot and heel.
The result looks like a cross between a high-heel hiking boot and an alien's
idea of walking shoes. The foot is given support in the arch through an
incredibly thin, lightweight and strong material called Graphlite. The
material, originally used in the wings of aeroplanes, runs glass fibres one
way and carbon fibres the other, and is covered with a plastic resin. 'The
three materials together are much stronger than they would be separately,'
says White.
To try to eliminate stress and injury, New Balance uses former transport
industry shock absorbers that were once used as a replacement for a heavy
steel spring. It also manufactures long-distance running gear with
high-wearing, abrasion-resistant rubber.
One of the most important innovations in recent years has been air tubes.
Nike and Adidas use air chambers in shoe soles for lightweight stability.
Reebok uses inflatable uppers for a snugger fit.
It is uncertain how far the industry can take its fascination with high
technology. Marshall says the last significant innovation was the air pump.
'We are waiting for something really big like that to take the industry
forward again.'
Fashion, of course, will play a part in the industry's future, but
manufacturers say it is not their mainstay. 'A lot of people who buy these
shoes may never practise the sport,' says White. 'They just want to wear
something that looks cool. We love these people, but we can't survive just
with their purchases. We need athletes who buy the shoes because of their
superior performance. And that is where the high technology comes in.'

<TEXT>
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel Investment Management and
one of the most forceful advocates of property as a financial asset, is
taking over as president of the Property Investment Forum.
The Forum was set up seven years ago to debate and comment on issues
relevant to the property investment community. It now has around 700 members
drawn from the property, legal, actuarial and other professions.
Ross Goobey's involvement is sure to raise the profile of the group. In
addition to running the UK's largest pension fund, he is a former Treasury
adviser to Normant Lamont and author of Bricks &amp; Mortals, a readable history
of the last boom-to-bust property cycle.
Yet he takes the helm of the IPF at a time when many of his peers are losing
interest in property. The average pension fund now has only around 6 per
cent of its assets in commercial property, against 20 per cent at the start
of the 1980s.
Ross Goobey believes part of the answer could be new forms of property
investment, which could mean another look at ways of unitising property to
appeal to fund managers.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Bright outlook forecast, but not guaranteed -
The new rules on 'going concern' statements which make explicit their
judgments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Making a statement that a business is a going concern should be viewed in
the same way as a weather forecast. It is a judgment based on available data
at a point in time. It is not a guarantee of fair weather.
No one would think of suing a weather forecaster after a holiday ruined by
rain. However, we might be justifiably annoyed by a 24-hour forecast which
failed to notice the approach of a typhoon.
The problem with the concept of going concern is that it is seen by many
shareholders and investors as providing a guarantee against collapse. When
things go badly wrong they feel aggrieved.
The late 1980s provided a string of examples of company collapses within
months of the publication of accounts, audited without qualification, and
containing the assumption that the company was a going concern.
Creditors sought to apportion blame and turned to the auditors. The
situation cruelly exposed an 'expectation gap'. If the company concerned was
a going concern eight months ago why was it now revealed to be nothing of
the sort? What had the auditor missed? What had the directors failed to tell
the auditor?
This week the Audit Practice Board, and the Working Group on Going Concern,
with members from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Hundred Group,
and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, have between them
attempted to clarify the responsibilities of auditors and directors with
respect to going concern. Their work is a direct response to the corporate
failures of the 1980s.
Both have been keen to make plain what going concern is not. It is not a
cast iron prediction. It is a judgment made on the available evidence at a
point in time. That judgment is based on the information provided by the
directors. It is not a guarantee the company will continue to trade.
What going concern is has become much clearer this week and the APB and the
working group deserve credit for co-ordinating their findings and coming up
with a practical framework.
The only danger is that they may have difficulty in restraining public
expectations in the future.
The APB's Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) 130 replaces the old
auditing guideline which was widely criticised for giving the auditor a
passive role on going concern. Unless the auditor literally fell over
contrary evidence the business was presumed to be a going concern.
SAS 130, which covers all audited companies, requires the auditor to take a
pro-active role and to consider, rigorously, a business's ability to
continue as a going concern. That ability should extend into the
'foreseeable future' - which is not strictly defined.
However, if directors of the company in question consider a period of less
than one year from the date of the approval of the financial statements and
do not disclose it, the auditors must record this in their basis of opinion.
This subtlety can be seen as the APB watering down the rigor of the standard
or introducing a practical recognition that some businesses, such as a
fashion house faced with an unpredictable spring season, might not be able
to provide the detail required for such a period.
The auditors, under SAS 130, should qualify their opinion if they think the
directors have not backed up their assertion of going concern with adequate
information. The auditors should register an adverse opinion if they
disagree with the assertion.
Michael Boyd, chairman of the task force that produced the standard is sure
it will not create a 'make work' project for companies. It is not mandatory
for companies to provide cash flow forecasts or budgets to back up going
concern.
For many companies no extra work will be needed.
The standard is effective from June 30 1995 although the APB wants it
adopted when those companies being audited already comply with the Cadbury
Code - under which directors are already urged to make a statement of going
concern.
What the APB has done for auditors, the Working Group on Going Concern has
done for company directors of listed companies - including those quoted on
the USM. It has published this week guidance on making an explicit statement
of going concern.
As its guidance is a codification of best practice with which it believes
companies with year ends from December 1994 can comply. The guidelines give
directors three options:
To state that the company is a going concern.
To state it is a going concern but with an explanation of potential problems
and how they would be dealt with.
To state that the business is not a going concern.
Needless to say the final option is going to be rare. The second will not be
as rare and will need very careful handling if it is not going to inflict
severe damage on the share price.
In the case, for example, of an incomplete negotiation of a contract,
analysts and the press would need to be carefully briefed.
Advice to directors on the definition of 'foreseeable future' has again been
dovetailed with the APB's rules for auditors. Generally they should look at
all the relevant information available - including the long-term view. The
expiry of a patent, for example, in 15 years' time is not an irrelevant item
for consideration.
One can see some potential problems when the new rules are up and running.
Imagine a group of directors putting forward their judgment that the company
is a going concern based upon a forthcoming bank loan. The auditor may
discover, after questioning the directors, that the loan is only to be
forthcoming if the company is judged a going concern. This kind of situation
will require a common sense solution. One could imagine a tripartite meeting
between the parties involved as a good start.
Finally the APB also published this week a revised bulletin on corporate
governance which said that it was impractical for auditors to give an
opinion on the director's report on going concern. This was seen as
involving too much extra work.
However, if the director's report is inconsistent with what the auditor
knows from having to sign off the accounts then they should highlight the
difference.
Taken together this week's publications certainly appear to increase the
responsibilities of auditors and directors. By clearly setting out their
duties and roles the APB and the working group have put in place a strong
framework. There may be some fears that as a result the liability of
auditors has been increased.
This is certainly a danger. But the allocation of responsibility between the
parties has also made it clear that auditors have to work with information
provided by directors. The rules now also make it explicit that the going
concern judgment is not a guarantee of future prosperity.
If auditors can educate the public on this definition of going concern it
will go a long way to closing the expectation gap and protecting them from
blame when companies fail. The need for more open discussion and analysis in
financial statements of going concern should also benefit the public
interest.
For most company directors the new rules will not be a burden. But the
guidelines undoubtedly focus their responsibilities in a way which is
difficult to avoid. There will be those who do not wish to take a more
rigorous approach to what has up until now been seen as a bland assumption.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Bus war sees off council operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Darlington Transport Company, a council-owned bus operator, went into
administration yesterday in the wake of fierce competition between rival
operators in the County Durham town.
Mr Nick Wallis, chairman of the council's transport committee, said: 'The
financial viability of DTC has been smashed beyond repair.'
The Labour-controlled council blamed the government's deregulation policy
and the sales process it imposed on council-owned bus companies for the
collapse of the 90-year-old business, which faces liquidation.
But it also blamed Stagecoach, the Perth-based company, which this week
started offering free travel for five weeks in Darlington, largely on the
same routes as DTC.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Nine IRA prisoners to be freed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government is to release nine IRA prisoners - including two who
are serving life sentences for murder - in the approach to Christmas as part
of its response to the IRA's ceasefire.
Those selected do not include Mr Thomas McMahon, who was jailed for life for
the murder of Lord Mountbatten in 1979. Irish sources said last night that
the releases would begin within days.
Yesterday's disclosure came 48 hours after Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the
Irish justice minister, sparked an angry response from unionist politicians
by indicating that Dublin intended to release a number of IRA prisoners.
The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in
British jails.
Irish sources said last night that the names of the nine prisoners to be
released were: Mr Owen Gallagher, Mr Gerard Hamilton, Mr John Harnett, Mr
Gerard Burns, Mr Richard Comerford, Mr Patrick Griffin, Mr Aaron O'Connell,
Mr Eamon Nolan and Mr Michael Daly.
The releases would be staggered over the period leading up to Christmas but
would begin in the next few days.
Seven of the nine men would have been due for release next year on the
expiry of their sentences.
The sources said that Mr O'Connell and Mr Nolan were serving life sentences,
having been convicted of murder during the course of a bank robbery. One of
the men had served 12 years, the other almost 15 years.
One man was serving a sentence for robbery, another for attempted robbery.
The other five were serving sentences in connection with the possession of
firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The sources said all nine prisoners had been granted conditional release and
that the conditions included their future good behaviour. These conditions
would remain in force until the end of their sentences. Breach of them would
render any prisoner liable to instant recommittal.
They said normal criteria, including the likelihood of the prisoners'
reoffending, were applied in reviewing the sentences. The cessation of
violence was a 'critical' factor in reviewing the sentences of IRA
prisoners.
The sources added that the list for early release was circulated in a move
to calm 'an almost hysterical response' to the announcement.
By leaving out any high-profile IRA figures Dublin showed the gesture was
not so dramatic as politicians in London and Belfast had feared.
Downing Street said it was informed but not consulted about the Irish
government's decision.
It said: 'This is a matter for the Irish government. We have no plans for
any similar action.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / Surge in chemicals drives deficit down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in exports of chemicals and capital goods is driving a continuing
improvement in the visible trade figures, Central Statistical Office figures
showed yesterday.
August's deficit with the rest of the world was a seasonally adjusted Pounds
631m, while July's was revised downwards from Pounds 704m to Pounds 555m
largely because of changes in the calculation of the seasonal adjustment.
The CSO said the trend shows a continued narrowing of the deficit, with
exports and imports rising about  1/2 a per cent a month.
World trade figures are reported in arrears because of the Intrastat system
used in the European Union, which is based on value added tax returns. The
new element of yesterday's figures was the EU deficit, which widened to
Pounds 342m from Pounds 171m in July, in part because of the import from
France of trains for the Channel tunnel. Imports from the EU have been
rising faster than those from the rest of the world.
Mr Adam Cole, a UK economist at James Capel, the brokers, said the rise in
EU imports was significant and might mark 'a turning point in the trend of
falling deficits apparent over the past few months'.
In the three months to August, the whole-world deficit was Pounds 1.97bn
compared with Pounds 2.85bn in the three months to May. In the same period
export values have risen 5 per cent while imports have grown 2 per cent. The
deficit was Pounds 3bn in the three months to August last year.
The CSO said that increases in the value of chemicals and capital goods were
responsible for about half the rise in exports in the past three months.
If oil and erratic items such as precious stones were excluded, the
whole-world trade deficit in August was Pounds 1.19bn, from Pounds 1.07bn in
July.
Official figures appear to show the trade trend continuing to improve in
volume as well as value terms.
The CSO estimates that export volumes - excluding oil and erratics - are
increasing by about 1 per cent a month, while imports are flat.
In the three months to August, export volumes were 3 per cent higher than in
the previous three months while imports fell 1 per cent. Compared with the
same period last year exports are up 12 per cent while imports are up 6 per
cent. Both export and import volumes reached records in August.
Falls in import volumes were recorded in all sectors in the three months to
August, including finished manufactures, where clothing imports fell 7.5 per
cent.
The improving trend in volumes has not been fully reflected in the headline
figure for the trade deficit because of a deterioration in the terms of
trade. Import prices were 3 per cent higher in the three months to August
than in the previous three months while export prices were 1 per cent
higher.
The government aims to increase the proportion of exports that go to
countries outside the European Union as part of its strategy for stimulating
domestic growth.
Ministers want to increase non-EU exports to more than 50 per cent of the
total before the next general election, due by 1997. They are keen to
promote British exports to relatively fast-growing economies in Asia and
Latin America.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, is due to leave for India on Sunday, at
the head of a party of more than 80 business executives in what the
Department of Trade and Industry is billing as its biggest-ever trade
mission.
Official figures indicate that the government is well on the way to
achieving its target. In the eight months to August exports to the EU were
Pounds 46.3bn, or 52.6 per cent of the total.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Service launched to help businesses find 'angels'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A matchmaking service to bring together small businesses and business
'angels' was launched yesterday by National Westminster Bank.
The six-month pilot operation - based on branches in north-west England and
the Thames Valley region - is intended to evolve into a national register of
private investors wanting to put money into small companies.
Access to the register of investors will be through NatWest branches for the
bank's small business customers, and through 12 specific intermediaries such
as Capital Exchange and Capital Access for other small companies.
Three training and enterprise councils - Bedfordshire, Devon and Cornwall,
and South and East Cheshire - are also involved.
NatWest is providing the service free of charge to investors, intermediaries
and its small business customers. Those using intermediaries may have to
pay.
Mr Duncan Matthews, head of NatWest's technology unit, said the register
would start with the names of about 200 investors and an investment
potential of Pounds 50m. He expects between 300 and 500 applications during
the pilot.
The register gives details about investors, including investment amounts,
sectors of interest and the extent of involvement desired in the businesses
where they invest.
Potential investors can contact Mr Matthews or one of his colleagues on 071
454 2236.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Audit costs 'lower in efficient companies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies with a high economic and managerial performance pay lower audit
fees, says a report published today and based on analysis of nearly 700 sets
of accounts.
The annual report, by JDH Consultants, finds that in many cases companies
with a low performance have been charged 50 per cent to 100 per cent more
for an audit.
The University of Glasgow's accounting and finance department is studying
the results. Professor Neil Garrod said: 'This research is extremely well
founded.'
Two reasons had been put forward for the relationship. The first suggested
that high-performing companies got value for money. 'It may be that the best
managers are the best negotiators,' he said.
Mr Dennis Henry, managing director of JDH Consultants, said: 'The other
obvious possibility is that the high-performing companies have accounts
which are more easily audited. If this is the case then another question
must be posed: 'Is there a connection between accounts which are easily
audited and company performance?' This could fit in with what appears to be
the case, that it takes 50 per cent to 100 per cent longer to audit accounts
of the less well-performing companies.'
Prof Garrod is interested in the possibility that good internal audit
practices have a clear impact on performance and keeping down audit fees.
Performance criteria were used by the consultants and matched against audit
fees to find a correlation. The criteria included return on assets, profit
margin and the value added by employees.
Another result of the analysis is that in those cases where the auditor
changed the fees charged had been reduced by an average 28.25 per cent. This
helps explain the increasing tendency for audits to be put out to tender.
In general, fees charged on accounts before October 6 this year rose 0.58
per cent - with audit fees rising 2.25 per cent while non-audit fees fell
1.77 per cent. This again illustrates a highly competitive sector.
The JDH analysis found, as it has done in recent years, a correlation
between the size of companies and audit fee charged and the sector and the
fee charged - but with big variations.
Some companies of the same size, in the same sector, were paying 10 times as
much for audit. Mr Henry said: 'Whilst I might accept a ratio of 2:1 or 3:1
as being reasonable, 10:1 takes a bit of understanding.'
On fees for companies of different size he added: 'The small guys pay more
and the big boys pay less. It takes a lot of big increases to the small ones
to make up for some reductions to the big ones. The big auditors have the
smaller companies over a barrel.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / Booklet on jobless figures attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kevin Barron, shadow employment minister, yesterday attacked a Department
of Employment booklet on how unemployment is measured as 'misleading and
wasteful'.
The pamphlet, which was sent to labour market statistics users last Friday,
included descriptions of the two surveys used by the department, the monthly
count of those claiming unemployment-related benefits (the claimant count)
and the quarterly survey of households (the labour force survey).
In the past year the Labour party has often criticised the government for
its use of the claimant count as its headline figure. The Department of
Employment said it issued the booklet to clarify its use of both forms of
measure.
But Mr Barron said the booklet was inaccurate because it said there had been
nine changes to the rules and procedures of benefit payments since 1979
which warranted adjustments to the counts.
The minister said Labour's employment team had gone through data from the
House of Commons library and identified 29 changes to the rules and
procedures resulting in a reduction to the headline unemployment figure of
nearly 700,000.
The Department of Employment rebutted Mr Barron's assertion about the 29
changes. It said all but nine of them were 'not significant enough to
justify a recasting of the back-series' of figures.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Names allowed limited liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday gave the go-ahead for individual members of the
market to make a switch away from underwriting insurance policies on the
basis of unlimited liability.
Formal approval has been given for Names, the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market, to transfer their investments in Lloyd's
to limited liability companies in time for the 1995 underwriting year.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said it had overcome 'many technical
complexities' and the move marked 'another step forward' for Lloyd's, which
has been plagued by heavy losses in recent years.
Citibank, the subsidiary of US group Citicorp, has already announced a
scheme which would allow Names to take advantage of the arrangements.
Lloyd's has failed so far however, to agree arrangements that would permit
the so-called 'inter-availability' of funds - by which Names could
underwrite via a limited liability company and continue underwriting as an
individual.
This may make it difficult for many existing Names to take advantage of the
latest rule changes. If they face the possibility of heavy losses from
previous years' underwriting, the cost of transfering those obligations into
a new company may prove prohibitive.
The timetable is also tight for significant numbers of Names to convert by
next year.
The new schemes would work by, in effect, 'reinsuring' liabilities on
outstanding policies that they have underwritten into an individual
'NameCo'. Lloyd's has agreed that NameCos should hold a minimum of Pounds
100,000 at the insurance market, compared with the Pounds 1.5m required from
companies set up in the past two years to inject corporate capital into the
market.

FT  10 NOV 94 / OFT hits at rights offer commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies have paid out about Pounds 240m in 'excess returns' to
institutional investors who help underwrite offerings of new shares,
according to a study commissioned by the Office of Fair Trading.
The study, which examined more than 600 rights offerings since 1986,
concludes that the fixed commission that companies pay advisers, brokers and
sub-underwriters, which totals 2 per cent, is too great for the risks taken
on. The overpayment includes the effects of hefty losses on sub-underwriting
incurred just after the 1987 stock market crash.
The study says: 'Underwriters and sub-underwriters perform a useful service
for companies by assuming the risks of a failed issue. Historically,
however, at least for equity rights issues, the evidence indicates that the
fees they charge for the assumption of this risk significantly exceed the
value of the insurance they provide.'
It also found that big companies overpay to a greater extent than smaller
companies.
The study was prepared by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School
and has not been released. Merchant banks and institutional investors have
been urging the OFT not to release the report, saying that its research
methods are so seriously flawed that to make it public would only confuse
the debate.
The OFT commissioned the report as part of its inquiry into whether a
'complex cartel' exists for commissions. The fees - 0.25 per cent to
brokers, 0.5 per cent to the lead underwriter and 1.25 per cent to
sub-underwriters - have not changed for years.
Yesterday the OFT said: 'We are likely to publish a report on this matter.
But what it will say has not yet been decided.'
The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the trade body for fund
managers, said yesterday that if there were any significant changes to the
rules on sub-underwriting its members may step back from the practice. It
said: 'It's not a profitable activity.'
The study based its conclusions on an analysis of the theoretical price of a
'put option', which its author says is similar to what occurs in a rights
offering. The company is effectively buying the right to 'put' new shares to
sub-underwriters 30 days after underwriting. The price of the shares is at a
discount to the prevailing market price on the day the rights offer is
announced.
The London Investment Bankers Association has said that the analysis is
misguided because companies cannot buy put options equal to the value of the
capital they raise in rights offerings.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Bribe allegations catch FA offside: A determination 'to keep
football above the suspicion of corruption'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Football Association, the game's governing body in England, yesterday
found itself in some difficulty over newspaper allegations that a player had
been bribed to help 'throw' a game.
Mr Michael Parry, its spokesman, said the incident was 'so isolated that we
don't even have a mechanism at the FA to investigate it'.
It is some time since the last such allegations. David 'Bronco' Layne and
the England international Peter Swan were among 10 players jailed in 1965
for fixing games.
The FA yesterday launched a 'thorough and urgent investigation' into the
allegations centred on Bruce Grobbelaar, the Southampton goalkeeper who used
to play for Liverpool. Mr Grobbelaar denied the allegations.
The FA said The Sun newspaper, which made the allegations, had agreed to
hand over information, including video tapes. The premier league,
Southampton, Liverpool, and the Professional Footballers' Association have
also pledged to co-operate with the inquiry.
Mr Graham Kelly, FA chief executive, said: 'There is no suggestion that
today's allegations are anything but an isolated case. We are determined to
keep football above the suspicion of corruption in any form.'
Mr Graham Sharpe of bookmakers William Hill, which takes Pounds 1m a week in
football bets, said that if match-rigging did exist in Britain, 'it exists
on a very, very minor scale'.
The British game does have a seedy side. Mr Terry Venables, the England
coach, spends a lot of time denying stories about his financial dealings. Mr
Lou Macari, the former Swindon Town manager, was banned for a year for
betting that his team would lose an important game.
Most fans assume that what happens on British pitches is fair. They know it
is hard to rig a football match - according to The Sun Mr Grobbelaar's teams
won or drew games in which he allegedly let in soft goals. The only safe way
to fix a match is to bribe the whole team.
More than Pounds 1bn is bet on football each year but more than 80 per cent
of that is on the pools, so anyone wanting to make money dishonestly would
have to fix several matches.
Fans trust players even though hundreds of thousands of pounds can rest on a
big game and playing careers are short. A couple of blunders on the day
would excite little surprise.
Football is a closed world and it is easy to see why a footballer would not
want to throw a game. From the age of 16, when he joins a professional club,
football provides him with almost all his friends, his values and social
status.
Hardly anyone is criticised in public and if you are lucky you can stay in
the game long after you retire.
Germany, Belgium, France and Italy have all had scandals in the last two
decades. In Italy gambling Mafiosi were arranging for players to throw
matches. When the 'Toto Nero' was exposed in 1979 the Italian FA relegated
AC Milan and banned a number of players, including Paolo Rossi, for three
years.
The German scandal also involved betting. But in Belgium in 1982, and in
France last year, Standard Liege and Olympique Marseille respectively bribed
opponents to guarantee winning the league title.
In Russia two years ago managers of all first division clubs were asked
whether match-rigging went on in their league. All said it did. But all
replied no to the next question: 'Does your club play in these matches?'.
The Sun's allegation is that Mr Grobbelaar was bribed by a syndicate from
the Far East, where football is less honest. Mr Peter Velappan,
secretary-general of the Asian Football Confederation, said: 'I was once
quite shocked to receive a report about a youth team, all its members under
15, carting away TVs, video players, radios and stereo sets after losing
12-0 in an international youth competition.'
The Grobbelaar case comes when football in Britain is enjoying a resurgence
in popularity. If Britain does suffer a bribery case, that should change
little.
The sad thing is that football here could be starting to slip for other
reasons. A cocaine scandal involving famous players is waiting to break.
England's draw against Romania last month and Manchester United's 4-0 defeat
at Barcelona last week make it clear that the 1960s are a long time ago.
On the other hand, there are few Peter Swans and 'Bronco' Laynes any more.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Westminster taxpayers 'have not suffered loss of money'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster City Council taxpayers have not suffered any loss of money
through alleged gerrymandering, a public inquiry was told yesterday.
The claim was made by Mr Anthony Scrivener who was opening the defence for
Dame Shirley Porter, the former council leader.
It is the first time that she has given a detailed response to allegations
made five years ago.
She and nine others were accused of gerrymandering in a provisional report
by Mr John Magill, the district auditor. He found that council homes had
been sold off in an attempt to attract potential Conservative voters into
marginal wards before a closely-fought local election.
Mr Magill is recommending that the 10 councillors and council officials
should pay a surcharge of Pounds 21m, the sum which he believes was wasted.
Mr Scrivener disclosed that he had obtained the opinions of three leading
accountancy firms. All three 'wholly disagreed with the approach' taken by
the district auditor when he had calculated the surcharge. 'In fact, there
was no loss,' he said. The firms will be revealed later in his submission,
which is expected to last up to four days.
Mr Scrivener added that the district auditor had made 'a series of
surprising and unique conclusions'. It was the first case in which a
district auditor intended to surcharge councillors who had a scheme approved
by a leading barrister before it was implemented, he said.
He said that in the district auditor's report he had largely relied 'on the
contents of political meetings as evidence for what happened in the council.
That has never happened before'. He said councillors were well aware of the
difference between what was said at political meetings with colleagues and
what was decided in the council chamber with the advice of officials.
The district auditor's report contains a long series of 'strictly
confidential' political papers written by Dame Shirley and her colleagues
for discussions in secret meetings.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Maxwell schemes offered up to Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of investment banks and former professional advisers to pension
schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell has offered to pay between
Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m in a 'global settlement' of all outstanding
claims.
Yesterday trustees of the schemes and their advisers met Sir Peter Webster
of the Maxwell Pensioners Trust who told them of the offers he had received.
Sir Peter had set a deadline of November 4 by which time all offers of
settlement had to be made. Those which did not make 'credible' offers could
expect legal proceedings against them to continue.
Trustees had hoped for an offer closer to the Pounds 448m estimated to have
disappeared from the schemes.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mirror Group Pension Scheme, the only one of
the former Maxwell schemes which still has a solvent sponsor, could scupper
the global settlement if an agreement is not reached with the Department of
Social Security.
The issue is whether the department is prepared to waive the requirement
that each scheme repay the government for the portion of State Earnings
Related Pensions (Serps) which has been paid through tax receipts since
1992.
The department said yesterday: 'We can defer the state scheme premiums but
we are not going to write them off.'
In order to allow the Maxwell pensioners to receive Serps, each scheme would
have had to pay a premium to the government. The aggregate value of these
premiums is Pounds 115m.
In October 1992 the government said it would defer collection of the
premiums in order to allow time for recovery of assets from other sources.
It is understood, however, that the department intends to reclaim these
payments if the schemes recover assets.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Venables company liquidator removed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidator of Edennote, the insolvent company of former Tottenham
Hotspur chief executive Mr Terry Venables, was removed from his post by a
High Court judge yesterday because he sold the company's only substantial
asset to Mr Venables without inviting offers from other creditors.
Mr Stephen Ryman was removed as a result of action taken by Mr Alan Sugar,
Tottenham Hotspur chairman, and his holding company Amshold, major creditors
of Edennote.
Mr Ryman had assigned to Mr Venables Edennote's interest in a pending Pounds
1m damages claim launched by Mr Venables and Edennote against Tottenham. The
claim concerned Mr Venables' allegedly wrongful dismissal as Spurs chief
executive and team manager in May last year.
Mr Venables paid Pounds 7,000 for the assignment and pledged to pay the
liquidator 10 per cent of any net proceeds he recovered in the action. The
judge, Sir John Vinelott, cancelled the assignment and said Mr Ryman should
have approached Tottenham to see if it would offer a better deal. The judge
stressed that no attack had been made on Mr Ryman's integrity and good
faith.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Severn Bridge tolls to rise 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tolls to cross the Severn bridge on the M4 motorway between England and
Wales will rise almost 9 per cent in the new year, taking the cost for a car
to Pounds 3.70 from Pounds 3.40, Roland Adburgham writes.
The announcement yesterday by Severn River Crossing, the consortium which
operates the bridge, provoked an angry reaction from motoring and haulage
organisations. Tolls rose nearly 10 per cent in January this year.
Under a formula set by the Severn Bridges Act, the coming increase will be
the last allowed above the rate of inflation. The tolls, which are charged
in the westbound direction only, are used to maintain the bridge and finance
the Pounds 300m second Severn bridge, under construction three miles
downstream.
The toll for a heavy truck will rise by Pounds 1 to Pounds 11.10, prompting
fears that this will cause a further increase in traffic avoiding the bridge
by taking a detour through Gloucestershire. In June a study for the Highways
Agency showed about 2,700 vehicles a day were doing this.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Labour outlines crackdown on tax abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday outlined plans to tackle tax avoidance by scrapping
allowances and tightening rules on inheritance and capital gains.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, also called for a one-off tax on the
'excess profits' of the privatised utility companies.
Mr Brown said a Labour study had identified more than 25 tax abuses which
could be closed to provide billions of pounds to help reduce long-term
unemployment.
Officials said final decisions on tax reform would be taken nearer the
election. The main proposals are:
Higher taxes on utilities, and a windfall tax on the Pounds 3.5bn profit
that will accrue to the regional electricity companies when National Grid is
sold or transferred later this year.
Statutory powers for the Inland Revenue to investigate the 'financial
substance' of tax avoidance schemes, even where no rules are broken.
Ending 'unfair' tax relief on executive share options, private medical
insurance and payments in kind such as jewellery and exotic untraded
chemicals.
Closing 'offshore' tax loopholes by tightening the rules on non-residence
and non-domicile claims, ending the 'abuse' of offshore regulations by
trusts and companies, and abolishing sovereign immunity, under which profits
on some investments by overseas governments are free of tax.
Preventing the treatment of income as capital and ending reinvestment
relief, intended to stimulate investment in unquoted companies, which Labour
claims is misused to avoid tax.
Simplification of corporate taxation, including tightening rules on group
structures, companies with foreign control, and foreign income dividends.
Dropping government plans to scrap stamp duty on securities, and preventing
avoidance of the duty on contracts, which Labour claims are kept offshore to
avoid payment.
Preventing using trusts for tax avoidance by bringing them into line with
the treatment of individuals.
Closing loopholes such as investments in farmland and insurance schemes to
avoid inheritance tax.
The tax reform plans are intended to demonstrate Labour's determination to
reduce taxes for middle-income taxpayers by forcing the better-off to pay a
bigger share. Proposals for using the money saved from tackling tax abuses
are planned to be published in a Budget submission to the Treasury in two
weeks.
Mr Brown will continue, however, to resist pressure to forecast income tax
rates under a Labour government.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Challenge to Hurd over Pergau funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was yesterday accused in the High Court
of acting unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget
for the Pergau dam in Malaysia.
The World Development Movement, a lobby group for developing countries, is
seeking to have his decision quashed, to recover the Pounds 29.6m already
spent and to block further payments from the aid budget for the dam's
construction. The next instalment is due to be paid next month.
The group says that Mr Hurd overstepped his powers under the 1980 Overseas
Development and Co-operation Act by allocating aid money for the improper
purpose of promoting trade with Malaysia. The act says the primary purpose
of aid must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or the welfare of
its people.
Mr Nigel Pleming QC, the group's counsel, said the purpose of the act was
'aid - not trade'. He said the use of aid could not be said to be for the
economic benefit of Malaysia because when Mr Hurd took the decision 'Pergau
was unequivocally an economically unsound project'.
Mr Pleming told the court that the dam could not be 'unbuilt' and added: 'We
are not concerned with what happens in Malaysia from now on. What we are
concerned about is that British monies which should not have been spent on
Pergau should be spent on proper, deserving cases.'
He said that Sir Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, had advised that the dam was uneconomic and
funding it was an 'abuse of the aid programme'. But he was overruled by Mr
Hurd on the basis of 'wider considerations'.
A plea by the development movement for the court to order the government to
release documents containing Sir Tim's reports to Mr Hurd was rejected by
the judge.
The government has accepted that if it loses the court case the bill for the
dam will have to be met by another government department.
The development group has said that the Pounds 234m earmarked for the
project is equal to twice as much as all British aid for water and
sanitation for the last five years, or half Britain's aid to sub-Saharan
Africa in 1992-93.
The hearing continues today.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Banham expects to create 40 unitaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, told county
councillors yesterday that he expected to create 'more than 40' English
unitary authorities which will combine the powers now shared by counties and
districts.
He told the annual conference of the Association of County Councils in
Leicester that there was overwhelming support for retaining a two-tier
structure in four counties, according to opinion surveys carried out for the
commission by the pollsters NOP.
In Northumberland 86 per cent of respondents preferred the status quo, while
there were figures of 65 per cent in Norfolk and 74 per cent in Suffolk. In
Northamptonshire 34 per cent wanted a unitary Northampton while retaining
two tiers for the rest of the county. A further 41 per cent wanted no change
to the two-tier structure at all - although this was not an option presented
by the commission.
Sir John said: 'People are not willing to support an expensive gamble on the
say-so of local politicians with a vested interest, and they have not been
impressed by many campaigns - at public expense - designed to persuade them
otherwise.'
He added that by avoiding proposals for small unitary councils made by the
Association of District Councils the commission had saved between Pounds
400m and Pounds 500m in transitional costs.
However, Sir John said that proponents of unitary authorities would have the
chance to prove their case 'on a massive scale'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Sport body expects Pounds 1.6bn from lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sports Council said yesterday that it expected Pounds 1.6bn to be
available for sport between 1995 and 2000 from the proceeds of the National
Lottery.
Projects ranging from local community sports facilities to a possible new
national stadium might be funded by the lottery, which is first drawn on
November 19. Sport is one of the five 'good causes' that will receive an
equal share from every Pounds 1 ticket sold.
Mr Rodney Walker, chairman of the Sports Council, the body responsible for
distributing lottery proceeds to sports projects in England, said yesterday:
'Every town and village in England could benefit from a new lottery-funded
sports facility between now and the turn of the century.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / Rules on casino adverts may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering relaxing the strict rules governing
advertising by casinos and betting shops, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
said yesterday.
Pressure on the government to ease gaming restrictions has increased with
the advent of the National Lottery, tickets for which go on sale on Monday.
Competing operators, including the football pools, have won concessions
after complaints that the lottery is not subject to the same tight rules on
advertising, promotion and operation as other forms of gambling.
Mr Howard told the British Casino Association that the government was
looking at all gaming controls as part of its effort to cut down on
unnecessary red tape, but it would not press ahead with any reforms without
proper public consultation.
Mr Howard added that the complete ban on advertising for casinos was 'ripe
for review'.
He said: 'There are legitimate concerns that unrestricted advertising would
send out the wrong signal to those who might be vulnerable to excessive
gaming.
'But I think there is a case for your being allowed to give out information
about yourselves, the location and facilities offered.'
Similar restrictions in other areas, such as betting shops, would be
examined, he added. Betting shops are allowed to advertise on posters, but
are not allowed to state their location.
The Ladbroke Group, which operates betting shops and casinos, said it
welcomed any move towards deregulation but added that it would also like
betting shops to be allowed to have slot machine games.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Adjudicator at Revenue to be Customs watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the complaints adjudicator at the Inland Revenue, was
named yesterday as the new watchdog at Customs and Excise.
Ms Filkin will bring both departments under a new joint adjudicator's office
from April, although she will publish two annual reports setting out
complaints and recommendations.
Ms Valerie Strachan, who chairs Customs and Excise, said she was pleased
with its complaints procedures but 'recent surveys have indicated that there
is a strong case for external adjudication similar to that for the Revenue'.
She added: 'The benefits of such a system - increased confidence on the part
of the complainants and improved feedback for the department - are clear.'
New guidance leaflets are to be published and will be available at ports,
airports and local offices. The introduction of an independent element into
Customs' complaint handling does not limit the right to ask an MP to take a
case to the ombudsman.
Ms Filkin will deal with complaints about customs officers in the dealings
with the general public and businesses and also with delays in value added
tax repayments. In her annual report she will be able to recommend the
payment of compensation in some cases.
At the revenue Ms Filkin took up 308 cases for full investigation in her
first year. She settled 105 during the period, 65 wholly or partly in favour
of the complainant.
The government has issued figures showing that gains to income tax payers in
1995-96 are concentrated among the low-paid and the well-paid compared with
broadly comparable figures for 1987-88. Those paying more tax are
concentrated on those earning Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 50,000 a year.
Income tax payments for those earning between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds
70,000 are to be reduced by an average of Pounds 620. Those earning more
than Pounds 80,000 will benefit by Pounds 16,900 on average.
The figures were given in a written answer to Mr Clive Betts MP by Sir
George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury.

FT  10 NOV 94 / One more blot in Howard's annus horribilis: The home
secretary's reluctance to accept advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a miserable year for Mr Michael Howard. Only 14 months ago he
was cheered to the rafters at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool
as he unveiled one of the toughest anti-crime programmes ever presented by a
home secretary.
Since then almost everything that could go wrong has. Two bills intended to
implement most of the 27 points in Mr Howard's anti-crime programme were
savaged by the House of Lords, big question marks have been raised over
prison security and demonstrators managed to camp out on the roof of
parliament.
To cap it all, Mr Howard was yesterday judged by the Appeal Court to have
abused his powers by implementing changes to the criminal injuries
compensation scheme without parliamentary approval.
Mr Howard will appeal to the House of Lords. But the ruling offers
devastating ammunition to his critics, who were presenting it yesterday as a
prime example of his refusal to accept advice, even from Conservative
colleagues.
Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, a former Tory cabinet minister who is chairman of
the criminal injuries compensation board, accused the home secretary of
ignoring him.
Lord Carlisle said: 'We warned the home secretary that we felt that what he
was doing was wrong, and that we felt it was probably unlawful.'
Opposition MPs were even more dismissive, pointing out that Mr Howard was
warned publicly about the weak constitutional foundations of the revised
scheme by several eminent judges, including Lords Ackner, Bridge and
Brightman.
Lord Lester, a QC and Liberal Democrat peer, was one of many senior lawyers
who warned that the home secretary's actions flouted the will of parliament
by overriding the statutory scheme set up by the Criminal Justice Act of
1988.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow home affairs spokesman, said the home secretary had
'arrogantly and foolishly' rejected attempts by Mr Tony Blair, then shadow
home secretary, to put the revised scheme on a statutory footing.
Critics of Mr Howard said his unwillingness to accept advice was in line
with other aspects of his home office stewardship, which has been marked by
a determined adherence to widely criticised policies.
These include his proposals to quintuple fines for possession of soft drugs
which have been derided by the Police Federation and the Magistrates'
Association.
Mr Howard's parliamentary problems have centred on the criminal justice
bill, which implemented many of his 27 points but was mauled by the Lords.
Many of the defeats were reversed in the Commons, but proposed changes to
the right to silence were watered down after the home secretary was rebuked
by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice.
Perhaps Mr Howard's worst moment came in the early stages of the police and
magistrates courts bill, the other main home office bill of the year, which
provides for reorganisation of police forces and police authorities.
Mr Howard was forced to dilute plans for a big increase in the home
secretary's influence over police authorities after Lord Whitelaw said they
would 'politicise the police to an unacceptable degree'.
Mr Howard has made light of many of his setbacks, describing criticism of
his proposals from distinguished predecessors as part of the democratic
process. He is likely to find the Appeal Court's verdict harder to shrug
off.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Humberside to get jobs boost from power plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 700 jobs are to be created in building a Pounds 520m gas-fired power
station near Grimsby, Humberside County Council said yesterday.
The station is being built by a consortium including Midlands Electricity,
the regional power company, IVO, the Finnish electricity company, and Tomen,
the Japanese trading company.
The council said the station was one of the biggest inward investments into
the UK. It is due to open in 1997. Mr Norman O'Neill, of the council's
economic development sub-committee, said the investment was the first of
many.
Construction of the station, which will have a capacity of 750MW, has been
seen as a setback for coal. When it is fully operational it will displace up
to 2m tonnes of coal a year.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Japanese banks condemn competitor over savers' lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's banking fraternity was divided yesterday when a credit banks'
association condemned one of its more ambitious members for launching a
lottery to attract new savers. On Monday, Johnan Shinkin (Credit) Bank
offered a savings account that made depositors eligible for a twice-yearly
raffle. In addition to the normal interest rate on the one-year deposit,
savers were offered the incentive of cash prizes of up to Y50,000 (Pounds
318).
The scheme was a hit. On the first day, the bank collected Y10bn in
deposits. And within hours the bank's anxious rivals had cried foul,
accusing Johnan of stealing an unfair march on the rest of the sector.
Their objection is that the new account breaches a self-imposed rule that
institutions will offer only gifts and not cash bonuses as incentives, and
that gifts should not exceed Y1,500 in value.
Yesterday the banks' grievance was dignified by Mr Keikichi Kato, chairman
of the National Association of Shinkin Banks, who issued an unprecedented
censure of Johnan's action. He said it was 'regrettable Johnan was
neglecting the association's voluntary rules'.
It is very unusual for a financial institution in Japan to break ranks so
unapologetically with its competitors, and Johnan's move may herald a more
independent approach by the main banks.
Observers were sceptical of the the banks' stated concerns.
A more serious objection seems to be that Johnan has found a novel way to
offer a higher interest rate to depositors. The bank calculates that the
average customer has a 3.38 per cent chance of winning a prize, and that the
overall effect of the scheme is to offer an extra 0.2 per cent interest to
savers.
Last month, the remaining regulations on interest rates were finally lifted
by the finance ministry, leaving banks free to set their own rates for
depositors.
But since the changes, most banks have continued to offer remarkably similar
rates, and consumer groups have expressed doubt about the strength of their
commitment to open competition.
A finance ministry official said that, since the banks' rule was voluntary,
the ministry was not in a position to act. But he added: 'It is questionable
whether it is appropriate for public-spirited financial institutions to set
up lotteries in an attempt to gain deposits.'
Johnan was unrepentant yesterday. A spokesman said the voluntary restraint
was against the spirit of financial deregulation, since it represented 'a
form of collusion' among the country's banks to deprive customers of the
benefits of freer markets.
He dismissed the row as simply 'labour pains' at the birth of a new era in
the country's financial system.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Summit light spills over on to East Timor: Indonesia is
braced for world attention on its annexed territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On All Souls Day at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the East Timor capital of
Dili last week, people paid tribute, in the Roman Catholic tradition, to
their deceased family and friends. Near the chapel a large group gathered
and, led by a local priest, remembered up to 200 independence demonstrators
who were massacred there by Indonesian soldiers three years ago.
Further recollections of the massacre, official admission of which was slow
to emerge at the time, are the sort of thing the Indonesian government hopes
will not take the gloss off its hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation summit next week.
President Suharto's government, notoriously sensitive about its annexation
of the former Portuguese colony it invaded in 1975, is hoping to win new
international respect from the summit, due to be attended by representatives
of 17 governments.
However, US President Bill Clinton and others will be under pressure to
raise human rights issues at the summit, and at least some attention is
bound to be focused on East Timor.
East Timor was abandoned by its colonial administrators in 1975 when the
region was plunged into civil war. Indonesia invaded because, the government
claims, the civil war in the territory, which borders Indonesian West Timor,
'threatened seriously to disrupt the national development and reconstruction
efforts in which Indonesia was engaged'.
East Timor was declared Indonesia's 27th province in 1976, defying
resolutions passed by the United Nations which does not recognise Jakarta's
sovereignty over the territory.
Sensitive to foreign criticism, Indonesian officials are keen to point out
that the region receives more government development funds, per head, than
any other. Under Portuguese rule the region's infrastructure and facilities
were negligible. Today there are schools, a university, roads, bridges,
health clinics, telecommunications facilities and electricity. Water supply
is still a problem.
However, says an East Timorese professional, 'we never cried for
development. We cried for freedom.'
Freedom is not on offer - a referendum is ruled out - but the Indonesian
government has taken some steps to find a solution. Mr Ali Alatas, foreign
minister, met earlier this year in New York, under United Nations auspices,
with the leader-in-exile of the Fretilin independence group, Mr Ramos Horta,
and with Mr Abilio Araujo, another former leader-in-exile who was ousted
from the exiled movement by opponents last year.
More recently President Suharto announced he would meet Mr Araujo although
they would not discuss the status of the territory.
There has also been talk of granting autonomy or special status to East
Timor but it is not clear what this means and statements have been
non-committal. East Timorese are quick to point out that the north Sumatran
province of Aceh and the sultanate of Yogjakarta in central Java are also
accorded special status, but that this has not made any difference to the
way the regions are governed.
Meanwhile, the military makes clear it has no plans to leave. 'If we leave
there will be more conflict,' says East Timor's military commander, Col Kiki
Syahnakri. However, he claims the number of armed guerrillas is dwindling -
there are only 188 poorly-equipped Fretilin fighters left in the mountains,
he says.
One East Timorese official says rape and murder by the military and police
are daily occurrences in many parts of the region. Many of these cases, he
says, go unreported and the perpetrators are not brought to trial. 'We are
really suffering here,' he says.
Clashes between mainly Moslem Indonesians, who are given incentives to move
to East Timor, and Roman Catholic East Timorese are common. Recently two
army officers were found guilty by a military court of desecrating the
sacrament in a Catholic church and discharged.
The animosity is made worse by rising unemployment. The East Timor
Provincial Capital Investment Co-ordinating Board says there were 16,308
unemployed people in the province in August 1993, but independent sources
say the figure is much higher. There are complaints that all the best jobs
go to outsiders. East Timorese say that they have little control over their
region's economy. The plantation and processing of coffee, the main cash
crop, is dominated by the military although a monopoly on production was
lifted earlier this year.
Indonesian rule has increased the level of distrust among the population.
Plain-clothed intelligence officers are ubiquitous. 'I don't even know
whether my brother or sister is spying on me,' says an East Timorese
professional who complains that Indonesian rule has sowed an atmosphere of
fear among the population.
In the absence of a referendum, and with a continuing large military
presence in East Timor, Indonesia's rule in the region will continue to
attract criticism from the international community. The Apec summit next
week is likely to be seen by some as an occasion for that criticism to be
loudly voiced.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Privatisation companies lined up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia plans a privatisation drive as part of its 1995-96 budget, with
international equity offerings and flotations on the Jakarta stock exchange,
Manuela Saragosa reports.
Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, finance minister, said yesterday that Telkom, the
domestic telecommunications company, PLN, the electricity company, and Jasa
Marga, the toll road operator, were the three state-owned companies most
prepared to 'go international'. He also admitted that Garuda, the
state-owned airline which some brokers said was being groomed to go public,
was not yet ready to be sold on the international market.
The government also plans to reduce its stake in Semen Gresik, one of the
country's largest cement producers, which is already listed in Jakarta, and
sell shares in two other state-owned cement producers, the South
Sulawesi-based Semen Tonasa and the West Sumatra-based Semen Padang.
Mr Andrew Vaughan, director of research and sales at stockbroker G K Goh
Ometraco, said the privatisations 'have been on the launch-pad for a long
time'. Telkom is thought likely to sell at least Dollars 500m (Pounds 312m)
worth of shares in its initial public offering. It is estimated that each of
the companies will have to float at least Dollars 20m-worth of shares to
make the exercise worthwhile. But it is not clear yet whether Jasa Marga
will issue bonds overseas rather than selling shares.
The companies are expected to give domestic exchanges a boost by floating
some of their equity on the Indonesia market. 'Long-term, this is exactly
what the Jakarta market needs, to have more large blue-chip companies,' said
Mr David Oxtoby, research director at Asia Equity Jasereh. 'The size of
their cash call may have a short-term depressing effect, but it will simply
be a case of short-term pain for long-term gain.'
Mr Muhammad's planned privatisations follow the flotation of shares in
Indosat, Indonesia's telecom satellite enterprise, on the New York Stock
Exchange last month which raised at least Dollars 800m for the Indonesian
government.
Indosat sold 25 per cent of its shares in New York and 10 per cent on the
Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges. Merrill Lynch was the global
underwriter for the offering, while Danareksa Sekuritas underwrote the
domestic share sale.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Hanoi set for Dollars 2bn pledges in foreign aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Vietnam is likely to receive pledges of some Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
foreign aid at a donors' meeting in Paris next week and wants about Dollars
10bn by the end of the decade to fund its economic reform programme,
Vietnamese government officials and foreign donors say.
Both sides are confident the 'consultative group' of 18 countries and 15
international organisations, chaired by the World Bank on Tuesday and
Wednesday, will at least match the Dollars 1.86bn pledged at the first such
meeting last year. Japan is again expected to be the biggest bilateral
donor.
Donors are pleased by Vietnam's performance as it moves from a centrally
planned to a market economy with annual growth rates in excess of 8 per
cent, but they are also concerned by delays in implementation of aid
projects. The UN says that only an estimated Dollars 300m in aid has been
disbursed this year.
'The most important issue will be how to use ODA (official development
assistance) in Vietnam, not how to attract ODA,' said Mr Do Duc Dinh, a
Vietnamese economist.
One reason for slow disbursement is that much of the aid is directed at big
infrastructure projects involving roads and ports, for example, which take
many months to implement. Some delays are caused by a cumbersome bureaucracy
slow to adopt free market policies.
'With the actual disbursements of ODA, things are not flowing as freely as
we would have hoped,' said Mr Roy Morey, representative in Vietnam for the
UN Development Programme. 'The institutional apparatus is the same as the
country has had for 25 years, and there's a kind of lag between policy
formulation and policy implementation.'
In its latest report on Vietnam, the World Bank urges Hanoi to scrap central
control of decision making (on the grounds that this causes bottlenecks and
encourages corruption in an increasingly complex economy), by decentralising
some tax and investment decisions to local authorities.
The World Bank admits this suggestion is controversial (local Communist
party authorities in some areas are accused of rampant corruption) but
believes it would allow the government to take on its proper role of
establishing an economic framework within which individuals and companies
could work.
'Vietnam is moving from relatively easy price liberalisation to more
difficult structural reforms, such as restructuring state-owned banks,
privatising public companies, and streamlining the trade regime,' the World
Bank report says.

Japan's leading electronics companies yesterday said they would increase
workers' bonuses for the first time in four years, a good sign for consumer
spending. Other sectors are unlikely to follow suit this year because they
have done less well than electronics groups. Yet the bonus rise indicates
that the traditional link between workers' incomes and corporate profits has
survived the rigours of recession. Trade unions at the top 17 electronics
groups said yesterday they had accepted six-monthly bonuses averaging 5.06
months' basic salary for this winter and next summer, up from last year's
five months' bonus.

<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday signed an agreement with Palestinians for aid
and loans worth up to Dollars 124m (Pounds 77m) in 1995 and strongly
defended its record on assistance to Palestinians. Mr Juan Prat, European
Commission director general, who signed the agreement with Mr Yassir Arafat,
chairman of the Palestinian self-rule authority, in Gaza also warned the EU
would not fund Palestinian running costs after June next year. Mr Prat said
the EU had spent Dollars 61m this year and made grants worth Dollars 1.1bn
since 1987 in development assistance and support to Palestinian refugees.
The EU is the biggest single donor to Palestinians and the 1995 aid package
is part of the EU's Dollars 620m five-year programme of grants and loans
from the European Investment Bank. Among projects supported by the EU are
paying salaries of the 10,800 Palestinian policemen; a Dollars 50m project
to build 1,200 housing units; construction of a 230-bed hospital; upgrading
of the sewage and solid waste systems; and funding Palestinian universities
and colleges. Mr Prat said donors faced a dilemma. While they wanted to fund
visible projects that immediately demonstrated to Palestinians that peace
brought concrete changes in living standards they were being forced to fund
salaries and running costs.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Demirel raises stakes in tense regional game: Project means
Turkish hand on Syrian and Iraqi water supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel inaugurated a key new stage in the
country's gigantic hydroelectric and irrigation project yesterday, he also
raised the stakes in an increasingly tense game of regional power politics.
Turkey is water-rich, but its Arab neighbours are desperately short of it;
strategists warn that the question of water is becoming a more explosive
Middle East issue than that of oil.
The South-east Anatolia Project, known by its Turkish acronym Gap, is a
complex of 22 dams on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. As well as developing
a remote and neglected corner of Turkey, it also represents a Turkish hand
on the water supply of Syria and Iraq.
With yesterday's inauguration of the first stage of the 26.4km Sanliurfa
irrigation tunnel, 30 cu m a second of water will begin flowing from the
huge Ataturk Dam through a mountain range to the arid Harran Plain to
irrigate nearly 500,000 hectares of land.
Gap is a dream come true for Mr Demirel, a hydrological engineer called the
'king of dams' and one of the project's prime movers in the 1960s. Gap's
huge size (the Ataturk Dam is the world's fifth largest and the Sanliurfa
tunnel is the longest of its kind) is a potent affirmation of national
pride.
Mr Demirel said at yesterday's ceremony attended by 2,000 people: 'We have
many more projects (for the region). We now know that we are able to carry
them out alone.'
Gap is being designed and built almost entirely by Turkish companies. Turkey
is also financing most of the Dollars 32bn (Pounds 20bn) cost alone, since
multilateral lenders refused to support the project. Still, the Gap project
is expected to add more than Dollars 1bn a year to Turkey's Dollars 170bn
GDP.
Once it is fully operational early in the next century, Gap will irrigate
land twice the area of Belgium. The Harran Plain, site of some of the
earliest civilisations, has fertile soils but lacks abundant water.
Critics complain the project will increase the power of feudal landlords,
and fear the government is underestimating its environmental costs. Further,
water running off the plain into tributaries is likely to become polluted
with pesticides, fertilisers and salts and become unsuitable for use further
downstream.
The plain will produce cash crops such as cotton and soyabeans. They will be
processed in nearby cities, creating jobs and raising incomes for the
country's most depressed region. Officials hope it will bring stability to a
region wracked by 10 years of fighting between government forces and
guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK).
But for Syria and Iraq, which depend heavily on the Euphrates, Gap is a
nightmare. Each cubic metre of water poured on to the Harran Plain
represents a roughly equal reduction in the Euphrates' flow.
Before the first dams were completed in the late 1980s, the Euphrates
carried 856m cu m of water across the Syrian border every second. In 1987
Turkey promised Syria a stable flow of 500 cu m a second. If worst-case
scenarios are borne out, pre-Gap flows further downstream into Iraq could be
cut by more than 80 per cent in the next 40 years.
Turkey gave Syria and Iraq no role in Gap's development and has never
reached an agreement with them over sharing the waters of the Euphrates and
Tigris. International lenders such as the World Bank refuse to back Gap.
Thus, Turkey has had to postpone or scale back projects. Building Gap is
straining government finances and fuelling inflation of more than 100 per
cent.
Syria is not satisfied with Turkey's unilateral 1987 commitment to supply
500 cu m of water a second. It has chosen to press Ankara for a water deal
by supporting the PKK. Turkish security forces are spending more than
Dollars 7bn a year to fight the PKK in the Kurdish south-east.
Mr Dogul Ergil, a political scientist at Ankara University and adviser to
the Gap administration, says: 'Turkey proposed a philosophy of mutual use,
to consume water where there is less evaporation and cultivate land where
the soils are most fertile, and share the fruits'.
But 'our neighbours are dictatorships and it is not in the nature of
dictatorships to co-operate.'
Optimists hope water may yet bring peace rather than conflict. Already Gap
is shifting the region's strategic balance towards Turkey. But like many
Turkish officials, Mr Ergil strenuously denies Gap is anything more than a
development project: 'Turkey has never thought of using it as an instrument
to manipulate our southern neighbours.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / African peacekeeping force 'has moved nearer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Francois Mitterrand claimed yesterday the idea of an inter-African
peacekeeping force to intervene in future Rwanda-style crises had 'advanced'
at the Franco-African summit in Biarritz, adding France would ask other
European countries to join it in providing help.
But not all the 35 African leaders present favoured or promised to take part
in such a force, and most backers of the idea said it depended crucially on
non-African assistance.
'This pan-African structure of 'blue helmets' will only be really
operational if France and other friendly countries give us their logistic
support,' President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo said.
The French president stoutly defended his often-controversial Africa policy
at a summit dominated by discussion of the Rwandan bloodshed and its
consequences, but to which Paris had not invited Rwanda's new leaders.
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was one of those who criticised France
for excluding Rwanda, though the Zairean leader's own presence in France,
which has denied him a visa for the past few years because of his human
rights record at home, stirred a separate controversy.
President Mitterrand vaunted France's record of economic help to Africa
before and after last January's devaluation of the French African franc
(CFA), and of security assistance, especially French troops' intervention in
this summer's Rwandan civil war.
Mr Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur want to avoid repeating
France's painful exposure in its Operation Turquoise in Rwanda, at the start
of which more than 2,000 French troops were joined only by 230 Senegalese.
President Sylvestre Ntibantuganya of Burundi, which faces the same ethnic
tensions as Rwanda, made clear he would prefer diplomatic help rather
military intervention.
The French president said the summit participants had agreed on 'certain
general principles' that an African intervention force would be under
'collective command, acting under the aegis of the UN or the Organisation of
African Unity'. But some leaders appeared divided on the issue of who should
take part.
President Omar Bongo of Gabon said Rwanda had given urgency to discussion of
an African force, but talks should first take place among French-speaking
countries. President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso said that discussing
security in west Africa made no sense without English-speaking Nigeria or
Ghana.
French leaders are keen for the widest possible participation in an
intervention force to avoid accusations of neo-colonialism. But
Vice-President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, which along with Zimbabwe,
Ethiopia and Eritrea was represented at the biennial summit for the first
time, indicated his new government would not take part in any force, even
though its army is the continent's most powerful.
Mr Mitterrand, who said he hoped several European countries would join
France in providing logistic support to an African force, is to meet Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, in next week's Franco-British summit in Chartres.
President Bongo said yesterday he had been one of the strongest opponents of
the CFA devaluation, but now conceded it was necessary and was benefiting
most of the 14 economies concerned. He urged Africa's creditors to forgive
more of the continent's debts.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: California goes from ballot box to
courtroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A San Francisco judge yesterday afternoon issued a temporary restraining
order preventing enforcement of parts of the referendum denying social
services to illegal immigrants which was approved by the voters of
California on Tuesday.
Judge Stuart Pollack commented of Proposition 187, supported by a 59-41 per
cent margin, 'there are serious legal questions here that need to be
resolved.' The move from the ballot box to the courtroom had been expected
regardless of the extent of the referendum's victory.
Strength of support for the Proposition was clearly a contributory factor in
the easy re-election of Governor Pete Wilson over Democratic contender Ms
Kathleen Brown and to the narrowness of the defeat of Republican Congressman
Michael Huffington by Senator Dianne Feinstein.
Both Republican candidates had been vocal advocates in favour and both
Democrats against. It also helped the re-election on Tuesday of Mr Dan
Lungren, the Republican state attorney general, who only came out in support
on Monday.
The proposition's passage also prompted an angry response from the Mexican
government yesterday. A foreign ministry statement condemned 'all open and
undercover forms of discrimination and any xenophobic practices'.
Legal challenges to its constitutionality and legality derive from its two
principal clauses - the denial of education and non-emergency healthcare to
illegal immigrants and the obligation on teachers, doctors and hospitals to
report to the federal government any individual suspected of illegal status.
Mr Demetrios Papademetriou, an immigration expert at the Carnegie Endowment
in Washington, who has helped prepare one legal challenge, said the suit was
'very broad' and based on the contention that the proposition would not
accomplish what it claimed to do - force the repatriation of the estimated
1.6m illegal immigrants in California.
He predicted that the state legal processes could be finished 'quite
quickly', though an ultimate judgment by the US Supreme Court, which would
take much longer, is considered likely. Mr Papademetriou described
Proposition 187 as 'a nasty primal scream'.
A Supreme Court ruling in 1982, Plyler v Doe, found that the 14th 'equal
protection' amendment to the US constitution prohibited a state from denying
admission to schools to any child living within its borders. Federal
education law also requires that government funds be withdrawn whenever
confidential information is revealed without consent of parents.
A problem still to be addressed in the lawsuits is the consequences of
forcing out of school the estimated 300,000 sons and daughters of illegal
immigrants in California. Proposition opponents argued this was certain to
contribute to juvenile delinquency.
Governor Wilson has already conceded the inevitability of lawsuits and Mr
Lungren last week said he would defend the proposition in court because he
was obliged by his office so to do. But he added that he lacked the
authority to prosecute teaching and medical professionals accused of not
informing on illegal immigrants.
Mr Wilson, along with some other governors from states with high levels of
immigration, has already sued Washington to require the federal government
to cover state expenditure on the health, welfare and education services
provided to not only illegal immigrants but also a new flood of refugees and
asylum seekers.
The principal immigrant recipient states, after California, are Florida,
Texas, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Arizona. Only in Florida has
political controversy remotely comparable to that in California been
evident, a reflection in part of different economic conditions and political
traditions.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Big Apple fails to save political
giant

<TEXT>
New York city turned out in force on Tuesday to vote for Mr Mario Cuomo, the
state's governor for the past 12 years and a giant on the national political
stage. The trouble for city dwellers was, the rest of the state did not.
The narrow vote which ousted the 62-year-old Mr Cuomo, installing in his
place Mr George Pataki, a little-known Republican, revealed a starker
division between voters in the city and those in the suburbs and up-state
New York than at any of the previous three elections, all of which Mr Cuomo
won.
It also threatens to usher in a turbulent period in relations between state
and city in New York - and a degree of animosity that could turn the city's
current budgetary problems into a bigger headache.
The reasons for Mr Cuomo's defeat are not difficult to identify. 'The New
York economy has dramatically lagged behind the national recovery,' says Mr
David Schulman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Manhattan. 'And Cuomo
has been around too long.'
The second consideration was probably the strongest in bringing to a halt
one of the most prominent liberal Democratic political careers in the US.
Mr Cuomo's accomplished oratory and political skills finally wore thin with
an electorate which has failed to see clear signs of improvement after the
last recession.
Mr Cuomo twice came close to seeking the Democratic nomination for
president, most recently in 1992. He was also offered, but turned down, a
seat on the US Supreme Court last year. Mr Pataki, meanwhile, benefited from
not being Mr Cuomo.
A former mayor of the small town of Peekskill, he is less well known than
his political godfather, Senator Alfonse D'Amato. The New York Republican
senator single-handedly pulled Mr Pataki from obscurity when he threw his
weight behind the state senator earlier this year.
Otherwise, the new governor has preached a bland and generally vague mix of
policies during his campaign. He has pledged to champion the reintroduction
of the death penalty in New York, build more prisons and reduce taxes. As a
tax-cutting Roman Catholic from the prosperous Westchester suburbs, Mr
Pataki is not the sort of person most likely to appeal to city dwellers.
Adding to the city's anxiety was the decision by its Republican mayor, Mr
Rudolph Giuliani, two weeks ago to cross party lines and back Mr Cuomo's
campaign. Mr Giuliani and Mr D'Amato are old rivals.
The question now is whether Mr Pataki and his political mentor will take
their revenge.
Mr Lewis Lehrman, a New York businessman who ran against Mr Cuomo in an
earlier gubernatorial election, says that the city could suffer from Mr
Giuliani's endorsement. 'New York city has been subsidised by the taxpayers
of upstate New York for generations. While that will not entirely be
reversed, growth of those subsidies should end.'
At the very least, it will make life difficult for Mr Giuliani as he
grapples with a budget deficit that is expected to top Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) in each of the next two years.
'It's likely to make the city's budgetary problems more difficult to deal
with,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres.
Around two thirds of the state's budget goes to local governments in the
form of aid, roughly half to New York city. If Mr Pataki pushes ahead and
cuts the state's top income tax rate, says Mr Rohatyn, it will add Dollars
500m a year to the city's deficit. 'It could be detrimental to its
businesses, and drive more people away from the city,' he says.

Mexico's Congress formally appointed Mr Ernesto Zedillo president-elect
yesterday, preparing the way for his assumption of power on December 1.
After long and tense negotiations, the centre-right National Action party
(PAN) finally abstained and the centre-left Democratic Revolutionary party
voted against ratifying the presidential election. PAN said the election had
not been fair and just, and thus could not endorse the result. The leftist
PRD said the election was invalidated by widespread fraud.

<TEXT>
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art in New York on Tuesday night
brought in Dollars 25.9m and was almost 78 per cent sold by value. All the
important works on offer, including one of Modigliani's last portraits, of
his mistress Jeanne Hebuterne, found buyers, but there was little interest
in the second rate. Seventeen of the 46 lots were unsold. The Modigliani
sold for Dollars 5.94m, just under its estimate. 'Femme dans la nuit',
painted in 1945 by Joan Mro, was also slightly below forecast, selling for
Dollars 3.03m. In 1986 Sotheby's sold the same painting for Dollars 2.5m. A
drawing by Van Gogh, 'Wheat Field with Sheaves', copied from one of his
oils, was just on target at Dollars 2.09m. There was little interest in
Picasso, with only two of six paintings by him finding buyers.

Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, yesterday became
actively involved in campaigning for next week's elections for state
governors. But instead of backing politicians from his own party, he was
giving support to a candidate from the left-wing Workers party (PT), his
main opponents in last month's presidential poll. Mr Cardoso's meeting with
Mr Vitor Buaiz, the PT's candidate for governor in the southern state of
Esprito Santo, was prompted by shared concern about the increasing
popularity for the other candidate, Mr Dejair Camata, a far-right protest
candidate who has pledged to wipe out crime. Mr Camata is a former police
corporal who, has pledged to erase crime in Esprito Santo and, if elected,
would give criminals 24 hours to flee the state. According to opinion polls
these types of populist promises are winning over the voters.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Chile inflation at annual 8.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chile will have single digit inflation this year for only the second time in
30 years. Mr Eduardo Aninat, finance minister, said in London yesterday that
restrictive economic policies had brought inflation down to an annual 8.3
per cent, from 13.7 per cent when the government took over in March. The
government's 1994 target of 10-11 per cent would be undershot, and the 1995
target might have to be revised downwards.
Chile had single digit annual inflation for a single year in 1980 but the
exchange rate policy that brought it about was unsustainable. The previous
year of single digit inflation was 1961. Growth this year will slow to 4.3
per cent - with consumer expenditures slowing - but should expand to more
than 6 per cent next year. Next year's overall budget surplus should be
about 1 per cent, compared with 2 per cent this year. Last year's trade
deficit of Dollars 974m (Pounds 593.9m) will become a surplus this year of
about Dollars 200m, helped by price increases for exports and a 10-12 per
cent growth in export volumes.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Health, gambling and false teeth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Around the country, voters cast ballots on dozens of measures over issues
ranging from healthcare to gambling and false teeth.
In Oregon, voters were close to allowing doctors to assist in suicides of
the terminally ill. In California, voters rejected a taxpayer-funded state
healthcare system and a referendum, backed by the tobacco industry, which
would reverse local smoking curbs. Limits on the terms officials can serve
passed in five states - Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Nebraska and Nevada. A total
of 21 states have now approved congressional term limits, but the
initiatives are subject to constitutional challenge in the courts.
Term limits vary from state to state. Colorado limited congressmen to three
consecutive terms. Nebraska imposed limits of three consecutive House terms
or two consecutive Senate terms. Nevada voters would limit senators to two
six-year terms and House members to three two-year terms.
Florida voters defeated a proposal to legalise gambling casinos. In
Washington state, dental technicians won permission to fit and install false
teeth, a right now limited to dentists.

African-Americans as just one of a series of black public officials targeted
by a white prosecutors, he drew support from many middle class blacks, who
might otherwise have opposed a disgraced public official. His opponent, Ms

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The younger generation of Bushes, sons of the former president, had a win
and a loss.
In Texas, George W Bush, the eldest son, felled Governor Ann Richards, who
once ridiculed President Bush for having been 'born with a silver foot in
his mouth'. Although a popular incumbent, Ms Richards proved susceptible to
a Republican tidal wave powered by promises to reduce taxes and crime. Mr
Bush, owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, won on his first try for
office. The attractive, prolific Bush children and grandchildren, played
important roles in their father's campaigns.
Another Bush son, Jeb, lost in a very close race against Florida Governor
Lawton Chiles. In a long political career, Chiles - a former senator - has
never lost a race.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Kennedy clan bucks the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While many Democrats were buried in Tuesday's landslide, Kennedy clan
candidates proved resilient, writes Nancy Dunne. Senator Edward Kennedy, the
family's patriarch, was in danger of losing his Senate seat for the first
time since 1962 but ultimately won handily against a young, telegenic
political neophyte, Mitt Romney, son of a former Michigan governor and
presidential candidate, George Romney.
Senator Kennedy was once hailed by President John Kennedy as the best
politician in the family. Now aging and overweight, he rallied former aides
and old friends to his standard and mortgaged his house to raise funds.
Four members of the younger Kennedy generation also were in contests. Two
ran and won seats in the US House of Representatives - Joseph Kennedy, son
of the slain Robert, in Massachusetts, and Patrick Kennedy, son of Edward,
in Rhode Island. Mark Shriver, son of the first Peace Corps director Sargent
Shriver and Eunice Kennedy, won a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert, is in a race for Maryland
lieutenant governor that yesterday was too close to call.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Big money still garners big vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money has always talked in US elections, and it spoke as loud as ever this
year in the most expensive campaign on record.
In more than 80 per cent of the elections, candidates with the most money to
pay for television advertising, direct mailing and telephone campaigning won
their races, and lobbying groups that helped finance them are looking
forward to an open door at their Washington offices.
Republicans won all nine Senate seats left open by retirements, and in seven
raised more money than their Democratic opponents. In the two exceptions,
Minnesota and Oklahoma, the fundraising advantage was not crushing.
Republicans who unseated incumbent Democratic senators in Tennessee and
Pennsylvania also outraised their opponents. Mr Rick Santorum, in
Pennsylvania, drew heavily on the political action committees, or PACs,
through which companies and lobbying groups donate to candidates.
PACs have in the past heavily favoured incumbents, regardless of party. But
Republican leaders have been twisting arms heavily recently, warning
lobbyists they would be frozen out if they continued to give to Democrats.
Big winners include the National Rifle Association, which turned its fury on
several old allies who had voted for Mr Clinton's crime bill.
The NRA's most prized trophy was Congressman Tom Foley, the Speaker, who
also voted for the crime bill and conceded defeat yesterday in Washington
state.
Many candidates, however, dipped deep into their own pockets to pay for
their campaigns. By the end of October, according to Federal Election
Commission returns, Senate candidates had spent more than Dollars 50m
(Pounds 30.4m) of their own money.
Most of that came from Mr Michael Huffington, who took his Texas oil fortune
to California to run against Senator Dianne Feinstein. He lost, but the
Dollars 28m he spent took him close to uprooting a popular and effective
senator, despite his non-existent record of achievement, vague political
views and employment of an illegal alien as his nanny.
Ms Feinstein had to spend Dollars 2.35m of her own in defence of her Senate
seat, but mostly raised money from PACs.
One oddity was Mr Oliver North, controversial former marine who lost his bid
to oust Sen Charles Robb in Virginia. Mr North raised over Dollars 15m, four
times that of Mr Robb.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: South becomes cornerstone of House
takeover - Southerners have previously said that they would 'rather vote for
a yellow dog' than a Republican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cornerstone of the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives
was a sweeping change in the southern US.
Ever since the Civil War, the South has traditionally shunned President
Abraham Lincoln's Republican party. Most southerners said they would 'rather
vote for a yellow dog' than a Republican.
Southern Democrats stood far to the right of their northern colleagues in
their political views, blending social conservatism with heavy pork barrel
spending.
Since the 1960s, when the Democrats became more closely identified with the
fight for black civil rights, the Republicans have made inroads in the Deep
South and the border states such as Kentucky and Missouri.
They started with presidential elections, in which southern states have
generally favoured Republican candidates from Senator Barry Goldwater
onwards, and continued in statewide elections for governor and senator.
That trend carried on in Tuesday's elections, with Republican candidates
taking over as governors in Alabama, Tennessee, Kansas, and with both
Tennessee Senate seats moving into the Republican column. Tennessee's new
governor is the first the state has ever elected who was born north of the
Mason-Dixon line, the traditional divide between North and South.
Perhaps as telling, the Republicans were able to hold on to the governorship
of South Carolina, though by the narrowest of margins, even though their
candidate, Mr David Beasley, aroused hostility with radical rightwing
positions backed by a Christian evangelical coalition.
One rare success for the Democrats was Governor Zell Miller's successful
campaign for re-election in Georgia, defeating the strongest challenge the
Republicans have mounted in that state since the Civil War.
But Republicans have in the past found it much more difficult to make
headway at the local level, leaving the Democrats dominant in the House of
Representatives, as well as in state legislatures and county courthouses.
'Used to be, if you wanted to win, you ran in the Democratic primary,' says
Mr Bernie Castleman, who is the only Republican commissioner elected in his
Tennessee county in the last hundred years.
That began to change in this election. Helped by the retirement of old
Democratic legislators such as Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, the
Republicans gained 11 House seats in five deep South states, three more in
Oklahoma, two in Texas and one each in Tennessee and Kansas.
The biggest swing came in North Carolina, where the cigarette tax proposed
in President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan added to the Democrats'
problems in tobacco-growing districts.
North Carolina also provided perhaps the most striking evidence of a lasting
change in the South's party alignment: a Republican takeover of the state
house and Senate - the first time this century that they have controlled a
state legislature in the South. They also won control of the Florida Senate.
Many southern Democrats have voting records in Congress that are closer to
the Republicans than to the rest of the Democratic party, and some are
expected to follow Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama's party switch
yesterday. Congressman Newt Gingrich has warned that the Republicans will
target conservative southerners who do not switch sides in the 1996
election.
And with the 'yellow dog Democrats'' stranglehold broken, new candidates
will feel in years to come that they can run as Republicans and have a good
chance of winning.
Southern Democrats are now as likely to be relatively leftwing black or
Hispanic politicians as conservative 'boll weevils'.
The South's realignment could also move the Democratic party further to the
left.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: A seismic takeover for the
Republicans - Losers and winners in polls which dealt a severe blow to
Clinton and the Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Even if the Republican party had fallen short of complete control of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, the congressional power structure
was already well on its way to a substantial shake-up because of the
retirement and defeat of a number of party leaders and powerful committee
chairmen.
But with outright majorities in both chambers, the Republicans will make a
seismic takeover of the committee apparatus.
Most Republican candidates for House seats signed the 'Contract with
America' prepared under the leadership of Congressman Newt Gingrich, the
architect of the Republican victory, who will almost certainly take over as
Speaker of the House.
The Contract pledges to bring to the House floor in the first 100 days of
the new Congress 10 substantial bills, including measures to cut income and
capital gains taxes, increase defence spending, provide for a balanced
budget amendment to the constitution, toughen penalties for criminals, cut
back on welfare payments and set term limits for members of Congress.
But many House candidates have been running away from the details of the
Contract - and even its chief draftsmen say they promise only to bring these
measures to a vote, not to pass them.
Republican Senators have also been sceptical about the proposals, which do
not include specific spending cuts to meet a balanced budget requirement,
and the Republican leadership structure in the Senate is likely to be much
more moderate, particularly on economic issues.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, will be flanked by Senator Phil
Gramm, a right winger with unconcealed presidential ambitions who chairs the
Republicans' Senate campaign committee.
Other right wingers will take over some important posts, notably Senator
Jesse Helms, the extreme conservative from North Carolina at the head of the
foreign relations committee, and Senator Alphonse D'Amato, the Republicans'
chief attack dog on the Whitewater issue, as chairman of the banking
committee.
But major economic policy positions in the Senate will be held by some of
the party's leading moderates.
Senator Robert Packwood, although politically weakened by charges of sexual
harassment which are still under investigation, is expected to chair the
Senate finance committee, with jurisdiction over all tax-related matters.
However, Senator Gramm has hinted that he might seek to elbow Mr Packwood
aside. Mr Packwood's fellow Oregonian, Senator Mark Hatfield, will take over
the appropriations committee, which controls government spending.
Moderates will also head the labour committee (Senator Nancy Kassebaum) and
the environment and public works committee (Senator John Chafee). Senator
Larry Pressler, a stiff-necked South Dakotan with an unpredictable set of
beliefs, will take over the commerce committee, where he is likely to be
much more of a free trader and much less of a regulator than Senator Ernest
Hollings, the current chairman.
Perhaps the determining factor in the direction of the Republican Congress
will be the influence that Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico manages to
wield as chairman of the budget committee. A fiscal conservative, almost to
the point of obsession, Mr Domenici has been one of the few Republicans
willing to contemplate unpopular measures such as tax increases and cuts in
entitlement programmes such as social security and Medicare in his desire to
control the budget deficit.
Mr Domenici is therefore likely to play a central role in curbing the more
wayward Republican promises of tax cuts and in tackling the long-term fiscal
imbalance that the US faces in the next century if it does not alter the
terms of social security and Medicare.
He is aligned with his House Republican colleagues on the need for a
line-item veto but could clash with them over the supply side premises of
the Contract with America's tax cut proposals. Congressman Dick Armey, the
chief backer among the House Republicans of a flat income tax rate, says the
cuts will cost Dollars 130bn to Dollars 150bn, but says the Republicans will
simply change the way the Congressional Budget Office scores tax measures to
assume that tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating the economy - a
logic which failed to balance the budget in the Reagan era.
Mr Armey currently ranks third in the Republican hierarchy, but with the
retirement of Congressman Bob Michel, the current minority leader, and the
elevation of Mr Gingrich to Speaker, he is likely to take the number two
post of majority leader, now held for the Democrats by Congressman Richard
Gephardt.
He will be backed on most tax issues by Congressman Bill Archer, a fellow
Texan who will probably become chairman of the House Ways and Means
committee, and by Congressman John Kasich, who will take over the budget
committee.
In some other key House committees, however, the Republicans are expected to
override the normal seniority rules that have prevailed in the past.
At the appropriations committee, Congressman Joseph McDade is the senior
Republican but his indictment on corruption charges is expected to block him
from the chairmanship. The second ranking Republican, Congressman John Myers
of Indiana, may be too moderate for the taste of the new House majority.
Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, a moderate but another leader of the
Whitewater pursuit team, will become chairman of the banking committee, and
Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, one of the most centrist members
remaining in the Republican party, will chair foreign affairs.
But Mr Gingrich is expected to push for a close ally, Congressman David
Dreier of California, to head the Rules committee, which plays a crucial
role in deciding which legislation comes to the floor, and with what
amendments, rather than Congressman Gerald Solomon, who is now the senior
Republican member of the committee.
Congressman Tom Bliley of Virginia, and not senior Republican Carlos
Moorhead, is also expected to take over the energy and commerce committee,
the barony created by the all-powerful Congressman John Dingell. Mr
Dingell's loss of the chairmanship could prove one of the most important
changes. His claim to jurisdiction over virtually everything has blocked
many legislative proposals, and his departure could pave the way for the
measures such as repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, which separates
investment and commercial banking.

FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Scramble to get Gatt through

<TEXT>
Mr Newt Gingrich, the new House Speaker-to-be, has promised to work with the
Clinton Administration to pass the Uruguay Round implementing legislation
when it comes up for Congressional approval in three weeks, according to a
senior White House official.
Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said in a CNN interview
yesterday Gatt passage, the first test of bi-partisanship in the new order,
would 'send a very important signal' which the president could carry into
summits with the Pacific Rim countries next week and Latin American leaders
on December 9-10.
However, that signal has yet to be sent directly by Mr Gingrich or Senator
Robert Dole, who will become Senate majority leader. Business lobbyists
yesterday were scurrying from meeting to meeting planning strategies to
secure passage this year. It is the outgoing Democratic-controlled Congress
which will vote on the Gatt legislation, but party labels matter little on
trade. Populists on both sides of the political divide are opposing the
proposed World Trade Organisation, which the Uruguay Round creates.
The implementing legislation is being depicted as 'a budget buster,' riddled
with protectionist clauses and 'sweetheart deals.' At least Dollars 40bn
(Pounds 24.3bn) of the projected lost tariff revenue has not been offset by
new taxes or programme cuts. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve a
budget waiver before implementing legislation can go to the floor.
Mr Dole is reported to have said he would like the legislation re-written
next year, but that was before the mid-term election. He has since made
conciliatory noises about bi-partisan co-operation.
Mr Mark Anderson, trade specialist at the AFL-CIO, the labour umbrella
organisation, has little doubt that Mr Dole will in the end co-operate with
the president on Gatt. 'Dole has a long history on free trade. . . I don't
think he'll turn his back on the Business Roundtable or agribusiness.'
Opponents are arguing that 'the fired and retired' members who return for
the 'lame duck' session have not the right to vote on an issue of such
economic importance as the Gatt package. They are alert for signs of
business pay-offs to congressmen and congressional staff in search of new
jobs. Pro-Gatt lobbyists believe the election has left members free 'to vote
their consciences'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: EU's new car distribution 'archaic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main arguments used by Europe's motor industry to win renewal of new car
distribution's exemption from EU competition law have been challenged by the
top US automotive expert of McKinsey, the international management
consultancy.
Mr Glenn Mercer said that recent industry trends made the manufacturers'
arguments - broadly accepted by the European Commission last month -
'increasingly outdated'. He described the practices the exemption was
designed to preserve as 'fairly archaic'.
Contrary to the industry's claims, its traditional distribution system was
obsolete, inefficient and failed to meet consumers' needs. Without
fundamental reforms, the system would become increasingly uneconomic and out
of touch with the market.
Mr Mercer's analysis, set out in an article in the latest McKinsey
Quarterly, is based mainly on US experience. However, he said yesterday that
most of its conclusions also applied to Europe, particularly the continent.
European manufacturers claim cars are technically sophisticated products and
that they must retain the right to supply them only through franchised
dealers. They say the system encourages competition and benefits consumers
by assuring high standards of sales and service.
However, Mr Mercer disputes these arguments. He says:
Many franchised dealers are too small to survive in a free market, while
their role in supplying information to manufacturers and customers has
declined as car-buyers have become better informed.
Car-buyers are increasingly dissatisfied with franchised dealers. According
to US market research, most consumers find visiting a dealer even more
unpleasant than a dental appointment.
The claim that cars need special after-sales care has been undercut by their
increasing reliability. Franchised dealers are not well-equipped for
servicing. Servicing would often be performed more efficiently by large
specialised garages which were not tied to branded manufacturers.
Independent franchised dealers are no longer the most efficient way of
selling cars. Large savings could be made if manufacturers sold cars direct
to customers, through discount warehouse clubs or through wholly owned
dealerships.
Contrary to European manufacturers' claims, many customers would like to buy
from large outlets stocking competing brands at one site. Multi-brand
outlets have already captured about 10 per cent of the US market, Mr Mercer
says.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Toyota planning second assembly plant in
Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota is to double production capacity in Canada to 205,000 cars a year by
the late 1990s. The Japanese carmaker is planning to invest CDollars 600m
(Dollars 450m) to build a second assembly plant at Cambridge, Ontario, with
capacity to produce 120,000 cars a year. Output at its current plant is
85,000 cars a year.
The new plant, due to begin production in August 1997, will increase
Toyota's capacity in North America to more than 900,000 cars and light
trucks a year by 1998, and will help Toyota counter the impact of the yen's
appreciation.
The main model to be produced at the new plant will be the Toyota Corolla
small family saloon. It is already assembled at Toyota's plant in Ontario
and at the New United Motor Manufacturing (NUMMI) plant at Fremont,
California, Toyota's joint venture with General Motors. A rebadged version
of the Corolla produced at the NUMMI plant is sold by GM in North America.
Toyota said it would cease exporting the Corolla from Japan to North
America, when the new plant in Canada begins production.
Toyota, the leading Japanese vehicle maker, announced recently that its
production in North America was expected to rise to 790,000 vehicles in
1996, a 50 per cent increase from last year's output of 533,000.
North American produced vehicles are expected to account for 60 per cent of
Toyota's sales in the US and Canada in 1996 compared with 46 per cent last
year.
Toyota is also increasing its car exports from North America, chiefly to
Japan, Taiwan and west Europe, and exports from the US and Canada are
forecast to rise to 80,000 a year by 1996 from 50,000 last year.
It is seeking to increase the local content of its North American produced
vehicles with plans to raise engine production in the US and Canada to more
than 440,000 a year in 1996 from 207,000 in 1993.
Toyota said that the planned expansion in Canada would satisfy the local
content requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement allowing the
cars to be shipped freely between Canada, the US and Mexico.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Poland bids for improved UK trade and
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Polish prime minister, yesterday sought to attract
more UK trade and investment by stressing Poland's large market  -
equivalent to the combined populations of the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovakia and former East Germany - and access to non-Russian sources of oil.
Addressing a Polish business conference at the Confederation of British
Industry in London, Mr Pawlak said that Poland was currently enjoying rapid
export-led economic growth and broad political agreement on the development
of market-based reforms.
Polish-UK trade has more than tripled in the past four years. This is partly
a result of growing UK investment by companies such as Pilkington Glass,
British Vita, British Sugar, British American Tobacco, Cadbury Schweppes, BP
and British Oxygen, and also because of rising exports of North Sea oil to
Polish refineries through the port of Gdansk.
In the first seven months of this year Polish exports to the UK rose to
Pounds 305m (Dollars 500.2m) from Pounds 251m in the same period of 1993,
while UK exports to Poland slipped back to Pounds 366m from Pounds 415m,
mainly because of a fall in oil and refined product imports to Pounds 88m
from Pounds 151m.
Poland's diversification from dependence on Russian oil was an early
priority of post-communist governments. By 1992 oil imports from Russia had
dropped to 48 per cent of the total, while the UK supplied 21 per cent, Iran
18 per cent and Norway 8 per cent.
Last week Russia and Poland were due to finalise an agreement on the
construction of the Polish section of a gas pipeline which will eventually
bring 67bn cu m of natural gas annually to central and western Europe from
the Yamal peninsular. Mainly for domestic political reasons, Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called off the meeting, but the
substance of the deal has not been affected.
Poland will help build and finance the pipeline and take 14bn cu m of
Russian gas annually. Unlike earlier Soviet gas pipelines, which terminated
in former east Germany and so represented Soviet control over Poland, the
Yamal pipeline will transit Poland and the main throughput will be sold on
the German market.
Modernisation of Poland's oil-refining and petrochemical industry, requiring
a total investment of about Dollars 2.5bn, is one of the government's
long-term priorities. But potential foreign investors, including UK oil and
energy groups, have been frustrated by political uncertainty over what
strategy will follow. Mr Pawlak said yesterday that the government was
currently inclined to restructure the industry before privatisation.
Officials added that Warsaw would be seeking substantial foreign investment.
Developing the energy sector was part of a broader plan to restructure eight
industrial sectors, including coal, iron and steel and shipbuilding, which
had already had subsidies removed and were now operating profitably, said Mr
Marek Pol, trade and industry minister.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Apec - future global powerhouse or mere
talking shop? / The choice facing Asia Pacific nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum held its first annual
summit in Seattle a year ago, a curious European Commission asked to send
observers. The request was rejected. 'The reason was simple,' says one Asian
diplomat. 'We didn't want them to discover there was nothing to discover.'
As ministers of Apec's 17 governments meet in Jakarta today to prepare for
next Tuesday's summit, the stakes look much higher. The summit poses a stiff
test of their political will to give substance to a grouping which has so
far been long on visionary statements but short on concrete decisions.
Optimists hope the five-year-old Apec will set out to become a global
economic powerhouse by agreeing a long-term timetable for freeing all trade
and investment flows in a region which extends from Labrador to Singapore.
Apec's members include some of the world's fastest-growing economies and
account for roughly half its total gross domestic product and international
trade. But there are wide disparities between individual countries' levels
of economic development and their views on Apec's role. Bilateral relations
between some of them are acutely strained - most notably by US trade
conflicts with China and Japan and by Washington's criticisms of Indonesia's
human rights record.
If these tensions bubble up into acrimonious disputes in Jakarta, they risk
scuppering the search for harmony and casting shadows over Apec's future.
The starting point for the talks is an ambitious blueprint drafted by an
eminent persons' group, chaired by Dr Fred Bergsten, head of the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics.
It proposes that all trade barriers in Apec be abolished by 2020, and by
2010 in the case of industrialised countries. Other blocs, such as the
European Union, would be invited to make reciprocal concessions in a move to
force the pace of multilateral trade liberalisation.
The plan's most enthusiastic supporters are Australia, which is eager to
stress its Asian credentials, and Indonesia. President Suharto views the
summit as a chance to set his seal on history and wants an even earlier
deadline for Apec free trade.
At the other extreme, Malaysia remains sceptical of the value of Apec and
continues to press for a rival East Asian Economic Caucus to counter western
economic domination. Still, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister,
who boycotted the Seattle meeting, plans to attend this summit, and
President Suharto may yet persuade him to tone down his opposition.
Much the biggest uncertainties concern China and the US. The former, long
lukewarm about Apec, has threatened to block progress unless Washington
softens its line on Beijing's application to join the new World Trade
Organisation in January. Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, is expected to
step up the pressure when she meets Mr Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's
chief trade negotiator, in Jakarta on Saturday.
However, Beijing may be over-estimating Apec's importance as a bargaining
chip with Washington. Much has changed since President Bill Clinton talked
up Apec's future at last year's summit, in the belief that a united stand by
Pacific Rim countries would induce the EU to give ground in the stalled
Uruguay Round trade talks.
Today, with prospects for congressional ratification of the Round on a knife
edge, the administration's priorities are reversed. It seems decidedly wary
of any trade initiatives which could fuel domestic opposition to the Round.
President Clinton's position has been further undermined by the Democrats'
loss of control of both houses of Congress in Tuesday's mid-term elections.
He may therefore be hard-pressed to offer any immediate concessions on
China's WTO entry, or to back any Apec decision which committed the US to
lowering its trade barriers substantially.
'Mr Clinton wants a big public relations success in Jakarta which ties his
hands as little as possible,' says a US trade policy expert.
Though Apec leaders may agree a long-term commitment to liberalisation, he
thinks they may endorse only uncontroversial proposals in areas such as
customs procedures, standards and voluntary investment principles.
Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, also doubts the summit will
set a binding timetable for liberalisation and says such an agreement may
take at least a further year to achieve.
Such an anodyne outcome need not constitute complete failure in the eyes of
Apec's Asian members. Many see the grouping less as a forum for sweeping
policy decisions than as a channel for informal dialogue, particularly with
the US, their largest final market.
Most would resist any attempt to turn Apec into a formal institution. They
fear such a step could threaten the future primacy of the WTO and encourage
the US to use Apec as a club to force them into making trade concessions.
Many Asian countries also want to push ahead with efforts to free trade
within Asia before embarking on any programme involving Washington.
Some observers believe little progress in Apec is likely until the recent
decision by the six-member Association of South East Asian Nations to try to
revive plans for an Asian free trade area has borne fruit.
Though the plans remain tentative and face big hurdles, Mr Chuan Leekpai,
Thailand's prime minister, says Apec is 'a looser form of grouping with less
depth' than Asean. In his view, Apec's main contribution to trade
liberalisation will be to encourage efforts under way in other forums,
rather than to launch substantive programmes of its own.
Ambivalence also runs deep in Japan. Though the government appears ready to
back a summit declaration endorsing broad free-trade principles, Tokyo wants
to avoid any decisions which could force it to choose between its
allegiances to Asia and to the US.
Some Apec members have questioned the value of any declaration which does
not bind governments to at least some concrete action. But even if the
summit endorsed a long-term liberalisation programme, implementation would
still require complex negotiations.
These would have to overcome fundamental conceptual differences between
Apec's members, which even the carefully-drafted Bergsten report fails to
hide.
'The report is riddled with contradictions,' says Dr Young Soogil, a leading
South Korean trade economist.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief ready for caretaker WTO role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With the contest for the top job at the future World Trade Organisation
effectively deadlocked, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is believed to be ready to stay on in a
caretaker role until his term ends next July.
Mr Sutherland announced last April he would not be a candidate for
director-general of the WTO, which is supposed to begin work on January 1.
But it now looks increasingly unlikely that a decision on his successor will
be made by early December, when Gatt members are due to endorse the
appointment, making it virtually impossible for the new director-general to
take up the WTO reins in January.
Though no formal proposal to stay on has yet been made to Mr Sutherland, it
is under active discussion by trade diplomats anxious to assure a smooth
transition from Gatt to the more powerful WTO. However, some officials are
still hopeful that the decision on the choice of WTO chief can still be made
by next month.
A third round of consultations among Gatt members on the WTO appointment is
taking place in Geneva this week. Trade officials said yesterday they
expected the outcome to be a continued three-way split on regional lines
between Mr Renato Ruggiero, the EU candidate, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
the outgoing Mexican president who has US and Latin American backing, and Mr
Kim Chul-su of South Korea who has Asian support.
Though Mr Ruggiero is ahead numerically, the eventual decision must be made
by consensus. Delays in ratifying the WTO and the associated Uruguay Round
global trade accords, the continued stalemate over the next OECD
secretary-general and the lack of engagement of the US in the WTO race are
all seen as obstacles to consensus.
To these must now be added the uncertainty over the outcome of the Uruguay
Round vote by the US Congress in three weeks' time. A rejection by Congress
would certainly kill the WTO which could not operate effectively without the
participation of the world's biggest trader.
Only 30-odd countries among Gatt's 124 members have so far ratified the
world trade pact, and they do not include any of the Quad group of leading
traders - the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. Most have been awaiting the US
decision.
The mid-term elections and the impending Uruguay Round vote have also kept
the US out of the active big-power horsetrading that will be a necessary
ingredient of an eventual deal.
Though strongly denied by the US and EU, many trade diplomats believe there
is also a trade-off between the WTO leadership and the long delayed decision
on who should run the OECD in Paris. If, as the US and Canada are demanding,
the OECD job goes to a non-European, this could boost Mr Ruggiero's WTO
chances.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Battle joined for WEU post: Differences within Europe's
defence club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of the nine-nation Western European Union into a full
blooded defence club will get under way today with an ill tempered contest
for its top job.
Whoever wins the race to become WEU secretary-general will have to reconcile
differences between Britain and many of its continental partners over the
route and pace of Europe's path towards greater self-sufficiency in defence.
The winner will also be struggling to settle another, even tougher argument
 -between the WEU, including Britain, on the one hand and the US on the
other - over the terms on which the US will 'lend' military hardware to
European defence missions.
Having failed to reach consensus on who will be the next secretary-general,
ambassadors of the nine member states will be voting in Brussels on Italian,
Portuguese and Spanish candidates. If there is deadlock, the Dutch
incumbent, Mr Willem van Eekelen, could remain in office.
The job seems certain to be a substantial one, because the principle of
reviving the WEU as the European pillar of Nato, and the defence arm of the
European Union, is no longer questioned by any of its members.
The 40-year-old WEU - which groups all EU members except Denmark and
Ireland, and will soon incorporate Greece - binds its members to defend one
another in even stronger terms than the founding treaty of Nato.
But in practice, Nato has largely overshadowed the European club, at least
until last January when the US told its allies to take more responsibility
for their own defence.
The candidates for the WEU job are two diplomats - Mr Giovanni Jannuzzi of
Italy and Mr Jose Cutileiro of Portugal - and Mr Enrique Baron Crespo, a
Spanish Socialist politician.
If today's vote yields a clear result, the winner will be endorsed at next
week's meeting in the Netherlands of WEU foreign and defence ministers,
which will also hear calls for rapid progress towards a common European
defence policy.
Britain, which used to argue that a strengthened WEU would alienate the US,
is now stressing that it fully supports the idea of giving the European body
some extra punch.
In practice, that would mean that certain defence tasks - in which the
Europeans wanted direct involvement but the US did not - would be shouldered
by the WEU, which would borrow US military hardware from Nato as necessary.
However, the US wants to retain considerable say in any missions for which
it is providing military assets, and ideally the right to pull its equipment
out if a more pressing need arises elsewhere.
The French - and, as of recently, the British - argue that the new
arrangement will work only if the Europeans can count on being able to
borrow Nato's military hardware whenever it is required.
'There would have to be a presumption, at least, that Nato assets would be
available,' said a UK diplomat.
Despite moving closer to France on some issues, Britain is putting the
brakes on proposals to issue a toughly worded statement on a common European
defence identity in the near future.
It says this would pre-empt preparations for the 1996 conference on the
future of the European Union.
London is also talking down the idea of an early 24-nation summit grouping
the WEU's full members and nations with associate or observer status.
In today's vote, Mr Cutileiro expects the backing of Britain and probably
the Netherlands, while Mr Jannuzzi enjoys French support and is hoping that
the Germans - waverers until the last minute - will rally to his cause. UK
diplomats have hinted that they would prefer Mr Jannuzzi to Mr Baron.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Dollars 1m to give away - in cyber-bucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: 10,000 cyber-junkies to participate in an experiment to test a new
electronic payment system specially designed for use on the Internet. Each
volunteer is required to spend Dollars 100 in cyber-bucks during the
experiment.
DigiCash, an Amsterdam-based company that specialises in developing new
electronic cash payment systems, has invented a form of digital money with
which people can pay for products or services bought on the Internet, the
international system of computer networks.
Mr David Chaum, a former academic who taught at University of California and
New York University before becoming managing director of DigiCash, said the
digital payment system - dubbed E-Cash - had been devised for use by
conventional banks as an alternative form of payment on the Internet that
protects the privacy of the user.
DigiCash has for the past week been operating E-Cash on an experimental
basis. A number of commercial companies, including Encyclopedia Britannica
and Wired, the technology magazine, are participating in the trial by
allowing the DigiCash volunteers to pay for their products in apocryphal
'cyber-bucks' using the E-Cash system.
During the trial DigiCash is giving away a total of Dollars 1m in
cyber-bucks to up to 10,000 volunteers, each of whom will be allowed to
spend Dollars 100. Each participant can withdraw their Dollars 100 from the
DigiCash 'bank' in 'digital coins', each of which is in the form of a
numerical code.
If the volunteers want to access an article from Wired on the Internet, they
pay for it with digital coins. Wired then verifies that the payment is valid
by checking the numerical code of each 'coin' with the DigiCash bank through
the Internet. If the bank approves, the purchase goes ahead.
DigiCash hopes that commercial banks will offer E-Cash as an alternative to
their standard payment systems. Mr Chaum said he hoped soon to conclude
negotiations with a UK bank which is interested in introducing E-Cash. A
conventional bank would operate the system in the same way as the DigiCash
bank in the trial.
Commercial transactions on the Internet are currently paid for with bank
debit or credit cards. The main advantage of the E-Cash format to users is
that it enables them to conduct their Internet transactions in privacy.
The numerical code on each digital coin is calculated according to a
mathematical formula devised by DigiCash. This ensures that the bank sees a
scrambled version of the user's original code and therefore, although it
validates each 'coin', it does not monitor individual transactions.
So far the E-Cash trial is going very well, according to DigiCash. After
only one week on-line it has signed up 1,000 volunteers and new recruits are
flooding in at the rate of 80 or 90 a day.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Brussels closes off a multimedia gateway: Technology may be
running streets ahead but Germany's MSG venture finds a dead-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A tough application of European competition law led yesterday to the
blocking of a pay-television joint venture between two German media
companies, Bertelsmann and the Kirch group, and the state telephone monopoly
 -as the Brussels Commission moved to to prevent what it saw as a potential
distortion of three markets.
But if the decision looked good for competition, it raised questions about
the development of multimedia in Europe, and whether the Commission was
trying to control an essentially uncontrollable and speedily evolving
industry.
For the Commission, the decision was clear-cut. 'If you have big players
dominating the gateway to a market, then you have to intervene,' said a
Commission official yesterday. 'We have to ensure that no one shuts off the
potential for new players coming in.'
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said Brussels blocked the
deal because it considered, after discussions with more than 100 companies
and industry bodies, that the proposed concentration was likely to create or
reinforce a dominant position in three separate markets. First, Bertelsmann
and Kirch would dominate the market for pay-television services, distinct
from traditional television, as it is mainly financed by subscribers. The
market is a potential pot of gold since from next year, digitalisation is
expected to lead to an explosion in the number of pay-TV programmes.
Second, MSG - as the proposed merger was known - would have dominated the
market for the technological services associated with pay-TV operators,
limiting if not preventing the entry of competitors. These services include
the provision of decoders, leased to subscribers to unscramble those
services for which they have paid. They also include 'access control
systems' which enable operators to restrict pay-TV channel reception to
subscribers.
Third, the Commission argued that the merger would have allowed Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom, the state telephone monopoly, to reinforce its dominant
position in the market for cable network services. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister,
chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board, reacted by saying he
considered the decision a blow for the German pay-television market. 'We
want to get a market moving which hardly exists in Germany and Europe,
otherwise this technology will be introduced in Germany much later.'
Industry analysts agreed that outdated competition and ownership rules, as
applied by national governments and the Commission, could hinder the
development of an industry where technology is running streets ahead of
government thinking. 'The message to industry from this decision is that
here is yet another thing which is going to delay the generation of revenue
from the digital superhighway,' said Mr John Scaife, media consultant at
Charon Capital in London.
The key to development, argues Mr Scaife, is the combination of delivery
networks together with ownership of programmes and films.
Such a combination would allow companies to package services to customers,
offering them, for example, both telephone and television services to
justify the price of subscription.
Yesterday, the Commission was adamant. 'Telekom owns most of the cable
network in Germany and controls its development,' it said. 'It also controls
the return channels necessary for interactive services, and has direct
access to more than 4m cabled households; Bertelsmann and Kirch already have
Premiere and own incomparable programme resources; moreover, Bertelsmann is
a major operator of book clubs.'
'No competitor has such advantages nor could reasonably enter the MSG
market,' it concluded.
Last-minute concessions offered by the merging parties were not accepted by
the Commission. These included development of a system whereby competitors
could have used the decoders, and an undertaking not to discriminate against
other pay-TV operators when it came to renting contracts for decoders, and
use of commercial information.
'These undertakings are in fact a mere declaration of intent not to abuse a
dominant position on the market for administrative and technical services to
the detriment of competitors,' said the Commission.
Lastly, MSG undertook to develop the digital cable network to ensure that
there was no shortage of transmission capacity.
This too was rejected by the Commission, as too difficult to check and
already linked to the regulatory obligations imposed on Telekom.
With the development of digital TV technology set to transform television
services over the next few years, the Commission is likely to have to
consider other complicated multimedia cases. But as the technology changes
and evolves, consideration may need to be given on how best to apply
competition rules.

<TEXT>
The German government yesterday called on statutory health insurance bodies
to cut contributions paid by workers and employers by January 1995,
prompting a sharp reaction from the federation of health insurance funds
(AOK). A government statement said contributions - averaging around 13 per
cent of salary, divided equally between workers and employers - should be
lowered because the new state scheme of care for the aged would relieve the
insurance funds of the need to support those needing special care after next
April. However, the AOK said contributions had been reduced last year and
more than DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) passed on to individuals and employers. The
AOK said it had no financial reserves which would justify cutting
contributions, but would consider cutting them again in 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's prolonged cabinet shuffle continued yesterday with the appointment
by President Boris Yeltsin of two new deputy prime ministers: Mr Oleg
Davydov, the foreign trade minister, and Mr Alexei Bolshakov, an
industrialist. Mr Yeltsin said the changes were part of a broad effort to
bring 'professionals and not politicians' into the government. But Russian
observers, perplexed by a week of new appointments and resignations which
appear to have favoured reformers and conservatives in equal measure, are
interpreting the changes as part of a complex power struggle between Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, his prime minister.
By replacing Mr Alexander Shokhin as deputy prime minister, Mr Davydov - who
upset markets over the summer with an impromptu demand for debt forgiveness
 -will assume responsibility for all of Russia's foreign economic
negotiations. Mr Bolshakov is to be responsible for relations between Russia
and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. He is a
favourite of the conservative parliament and is expected to strengthen the
'red barons', the former Soviet factory directors, against the younger,
academic market reformers in the cabinet.

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb forces yesterday forced back the Moslem-led army in
northwestern Bosnia, apparently recapturing the strategic heights round
Bihac, a United Nations-designated safe area. The UN also confirmed that a
jet aircraft, thought to have come from a base just over the border in
Serb-held territory in Croatia, had fired two rockets at targets in Bihac.
'We understand an airplane fired two rockets at around 1110 GMT,' said
Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Spicer, UN spokesman. The Orao ground attack jet,
built in a joint Yugoslav-Romanian defence project, 'was outside the
airspace of Bosnia-Hercegovina when it fired,' he said. Unconfirmed reports
suggested that the first rocket hit a warehouse, possibly an ammunition dump
which caused strong secondary explosions.
After the Serb military gains, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader,
last night drew back from an earlier vow that his assembly would declare a
state of war. 'It will probably not be an immediate state of war on the
whole territory,' he said before a meeting in Pale, the Serb mountain
stronghold above Sarajevo. The Bosnian capital yesterday suffered another
heavy day of fighting with five people wounded in machinegun fire from a
Serb-held part of the city. In an attempt to salvage a ceasefire which has
broadly held since February around Sarajevo, General Sir Michael Rose, head
of UN forces in Bosnia, yesterday 'urgently' summoned the commanders of the
warring sides to the city airport.

The Czech Republic is to apply to join the European Union in 1996 and
expects to be a member by 1999, Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said
yesterday. Membership talks are expected to begin after the EU
inter-governmental conference in 1996 which is to set the ground rules and
timetable for membership for the countries of central and eastern Europe. Mr
Klaus said the government would establish a special committee on January 1
to oversee the application. His announcement is expected to give the
government a boost in the run-up to local elections being held on November
18 and 19.
The Czech Republic will join Poland and Hungary as the first post-communist
countries to be considered for membership. Hungary and Poland have already
applied. Mr Klaus has long argued that his country is in a position to join
now because of its advanced economic and political reforms. Slovakia, fourth
member of the so-called Visegrad group, is also likely to seek entry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading members of France's centrist UDF, part of the centre-right governing
coalition, warned yesterday they could back a candidate from another party
in next year's presidential elections. The statement, by former industry
minister Gerard Longuet among others, said they would not be bound to
support a candidate from party ranks if it obstructed a single candidate
from the coalition. The statement reflects a move by many in the party to
support Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister and a member of the Gaullist
RPR party, rather than Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the UDF.
Polls show Mr Balladur ahead of Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader and the
only serious contender yet to have announced his candidacy. However, an RPR
party congress has been called for next weekend to endorse Mr Chirac's
candidacy. The prime minister's standing has fallen in recent months partly
because of a series of corruption scandals which have prompted the
resignation of two ministers, including Mr Longuet. The French press has
reported that Mr Michel Roussin, minister for economic co-operation, is
implicated in an investigation into illicit political funding of the RPR.

FT  10 NOV 94 / European Interview: Kinnock revs up in lay-by - The European
Union's next transport commissioner is eager to get motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock is straining at the leash. Maybe it is the prospect of
leaving behind British politics for lusher European pastures, but this week
the former leader of the UK Labour party was in ebullient mood as he spoke
about his new job as EU commissioner for transport.
Commissioner Kinnock, who starts work in January, likes the transport
portfolio. After all, ordinary European citizens can relate more readily to
good, cheap, safe trans-frontier travel by air, road, rail or sea, than to
the often opaque debate about the future of Europe.
'Transport is something tangible,' said Mr Kinnock in an interview, 'it can
have an application literally at street level.'
Over the next five years, he believes 'there is a real job for advocacy and
advocates' of Europe. His warm, folksy manner will help make Europe more
relevant; but ever conscious of his reputation back home as the 'Welsh
windbag', he knows that 'going for the flamboyant phrase' will not be enough
to win credibility.
'Before the headline term is used we need a strategy for its delivery,' he
says soberly. 'Without that, this (Commission) will always look like a well
appointed rest home for bureaucrats.'
It is too early to pin down the new commissioner on specific policies. But
he is clearly aware of the two toughest challenges in his in-tray:
development of the trans-European networks (TENS), the multi-billion Ecu
road, rail and other transport projects designed to link Europe's single
market; and state aid cases, particularly among some of Europe's cosseted
airlines, which threaten to distort that market.
The TENS (like the Channel tunnel which he used to get to Brussels this
week) are seen as job-creators in their own right, assuming up to Ecu400bn
(Pounds 312bn) is spent over the next decade or so. But they are also the
key to strengthening EU competitiveness and 'shrinking' the continent. Mr
Kinnock reminds listeners that in the mid-19th century, 'single markets were
created by a transport revolution' in Britain, France and Germany. 'The next
40 years will see us go through a similar process' at continental level,
through a public and private partnership 'on a scale that has never been
seen before'.
While acknowledging the concerns of Europe's eco-lobby, he says the Greens
must not be allowed to halt judiciously planned projects which will help
save 'billions and billions on wasted time and fuel' on Europe's clogged
highways.
On state aid, the former Labour leaders seems surprisingly hawkish, even
going as far as to hint that he may revisit the Commission's recent approval
of FF20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh state aid for Air France, the beleaguered
national carrier.
'As far as I'm concerned (Air France) is an ongoing story. No decision could
reasonably have been expected to be final, could it?' he says.
The Air France aid is under challenge in the European Court from a British
Airways-led coalition. It is only the largest sum in a torrent of government
finance to national airlines which Brussels is allowing in exchange for
'last chance' restructuring plans.
Mr Kinnock believes a fine judgment has to be made between subsidies which
'are appropriate for the maintenance of vital services, or where they are
giving an unfair competitive advantage'. But he insists: 'Unfair advantage
has got to be taken on.'
Mr Kinnock is bound to be more like the UK's senior commissioner, Sir Leon
Brittan, than Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour cabinet minister whom he is
replacing. Sir Leon has repeatedly trumpeted his own and the Union's
successes in competition and trade policy; by contrast, Mr Millan is almost
allergic to publicity.
Yet Mr Millan, a former secretary of state for Scotland, is widely credited
with running a tight ship and making a success out of the EU's regional aid
policy.
Asked whether he will be at a disadvantage in Brussels, never having run a
ministry in the UK, Mr Kinnock replies: 'I would say, modestly, yes.' But
then, he smiles, 'there are not many government departments that equate to
the Labour party'.
So what are the main qualities a commissioner needs to do a good job? For a
moment he hesitates, then reaches for Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist
thinker, who spoke of the need to combine 'optimism of the will, with
pessimism of the intellect'. More practically, he admits that it also helps
to be well connected with his Euro-Socialist confreres, who number 10 on the
21-strong Commission.
Mr Kinnock is clearly delighted to be able to team up with his wife, Glenys,
who preceded him into Europe and is already establishing a prominent voice
as a newly elected European parliament member.
He intends to make his views known across 'a fairly broad spectrum', from
monetary union, through social policy, to EU expansion and reform - all
issues that spark warfare among Britain's governing Conservatives. 'There
will be occasions,' he says quietly, but he does not see himself primarily
as a Brussels adjunct to the UK's tortured domestic debate on Europe.
Advocacy, yes; but 'the soap-box is not in my baggage'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Markets retreat after early rally
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republican success in Tuesday's elections sparked a strong rally in the
dollar and US and European financial markets yesterday, as investors
anticipated that a more pro-business Congress would pursue policies to aid
growth and cut government spending.
However, US markets were unable to sustain their early gains and Wall Street
retreated amid concerns that conflict between President Bill Clinton and a
Republican Congress could undermine investor confidence in the economy and
the dollar.
The markets were also troubled by fears of rising US interest rates; most
analysts expect rates to be raised next week to slow economic growth and
restrain inflation.
Some analysts believe the poll results have important implications for
monetary policy. Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the investment fund
group Dreyfus, said: 'The Fed will be now more free to tighten as fast and
as much as it wants. It had been under pressure from Democrats in Congress,
and with the Republicans taking over both houses, the pressure against the
Fed will fall.'
The possibility that the Republican success could lead Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, to raise rates further and faster than the markets had
expected was behind some of the selling on US markets yesterday.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which had jumped 38 points
in the opening minutes - had sunk back to 3,831.75 points, a gain of 1.01 on
the day. But the dollar kept its gains in New York, up about two pfennigs
against the D-Mark at DM1.52755, and at Y97.775.
European stock markets greeted the Republican victories with impressive
advances, but unlike Wall Street they kept most of their gains. London's
FT-SE 100 index closed up 35.8 at 3,099.6, while in Frankfurt the DAX index
rose 43.03 to 2,096.47.
Wall Street was concerned that discord between Congress and the White House
might lead to legislative gridlock, and that a hardline Republican
leadership could block progress on trade.
Mr Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch, said Wall
Street was debating 'whether Republican control of both houses leads to more
legislation that is good for the market, or whether it leads to more
deadlock'.
Mr Hoey said any positive effects from the elections would probably soon
fade. 'The stock market is left with all the same issues it had before, in
terms of the outlook for the economy and the possibility for more Fed
tightenings. The core issue is how much more will interest rates go up.'

British Sky Broadcasting is negotiating to have its 24-hours-a-day
television news channel, Sky News, supplied under contract by Independent
Television News.
If the deal goes through it would re-create an effective BBC-ITN national
television news monopoly in the UK.
Talks are believed to be well advanced between the BSkyB satellite
television venture and ITN, the ITV television news organisation. They have
involved Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, Mr Michael Green,
chairman of ITN and of Carlton Communications, and Mr Sam Chisholm, the
BSkyB chief executive.
Mr Chisholm said last night: 'We have plenty of suitors who want to get
involved with us in a whole range of areas. ITN is but one.'
Sky News is broadcast across Europe on the Astra satellite and is available
to millions of viewers through satellite dishes and cable television
networks. ITN, which supplies television news to ITV and Channel 4, already
provides news programmes around the clock.
For both sides, there are strong incentives to strike a deal.
ITN is 90 per cent controlled by three groups - Carlton, which runs the
London weekday licence and the Midlands ITV licence, Granada, and Reuters,
the news and information group - and is ambitious to expand.
Mr Murdoch controls 50 per cent of BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. He is committed to
continuing to provide a 24-hour news channel as part of the Sky package of
satellite channels.
BSkyB has been trying for several years to find a less costly way of
providing the news channel, but past talks with the BBC and ITN had come to
nothing.
Sky News costs about Pounds 30m a year to run and has never made a profit.
It is believed that the deal on offer from ITN could save BSkyB about Pounds
7m-Pounds 8m a year.
It is understood that a deal will be agreed only if ITN can show that its
service will be better as well as cheaper. BSkyB would insist on retaining
the Sky News name and editorial control.
The talks come as BSkyB prepares for a stock exchange flotation. Although
the negotiations about news provision are not believed to be directly
related, an agreement would almost certainly be seen as positive for the
BSkyB float, which is expected next month.
Tuesday's announcement by the Independent Television Commission - that it is
deferring until the end of 1995 the need for ITN shareholders to reduce
their stakes to 20 per cent - was also probably a precondition for a deal.
One large newspaper group yesterday expressed anger that UK television was
being completely 'carved up'.
The individual ITV shareholders in ITN could continue to hold on to larger
stakes than the 20 per cent maximum specified in the 1990 Broadcasting Act,
yet newspapers were still prevented from holding more than 20 per cent of an
ITV franchise.

FT  10 NOV 94 / MMC to study Thomas Cook travellers' cheques acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition by Thomas Cook Group, the travel company, of Barclays Bank's
travellers' cheques business has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The acquisition, announced in August, would allow Thomas Cook, already the
world's largest issuer of Mastercard travellers' cheques, to become the
biggest issuer of Visa travellers' cheques as well.
The deal would increase Thomas Cook's share of the world's Dollars 54bn
(Pounds 33bn) a year travellers' cheque market from 17 per cent to 30 per
cent. The market is led by American Express, which invented the travellers'
cheque 103 years ago, and has 44 per cent of the market.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that Mr Heseltine had
referred the acquisition to the MMC on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading. The MMC must report by February 16.
The deal was originally due to be completed this week, but has now been put
on hold until after the MMC report. Thomas Cook has not disclosed how much
it paid Barclays to acquire Interpayment Services, the subsidiary, and
yesterday refused to comment on the MMC referral.
Thomas Cook intends to operate the Interpayment Visa brand separately
although the two brands would use the same distribution and processing
facilities. The integration of those facilities has not yet begun.
The consolidation in the travellers' cheques business is in response to a
slowdown in the world market, as plastic cards and automated cash machines
have started to replace cheques as a means of transferring small sums of
money abroad.
Under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, the trade and industry secretary can refer
to the MMC mergers that intensify a market share of 25 per cent or more in
the UK. The MMC has to report whether the merger may operate against the
public interest.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Clinton defiant on economy in wake of Republican triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday answered the Republican party's most
sweeping mid-term election triumph in nearly 50 years by promising to block
opposition attempts to 'turn the clock back' to the economic policies of the
1980s.
Alternately reflective and combative at an afternoon press conference, the
president welcomed the offers of co-operation with the Democrat
administration from the new Republican leadership in both houses of
Congress. 'I ask them to join me in the centre of the public debate where
the best ideas must come.'
But, he said: 'I say to those who would use this election to turn us back .
. . I will do all in my power to keep anyone from jeopardising this economic
recovery by taking us back to the policies and exploding deficits that
failed us before.'
His analysis of the drubbing his party had taken, an adverse reflection of
his own leadership, was not that the American people disliked the specifics
of Democratic policies. 'They just don't like it when they see what we do up
here.'
Mr Robert Dole, about to become majority leader in the Senate, echoed these
sentiments. 'If we don't deliver, we'll be out of here too,' he said.
Congressman Newt Gingrich, Speaker-presumptive of the House, commented: 'Let
the '96 presidential campaign come in '96.'
Mr Gingrich said he would seek accommodation with the administration - on
greater budgetary control, tax credits for middle-income families and
welfare reform - before pressing ahead with the ideological elements in the
Republican manifesto so inimical to President Clinton.
In the same spirit, Mr Clinton called Mr Gingrich yesterday and, according
to reports from both sides, offered, and received, pledges not to let the
nation's government sink into gridlock.
Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said he had also spoken to Mr
Gingrich on election night and extracted a pledge that the Republican 'would
work with us to try and get the Gatt treaty passed' when both houses of the
old Congress reconvene for votes at the turn of this month.
The 52-48 Senate majority won by Republicans at the polls swelled by one
when Senator Richard Shelby, the conservative Democrat from Alabama,
announced he was crossing the political aisle. Flanked by Senators Dole and
Phil Gramm, he said he was joining 'a party of hope for America' and leaving
'a party of dependency'.
The overall results, in which no Republican incumbent in Congress was
defeated, far exceeded the party's wildest dreams. But the Senate will have
to get along without a Republican candidate who would have been difficult to
imbue with any spirit of co-operation. Mr Oliver North lost in Virginia to
Senator Charles Robb, but ominously promised to return.
In California, Mr Michael Huffington, his pockets Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m)
lighter as a result of his campaign, had still not publicly conceded his
two-point defeat by Senator Dianne Feinstein, claiming that absentee ballots
could yet vote him in.
But these losses were more than offset by the cull of dozens of Democratic
luminaries.
The massacre leaves the country with a new political face. In the House,
with nine contests still undecided, the Republicans had a provisional net
gain of 49 and had already acquired an edge of about 227-198. The lone
independent and nominal socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, survived.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Economic recovery helps Trimac
double profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trimac, North America's biggest road haulier of bulk commodities and the
world's fourth-largest contract driller, doubled profits in the first nine
months of 1994.
Trimac, controlled by the McCaig family of Calgary, said the gain stemmed
from the north American economic recovery and a strong market for oil and
gas drilling rigs. Exploration activity in western Canada, for example, was
running at record levels.
Third-quarter net profit advanced to CDollars 14.5m (USDollars 10.7m), or 36
cents a share, up from CDollars 9.7m, or 24 cents. Nine-month profit was
CDollars 31.3m, or 77 cents, against CDollars 16.3m, or 41 cents.
Revenues for the nine months were CDollars 495m, up 10 per cent.
Trimac said third-quarter trucking results were firm and drilling revenues
were up 47 per cent. Its equip-ment leasing business also improved.
CAE, the world's biggest maker of flight simulators, continued its recovery
in the second quarter, although the US military training division was hit by
US defence budget cuts.
Second-quarter net profit was CDollars 10.9m, or 10 cents a share, against
Dollars 6m, or 6 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 265m, up 5.3
per cent.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: BASF declares interest in Boots
pharmaceutical arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, yesterday said it was 'looking
at' the pharmaceutical division of Boots, the UK high-street chemist and
retailer, but refused to comment on reports that it had made a takeover
offer.
BASF is one of several companies that have discussed buying the Boots'
pharmaceuticals division. A management buy-out team has also shown interest.
Boots has one of its regular main board meetings later this week and the
future of the pharmaceuticals division is certain to be discussed.
Mr Jens-Uwe Bliesener, a corporate development executive at Knoll, BASF's
main healthcare subsidiary, said Boots was one of the top 50 companies
worldwide which had been examined in the group's well-publicised search for
potential partners.
He declined to say whether the UK business was still of interest or if talks
were under way. 'We have no official statement,' he said.
However, Mr Bliesener conceded that BASF was trying to fill gaps in its
market coverage, including the UK and France. Japan, where Knoll is
unrepresented, was also of interest.
Boots pharmaceutical sales are largely in the UK, the US and Commonwealth
countries. Its main products are Synthroid, a thyroid drug, and ibuprofen,
an anti-inflammatory and painkiller.
Knoll, with annual drugs and medication sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn)
compared with DM11bn at Hoechst, is considered too small to compete
efficiently with other research-based pharmaceutical companies.
Its research budget this year is expected to be about DM300m. It has no
obvious successor products to replace top-seller Isoptin, a heart treatment
on which the European patents expire in 1996.
Sales last year totalled more than DM500m.
Knoll's main advantage is that it has an immensely-rich parent group whose
chairman, Mr Jurgen Strube, refuses to contemplate withdrawal from the drugs
business.
Recent efforts to improve prospects include belated entry into the German
generics markets with a new company, BASF Generika.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Friel's 'Molly Sweeney'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when you have to be patient with the Irish; it can pay off
in the end. The first act of Brian Friel's new play seems slow. Characters
(there are only three of them) seldom move. Even the unmistakable rhythm of
the Friel language begins to seem repetitive.
This is deceptive. Taken all in all, Molly Sweeney is a marvellous piece of
writing. To rejuvenate a cliche, there is more than meets the eye - and what
does meet the eye if you have been partially blind for over 40 years, then
have your sight restored?
The territory is familiar Friel-land: Ballybeg, Donegal, rural Ireland and,
yes, dancing is still a kind of magic formula. There is also science,
culture and international communications. It is in the mixture of paganism,
christianity and the modern world that Friel excels.
In the old days Molly's sight might have come back by praying to the Virgin
Mary or a local saint. Now it is restored by a surgeon with contacts all
over the world. Never mind, the effects are much the same: it is not certain
that the surgery has worked.
Molly is not totally unhappy with her blindness, which came upon her at the
age of 10 months. She can recognise flowers, laugh and swim; she has a job
and marries. The men in the piece are Molly's husband, Frank, and the eye
surgeon, Mr Rice. Frank is peculiar perhaps even by the standards of
Donegal. It is not remotely clear why an unemployed Irishman should take off
to lead a food convoy to Ethiopia, and stay there, while his wife is
recuperating. This is a weakness in the structure of the piece.
Mr Rice fits in better: the surgeon invited by Frank to perform an operation
that has almost never been successful and brings international repute. He
treats the operating theatre much like the stage, but admits that even when
operations appear to work, it is not always clear why.
There is some intellectual rambling. Diderot, John Locke and Bishop Berkeley
are all thrown in. Good and bad jokes come in about equal measure. I liked
the story about the imported Iranian goats who refused to adjust to Irish
time. On the other hand, some of the references to the third world struck me
as patronising - rather in the way the English used to talk about the Irish.
The production at the Almeida comes from the Gate Theatre, Dublin where the
piece had its premiere in August. Friel directs himself. The speaking of the
lines by Catherine Byrne as Molly, Mark Lambert as Frank and TP McKenna as
Mr Rice is immaculate. Their performances might be even better if they were
allowed to act a bit more. Fine Irish writing does not automatically amount
to a play.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Mandela seeks new mines policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela yesterday called on South Africa's mining houses to
expand their dialogue with the government and trade unions by establishing a
permanent forum of big stakeholders to help shape a new policy framework for
the industry.
Addressing the Johannesburg meeting of the Chamber of Mines, an umbrella
body representing mining industry interests, Mr Mandela said such a forum
could improve productivity and help mines develop education and training
initiatives for workers, while improving health and safety measures.
'The mining industry's impressive technological achievements still confront
archaic social conditions and a workforce built on a low skills base and
largely confined by illiteracy.'
While praising the achievements of the industry as 'truly remarkable,' Mr
Mandela avoided addressing the question of mineral ownership, merely saying
he hoped that 'under whatever form of ownership,' mining would seek 'to
uplift the most disadvantaged of our society'.
Since last year, a debate has been under way in Mr Mandela's African
National Congress on whether the state should assume ownership of all
mineral rights, to release under-used deposits for possible exploitation by
foreign investors and small black-owned mines, or whether it should accept
the private ownership system.
Talks between the ANC, the mines and the Department of Mineral and Energy
Affairs have been continuing since the April general elections, but the
government has yet to make a definitive policy statement on the issue. For
the moment, Mr Mandela's address appears to indicate the state's willingness
to accept the status quo while encouraging further social responsibility
programmes by the mines.
Mr Jurie Geldenhuys, outgoing president of the chamber, responded by urging
'a synergistic and co-operative relationship' between government and mining,
and praising the administration's non-interventionist approach to the
private sector as a whole.
But Mr Geldenhuys criticised planned alterations to labour laws, such as
more public holidays and a 40-hour maximum work week, as well as tighter
environmental controls, charging they constituted 'an anachronism' that
could prove extremely costly to the industry.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Top two US shipping lines seek to reflag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two biggest US commercial shipping lines have begun to request
permission to reflag their ships in foreign countries to reduce the costs of
their operations.
American Presidential Lines has asked the US Maritime Administration to put
six new container ships under foreign flags, and is expected to seek
reflagging of part of its 16-ship fleet now under the US flag.
Sea-Land Services yesterday was expected to notify the administration that
it wants to reflag about half of its 25-ship fleet. It hopes to begin with
five foreign-based ships.
The reflagging is strongly opposed by maritime labour, which joined with
shipping interests last year in a congressional drive to get a new Dollars
1bn maritime operating subsidy programme. Union officials say American
Presidential Lines worked against the legislation and should not be rewarded
with waivers which permit the reflagging.
The Clinton administration had hoped to create 'a renaissance for the
American shipbuilding industry' with more investment in new technology.
Shipping lines agreed to hold off reflagging until Congress passed
legislation on operating subsidies. Subsidies were approved twice in the
House with bipartisan support but killed in the Senate. Congress did,
however, pass legislation providing for shipyard modernisation and export
subsidies.
The number of US-flagged vessels has been declining for years. As of last
February the US had 366 large ocean-going vessels under US flag. Of these,
340 were active. Without subsidies the US fleet is expected to dwindle to
about 30 vessels after the year 2000.
The willingness of shipowners to reflag reflects the lower cost of
operations using foreign crews and lower taxes abroad. It also represents
the devaluing of the protection granted by cabotage rules, which permit only
US flagged ships to sail from one US port to another, as trade becomes
increasingly global.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black-owned group to run 47
Denny's restaurants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Denny's, the US restaurant chain recently exposed as having discriminated
against black customers in many of its 1,500 restaurants, yesterday
announced that it had appointed a black-owned business to run 47 Denny's
restaurants in the states of New York and New Jersey.
The company is NDI Foods, a newly-formed subsidiary of the Atlanta-based NDI
Inc. A second subsidiary of the same company, NDI Video, owns and operates
23 Blockbuster Video stores in the US.
Under the agreement with Denny's, NDI Foods will buy 17 company-owned
Denny's restaurants in New York and New Jersey this year and acquire the
right to buy five more next year.
It will also build and operate 25 new Denny's restaurants in the same
territory over the next five years.
The deal will be financed by the New England based BancBoston Capital, a
subsidiary of the Bank of Boston.
The price of the transaction was not disclosed.
In May this year Denny's, part of Flagstar, the Nasdaq-quoted restaurant
group, agreed to pay Dollars 46m in damages to thousands of black customers
to settle charges that it had discriminated against them.
Some Denny's managers, it emerged, had tried to drive black customers away
by refusing them service or making them pay in advance.
The discrimination came to light in April 1993 when six black agents on the
US president's secret service detail were kept waiting nearly an hour in a
Denny's restaurant while white colleagues were served.
In an attempt to rebuild its reputation, Flagstar reached an agreement with
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in July this
year, pledging to put at least eight of its restaurants into the hands of
black franchises by the end of this year and at least 53 by the end of 1997.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Pakistani hostages are freed

   PESHAWAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani Islamic militants yesterday released about 50 government officials
taken hostage in a remote north-western region at the start of a violent
campaign for Islamic laws, Reuter reports from Peshawar.
The officials, freed at Matta town in the North West Frontier Province, were
unhurt, provincial police chief Masud Shah said. The hostages included two
judges, a senior local civil servant and a senior police official.
Yesterday's release was the largest group of hostages freed after the
heavily armed militants began a truce on Sunday on the orders of their
leader, Sufi Mohammad, after two days of battles with security forces in
which at least 25 people from both sides died.
Provincial chief minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, who ordered the enforcement
of Islamic laws last Thursday, in an interview published yesterday linked
'foreign involvement' to the militants' action.
Last Thursday, the militants killed a provincial parliament member of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party after taking him hostage.
Mr Sufi says the demand of his Tehrik Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi organisation
has been met and he is satisfied by the Sherpao order.
But some local TNSM leaders say they do not trust the government, hinting at
a rift in the fundamentalist group.
Despite a sharp political polarisation in Pakistan, there has been little
sympathy for the militant cause.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: GM 'on track' for turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, 'remains on track' for a financial
turnround, according to Mr John Smith, chief executive and president,
agencies report.
'Although we were not satisfied with our performance in the third quarter,
we remain confident that our fundamental turnround strategies are sound, and
we are on track to achieve them,' he told a meeting of Canadian car
suppliers that serve GM's operations.
GM announced a net profit of Dollars 552m in the third quarter, a big
improvement from the year-earlier loss of Dollars 113m. In North America,
however, the company lost Dollars 328m in the period, surprising analysts
who had expected a much smaller loss.
Mr Smith attributed the loss to new-model start-ups, production losses
related to strikes at two North American facilities, and higher engineering
costs related to GM's 'aggressive product programmes'.
However, he added that: 'We've restructured and consolidated operations,
reduced the number of employees, and realigned our product programmes. We're
redoubling our cost-cutting efforts and focusing on making fundamental
improvements in our operating efficiency.'
Highlighting some of the company's 'encouraging factors', Mr Smith noted
that total GM vehicle sales in Canada and the US were up 7.9 per cent in the
first 10 months, compared with a year ago.
He also said that GM had increased market share in the third quarter of 1994
and for the 1994 model year, 'even with intense competition and the capacity
constraints that limited production of some of our key models'.
GM's consolidated net income improved in both the third quarter and the
first nine months compared with the same periods last year, Mr Smith said,
adding that net income at nine months had increased by Dollars 2bn from a
year ago.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has appointed Mr
Robert Herbold, a former Procter &amp; Gamble executive, as executive
vice-president and chief operating officer, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Mr Herbold will report directly to Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and
chief executive, as a member of Microsoft's 'office of the president',
succeeding the late Mr Frank Gaudette, who died in April.
He joins Mr Steve Ballmer, executive vice-president of sales and support,
and Mr Mike Maples, executive vice-president of products, as a member of the
office. This group shares responsibility with Mr Gates for broad strategic
and business planning for the entire company.
Mr Herbold worked for P&amp;G for 26 years, most recently as senior
vice-president for information services and advertising.
The appointment by Microsoft of an outsider to such a senior position is
surprising. In the past Mr Gates has expressed scepticism about the choice
of executives from other industries such as Mr Lou Gerstner of IBM to head
computer companies.
Yesterday, however, Mr Gates said that Mr Herbold's business experience and
management skills 'will prove invaluable in taking Microsoft forward as we
face new business challenges'.
Mr Herbold will be responsible for worldwide operations at Microsoft,
including finance, manufacturing, distribution, logistics, information
technology, human resources, corporate services, real estate and development
and Microsoft Press.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Barclays in talks on US disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is in discussions to sell its commercial credit company in the
US, marking the latest in a series of disposals of personal and small
company finance businesses there.
The bank confirmed yesterday that it was in negotiations with Shawmut
National, a New England banking group, over the sale of Barclays Business
Credit, a Connecticut-based subsidiary with assets of about Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.2bn).
According to one person with knowledge of the company, Business Credit 'is
highly profitable and has had extremely low losses'. Much of the company's
lending is to small and medium-sized companies to finance assets ranging
from trucks to machinery.
Barclays has sold a string of consumer and commercial finance companies
across the US in recent years, marking the reversal of an unsuccessful
attempt, dating from the 1980s, to grow a broad-based US financing business.
The failure has cost it Dollars 1.1bn in write-offs in the past three years.
On a recent visit to New York, Mr Martin Taylor, the bank's chief executive,
said Barclays was planning to shrink the 'monster lending book' it had built
up.
It would shed 'those (corporate) relationships that are frankly not real,
where we have simply been stuffed in a syndicate, and we have no genuine
prospect of building a serious relationship quickly', Mr Taylor said.
Instead, it would concentrate on doing business with a smaller number of
companies where it had a better chance of earning a profit, he said.
The operations already sold by Barclays include retail branch networks in
New York and California, a business banking operation in North Carolina, a
consumer finance company and a private-label credit-card company.
Earlier this year, the bank sold its US factoring business to CIT.
In addition to Business Credit, the relics of the expansion include a
company which services mortgage loans, on which Barclays was forced to take
a Pounds 236m (Dollars 387m) write-down last year, and a portfolio of
non-performing assets which stood at Dollars 1bn at the end of 1993.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Alice Revisited - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
And back we go into the nursery, into the place where we now analyse
childhood enchantments in context of disenchanted knowledge of adult life.
Can there be one simple reaction to Alice's Adventures Under Ground,
Christopher Hampton's new adaptation of Lewis Carroll's writings and aspects
of his (ie Charles Dodgson's) life? On the one hand, since this Alice is
full of episodes from those classic books, it is a bracing dip back into a
sane child's discovery of the nonsensical grown-up world. On the other hand,
it is a disturbing study of the stammering, polite, scholarly Dodgson's
melancholy fascination with little girls.
Hampton means, I take it, to examine Carroll's creativity in terms of what
Edmund Wilson called 'the wound and the bow': the wound, in this case, being
Dodgson's paedophile inclinations, the bow being the tales he told to
enthrall his listeners. The wound/bow theory proposes that the spot where
some artists are psychologically vulnerable is precisely what gives them
their archery - their creative genius. In Martha Clarke's staging, there are
only five actors, and the overlap between little Alice Liddell's real world
and the dream world that Dodgson creates for her in the nursery is
considerable.
Hampton's view of Dodgson/Carroll is compassionate - too much so. The bow
only interests him as far as it reveals the wound, and many of the books'
multi-faceted quotations are so placed that we read them in terms of
Dodgson's private feelings. 'Seven and a half] Uncomfortable sort of age. If
you'd asked my advice, you'd have left off at seven.' We also watch Dodgson
start to cry as he slowly unbuttons little Alice's dress.
But Carroll's own mind, for all its pathos, is weak tea beside the
intoxicating concoctions of his tales. Though Alice's Adventures Under
Ground is sensitively shaped, its eventual thrust is merely sentimental. And
sentimentality, surely, is wrong for the man who made Alice cry out 'You're
nothing but a pack of cards]'
At the Cottesloe Theatre, Robert Israel's nursery set is eloquent. One look
at its rocking-horse, its white walls, its large dark looking-glass above
the mantel, and we are prepared for meanings both surreal and psychological.
John Carlisle, Gabrielle Lloyd, and Joseph Mydell play a marvellous range of
supporting roles. Martha Clarke has them act with a fine dash of exaggerated
intensity.
Little Sasha Hanau would be an ideal Alice - grave, focused, precise,
responsive - if she did not gabble rapid lines. Such manners are affecting
in so small a child. Michael Maloney (despite overdoses of vocal virtuosity)
beautifully creates a Carroll/Dodgson of immense courtesy, birdlike staccato
head movements, and eyes both burning and pleading. He is adult among
children, child among adults. Judiciously, Hampton and Clarke have him play
his own Dormouse.
In repertory at the Cottesloe, Theatre, South Bank, into 1995.

Mr Blair, addressing the Per Cent Club, spoke of the 'interdependence of

recognition by business that it had a responsibility to wider society.
Business involvement in the community was more than an act of charity. 'Our
communities are your customers, and communities are your employees. The
state of society beyond the factory gate, the shop window and the office
entrance matters to business.'
Mr Blair supported the idea of a national youth and community service

means from time to time policy has to be adjusted.'

the resolution rules out the death sentence for those found guilty of
organising and carrying out the ethnic and political slaughter in the
central African nation. However, UN officials said the Rwandan government
had indicated it would co-operate with the tribunal.
Rwanda was the only member of the 15 member Security Council to vote against
the resolution which will open the way for an international court similar to
the one set up to try war criminals from the former Yugoslavia. China
abstained.
More than 500,000 people are believed to have perished in violence that
swept over Rwanda after the country's president was killed in an air crash
last April.

FT  09 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): North defeated on
Virginia battlefield - Democrat Robb fends off challenge from former marine
colonel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A lonely ray of sunshine shone in Virginia for the battered Democrats in
yesterday's US congressional elections when Senator Chuck Robb held off the
challenge of Mr Oliver North, the controversial former marine colonel. Mr
North, loathed even by many in his own Republican party for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, was the candidate to whom the Democrats would most have
hated to lose.
The Virginia victory, which sees Mr Robb re-elected, was scant consolation,
however. A string of losses in other states shook the Senate majority the
Democrats have held for the last eight years.
Although Mr North was found guilty of lying to Congress over his role in
arranging the exchange of weapons for the release of US hostages held in
Lebanon, while siphoning off money to arm the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas
in defiance of a law passed by Congress, his conviction was voided on a
technicality.
He inspires almost fanatical loyalty among his core supporters, especially
those who classify themselves as belonging to the Christian right wing.
But he remains a distasteful figure to many Republicans, and especially to
loyalists of former President Ronald Reagan. Mrs Nancy Reagan denounced him
for his role in the Iran-Contra conspiracy, and for what he said about Mr
Reagan's role in it.
Virginia's other senator, Mr John Warner, although a Republican, said he did
not wish to serve in the Senate alongside a man who had lied to Congress.
But Mr Robb himself was so widely disliked by the voters, and campaigned so
weakly until the last few days, that he came close to handing the election
to a man who most politicians six months ago thought to be unelectable.
Once one of the Democrats' brightest stars and widely expected to be a
future presidential candidate, Mr Robb has struggled to live down stories
about his private life that have damaged the reputation he built up as one
of Virginia's most effective governors.
He may owe his winning margin to the two independent candidates who entered
the race. One, former Governor Douglas Wilder, withdrew and campaigned for
Mr Robb, helping him to reap around 88 per cent of the votes cast by black
Virginians.
Mr Marshall Coleman, an independent Republican backed by Senator Warner,
fought on, drawing votes away from the main candidates. But he won fewer
votes than opinion polls had projected.

FT  09 NOV 94 / German parties near deal on coalition agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Talks between the three German parties hoping to form the next government
are due to end on Friday, Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union, said yesterday.
At the same time, the CDU, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister
party, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, expect
to elect the Chancellor on November 15. A cabinet is expected to be chosen
within the next 10 days.
Unlike previous coalition negotiations which lasted several weeks, these
talks, which have drawn up a rough policy agenda for the next parliament,
have tended to highlight similarities rather than differences. The main
differences, many of which were narrowed if not resolved yesterday, have
focused on taxation.
One disruptive issue - increased powers for police to introduce bugging in
private homes - has been deleted from the agenda, while greater access for
citizenship for the 6.8m foreigners in Germany will be discussed on Friday.
During yesterday's session, Mr Hintze said a controversial 'solidarity' or
income tax surcharge of 7.5 per cent would be decreased over time if the
annual financial transfers to the five east German states were gradually
reduced.
More than DM160bn (Pounds 65.3bn) each year is allocated to east Germany
for, among other things, modernising the infrastructure and subsidising
pensions and consumer spending. However, these transfers have increased the
budget deficit which this year is expected to be DM68bn. As a means of
reducing the deficit, the incoming coalition government will re-impose the
solidarity tax which had been introduced after German unification in 1990
but was dropped in 1993. It is expected to raise DM28bn.
CDU and CSU officials stressed, however, that any reduction in the annual
financial transfers and the solidarity tax was linked to a continuing
economic upswing, in eastern as well as west Germany.
All sides also agreed to raise the threshold at which income tax is payable,
said Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the CSU. However, Mr Theo Waigel,
the German finance minister, yesterday found himself at loggerheads with a
commission of experts, which he appointed, about how to finance this.
After a year's work, the eight-man commission told Mr Waigel he would need
around DM40bn in order to raise the threshold to DM13,000, up from DM5,616.
Mr Waigel must introduce the changes by the beginning of 1996 to fulfil a
ruling by the constitutional court, Germany's supreme court, but has said he
will need only an extra DM15bn to do so. Mr Waigel also rejected the
commission's suggestion that unemployment and other welfare benefits and
pensions should be taxable.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Pay-TV talks get nowhere
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last-minute talks to win approval for a cable and pay-TV venture between
German media group Bertelsmann, the Kirch Group and Deutsche Telekom have
failed, a European Union official claimed yesterday. The official, who asked
not to be named said: 'It's a clear-cut case, so . . . it will also be a
clear-cut answer from the (European) Commission that this cannot go on.'
Earlier, Commission officials had said that the joint venture could still
win EU backing if last-minute contacts between Bertelsmann, Kirch and
Deutsche Telekom yielded results. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition
commissioner, has recommended that Brussels block the venture known as Media
Service GmbH. Mr Van Miert argues that MSG will effectively lock other
competitors out of the multimedia market.
Bertelsmann is Germany's largest media company and helped launch the
country's first pay-TV channel, Premiere, which boasts 800,000 subscribers.
The Kirch Group holds shares in Premiere and has the largest German-language
film library. Deutsche Telekom, Germany's telephone monopoly, controls the
country's cable-TV market, which has 14m subscribers. AP, Brussels

FT  09 NOV 94 / Republicans poised to win Congress: Democrats face loss of
House for first time in 40 years - Dole predicts Senate victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republican party stood on the brink of control of both houses of the US
Congress early today, administering a severe rebuff to President Bill
Clinton and the incumbent Democratic party.
Results and TV projections mostly from the eastern half of the country, but
including Arizona, pointed to a net Republican gain of seven seats in the
Senate, exactly what was what needed to overturn the 56-44 Democratic
majority.
Elsewhere a Republican candidate was trailing, but only slightly, in
Pennsylvania, a Democratic seat, and there was no result declared in
Minnesota, a possible Democratic gain. Altogether 35 Senate seats were at
stake.
Mr Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, said cautiously: 'We're not
there yet, but I think we'll make it.' Senator John Breaux, the Lousiana
Democrat, virtually conceded defeat as he left a reception at the White
House with the words,'I've never been in the minority before.'
In the House of Representatives, in Democratic hands since 1954, a
late-evening projection by the Associated Press pointed to a net Republican
gain of 40 seats, again precisely what they need to reverse the current
Democratic edge of 256-178, with one independent.
The one overwhelming consolation for the Democrats was the defeat in the
Senate contest in Virginia of Mr Oliver North, architect of the Iran-Contra
scandals, by Senator Chuck Robb. With most of the votes counted, Mr Robb was
ahead by about 5 points, according to exit polls, winning mostly on the
strength of distrust of Mr North.
Some other Democratic warhorses survived, either easily (Senators Edward
Kennedy in Massachusetts, Paul Sarbanes in Maryland and Robert Byrd in West
Virginia) or with difficulty (Senator Frank Lautenberg in New Jersey). Also
withstanding strong Democratic challenges were Republican senators Bill Roth
in Delaware and James Jeffords in Vermont.
But the killing blows were delivered in southern border states, where the
Democrats lost both seats in Tennessee, including that of Senator Jim Sasser
to Dr Bill Frist, a political novice, and in Oklahoma, where the well-known
congressman Dave McCurdy was crushed by Congressman Jim Inhofe. Earlier
Republican Senate pick-ups in Ohio, Maine and Michigan had been freely
predicted,
The Republicans also began to pick up some of the 22 Democratic
governorships of the 36 being contested, with victories in Oklahoma, Kansas,
Wyoming and Tennessee, though the loss of South Carolina looked likely.
In Maryland, another Democratic seat, Mr Parris Glendening was falling
behind Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey, the conservative Republican. But in Georgia,
Governor Zell Miller was holding on to an edge over another
arch-conservative, Mr Guy Millner.
Results in the two big states - California and New York - were expected
later, though Governor Mario Cuomo in the latter was behind Mr George Pataki
in very early returns. Of former President George Bush's two sons, George W
Jr was leading Governor Ann Richards in Texas, but Jeb was narrowly behind
Governor Lawton Chiles in Florida.
But both were faring better than Mr Hugh Rodham, brother of the First Lady.
He was thrashed for the US Senate seat in Florida by Mr Connie Mack, the
Republican incumbent.
One of the more startling upsets was still just possible in Washington, DC,
late last night. Mr Marion Barry, a three-time mayor seeking rehabilitation
after a narcotics conviction was barely ahead of Mrs Carol Schwartz, the
Republican, in spite of the fact that Democrats and blacks both have vast
majorities in the nation's capital.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (31): Gateway to the Amazon - Santa Cruz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Cruz de la Sierra, misleadingly called 'of the highlands', is
Bolivia's agro-industrial centre and gateway to the Amazon region.
This sprawling city of about 750,000 inhabitants boasts the highest per
capita income of the nation and is rivalling La Paz as the number one city
in Bolivia.
Tens of thousands of migrants arrive annually - principally from the
highlands - in search of employment. Some join the growing service industry,
others end up sorting through the growing trash mounds beyond the last of
the eight highway rings that sub-divide the city.
Architecturally, Santa Cruz cannot compete with the quaint colonial cities
of Sucre or Potos. Yet at the heart of the city lies the picturesque Plaza
24 de Septiembre with its ecliptic-style cathedral (Basilica Menor de San
Lorenzo) and a well-kept park with colourful native Tajibos trees. The
arcaded streets surrounding the plaza maintain something of a colonial air.
Also in the city centre is El Arenal, a type of Central Park with an
open-air market nearby and countless food stalls. In the centre of the park
a mural by the artist Lorgio Vaca depicts the encounter of the Waran Indians
with the first Spaniards coming to the region. The park's anthropological
museum provides an introduction to the Chiquitano Indian culture, but
artifacts on display are poorly labelled.
Among the crowds that wind their way through a seemingly endless commercial
district and the bustling traffic of the city centre are the
characteristically plain-clad Mennonites, of Canadian and Paraguayan origin.
Another group of immigrants, invited by the Bolivian government to settle
the still virgin rainforest surrounding Santa Cruz decades ago, are the
Japanese. They have found employment in numerous professions and established
half a dozen or more good restaurants.
Visitors seeking a cool and shady refuge in the often sweltering mid-day
heat of Santa Cruz should visit the municipal zoo. For those that cannot
make it to any of the outlying national parks to see the fauna in its
natural habitat, the zoo has a good display of some of the rare and
endangered species from all over Latin America.
Santa Cruz's Carnival, celebrated before Lent, is famous throughout the
region. Floats, parades and dancers in the streets reveal the gaiety for
which the people of Santa Cruz are known. Pedestrians should beware the
water-filled balloons which youngsters throw indiscriminately at passers-by.
Santa Cruz offers the traveller a host of excellent hotels and restaurants.
Reservations are especially recommended in September when the annual Santa
Cruz Trade Show is on. It attracts vendors from all of South America and
specialises in agro-industrial products and services.
Business travellers are recommended to stay in the centrally located
four-star Grand Hotel Santa Cruz, which features a swimming pool and
spacious patio, or the Hotel El Arenal, which is somewhat less spacious but
is a good value.
The city's biggest and most exclusive hotel is Los Tajibos which offers a
pool and a restaurant recommended for its ceviche (marinated fish). The
casino is presently closed. A second five-star apart-hotel, Yatau, has
recently been inaugurated. Both lie in the wealthy residential neighbourhood
of San Martn.
The Dunas de Arenas just outside the city are interesting sand formations
and are becoming something of a tourist attraction. They are also a warning
of the dangers of massive erosion due to deforestation and unsustainable
agricultural activities.
The city's airport offers excellent service and daily non-stop connections
to La Paz, Sao Paulo and Miami, but is not busy. The same applies to Santa
Cruz train station.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (30): A delightfully provincial city -
City profiles, La Paz and Cochabamba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER and SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even world-weary travellers should respond to the charm of the 400-year-old
city of La Paz and its 1.1m inhabitants squeezed into a natural bowl beneath
snow-capped Illimani.
The residential order is the reverse in La Paz to that of many 'up-and-down'
cities: the poorest live in the inhospitable satellite town of El Alto ('The
Heights') at 4,100m above sea level.
The business centre and hotels are located centrally (at 3,600m), where the
main Spanish colonial city stood. And the wealthy, in recent years, have
withdrawn to the lower slopes, where breathing is easier.
Fortunately, in view of the altitude, doing business in La Paz is physically
undemanding: most government offices and corporate headquarters are within
easy walking distance of the main street, El Prado.
The westernised occupants of these offices look, think, act and dress
differently from the Bolivian man and woman in the street. Compared to most
Latin American cities, La Paz is delightfully provincial in its manners and
the honesty of its inhabitants.
Shared taxis are the preferred form of transport for the pacenos and one of
the few places where the social classes mingle and exchange political
chit-chat.
Bolivians are flexible about punctuality for social appointments; less so
for business. Bear in mind what Mr Victor Hugo Cardenas, the vice-president
who is himself an Aymara Indian - says of his indigenous fellow countrymen,
the majority in Bolivia: 'They never say yes or no; always maybe. They are
never excessively happy or disappointed; never over-optimistic and never
over-fatalistic. Balance in all things is the wisdom of the Andes.'
Arriving in La Paz need not be as unpleasant as you have been told. True, at
4,000m above sea level, El Alto is the world's highest big airport - but
altitude is 50 per cent in the mind. You may experience slight
breathlessness or light-headedness at first until your body adjusts. Follow
the advice recently given by his personal physician to a 74-year-old former
UN secretary-general, returning to the 'Altiplano' after years of soft,
sea-level living: 'Walk slowly; eat little; sleep alone'. Most important:
make no business appointments for the first day, while your red corpuscles
are building up. Drink abundant liquids (but not alcohol) and avoid over-hot
baths. A mate de coca (coca tea) on arrival may help stave off soroche
(altitude sickness).
Business travellers from most European and North American destinations will
not require visas. Customs formalities are relaxed and airport staff
helpful. A taxi into town (about 30 minutes) costs less than Dollars 10.
Cabs have no meters. Don't expect taxi drivers to speak English; they are,
however, honest and reliable. A Dollars 20 exit tax is payable on departure.
Hotels: Status-conscious businessmen frequent the Radisson (the remodelled
former Sheraton), the Plaza or the Presidente, all of which are well up to
international standards. The discriminating traveller may prefer the cosier
atmosphere of the newly-inaugurated Rey Palace where suites are huge and
half the price.
Restaurants: Thanks to the expense accounts of a continuing procession of
international functionaries, development experts and ubiquitous consultants
showing Bolivia the way to 'modernity', La Paz's range of eating-houses is
expanding. The Utama sky-room restaurant in the Plaza hotel (excellent salad
bar) has an established and well-deserved reputation. For a quiet business
lunch or dinner, choose between Juliano's and La Quebecoise, both in former
private houses. Even more intimate is the Restaurant de la Paz, where the
tables are set with the owner's own solid silver cutlery.
Newly fashionable among carnivorous Bolivians is the Brazilian-style meat
restaurant Brasargent (fixed price; all the meat you can eat). The Casa del
Corregidor (Swiss management but Bolivian chef) offers Bolivian folk music
and local and international dishes in a colonial setting. If you have time,
the Oberland (through the 'Valley of the Moon') is a pleasant lunch spot.
And when you need a coffee, opposite the central post office is the
legendary Cafe La Paz where old-time conspirators planned their coups.
Typical dishes and drinks: Saltenas - a spicy meat or chicken turnover
traditionally eaten before lunch always with a cold drink, never coffee or
tea. Chairo - the soup of La Paz, meat-based with at least 10 spices, made
with dried potato flour (chuno). Picante mixto - as a main dish. In its
complete version, it includes jerky, rabbit, tripe and tongue. Chuflay - a
mixture of singani (a locally-distilled spirit made of grapes), lemon juice
and Seven-Up. Concepcion - a breakthrough in Bolivian wine. Could be
Chilean.
Communications: Picking up a pre-capitalisation Bolivian telephone can be a
nightmare; getting through, locally and internationally, is time-consuming.
Picking up the Bolivian Times, the country's only English-language
newspaper, is a more agreeable experience. The one-year-old weekly appears
on Fridays.
Cochabamba: Half and hour's flight from La Paz, this 'city of eternal
spring', at 2,600m above sea level, has lost some of its former
architectural charm in the aftermath of the 1980s coca boom down the road to
the Chapare. It remains a pleasant and relaxed, but well-developed, business
centre.
Stay at the deceptively gracious, recently-refurbished Gran Hotel
Cochabamba. Built adjacent to a small church, some rooms permit
participation in services next door. Round the corner is the new Hotel
Portales, not to be confused with the Patino mansion (now a cultural centre
and art gallery) in the same block. Both hotels have swimming pools.
The Gran Hotel restaurant is considered the best in town.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (26): Obstructing the president's vision -
Stephen Fidler assesses the political system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Byzantine workings of Bolivia's tight-knit political system remain a
mystery even to long-standing students. Some observers reckon it also
remains a mystery to its president, who spent most of his formative years
outside the country.
Far from enjoying the cut and thrust of political life, President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada appears to view politics as a rather tiresome necessity.
Like Bolivia's coca problem, politics stands in the way of his grand vision.
Educated at the University of Chicago and a philosophy student who speaks
better English than Spanish, he certainly is not from Bolivia's traditional
political mould - which is a positive rather than negative attribute as far
as most of the public is concerned.
While the popularity of his government has waned in recent months - in large
measure because of the way it handled demonstrations by coca growers - it
remains by Bolivian standards at reasonable levels. Many Bolivians figure
the president, one of Bolivia's most successful entrepreneurs, is rich
enough not to have to be corrupt.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada describes himself as 'a very modern type of
politician'. During the 1993 election campaign, he reshaped his campaign -
with the help of US political consultants Sawyer, Miller - after close
scrutiny of opinion polls. It was out of these opinion polls that the idea
of 'capitalising' rather than privatising state industries developed.
He has followed public opinion closely since he took office. 'We have used a
great deal of modern methods - polling, focus groups and in-depth
interviews. We've become very effective in not only knowing the questions to
ask but knowing how to interpret the answers,' he says.
But even some supporters think that the president is too much of a slave to
public opinion, and that following the opinion polls has added to
indecisiveness and slowed the government reform programme. They argue that
to get things done he will have to court public unpopularity  - particularly
in the middle of his term and since he is forbidden by the constitution for
standing for a second consecutive term.
As an example, they cite the fact that public support for coca-growers
marching on La Paz to protest against government policy aimed at repressing
illegal coca cultivation led him to an about-turn in which he met the
leaders of the coca farmers' unions, whom he openly condemns.
Yet Goni - as he is widely known - continues to stand head and shoulders in
public esteem above the rest of his political rivals, according to Mr Carlos
Mesa, a political analyst and television journalist.
Indeed, most of the parties competing against the coalition led by the
president's MNR party are almost all in turmoil.
The MIR, the party which provided the previous president, Mr Jaime Paz
Zamora, is viewed by political analysts as highly vulnerable. This follows
allegations - brought to the attention of the government by the US Embassy
and now being examined by Congress - that the former president and senior
members of his party had links with drugs traffickers.
The party of former dictator Gen Hugo Banzer - the ADN - has also been
weakened by an intensifying debate over the succession to the party's ageing
figurehead and founder.
Meanwhile the UCS, the party headed by brewery magnate Max Fernandez, has
been riven by a dispute with the government.
Mr Fernandez pulled out from the governing coalition protesting at the lack
of government jobs allotted to his party. However, many of his party members
peeled off and continue to support the government, which thereby preserved
its majority in both houses of Congress.
Other significant opposition figures include Mr Carlos Palenque, a
television talk-show host and populist who heads Condepa. Arguing for a new
economic programme which he calls 'endogenous development', he so far has
been unable to extend his support beyond the poor people of the highland
regions.
According to one observer, therefore, 'Goni's biggest problem is with his
own party.' As a modernising president sitting atop an unreconstructed
political system, he has had to cut deals - that means promising jobs - with
key figures within the MNR. Although it is early to judge, many political
analysts believe, nonetheless, that the most likely next president will come
from the ranks of the MNR.
Among the names most frequently mentioned are - in the ranks of traditional
politicians - Mr Guillermo Bedregal, now a leading legislator in the lower
house, and a senator, Juan Carlos Duran. The candidature of Mr Bedregal, who
agreed to go as ambassador to the UK before deciding that he should stay on
in Bolivia, is weakened by his links to the violent 16-day dictatorship of
Alberto Natusch Busch in 1979, when he was minister of external relations.
More technocrats than politicians are Mr Fernando Romero, the entrepreneur
and a former cabinet minister ousted by the president, and Mr Jose Guillermo
Justiniano, the present minister of sustainable development and the
environment.
All this assumes some measure of success for Mr Sanchez de Lozada's
programme, in particular capitalisation, which is being relied upon to boost
growth. 'If capitalisation doesn't work, everything he does here is dead,'
says one political analyst.
Failure of the programme, according to one diplomat, does raise the danger
of a populist government succeeding the administration. If that happens, he
argues that the intervention of the military cannot be ruled out.
In the military - as well as in politics, particularly in the eastern city
of Santa Cruz - the influence of secret societies or 'lodges' is hard for
outsiders to divine. Yet the intervention in the near future of the military
in politics is viewed as unlikely by most Bolivian observers.
Indeed, the military is on the face of it today less of a factor in Bolivian
politics than it has ever been. The involvement of the dictatorship of Gen
Luis Garcia Meza during 1980-81 with drug trafficking and the viciousness of
the regime caused long-term damage to the public standing of the army.
Mr Mesa, the political analyst, says morale in the armed forces is low, its
effectiveness has been reduced by budget stringency and it has yet properly
to define a modern role for itself. The international and regional
environment is also significantly less friendly to military governments than
it was a decade ago. Furthermore, there is no sign of the emergence of a new
military leadership willing or able to take a political role, he says.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (28): From teargas to handshakes - Richard
Bauer takes a look at the drugs problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First it was teargas hurled from helicopters; then dialogue and handshakes
in the Presidential palace. That was the government's alternating strategy
for dealing with recalcitrant coca-growers.
With annual production of about 90,000 tonnes, Bolivia is - after Peru  -
the world's second-largest producer of coca leaf. An estimated Dollars 300m
to Dollars 600m is injected annually into the economy by the coca-cocaine
business with as many as 120,000 Bolivians directly involved either in
growing the (legal) leaf or processing the (illicit) basic paste from which
cocaine is made.
In the biggest social protest demonstration since President Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada took office last year, La Paz residents opened their arms to 2,000
down-at-heel 'cocaleros' when they marched on the capital in September.
Dodging police and military road-blocks, they had made their way from the
country's main coca-growing region - the sub-tropical Chapare near
Cochabamba - to clamour against stepped-up repression measures adopted by
Bolivia's drugs police who are advised by the US Drug Enforcement
Administration. They also sought more government funding for alternative
agricultural development.
Mr Felipe Caceres, number two in Bolivia's 40,000-strong Cocaleros
Federation, says the government's 'Operation Dawn' had put the Chapare under
virtual state of siege. 'They tried to intimidate us. Everyone out at night
in the bush or without proper identification was arrested.'
The government's objective was to force the coca price below production
cost, thus obliging the cocaleros to eradicate more crops and meet drugs
treaty obligations with the US, according to Mr Caceres.
Long gone are the boom years of the mid-80s when a 50kg sack of dried coca
leaves fetched as much as Dollars 900. 'At Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 a sack,
coca-growing's become bad business. We can't even pay day labourers to
harvest it,' says Alcira Perez of Quechua origin, who immigrated to the
Chapare years ago. She says she has half a hectare of coca along with a
variety of cash crops.
'The record low coca leaf price is an element in the protests,' says Mr
Oscar Freudenthal of Unido (the United Naions Industrial Development
Organisation), who oversees alternative development projects in the Chapare.
He believes coca production in Bolivia is decreasing. 'Drugs dealers prefer
to do business in Peru where repression is less harsh - here, peasants are
trapped and haven't switched to other crops.'
President Sanchez de Lozada says: 'We haven't got rid of the cancer, but at
least it's not growing,' referring to the coca issue. A senior US embassy
official in La Paz, meanwhile, sees a real reduction in the macro-economic
impact of the drug economy: 'GDP has grown and coca has been contained,' he
says.
According to the State Department's Agency for International Development
(USAID) estimates, six years ago 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product came
from coca-cocaine. By 1993 that had dropped to 2.7 per cent. Coca leaf
production has stagnated since 1988.
Bolivia's performance on drugs control is far superior to Peru's, says Mr
Sandro Calvani, representative in Bolivia for the United Nations Drugs
Control Programme. 'Drug mafias have not succeeded in undermining Bolivian
democracy - and people are not dying en masse as in Peru or Colombia. In the
past 10 years in Bolivia, only two policemen and 18 peasants have been
killed in drugs-related crimes.'
Government officials complain that popular views on coca and the drugs trade
are being manipulated locally by a handful of old-fashioned trade union
leaders - mainly laid-off miners - and the communications media who are
'romanticising' the issue. President Sanchez de Lozada terms the reaction of
his countrymen 'devastating; all the people say this is a repressive
government (acting) against poor farmers.' Many Bolivians consider straight
interdiction activities by the Umopar drugs police are a US-inspired
conspiracy to undermine their national dignity and sovereignty.
Mr David Dlouhy, US charge d'affaires in La Paz, unleashed a storm of
protest by stating publicly that 'coca-growers have turned into drugs
traffickers. They are directly collaborating with the coca producers and
cocaine dealers who sell the drug outside the Chapare.'
'When it comes to coca, everyone in Bolivia is playing a game,' says a
foreign drugs expert. 'You cannot ignore the existence of at least 7,000
coca maceration pits in the Chapare, nor the 20,000 people directly involved
in drugs production.'
The apparent hypocrisy stems from the fact that coca is a legal crop in
Bolivia, and has served peasants and miners down the centuries as a
stimulant when working at altitude. The panorama changed radically - and
illegal cultivation grew rapidly - only when cocaine became a fashionable
drug in the US and Europe of the 1980s.
Since 1988, Bolivian law has made an innovative distinction between legally
grown and harvested leaves destined to satisfy 'traditional' demand (that
is, chewing, drinking as tea or reading the leaves) and coca for other
purposes which is 'iter criminis' (on the way to illegality).
If this nice distinction is applied, most of the 50,000ha of coca fields in
the Chapare are illegal and should be gradually reduced. With the help of
satellite photography, the US has identified 40,000ha for eradication. Coca
growers get a Dollars 2,000 cash reward for each hectare they eradicate.
The results speak for themselves: between 1987 and 1993, some 26,000ha have
been destroyed, with Dollars 50m paid put in cash compensation. But, as if
by magic, another 33,000 new hectares have been freshly planted.
Mr Alfonso Alem, government adviser and representative to Conadal, the
recently-revived alternative development council, says the strategy has
clearly failed; the situation is 'schizophrenic' and coca-growers 'the
privileged', he says.
'No region in Bolivia has received so much development aid as the Chapare,
and thanks to coca, central government receives balance-of-payments support
from the US. The message is: to get money, grow coca.'
Asked if his government has a clear strategy for fighting the coca-cocaine
business, President Sanchez de Lozada's disturbingly honest answer is:
'Obviously not. Who (in the world) has a clear strategy on drugs?'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (27): Ambitious government plan - The
environment / Raymond Colitt examines forestry issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For centuries, Bolivia's natural resources have been exploited in a
free-for-all manner - usually lacking any environmental concern. Today, the
economy is still heavily resource dependent and excessive environmental
degradation is common.
The government, in an ambitious plan developed by the new Ministry of
Sustainable Development and Environment, is attempting to introduce the
sustainable or rational use of natural resources without sacrificing
economic growth.
The challenges are daunting. Extreme poverty, powerful agro-industrial
enterprises and a general ignorance of environmental issues are the
principal causes of Bolivia's ecological problem.
The question is, will the government have the resources and political power
to enforce its scheme?
On the winding road from Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia, trucks head westward
loaded with enormous trunks of tropical timber, winding their way up the
Andean slopes. These shipments, usually made up of mahogany from Bolivia's
vast Amazon rain forest, are destined for export. 'Forests cover 50 per cent
of Bolivia's territory, providing the woodworking sector with an immense
natural resource. . .' reads an investment brochure for Bolivia. Indeed, the
wood industry, which increases the country's income for each tree felled, is
growing steadily. But manufactured wood products, such as doors, make up
only only a small proportion of the income from exports: Dollars 7.2m of the
Dollars 52m total wood exports last year.
Mr Juan Carlos Quiroga, secretary of natural resources, says: 'Brazil
extracts the same amount of mahogany as Bolivia does, but by processing it
they earn Dollars 200m instead of Dollars 45m like we do.'
What makes Bolivia's wood industry 'unsustainable', however, is that
virtually none of the wood exported today comes from reforested areas, so
that the country's stock of forest simply dwindles until it disappears. In
addition, says Mr Gonzalo Flores of the forest conservation programme
Probona, 'companies evade paying the proper taxes and have management plans
rubber-stamped by corrupt officials.
A legislative proposal presently before congress is to institute a 40-year
concession on forested areas in exchange for annual fees per hectare of
between seventy cents and Dollars 1.30, replacing the present tax per square
foot of lumber, which was easily evaded. Management plans requiring a more
reasonable extraction of timber would be reviewed by international
consultants and approved by a high-level ministerial council. The idea is
that the concession would be revoked if timber companies exploited the area
irrationally.
Wood industry leaders are sceptical about the new law. Mr Carlos Miguel
Gagliardi, general manager of the industrial wood company Cimal, says: 'the
per hectare tax will drive up our cost because now we have to conduct
expensive inventory studies to be sure of the amount of marketable timber.'
Mr Cristobal Roda, whose family made its fortune in wood extraction, says he
realises the need for serious forestry management. 'We have to think of the
future because my factory and our people's jobs are at stake.' Yet few wood
companies have long-term investments. 'The majority operate only with a
skidder, a caterpillar and a saw mill,' says Mr Gagliardi.
'Our intention is to get these companies to think of long-term strategies
rather than just short-term profits,' says Mr Juan Carlos Quiroga.
The problem, reply industry representatives, is that so far government
policies have not been very consistent. Neither does the proposed idea of
concessions promote reforestation, they say. 'There won't be much interest
in reforestation if we can't own the land,' says Mr Roda.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (29): Lots of attractions - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tourism may well have the largest potential for growth of any industry in
Bolivia. At least that is the way the government sees it.
A plan to develop tourism - the first in the history of Bolivia according to
government officials - aims to boost industry income from Dollars 115m at
present to Dollars 1bn within a decade. Instead of the present 265,000
visitors a year close to 1m are to be enticed to the country.
'We want more tourists; have them stay longer; spend more money; and speak
well of our country when they leave,' says Mr Ricardo Rojas, secretary of
tourism.
'If you look at other countries that have been successful in tourism, you'll
notice that they've focused on a few well-targeted, key development
projects,' says Mr Rojas. A new tourism law, which the government hopes to
have approved by March 1995, will provide long-term tax exemptions to
attract foreign investment to several so-called 'mega-projects.'
In exchange for foreign capital, the government pledges to provide the basic
infrastructure for a project, train the personnel, and promote tourism
abroad. A list of proposed sites is to be made known shortly.
The government is aware that it faces a challenging task. Not only is there
an enormous information deficit about Bolivia among international tour
operators, but it also suffers from an image problem - that of a politically
unstable and drug-ridden country.
Many tourists still only visit Bolivia as part of a two- or three-country
tour. 'We get many tourists venturing into Bolivia on a brief excursion
following an extensive tour of Peru: that needs to change,' says the manager
of a leading tour operator.
As part of its promotional activities, the government inaugurated a tourist
office in New York on August 1 and plans to open others in Spain and Germany
by next year. A toll-free information line is operating in the US, and
Bolivia plans to attend international tourism fairs, including the World
Travel Market in London between November 14 and 17.
The image which the government will be trying to sell to the public is that
of a safe and cheap country boasting enormous diversity and friendly people.
One promotional brochure says that 'Bolivia is the new undiscovered tourist
destination' and that 'Bolivia is definitely the last frontier' for those
seeking ancient cultures or ecological adventure.
The potential exists. Tourist attractions in Bolivia abound. Only an 1 1/2
hours from La Paz, for example, are the crystal-clear waters of Lake
Titicaca, 4,000m above sea level and fed by the melting waters of the
snow-capped peaks of the Cordillera Real, which forms a breath-taking
backdrop.
On the island of Paco, the villagers of Suriki demonstrate their skills in
constructing balsas, or reed canoes, which the Norwegian explorer Thor
Heyerdahl used in his voyages and which the Spanish adventurer Kitin Munoz
is soon to take on a world tour.
Nearby, Tiwanaku is probably Bolivia's most important archaeological site,
featuring monumental stone figures and the so-called Sun Gate, which give
testimony to what was once the capital of one of the world's
longest-reigning empires.
The pre-Incan Tiwanaku civilisation, famed for advanced agricultural systems
that are now being revived, is said to have had significant cultural
influence on the subsequently larger Inca empire.
Opportunities for mountain climbing or trekking are numerous near La Paz.
Peaks such as the Ilimani or Huayna Potosi, rising over 6,300m are easily
accessible and can be climbed in two days. Stone-paved Inca trails, still
employed by farmers and their produce-laden llamas, are ideal for treks
through the Andean mountains.
A trip out to Bolivia's Amazon region is worthwhile. Visitors can see Jesuit
missions some 220km north-east of Santa Cruz in the middle of the tropical
rain forest.
Missionaries from Bavaria, Switzerland and Bohemia went there in the early
17th century to convert the Chiquitano Indians to Christianity and train
them as musicians and artisans.
Today, half a dozen of the world's most unique churches make the story of
The Mission come alive. They still serve as community centres for thousands
Chiquitanos.
Eastern Bolivia, with its rich biodiversity has enormous potential for
eco-tourism. A large number of local bird species, among them the
blue-throated or red-fronted macaws, make it an ornithologist's paradise.
Access to, and facilities within, the country's protected areas - which
boast a wealth of natural beauty - are rather limited, however.
A lack of infrastructure is also evident at other tourist sites such as
Samaipata, which features important vestiges of an Amazon tribe in the
Andean foothills but is still rather unprotected and unexplored.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (24): Rapid growth from a very small base
 -Developments in the financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance is one of the fastest growing areas of the Bolivian economy. Central
bank figures show the financial sector growing by 21 per cent in 1992, 14
per cent last year and an estimated 12.4 per cent this year.
According to Mr Edward Derksen, chairman of BHN Multibanco, a Bolivian
commercial bank, the country's bigger banks are growing by 30 per cent year.
'With a stable currency and low interest rates abroad, we have had capital
repatriation,' he says.
Yet this rapid growth is from a very small base. The basic business of
banking remains a mystery to a large majority of Bolivians.
Mr Guido Antezana, who stepped down this year as head of the country's
banking association, points out that there are only 350,000 deposit accounts
in a country of 7m people.
Some 45,000 depositors hold 85 per cent by value of all bank accounts.
'This shows how deep the financial function goes in Bolivia,' says Mr
Antezana.
The financial sector is only now recovering from the devastation wrought on
it during the hyperinflation of the early 1980s, which damaged the
credibility of both the Bolivian currency and the banking system.
By the end of 1985, the financial meltdown left the banking system with just
Dollars 50m in assets.
Banking assets have since recovered to Dollars 3.27bn at the end of last
year and the banks' capital to Dollars 225m. But, says Mr Antezana: 'We are
barely back to the financial assets that were held by the banking system in
1978.'
Hyperinflation has left another legacy: the banking system's switch to
dollars.
The proportion of dollars in banks has grown in recent years as money has
been repatriated from abroad and left on deposit in the US currency.
According to the World Bank, 85 per cent of deposits in Bolivian banks were
denominated in dollars at the end of 1993, compared with 77 per cent in
1989.
The majority of local currency deposits in the banking system are held by
the government.
This switch to the dollar clearly reduces the mechanisms available to the
government and central bank for the control of economic policy.
A report from the economic consulting firm Muller &amp; Associates points out
that this - together with the concentration of deposits in a relatively
small number of hands - 'makes the Bolivian economy more vulnerable to
external shocks.'
It also leaves the economy more vulnerable to money laundering by drug
traffickers. The US government says that the country is still not an
important centre for money-laundering. Yet it argues that the situation may
change because money laundering is not considered a crime, 'dollarisation'
is advanced and the banking superintendency refuses to share information
with agencies fighting drug traffickers.
Better liquidity, the perception that the banking system is more or less
secure except for a couple of smaller institutions, and that the country's
political and economic risk rating have improved, have all combined to bring
down lending spreads.
The country risk premium on dollar deposits is about 5-6 per cent on
deposits. Lending spreads are down: interest rates on big bank deposits vary
between 9 1/2 and 11 per cent; and on loans from 12-13 per cent for the best
customers, to 16-20 per cent.
A new banking law, pushed through under World Bank insistence, was passed in
1993. It brought capital requirements to international standards and set up
a superintendency of banks. Critics say the superintendent has been given
too much discretionary power - and provides a poor example for the
regulatory regime which the government intends to set up for
newly-capitalised companies.
Mr Antezana says that more than a dozen banks with adequate minimum capital
are awaiting a decision to allow them to open, but permission has not been
granted or denied. When the bankrupt state banks were formally closed - the
last in December 1992 after the World Bank made this a condition of a loan
it was granting - the then superintendent was accused of reallocating the
accounts in a discretionary manner.
According to Mr Fernando Candia, the central bank president, the central
bank has been operating with complete de facto independence in monetary and
exchange rates since the present government took over last year. The
government is proposing that the independence of the bank in monetary and
exchange rate policy should be granted by law.
To activate the financial system fully, especially the securities markets, a
number of other legal changes are being proposed. A new securities law is
planned to overhaul the antiquated rules. There is a small fixed interest
market - turnover this year is expected to reach Dollars 1bn compared with
Dollars 120m in 1991 - which is increasingly being dominated by private
sector users rather than the government. However, approval of issues by the
securities commission is slow.
There are two independent stock exchanges, created as part of the IMF and
World Bank conditions for structural adjustment, but there is no share
trading - although two share issues are listed. The La Paz stock exchange
started operation in 1989, trading in central bank deposit certificates,
bonds and fixed-term deposits of private banks which account for 85 per cent
of 1993 trading volume of Dollars 578m. The Santa Cruz stock exchange trades
in bills and some bonds, but no fixed-term bank deposits.
The two equity issues are likely to be joined in the next few months as
Cochabamba Power and Light is floated domestically and internationally. The
possible sale of the La Paz electricity distribution company next year may
add another company. But it is hoped that the biggest boost to the equity
market - and to the development of national savings - will come from the
capitalisation process. Under that process, the shares of up to 50 per cent
of the capitalised companies will be distributed equally among Bolivians
aged over 18. This will involve the establishment of some 3.7m separate
retirement accounts.
The first task will be to establish who the eligible Bolivians are - a
difficult one, because the names of a large number of Bolivians are unknown
to the state.
Pension fund managers will be invited to bid to manage these
non-contributory retirement accounts. Already, six pension fund groups,
mostly local banks often with a Chilean partner, are in place.
After the bidding process, which is likely to take into account a variety of
factors, including commissions, holders will be free to shift pension fund
managers. The law will require that those individuals who decide to
contribute to their own private pension funds  - to be introduced as part of
the proposed pensions reform - will have to hold them with the manager who
has the account containing shares in the capitalised companies. The
government estimates there are some 300,000 potential clients who will sign
up for such contributory pensions.
According to Mr Ruben Ferrufino, a senior official working on the pension
plan, the likely lack of liquidity in the capitalisation shares will impose
limits on the amount that can be sold at one time. This liquidity shortage
may also mean that capitalisation shares will be listed on stock exchanges
outside the country.
Proceeds from sales of shares in the non-contributory funds will be directed
into contributory funds. Because of the limited investment opportunity in
the domestic market, investment outside Bolivia is likely to be restricted
to 30 per cent, a high percentage compared with other countries in the
region with private pension systems.
Even if the plan can be guided through Congress, where the government
coalition has a majority, opposition is inevitable and is likely to be
strongest from the national trade union federation. Existing pensioners
worried about losing their pensions, and the managers of the small existing
pension funds - all severely hit by hyperinflation in the 1980s - which
coexist with the bankrupt state pension fund, are also likely to oppose the
changes.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (25): Writing its own success story -
BancoSol, the unorthodox bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BancoSol, not yet three years old and the smallest of all Bolivian banks, is
writing its own success story.
Inspired by a 'bank for the poor' in Bangladesh, this unorthodox financial
institution presently channels through its 29 branches short-term
'mini-loans' to 60,000 individuals 'who wouldn't normally get through a
bank's glass doors,' says Mr Pancho Otero, BancoSol's general manager.
BancoSol has set up its unusual headquarters in a bustling, lower
middle-class district next door to La Paz's San Pedro prison - a far cry
from the marble banking halls of El Prado preferred by its more traditional
rivals. BancoSol customers make up 40 per cent of all Bolivian borrowers,
but the average individual credit is a tiny Dollars 500. Bad loans are
almost unheard of. The first write-off in BancoSol's history was in October
 -for Dollars 1,500.
Each month, the bank processes 12,000 loans for Bolivia's army of informal
entrepreneurs - known to economists as 'the self-employed' and estimated to
number about 1m.
BancoSol's clients, a majority of them women, would never receive credit
from a traditionally-constituted bank: they lack the necessary documentation
and formal guarantees. Forty per cent of all credits go to finance the
commercial activities of street-traders, the rest to workshops and small
back-street factories.
The secret of BancoSol's success lies in its policy of lending only to small
groups of between three and eight who co-guarantee the loan. Alicia Aira,
Flora Blanco and Irma Gutierrez are a typical group of borrowers. All three
are tough-talking Aymara women, proudly dressed in traditional bowler hats
and many-petticoated skirts. Their Spanish is deficient but their business
talents irrefutable.
All make their living as street-traders, with adjoining pitches in central
Avenida Camacho. One sells sweets, another sun-glasses and the third,
magazines. In October, they were seeking BancoSol credit for working capital
in preparation for the busy Christmas season - Dollars 500 each for eight
months at 2.5 per cent a month. Without BancoSol, their only alternative
would be an informal loan shark who would charge at least twice that.
'There's an unquenched thirst for credit in the informal sector,' says Mr
Javier Villanueva, a young university graduate-turned-stockbroker at Saxxon
Capital who wrote his thesis on informal banking practices in Bolivia. He
has identified some 50 non-governmental organisations which presently grant
informal credits outside the banking law. But BancoSol is the first
formalised bank to attend those needs.
Five NGOs are awaiting the green light from Bolivia's banking
superintendency to become authorised lending institutions. BancoSol,
meanwhile, aims to lend a total of Dollars 150m in 1998.
With Dollars 7m in capital, BancoSol eschews the mask of philanthropy. 'It's
run along the same criteria as any other bank,' says Mr Otero, who expects
profits of Dollars 1m for 1994. It receives credits at commercial rates
(between 10 and 12 per cent a year) from other banks and large, liquid
companies to increase volume. A pilot programme to attract small savers has
got off the ground, bringing in Dollars 4m to date.
International organisations such as Massachusetts-based Action
International, the Fundes foundation of Switzerland for the promotion of
small enterprise and the IADB's offshoot IIC are all shareholders in
BancoSol. But so too, encouragingly, are some of Bolivia's wealthiest
businessmen with a social penchant: President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, Mr
Fernando Romero, former planning minister, and Mr Julio Leon Prado, a
prominent entrepreneur, all have a stake in BancoSol and are ready to offer
professional advice.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (19): Pillar for economic growth - The
agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agriculture remains Bolivia's single most important sector of the economy,
representing 20 per cent of gross domestic product, and agro-industrial
products are presently experiencing the fastest growth of any exports.
This is not a cyclical trend; agricultural development will be a pillar for
economic growth in years to come. The main reason is that Bolivia is
discovering that it has comparative advantages in specific agricultural
products - and it has enormous tracts of undeveloped and extremely fertile
land in its eastern frontier.
Contrary to other tropical regions in the Amazon basin, the fluvial plains
in the province of Santa Cruz boast soils extremely rich in nutrients that
produce above-average yields. While soya producers in neighbouring countries
harvest an average of 1.5 tonnes a hectare, Bolivian farmers reap 2.5 to 3
tonnes a hectare. The tropical climate allows two soya harvests a year, of
which the larger one is in the wet season between November and April.
Prospects are so promising that foreign investors, especially from Brazil
and Argentina, are flocking to the area in search of sizeable tracts of land
to grow soya beans and other crops. Although some of the soya production
still leaves the country without any processing - soya worth Dollars 13m was
exported in 1993 - large quantities are being processed into oil, flour or
animal feed.
Despite considerable growth figures last year, however, the agricultural
sector faces significant difficulties. Interest rates on loans are still
high, preventing capital investment in technology. Irrigation is virtually
non-existent and dependency on rainfall does not allow for steady returns.
This year, a prolonged drought caused estimated losses of Dollars 20m in
soya, wheat, sunflower and fruit production.
In addition, the region's limited infrastructure complicates the transport
of agro-exports. Producers complain that transportation to Chile's distant
Arica port is costly and that roads are in poor condition. The
Paraguay-Parana waterway, which flows into the Rio Plata near Buenos Aires,
provides a less expensive alternative shipping route. But the train service
from Santa Cruz to Puerto Suarez on the river Paraguay has a limited cargo
capacity.
The influential lowland agriculture association, CAO, demands more support
from the government as well as a coherent development plan for the sector.
Mr Erwin Reck, CAO's president, urges the creation of a ministry of
agricultural development and the construction of strategic roads in the
region, as well as cheaper credits.
The small-scale farming of more traditional products by campesinos of the
highlands is a sharp contrast to the large agro-industrial production of
Bolivia's lowlands. A large percentage of Bolivia's highland rural
population ekes out a living in subsistence farming, while others manage to
market excess production of foodstuffs.
One product from the largely bleak and agriculturally poor Altiplano that
has seen rapid growth - and is now being exported - is the quinua, a small,
disk-shaped grain which has been a staple in the Andes for thousands of
years and has recently seen a resurgence as a health food in Europe and the
US. Quinua has higher nutritional value than any other grain commercially
available.
The Association of Quinua producers, Anapqui, has been promoting exports of
the product, making Bolivia the world's leading producer. Anapqui,
incorporating 3,000 producers of quinua, claims that 60 per cent of
Bolivia's total is exported and this grows by 20 per cent annually.
Mr Francisco Valderrama, head of Anapqui, says that continued growth of
quinua production in Bolivia will depend on the country's ability to satisfy
consumer demand for specific quinua products, such as ready-to-eat cereals
or snacks. 'Above all we have to capitalise on the advantage in quality we
have over other producers to increase and defend our market share,' says Mr
Valderrama.
Although the US and Canada are producing large quantities of quinua, they
have reportedly not been able to match the size and quality of the Andean
product.
Another up-and-coming export product that has been grown in the region for
thousands of years are textiles made of alpaca, from a domesticated version
of the Andean llama. Exports last year totalled Dollars 4m.
Hand-knitted designer sweaters 'made in Bolivia' are on sale in boutiques
and department stores in the US and Europe. Mr Gerald Fisher, a US
expatriate, who has been supplying US department stores and mail order
catalogues for 20 years, says: 'Alpaca is a fibre that has awaken.' His
sweaters, designed by a well known New York fashion designer and knitted by
indigenous women in the highlands, retail for Dollars 195 to Dollars 295 in
the US.
Beatrice Patino's Coats and suits in Alpaca textiles by Beatrice Patino have
been featured in New York as an alternative to garments in traditional
luxury fibres such as cashmere or mohair.
Patino moved her business from 7th Avenue, to a back street in a popular
neighbourhood in La Paz.
The Bolivian Export Foundation (FBE), a non-profit organisation funded by
the World Bank and the Dutch and Swiss governments, goes beyond merely
identifying potential export products to co-finance their production. Unlike
other aid organisations, the FBE conducts detailed feasibility studies on
specific products before entering into a joint venture with local
enterprises or communities.
Mr Romel Antelo, secretary of the directorate, says that while other
development non-governmental organisations are often careless about where
they put their money, the FBE has to make a positive return on its
investment to continue operating. 'We operate very much like a private
enterprise, carefully studying the investment opportunities,' says Antelo.
The FBE is presently financing a garlic producing venture with 120 peasant
families in Tarija, southern Bolivia, who contribute the land as their part
of the deal. The FBE expects to recuperate its Dollars 300,000 investment
after the first harvest.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (20): Community effort is the key /
Profile of Caico farming co-operative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Kotei Gushiken arrived in Bolivia in 1954 he had little more than hope
in his baggage - hope to begin a new life after leaving behind the
economically depressed post-war Okinawa.
With him came some 405 Japanese peasants, each of whom was given a plot of
land by the Bolivian government as part of a programme to expand the
agricultural frontier into the dense jungle that still predominated in the
areas just north of Santa Cruz.
A mysterious fatal disease and the peasants' unfamiliarity with the tropical
soil and climate led nearly half of the recently arrived immigrants to
abandon their new homes. Adverse soil conditions forced the remaining
settlers to move their community twice before finally founding Okinawa
colony in 1956.
Attempts to cultivate cotton and other crops failed in these early stages.
Yet today Mr Gushiken sits in an executive chair in his air-conditioned
office in a brand new community centre built with Japanese government aid.
He is now president of the Japanese-Bolivian Association with its 730
members.
Mr Gushiken says: 'In the early days I never believed we could achieve what
we have now - and much of that success is due to a communal effort.'
The agricultural co-operative Caico, formed by the colony in 1971, today
controls 10 per cent of the country's soya grain production and 35 per cent
of total soya seed production.
It was this community that began experimenting with the cultivation of soya
back in the early 1970s, before the bean became the number one agricultural
export in Bolivia.
Land and machinery remain private property in the community but Caico
provides technical assistance, long-term planning and collective bargaining
with wholesalers.
Quick to realise the long-term benefits of adding value to its basic
product, Caico soon began processing soya beans on site.
First, a seed processing plant was installed, then facilities to extract oil
and produce soya-based animal feed.
With a long-term outlook of secure but steady growth, Caico presently
invests heavily in training its staff.
Youngsters in the colony are given a scholarship and sent abroad to be
trained as agronomists, veterinarians, business administrators and lawyers.
'In order to secure our future we need to invest in our people, maintain our
high quality standards and diversify our product line,' says Mr Masayuki
Kudaka, general manager of Caico.
Caico is now studying the macadamia nut as a crop with a large potential for
growth. Tree nurseries are already in place but the first harvest is still
two years away.
The latest success, though, is the co-operative's own supermarket in the
city of Santa Cruz as a direct outlet for its products.
Says Mr Kudaka: 'With help of the co-operative, we achieved together what we
never could have done on our own.'
An important factor in the community's perseverance has been the maintenance
of cultural traditions. Japanese sociologists who recently visited the
colony say its people have preserved their traditions more than their
brethren in Okinawa.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (23): Looking east - and west - Sally
Bowen meets two Bolivian visionaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself, two of Bolivia's most far-sighted
men are entrepreneurs who, after spending many years outside their native
land, have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into
reality.
One is Mr Joaquin Aguirre, author, philosopher, playwright, businessman and
now the owner of Bolivia's only genuinely functioning port on the Paraguay
River: it bears his name, Puerto Aguirre.
'The Paraguay-Parana hidrovia (waterway) is to our continent what the
Mississippi is to the US,' he says, 'but over the centuries Latin Americans
have done everything possible to ignore it.'
Aguirre found plans for a river port and waterway already gathering dust in
the foreign ministry's archives when he was a young man.
Only after 30 years of globe-trotting - during which he built the gas
pipeline to Argentina, founded a supermarket chain in Colombia and patented
sugar made from bananas - did he return to Bolivia to explore the waterway
route in the mid-1970s.
Since 1983, Mr Aguirre says he has invested Dollars 10m in Puerto Aguirre
from his own savings and loans: other private entrepreneurs have put in
another Dollars 28m.
The 1986 World Bank report on the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, which gave
the green light - and initial credit - to soya farming in the zone,
described him as 'a man of vision, passion and action'.
Mr Aguirre, now in his seventies, believes integration will be achieved by
entrepreneurs rather than governments.
A permanent, five-country 'hidrovia' commission now exists and is already
moving ahead with waterway improvements.
This year, he says, his 'pipe-dream' Puerto Aguirre will move 200,000 tonnes
of cargo, mainly soya.
Like Mr Aguirre, Mr Julio Leon Prado made most of his money in other Latin
American countries over a 30-year period - chiefly in power transmission
lines and construction.
His many-tentacled Banco Industrial group is now Bolivia's leader in
financial services.
But Mr Leon Prado is a frontiersman at heart. Although he is nearly 70 years
old, in the past few years he has spearheaded Bolivia's booming soya
industry and is now the country's largest individual farmer.
'When I expanded to 2,000 hectares, they said I was crazy. But I told them,
if you need two tractors for 2,000 hectares, you need twenty for 20,000:
it's that simple.'
With yields of 3.2 tonnes a hectare, Mr Leon can match the world's most
productive soya farmers. He praises the Japanese settlers in the region east
of Santa Cruz for realising the land's rich potential:
'They revolutionised alised Bolivian agriculture, proving how fertile it
is.'
For Mr Leon, soya represents the future of Bolivia. 'It's a primary industry
and best of all, it's forever because it's sustainable. There's business
here for everyone.' He is lending money, supplying seeds, sharing technology
and weather reports with small farmers in a push to get a million hectares
of Bolivian lowlands under soya.
'That means 3m tonnes of beans a year, which is a point of no return,' he
says. Bolivian soya, plus the produce from south-west Brazil, will exert
irresistible pressure on governments and private companies to get adequate
transportation infrastructure in place.
'Joaquin Aguirre is one of Bolivia's great visionaries,' Mr Leon
acknowledges.
'But I think time will prove him wrong. I believe Bolivia's future lies
westwards, out through Peru to the Pacific.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (21): Income is gradually rising - Rural
development programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The town of Comanche in the province of Pacajes - some 120km south of the
capital La Paz, on the bleak and wind-swept Altiplano - is the site of an
unusual sustainable rural development project, writes Raymond Colitt.
Only a few years back, the population of Comanche was struggling with daily
survival. The inhospitable lands did not allow for any type of agriculture.
Water is scarce during 10 months of the year and the temperature at 4,000m
above sea level often drops well below zero. Well-water in the area is salty
and unsuitable for human consumption.
The Pacajes, a pre-Incan indigenous group, had once earned their living as
merchants, bringing goods from the Pacific coast. The coming of the railway
meant that their way of life changed drastically, forcing them to rely on
agricultural activities. Yet even cattle ranching, the only source of
income, was not feasible on a large scale because of the meagre vegetation.
The villagers of Comanche, like those in many other towns throughout the
Altiplano, left home to look for jobs in the city, to practice
slash-and-burn farming in Bolivia's lowlands, or to join the multitude of
coca-growers in the sub-tropical Chapare region.
Then, in 1983, a non-profit aid organisation, Semta, launched a rural
development plan. Unlike countless other aid projects, this one introduced
simple and inexpensive technologies to promote environmentally sustainable
and economically yielding agricultural practices.
One of the earliest and most successful projects was the construction of a
new type of greenhouse - a low, four-walled building covered with an
'agrofoil' that allows the temperature to rise to 350C, while protecting the
plants from strong winds.
Other low-cost, high-impact projects include the construction of ditches and
dams to retain and channel rain water, which is otherwise wasted and erodes
the already thin layer of fertile soil. A programme to recuperate 17,000ha
of grassland by sowing native grass seeds is already bearing fruit: the
number of cattle able to graze there has increased substantially.
Semta's projects are based neither on hand-outs nor on 'top-to-bottom'
coaching. Mr Oscar Aguilar Calderon, Semta's executive director, says:
'Community participation is crucial in avoiding dependence and in
guaranteeing the success of a project.' Farmers must, for example, produce
and hand over to Semta new seed for the grassland project - in exchange for
which they get barley seed.
High-school children are in charge of reforestation and receive an award for
the biggest tree at the end of each year. Management plans are also jointly
established between the community and Semta.
Today, the results of Semta's work are clearly visible. Many families are
virtually self-sufficient in grains, vegetables and milk. Their income is
gradually rising through the commercialisation of cattle-farming and their
agricultural skills have improved significantly.
However, one member of every family usually still migrates to La Paz,
Cochabamba or Santa Cruz to secure additional income, and the inhabitants of
Comanche are still uncertain about the future of their community. But the
massive flow of migrants has at least been halted.
The question is whether this type of project can be implemented on a
national level.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (22): Symbols are important - The Indians
/ The majority indigenous peoples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Hugo Cardenas, Bolivia's vice-president, receives visitors in his
ornate office in La Paz's legislative palace. Seating his guests around him,
he indicates the most elaborate gilded chair and jokes: 'This is my throne'.
Symbols are important for this first-ever Aymara to be elected to such high
office.
Every hour of the day since he was sworn in, Mr Cardenas has worn over his
left shoulder a finely-woven scarf of vicuna hair - 'except when I'm in the
shower,' says the Sorbonne-trained educator and leader of the indigenous
MRTKL political party.
'A (native) priest gave it to me on behalf of the Bolivian people and told
me never to take it off. It symbolises authority and social control.'
Returning the scarf at the end of his term, Mr Cardenas will have to give
account to priest and people of his actions in government.
Mr Cardenas takes his symbolic role seriously. He aims to 'build in the
political arena a genuinely democratic state where the indigenous, the
peasants and the marginalised are not just guinea-pigs for experiments made
by the government of the day.'
Bolivia, like Peru and Ecuador, is a country in which indigenous peoples are
in a majority. Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken.
Whites, proportionately over-represented in formal business and government,
are an absolute minority.
'We have a dream: that the political system which has always excluded the
majority will accept us. Where does exclusion lead? Sooner or later to
confrontation between Bolivians. Because when the excluded lack channels of
expression within the political system, they seek other methods. Indigenous
and non-indigenous must unite to transform the structure of our country.'
Mr Cardenas has personal experience of exclusion, or discrimination. 'My
father's name was Pedro Choquehuanca Pinto: because of his indigenous
background he could not enter university. When he married, he changed his
name to Cardenas so his children should not suffer the same fate. I can
understand why he did that but, today, conditions have changed and I
wouldn't do it.'
His own wife's experience - she left the teaching profession because she was
not permitted to hold classes wearing her traditional Indian clothes - has
helped give education a high priority on the list of reforms. Bolivia is
moving towards a bilingual educational syste where indigenous children will
be taught first in their native language, adding Spanish later.
Teachers will be permitted to wear traditional dress.
Mr Cardenas hopes reforms such as these will help revert the depressing
statistics: children on average take 12 years to complete a six-year course.
Not surprisingly, the drop-out rate is extremely high.
While Mr Cardenas is certainly a figure full of symbolism, he appears to
have succeeded in escaping the historically non-influential and decorative
role of a Bolivian vice-president.
'I don't just sell government policy; I hear the viewpoints and arguments of
the excluded and I channel them to the appropriate area in the executive
branch where they are dealt with. We want to bring state and society
together.'
Mr Cardenas argues that even though the state has ignored them, Bolivia's
marginalised have notched up many business successes and pressed for a more
economically liberal society.
'If many of us have survived, it's because of our strong shared and
community ties, even among the migrants to the cities. Goni (President
Sanchez de Lozada) has his traditions, his modernity, and I have mine.
Together we want to create an alchemy - and so far, it's working.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (15): Attractive traffic rights - Lloyd
Aereo Boliviano state airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), the state airline, may not be the first, or the
largest, state industry to be capitalised, but it may well be the most
controversial.
Repeated strikes have indicated labour opposition to the planned sale of
shares and transfer of management of the 69-year-old enterprise - one of the
oldest airlines in the world.
Perhaps more interesting than the airline's assets - the average age of its
nine fully-owned aircraft is more than 21 years - are its attractive traffic
rights throughout the hemisphere. LAB presently serves its immediate
neighbours as well as the US. Venezuela, Panama, Uruguay and Mexico. Other
international routes not in use include those to Germany, Spain, Holland,
Cuba, Colombia and Ecuador.
LAB had total assets in 1993 of Dollars 153m, yet booked total long-term
liabilities of Dollars 56m. The company's 1991 net profit of Dollars 2.5m
dropped to a net loss of Dollars 11.8m and Dollars 13.3m in 1992 and 1993
respectively, largely due to big spending on marketing.
The state holds 97.83 per cent of the shares in LAB, with American Airlines
owning 1 per cent and a nominal labour participation equalling 0.1 per cent.
By mid-November the Ministry of Capitalisation will have chosen an
investment bank and a regulatory adviser. The final bid on an expected 49
per cent share in LAB is to be made between March and May 31 of next year.
According to Mr Javier Burgos, secretary of capitalisation and investment,
potential buyers will have no interest in a majority share because they
would lose the usual benefits conferred to a national airline both
domestically as well as in international air traffic agreements.
A rather innovative aspect of the LAB capitalisation programme is the
variety of investment options given to the prospective buyer. Besides making
a cash offer, investors can bid in form of goods or services, such as
aircraft or reservation systems. 'With this added benefit we hope to attract
even more potential investors,' says Javier Burgos. Unlike the other state
enterprises on offer, LAB's sale does not require any additional
legislation. Due to competition by the private Aerosur, which inaugurated
service two years ago, LAB's privatisation would not violate existing
anti-monopoly legislation.
LAB holds a 65 per cent share of Bolivia's international airline market
ahead of American Airlines and Brazil's Varig. In the domestic market, LAB
has been losing ground to Aerosur but still holds a 59 per cent share.
Government officials further underscore the carrier's low labour costs, its
highly trained technical staff, and its potential to improve aircraft
utilisation. With Bolivia's strategic location in the centre of South
America, its promoters envision the under-employed airport of Santa Cruz
becoming a type of regional hub. President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada says
'it would be a natural hub,' but admits, 'we don't generate enough of our
own traffic.' He adds: 'We have this Dollars 250m airport in Santa Cruz,
which only operates 15 minutes per day.'
A previous attempt to sell LAB in 1992 failed, due to what the government
deemed was an unacceptable offer by Iberia.
The Spanish carrier had allegedly offered Dollars 20m for LAB with an option
to withdraw from the deal within a two-year trial period.
A recent government invitation to interested buyers to attend a
'brain-storming session' found little response and had to be cancelled.
Yet Mr Edgar Saravia, senior official at the ministry of capitalisation,
says the problem is not LAB, but rather that many European airlines are busy
themselves in restructuring their operations, while others are simply
cash-strapped.
'In January we will aggressively hit the campaign trail, perhaps having to
offer other finance options or a management contract combined with a lower
stake in the company.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (17): Tough challenge for team - Enfe
state railway system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with the state airline, one of the toughest challenges for Bolivia's
capitalisation team will be Enfe, the aged state railway system. Resistance
may also expected from the 4,000 workers still on the company payroll
despite successive lay-offs of more than 3,000 employees over the past three
years. The World Bank estimates that Dollars 27m will be required for
post-capitalisation severance payments.
Bolivian railways date from 1877 when construction started on the first
Antofagasta stretch. The La Paz to Arica section was inaugurated in 1913
after settlement by treaty of the war between Bolivia and Chile. The eastern
section, joining Santa Cruz to Santos in Brazil and Rosario in Argentina,
dates from the 1940s and 1950s. The three sections have a total 3,466km of
track.
The national railway company Enfe was created in 1964 - at which time the
company operated 102 steam locomotives. Only in 1976 was the switch made to
diesel-electric engines. In the run-up to capitalisation, the fleet
comprised 57 locomotives, only 34 of them operational. Of the 134 passenger
carriages, less than two-thirds were serviceable, and last year Enfe carried
only 750,000 passengers.
Minerals transport has traditionally been Enfe's staple, accounting for some
40 per cent of the 1.4m tonnes of freight hauled last year. Enfe has made
some attempt to move into the fast-expanding business of transporting soya.
But much of its capacity is in the form of converted box cars - there are no
hopper trucks - and soya producers complain bitterly about the quality of
service. Wood, meanwhile, is hauled almost exclusively by road.
If, as Bolivian government officials and many entrepreneurs believe, the
'interoceanic corridor' - from the Atlantic (Santos in Brazil) to the
Pacific (Arica in Chile) - represents their country's trading future, the
most immediate investment will have to be some Dollars 200m building the
missing rail link between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.
Jica, the Japanese international agency, came up in 1991 with a master plan
for upgrading the Bolivian railway system. It envisages investment of
Dollars 1.46bn over 30 years and predicts an internal rate of return of 11
per cent.
Building the missing Cochabamba-Santa Cruz link would be a priority, as
would the extension of the eastern network to Puerto Busch, now projected as
the principal outlet for Bolivian exports to the Atlantic via the
Paraguay-Parana waterway.
By late October, discussions were still in progress about whether to split
Enfe into three for capitalisation or offer it as a complete package. Most
international consultants have advised against including the track itself in
the transfer: Enfe is unlikely to fetch its book price at capitalisation and
retaining ownership of the track would explain away an otherwise
unacceptably low offer.
'It's a politically sensitive issue,' admits Mr Edgar Saravia,
capitalisation secretary. But he is adamant that the state will have no
future role in running the capitalised business: the new operator would
simply lease the track under concession and assume responsibility for its
maintenance.
Enfe's future shape will depend on the capitalisation team's decision.
Smallish regional companies from neighbouring Chile, Argentina and Brazil
could be interested if it is divided, while three US companies - Burlington
Northern, Conrail and Pacific SouthWest - might be convinced to bid for the
railway system as a whole.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (16): Transfer is seen as critical - Ende
electricity company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity company Ende will be be the first of Bolivia's state-owned
assets to undergo the novel capitalisation process. Transfer of 50 per cent
of Ende to a private operator-investor - optimistically scheduled for
February 1995 - is seen as critical for the capitalisation programme.
'Ende has to be a great success,' says Mr Edgar Saravia, capitalisation
secretary. 'It'll be used as a concrete example to convince Bolivians that
capitalisation equals a new society. We're choosing a strategic partner for
the Bolivian people, not just selling a company.'
Schroders, the UK-based merchant bank, has been selected to help identify
the right bridegroom for Ende in what one state official cosily calls this
'electric marriage'. Thirty-one foreign companies, meanwhile, have
pre-qualified to bid, led by cash-rich and expansionist Chilean operators.
Best guesstimates put the bride price at between Dollars 250m and Dollars
300m.
Mr Ramiro Rollano, general manager of ICE, Bolivia's largest construction
company which might hook up with a foreign company to bid, considers Ende
technically well-managed and, with just 500 employees, lean and potentially
profitable. Electricity consumption has been growing steadily at about 6 per
cent a year for several years.
By late October, the energy ministry was into the fifteenth draft of a new
law designed to end the effective duopoly on electric power generation
shared between Ende and Cobee, the La Paz-based private company. Cobee is 70
per cent controlled by the North American holding company Leucadia; small
shareholders have the remainder.
Ende produces half of Bolivia's electricity; Cobee a third. Of the total
750MW, some 300MW is hydroelectrically generated, the rest coming from
largely environmentally-friendly, natural gas-fuelled thermal plants.
Distribution is in the hands of three principal local companies, with Cobee
handling 37 per cent.
Capitalisation is designed to meet classic World Bank privatisation
parameters for creation of competition. Generation, transmission and
distribution will be managed by separate companies.
Initially, the government will retain control over the transmission system
while Ende's generation plants are grouped in three regional packages for
capitalisation.
After some grousing, Cobee is expected to accept the division of its
generation and distribution arms in the pursuit of competition. The three
regional generation companies will have a three-year option on developing
strategic energy export markets.
'Growing electricity demand in the border zones of Brazil, Peru and northern
Chile make that prospect look very attractive,' says Mr Claude Besse, a
former Ende general manager and some-time World Bank consultant.
According to Mr Saravia, changes in the law will ensure that no consumer has
to pay a service connection charge in advance. The Santa Cruz co-operative,
for example, presently charges Dollars 500 to put the first power outlet in
a home.
While this may help overcome regional consumer resistance to the central
government's radical capitalisation plans, the co-operatives themselves may
not be so enthusiastic. Some, such as that of Santa Cruz, have ambitions to
expand into generation - prohibited under the new law.
Other criticisms concern the World Bank-designed plan to dismember an
already tiny generation system into three. 'The boys from Washington are
applying the Argentinian model but forgetting that Bolivia's entire system
generates 750MW against Argentina's 18,000MW,' says Mr Julio Leon Prado of
ICE, the company that built most of the Bolivian transmission and
distribution grid. 'The packages are too small for a foreign investor.'
At 320kWh a year, Bolivia's per capita energy consumption is one of the
lowest in the continent: 44 per cent of Bolivians, mainly in rural areas,
have no access to electricity. Government and World Bank advisers believe
capitalisation is the surest way to improve those statistics.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (18): Investor interest appears keen -
Entel telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With fewer than four lines for every 100 inhabitants, Bolivia has one of the
lowest indices of telephone provision in Latin America. But, as Peru proved
earlier this year when it sold off a controlling share in its state-owned
telecommunications industry for more than Dollars 2bn, it is growth
potential which counts with investors.
Bolivia's long-distance carrier Entel is second on the list of six state
companies headed for capitalisation. Mr Doyle Gallegos, an independent
consultant with previous experience in the Argentine, Venezuelan and
Peruvian sell-offs and now retained to advise on the Bolivian process,
describes Entel as a 'relatively sophisticated' company. Over the past five
years, it has invested some Dollars 150m in satellite and digital equipment
 -40 per cent of that coming from multilateral credits.
Entel's revenue has grown about 70 per cent over the same period, with
international traffic expanding 30 per cent and national long-distance 20
per cent. Rates are near to or slightly lower than the Latin American
average: international calls are Dollars 2.25 per minute plus 13 per cent
tax.
Entel billed Dollars 101m in 1993, producing cash flow equivalent to about
33 per cent of revenue. The new operator will enjoy an 'exclusive
concession' on long-distance traffic for five years, after which the
Bolivian telephone business will be thrown open to full competition.
Capitalisation is complicated by the fact that on-the-ground service has for
more than a decade been in the hands of 22 co-operatives nationally. The
Santa Cruz co-operative has been in existence for 25 years. In general, the
co-operatives have lagged behind in infrastructure investments; many are
alleged to be both inefficient and corrupt, 'administered by people who know
nothing about telecommunications,' according to a local expert.
At present, Bolivians wanting a telephone must pay a discouraging Dollars
1,500 installation charge to their local co-operative. Finding sources of
financing is generally difficult for co-operatives so they are unable to
meet demand: the average waiting time for connection is a year.
Following the Peruvian privatisation model, Bolivia's capitalisation team is
setting specific conditions for Entel's 'strategic partner'. Existing
telephone density is to be doubled within five years, with a target of 12
lines for every 100 inhabitants by the year 2005. That would mean investment
totalling some Dollars 1.6bn.
A simple price cap formula will be applied, diminishing gradually on a
real-terms basis to oblige the operator to increase efficiency. Currently
low local monthly tariffs will have immediately to be raised while
international rates will gradually fall.
By late October, it was not clear how much resistance was to be expected
from certain co-operatives.
Government strategy seemed to focus on reason and persuasion, with the
back-up legal provision that Entel's new partner will have the right to
install parallel infrastructure if local co-operation is not forthcoming.
'Most likely, co-operatives will transform themselves into limited
companies,' says Mr Gallegos. 'Otherwise, their chances of expanding will be
slight.'
The co-operative snag notwithstanding, investor interest appears keen.
Leading international operators such as GTE, American Telephone and
Telegraph, Telefonica and SouthWestern Bell - who recently participated in
the Peruvian telecommunications sell-off - have attended Entel information
seminars. Brazilian and Mexican companies are also reportedly interested in
forming consortia with larger operators.
Seven investment banks have been short-listed for the job of promotion and a
decision is expected by late November. Pre-qualification of operators is
scheduled for January.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (13): Neighbour that always wins - The
country's relationship with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Finland has fought many wars with Russia and it has come second every
time,' Finns will joke when discussing their sensitive relationship with
their giant eastern neighbour.
The most recent confrontation was during the second world war. On that
occasion, the country achieved one of its better results, managing to
preserve its independence despite the sacrifice of a tenth of its territory
The sensitivity in the relationship is hardly surprising. Finland was ruled
by Russia for more than 100 years until 1917. During the cold war it was
forced to adopt a stance of strict neutrality to avoid provoking Moscow.
More recently it has had to endure the taunts of Vladimir Zhironovsky, the
Russian nationalist, and even talk that a starving Russian population was
about to flock over its borders in search of a better life. Even today,
instability in Russia almost automatically provokes a sell-off on the
Helsinki stock exchange.
Against this background, it is not surprising that Finland's desire to
anchor itself firmly in the western camp was one of the main reasons that
its electorate voted to join the European Union by such a clear margin on
October 16. In the back of many people's minds was that the thought that
Finland would gain more security without any new military alliances or
commitments.
The irony is that Finland would probably not have got its chance to apply
for EU membership without the momentous changes which have swept through
Russia in the past five years. Its ability to chart a more independent
course came with the ending of the cold war and the collapse of the former
Soviet Union. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, signalled
in 1990 that Finland was able to go its own way. Then, in mid-1991 Sweden
applied for EU membership. When Finland duly followed suit in March 1992,
the move passed almost unnoticed in Russia.
In the run-up to October's referendum, both supporters and opponents of EU
membership used the Russian issue to back their argument.
Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, said: 'Finland will be able to be very
active and play a very important role in programmes the European Union has
for assisting Russia.
'My impression is that on the Russian side they see the membership of
Finland as an opportunity also for Russia because of the fact that resources
for co-operation will be increased.'
Opponents are not so sure. They believe Finland will slowly be drawn through
EU membership into less neutral defence structures, which could in a future
east-west confrontation put the country in the front line. Mr Risto Volanen,
a member of the 'No' camp, says: 'I am worried we are putting ourselves on
the chessboard in such a way that we are not in control of the moves that
are made.'
The aim is still to hang on to the spirit, if not the fact, of neutrality.
Thus, Finland has joined the Partnership for Peace, while stressing this is
not a staging post on the way to full membership of Nato. As for the Western
European Union, the country says it will seek observer status but has
declined to give any commitment beyond that.
This shows a continuation of the pragmatic stance which Finns have adopted
in their Russian dealings for most of this century. It is an approach that
has benefited them in many ways.
The best example has been trade. During the cold war, Finland had a
privileged trading relationship with the Soviet Union. Under a clearing
system arrangement, agreed at government level and implemented through
five-year plans, the country built up a dangerously high dependence on its
eastern neighbour. Most of its oil and gas imports came from the Soviet
Union; in exchange it supplied ships, machinery and equipment, chemicals and
consumer goods.
At its peak in the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union accounted for 26 per cent of
Finland's trade. The total fell during the late 1980s, but even so the
Finnish economy felt a massive shock when the clearing system was abandoned
 -at Soviet insistence - at the beginning of 1991. The blow deepened
Finland's three-year recession between 1991 and 1993 at a time when it was
already reeling from the consequences of 1980s over-heating and a downturn
in the international economic cycle.
Finnish-Soviet trade, having been worth FM36.6bn in 1983, fell to just
FM9.7bn in 1992. However, there are already clear signs of recovery. In 1993
the trade was worth FM13.9bn and this year it is predicted to reach FM18bn,
or 7.2 per cent of the country's total. This makes Russia Finland's fifth
largest trading partner.
But the structure of the trade today is totally different. Having been
centralised and largely the domain of Finland's big exporters, the picture
is now more fragmented and thousands of Finnish companies are involved.
Moreover, the type of trade has changed. Today, Finland is exporting (or
re-exporting) far more consumer goods than in the past. Trade is also more
complicated due to the absence of a sound legal and banking infrastructure
on the Russian side.
Finland is confident it will benefit in the long term from its geographical
proximity to Russia and, in particular, its closeness to St Petersburg where
Finnish companies are already among the most active foreign investors. The
Finnish port industry has already benefited from congestion and obsolete
facilities on the Russian side, helped by the fact that the two countries
share a common rail gauge.
Whether Finland can successfully market itself more broadly as the 'Gateway
to Russia' and attract foreign investment on the back of it remains open to
doubt. Finland has more experience of dealing with Russia than other western
countries. But its experience derives from a different era and different
conditions when different people were in charge. In many respects, it is
having to start afresh, just like everyone else, in its dealings with the
'new' Russia.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (14): A gift for order, serenity and logic
 -Finnish design should not be ignored, though it is out of the limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The glory days of Finnish design are, for the moment at least, over. Way
back in the 1950s and 1960s, anybody who knew anything at all about design
knew that the Finns were much of what modern design was at. Though Finland
came into design prominence later than its northern neighbours, Sweden and
Denmark, the impact it made was huge.
Alvar Aalto's beautifully lucid and tranquil designs, often based on
laminated blond Finnish beechwood, from the 1930s found a new audience in
the young Europeans hungry for a new aesthetic after the dreary war years.
Eero Aarnio's chairs became models of ergonomic rectitude.
Designers such as Tapio Wirkkala and Timo Sarpaneva brought a new approach
to glass-making and bounced upon the international stage at the Milan
Triennales during the 1950s. But it was probably the colourful cotton
textiles of Marimekko that made the biggest impact round the world. Her
fresh, joyful, sunny approach brought a new innocence and vivacity to the
business of weaving textiles.
Today the works of these designers may be no less beautiful or attractive
but they are somehow, subtly, out of tune with the times. In spite of an
inherent feel for quality combined with simplicity and a deep aversion to
pretentiousness, Finnish design currently seems to be out of the limelight.
A look through the International Design Yearbook for 1993 edited by Borek
Sipek reveals scarcely a Finnish object - during the 1950s and 1960s this
would have been unheard of.
Nevertheless, behind the scenes, all is not lost. The high-profile names may
not be there (this is currently a niche market for the Italians and,
surprise, surprise, the British) but profitable, if less starry, markets are
being developed in office, school and other contract areas. These have
always been particularly suited to the Finnish gift for order, serenity and
logic. Isku, for instance, uses light Finnish birch and pine for shelving,
simple, orderly chairs and tables, while Lepo Product's Paletti collection
of chairs, tables, office furniture, lamps and storage units is durable,
sturdy and much in demand among interior designers.
Even though Finland is unlikely ever to prove a rival to Paris, Milan or New
York, it is building up a surprisingly successful and profitable business in
clothing. Exports have grown continuously and steadily. The opening of the
Russian market has given the clothing industry a big boost but ranges such
as Luhta skiwear have built a steady international following for their
combination of practicality, fashionability and reasonable prices.
Anne Linnomaa had built up a niche business, too, with her ecological
clothing collections for the eco-aware. The company was producing simple,
naturally dyed cotton clothing long before ecology became fashionable.
Friitala has always been renowned for its exquisitely made and classically
designed suedes and leathers. It has managed to walk that fine line between
the classic and the modern, updating the suedes (reindeer and pig) and
leather styles with cut and colour. Popular in St Petersburg, as well as
Peking, it is concentrating on selling through specialty boutiques.
Lapponia is Finland's biggest, most internationally successful jewellery
company. It uses gold in a rich, almost sculptural way, combining it with
aquamarines, opals, amethysts, tourmalines or pearls of diamonds if you
wish, to make rings, brooches, necklaces and bracelets. Less ethnic in its
appeal than Kalevala Koru and more contemporary in approach, it has an
international following.
Hackman Housewares has long been a byword for solid quality, sturdiness and
clean lines. Its range of stainless steel, coated aluminium, copper and cast
iron cookware is scarcely bettered anywhere.
Though Finland is on the whole irredeemably associated with the
contemporary, there are niche businesses that hark back, or perhaps more
politely put, build on a more nostalgic past. J. Marttiini's hunting,
fishing and camping knives, derive from a traditional way of life and have a
strong, visual appeal even for those who will never gut a fish or skin a
reindeer.
Kalevala Koru makes jewellery that celebrates the myths and legends that are
part of Finland's past. Many of the pieces are inspired by excavated
artefacts - rings are intricately worked, a menagerie of animals ranging
from serpents to horses and birds appears on brooches, rings, necklaces.
Pectoral crosses based around the 'praying Mary' and Karelian ribbon winding
are richly dramatic. Stones such as amethyst and spectrolite as well as rock
crystal are combined with silver and bronze to produce jewellery with a
distinct national identity. All the jewellery is made by the Women of
Kalevala, a non-profit organisation formed to ensure that Finland's rich
cultural history lives on in a vital way.
The Nostalgia Home Collection looks as if it comes straight out of a
quintessentially English conservatory - here are elegantly light and
graceful shapes, tables, chairs, storage shelves, all made from lightweight,
sandblasted and powderpainted iron, which could happily live indoors or out.
Aalos managed to combine traditional woodworking skills with a contemporary
approach to children's play in its beautifully crafted wooden toys all made
from Finnish birch.
Those who have forgotten, or those who are too young ever to have seen,
Alvar Aalto's serene and classic furniture might like to know that Artek,
the company which is forever linked with his name, is still going strong. As
trends go in and out, Aalto's furniture may be more or less in fashion, but
something about them endures. There is nothing that is modish or ephemeral
about them. As long as men need seats to sit on, tables to eat off and
quelque chose pour l'oeil' Aalto's furniture will live on.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (13): Energy wealth wasted - YPFB
petroleum company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not only the local coca growers that have put the sub-tropical Chapare
region near Cochabamba under threat. Oil and gas fields discovered in 1993
and developed by the still state-owned petroleum company YPFB are turning
the Chapare into an ecological danger zone.
Campo Carrasco, 300km west of Santa Cruz along the coca trail, is typical.
On one side of the road, a seedy night club advertisement offers engineers,
coca-growers and drug dealers 'pleasant company'. Opposite, a 7km side-road
comes to a less pleasant end - a gigantic gas torch protruding from the lush
vegetation throws out scorching flame, testimony to decades of mismanagement
by historically corruption-riddled YPFB.
Day and night, and not just in the Chapare, gas from YPFB wells is burned
off. As much as 20 per cent of Bolivia's non-renewable hydrocarbons wealth,
instead of being reinjected or transported to final consumers, goes straight
into the atmosphere.
'It's bad planning by previous administrations,' says Mr Mauricio Gonzalez,
YPFB's Oxford-educated president, appointed when the new government took
office in August 1993. He is charged with capitalising Bolivia's most
important state-owned company.
'Capitalisation is a highly expeditious and cost-efficient way of financing
the Dollars 1bn minimum YPFB needs over five years for upstream
development,' says Mr Gonzalez, who prefers to describe the state's
quasi-monopoly as a 'dominant position in the local market'.
Bolivia's only hydrocarbons export is natural gas to Argentina worth Dollars
120m a year. National production shortages meant oil-and-gas-rich Bolivia
was obliged to start importing diesel fuel in 1993.
YPFB is far and away the country's largest company. Its 14,900-strong
workforce produces some 400 cu ft of natural gas and 27,000 barrels of oil a
day. Revenue from YPFB is central government's single most important source
of income; militant YPFB unions its biggest headache.
Mr Gonzalez says YPFB's new partner will inherit the job of restructuring
the workforce: so far it has been reduced by just 800.
The YPFB capitalisation timetable - and its eventual price tag - will be
dependent on negotiations over new gas markets in Brazil and Chile, on a new
hydrocarbons law and on passage of deregulatory and environmental norms.
'These are exciting times - we're moving ahead terribly fast on all fronts,'
says Mr Gonzalez, who aims to have the capitalisation process completed by
mid-1995.
Industry reaction is mixed. 'The government is taking the right steps,' said
a foreign oil executive based in Santa Cruz. 'But no-one knows how they
intend to get investors on the boat.' Special concern exists about
environmental liabilities such as unplugged holes and claims for past
damages.
Whether to offer YPFB as a whole or as a series of packages - as the World
Bank is urging - is still being studied, according to Mr Alfonso Revollo,
capitalisation minister.
If the government decides to keep YPFB as a single entity, it must then
decide whether to allow one trade buyer to buy up half the company. Some
government advisers think this would risk submerging Bolivia's biggest
company into a foreign oil giant. So they are proposing a sale of a 20 per
cent stake to an investor that would manage the company, and the sale of 30
per cent to institutional investors in international financial markets. This
would maximise the long-term value of the 50 per cent of the company being
distributed to Bolivians, they say.
Leading international companies such as Exxon, Occidental Petroleum, Amoco
and Shell have shown keen interest in partnering YPFB, says Mr Revollo.
Newly-privatised Argentine oil company YPF is also likely to be interested.
'By smashing the anachronistic YPFB monopoly and introducing an attractive
fiscal regime for upstream activities, the 1990 hydrocarbons law set the
stage for aggressive oil and gas exploration by private companies both
foreign and national,' says Mr Herbert Muller, the former energy minister.
Now, on the way to capitalisation, the hydrocarbons law is again under
revision - in late October a twelfth draft sought still more 'agile
mechanisms that will stimulate investment', according to Mr Gonzalez. The
new law will require private companies and YPFB to sign hydrocarbons
contracts directly with the government.
Latest World Bank projections envisage a 12.5 per cent royalty for the
producer regions, a 19 per cent tax on production for existing
contract-holders, a 25 per cent corporate income tax and a 50 per cent
royalty on output from YPFB-operated fields. Industry, meanwhile, is
pressing hard to be able to write off exploration costs during the first
year of production.
Oil companies - mainly foreign - have to date signed a total of 16
exploration-operation contracts or embarked on joint ventures with YPFB. The
state company estimates its operations presently cover only 15 per cent of
Bolivia's oil and gas-bearing territory; joint operating contracts account
for another 22 per cent and 12 per cent is in the final negotiation stage.
'The rest is up for grabs,' says Mr Gonzalez.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (14): Elfec is a special case - Small
privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No fewer than 72 Bolivian state-owned companies out of a total of 160 will
come under the hammer in the next few months. Companies controlled by the
armed forces or local municipalities, and those directly dependent on
ministries remain untouched for the time being.
'The companies to be privatised are small to medium-sized so the transaction
costs involved make capitalising them unfeasible,' says Mr Jorge Harriague,
director of Bolivia's privatisation programme, the low-profile complement to
the government's ambitious capitalisation project.
'Their economic impact may be pretty marginal, but we have to privatise fast
and get the state out of commercial activities once and for all.'
Companies to be offered to private investors in straight sell-offs range
from run-down hotels to dairy plants, from animal feeds processing factories
to a small airline. The most expensive carries a price tag of about Dollars
12m, but many are virtually bankrupt and have book values of less than
Dollars 1m apiece. The whole package could fetch between Dollars 45m and
Dollars 55m, according to Mr Harriague.
Investor interest centres on half a dozen promising concerns. Hilanderia
Santa Cruz, a yarn producer which cost Dollars 50m to build, and a sugar
mill in Bermejo, top the list. The dairy plants in Santa Cruz, Cochabamba
and La Paz, plus two cement factories in Sucre and Tarija, are also expected
to be keenly contested.
Bolivian privatisation commenced under the previous administration of Jaime
Paz Zamora when 24 public companies dependent on the regional development
corporations were sold by auction. The modest proceeds - some Dollars 20m -
went, as the law requires, into social spending. Nine others were simply
liquidated. No sales have been made so far under the Sanchez de Lozada
government.
A special case is Elfec, the relatively efficient state-controlled
Cochabamba power distribution company. Ninety per cent of Elfec's shares,
worth some Dollars 32m, is scheduled for flotation on the London and La Paz
stock exchanges in the next few months.
'This will help kick-start the capitalisation programme; it's a significant
milestone in the development of Bolivia's capital markets,' says Mr Peter
Earl, a director of the Fieldstone Group of London, one of the architects of
the Elfec offer.
Elfec has had private shareholders ever since it was founded in 1908 by the
Bolivian Suarez family. Ende, the state electric energy producer en route to
capitalisation, presently holds 70 per cent of Elfec. The Cochabamba
municipality holds a further 22 per cent; smaller municipalities 4 per cent;
and the remainder is split among some 2,000 shareholders.
Ende and the city of Cochabamba are expected to dispose of the bulk of their
holdings. Cochabamba's city fathers plan to use the cash to embark upon a
long-delayed but increasingly urgent Misicuni project: to bore a tunnel
through the Andes and bring water from the Amazonian side of the cordillera
to the thirsty Cochabamba valley.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (12): Details under discussion - Enaf
metallurgical plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enaf-Vinto metallurgical smelter complex just east of Oruro, is close to
Bolivia's principal tin mines, Huanuni and Colquiri, owned by the state
mining company Comibol. Between them, the two produce some 7,000 tonnes of
tin concentrate a year - of a national total of about 18,000 tonnes.
Comibol officials expect tin concentrates output to rise to anything between
23,000 and 39,000 tonnes after Huanuni and Colquiri are transferred to the
private sector through joint venture or leasing agreements.
Vinto is a Comibol subsidiary. Because it was never nationalised, there is
no constitutional obstacle to transfer of ownership.
Rationalisation has cut the workforce sharply to about 1,000 from the
2,000-plus employed in the mid-80s while productivity in certain areas, such
as the tin smelter, has increased many times over.
The German government has donated DM10m for environmental control project.
The Vinto complex comprises three metallurgical plants, two for tin (high
grade and low grade) plus an antimony smelter. All came on stream in the
1970s.
The high-grade, German-built smelter uses the fuming process, which allows
treatment of complex concentrates such as Bolivia's in a single stage.
'Vinto is good business, it requires little new investment and enjoys a high
international reputation - the Enaf trade mark for 99.95 per cent pure tin
is known worldwide,' says Mr Carlos Morales, adviser to Comibol.
Antimony production was recommenced in mid-1990 after heavy operating losses
caused a 4 1/2 -year stoppage.
Bolivia has traditionally been the world's second-largest antimony producer
after China and ahead of the former Soviet Union and South Africa.
Output, at some 6,000 tonnes a year, is less than half of that produced a
decade ago, however.
An interesting item on Comibol's books is the Karachipampa lead and silver
smelter and refinery, built in the mining department of Potosi in the early
1980s by a German-Belgian consortium.
The complex cost Dollars 147m and installed capacity is for 51,000 tonnes of
concentrate a year.
Karachipampa was hammered by problems at its scheduled 1985 start-up.
Bolivian lead concentrate output slumped to levels inadequate to supply the
smelter, while the Soviet Kivcet technology used for the smelting process
was seriously questioned.
As a result, Karachipampa never went into operation.
The panorama is now somewhat brighter. Lead concentrate production is on the
increase with some 25,000 tonnes projected for next year; and the Kivcet
process has been given the metallurgical green light, with several western
countries now employing it.
According to Mr Morales, the plant's unused machinery and equipment has been
well maintained and is virtually ready to go.
The government has assumed all Karachipampa's debts. A private sector
operator would be free to enter into a joint venture or lease option for
Comibol lead-silver mines such as San Jose or San Vicente, or to buy from
private producers in the area.
Precise details of capitalisation are still under discussion.
The Vinto smelter and refineries could well be offered as separate packages
along with complementary Comibol mining deposits to ensure a raw materials
source.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (11): Cornerstone of reform programme -
Stephen Fidler explains the capitalisation process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada calls capitalisation the cornerstone of
his government's reform programme. It aims to shift companies responsible
for 12.5 per cent of Bolivia's gross domestic product to the private sector.
But the idea is not to sell the six state companies involved directly to
private buyers. It is to entice foreign investors to make investments in
them in return for ownership, typically, of half the company. The remaining
portion - apart from a small distribution to workers - will be distributed
to an estimated 3.8m Bolivians as pensions contributions.
This, it is hoped, will prevent opposition to the proposal from Bolivians
who - according to opinion polls - associate privatisation with a loss of
national sovereignty and corruption.
The idea is to stimulate investment and thereby boost growth. The government
estimates that these reforms should allow growth to rise steeply to 7 per
cent by 1999. Without this, and other reforms, it estimates growth of 4.7
per cent.
The proposal to capitalise, rather than privatise, has some disadvantages.
In the early years, rather than bolster government finances, it worsens them
 -because no revenues are received from the sale of the company. This risks
a short-term increase in the government's already heavy debt burden. Some
potential investors are also likely to see the mechanism as excessively
complicated.
The project has many hurdles still to overcome. A raft of legislation is
needed following the overall capitalisation law passed this year: laws to
establish an overall regulatory system for the capitalised companies, on the
electricity, telecommunications and hydrocarbons sectors, a tax reform,
adjustments to the mining code and a transportation reform are all required.
After this, a law for pension fund reform is needed. Opposition from
employees, trade unions and other interest groups must also be surmounted.
The government will lastly need to demonstrate financial success.
The keys are the first capitalisation, of the electricity company Ende and
of the oil company YPFB - alone responsible for 9 per cent of GDP. Officials
admit there may be difficulties in capitalising the state airline, the
railway and the mining assets.
However, the impression that many Bolivians have - that the public sector
companies are profitable and contribute to the budget is false, says Mr
Fernando Candia, the president of the central bank.
Although the companies run an operating surplus of about 0.8 per cent of
GDP, debt servicing costs are equal to 2.5 per cent of GDP, producing a net
deficit of 1.7 per cent.
The one-time costs associated with the capitalisation and other reforms will
raise the budget deficit in 1995 and 1996.
According to a Dollars 140m three-year loan agreement signed with the
International Monetary Fund last month, the deficit will rise to 4.4 per
cent of GDP next year, and closer to 5 per cent in 1996, from an expected
3.3 per cent this year.
Eventually it is hoped that increased tax revenues from the capitalised
companies will more than make up for the initial shortfall.
Mr Edgar Saravia, capitalisation secretary, says that the capitalisation
programme is about six weeks behind schedule, but believes that by July next
year, the first stage of the programme - the handover of the companies to
foreign operators - should be complete.
The remaining shares will be held in trust until the pension arrangements
can be established, to allow them to be distributed among every adult
Bolivian. This will not be an easy task, in part because the state has no
record of the names of a majority of its citizens.
The government agonised over whether to take the time to legislate the
reform - as the World Bank was urging - or whether to move more rapidly, as
the Argentine government had in its privatisation programme, by presidential
decree. 'Bolivia is not a country where people look at the outset to make
their investments. To the degree that we can give outside investors more
stability - for example through legislation - we think we will be more
successful,' said Mr Saravia.
Problems in establishing satisfactory regulation of the Argentine companies
after privatisation helped to persuade the government that it should first
establish regulatory regimes before the companies were moved to the private
sector.
Capitalisation will not necessarily stop with the sale of existing
companies. Mr Saravia says some of the money raised by the flotation of
Cochabamba Power and Light, now a subsidiary of the state electricity
company, Ende, will be used to start a long-awaited project to drill a
tunnel through the mountains to bring water to the parched city of
Cochabamba.
Foreign government donors were to be asked to consider matching the expected
Dollars 19m funding with a similar amount. Then, once the drilling is
complete - no private sector investor is likely to take on the drilling risk
 -the whole Misicuni project may be capitalised with a private sector
investor.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (12): Stakes cut gradually - Elections may
stall pace of state asset sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The momentum of the Finnish privatisation programme - stalled for so long by
the country's deep recession - has increased sharply in the last 12 months.
The government has sold out stakes in five companies, raising a total of
FM7.4bn both for itself and the companies concerned. The question is whether
the pace of the programme will be maintained after next March's general
elections when the Social Democrats look likely to return to power.
The Finnish privatisation programme has been a cautious one. Indeed,
privatisation is probably too strong a word for a process that is better
characterised as a broadening of ownership. The government has chosen to
reduce its stake gradually in a number of the country's biggest industrial
groups and, in most cases, it still retains more than 50 per cent of the
shares.
The companies themselves have been the main beneficiaries of the process,
garnering FM5.84bn out of the proceeds to strengthen their recession and
debt-weakened balance sheets. The government could have done with the funds
to reduce its budget deficit, but it is precisely because of budget
constraints that it has not been able to service the risk capital needs of
the companies itself.
Over the past 12 months, stakes have been sold in Outokumpu, the mining and
metals group; Rautaruukki, the steel producer; Valmet, the paper machinery
manufacturer, Kemira, the chemicals group, and Veitsiluoto, the pulp and
paper group.
In the case of Outokumpu, Rautaruukki and Valmet, which were already listed
companies, the targeted buyers have been domestic and international
institutions. With Veitsiluoto, on the other hand, an industry buyer was
preferred, which resulted in Enso-Gutzeit securing a 35 per cent stake for
FM1.5bn. Kemira was introduced via an initial public offering which raised
FM1.14bn and cut state ownership to 75 per cent.
The government is free to sell more shares in all five companies before it
reaches the limits of its parliamentary authorisation. Outokumpu is the only
member of the group where state ownership has already fallen below 50 per
cent.
Altogether, there are some 12 groups on the government's privatisation list,
including Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group; Enso-Gutzeit, the pulp
and paper group; Finnair, the national airline; and Imatran Voima, the big
energy company.
Some commentators believe that the state could have been more aggressive,
selling out more stakes earlier in the cyclical upturn which has favoured
the country's big exporters and driven the stock market up sharply in the
past two years.
But there are good reasons for the government's caution. One is Finland's
three-year long recession between 1991 and 1993 which dragged many companies
into the red and sent share values plunging. 'We have always had a very
company specific orientation,' says Mr Matti Vuoria, secretary-general of
Ministry of Trade and Industry.
Another consideration has been the small size of the domestic market which
could easily have been swamped if the government had been too ambitious.
The momentum of the process has shown no signs of abating. Indeed, one of
the most ambitious parts of the programme - a partial privatisation of
Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group - is likely to be next, possibly as
early as the spring of 1995. Neste has been valued at FM10bn, so that even
if only 20 per cent of the company is sold initially, it would be the
biggest Finnish privatisation so far.
In addition, the government is looking for parliamentary permission to
reduce its stake further in three other companies: Rautaruukki, Valmet and
Kemira.
A key question will be the attitude of the Social Democrats who, the polls
say, will return to power in general elections next March. They have been
less enthusiastic about the privatisation process than the current
centre-right administration and they could try to slow the process down.
International investors have played a crucial role in the privatisation
programme, largely because there has been too much stock for domestic
institutions to swallow and there has only been a limited retail element.
More than 50 per cent of the shares offered so far have been taken up by
foreigners.
This reliance on the international market has helped to drive up foreign
ownership of Finnish companies at a time when foreign buying has in any case
been heavy due to strong fundamentals and the 1993 liberalisation of rules
on foreign ownership. Today around 30 per cent of Finnish shares are in
foreign hands.
In some companies, the level is much higher. For example, more than 50 per
cent of Nokia, the high-flying telecommunications group which launched a
FM2.4bn share issue during the summer, is now foreign-owned. This prompted
the group to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the first
Finnish company to do so.
Some commentators worry that high foreign ownership levels and the
continuing privatisation programme could unsettle the development of the
stock market at a time when it is within striking distance of its 1989
all-time high.
A sudden withdrawal by foreigners could quickly cause the market to plunge
simply because domestic institutions could not handle it. This is what
happened in the Finnish bond markets earlier this year. The risk of
profit-taking in the equity market has been heightened by the strength of
the markka which has amplified dollar earnings.
With privatisation, the worry is one of over-loading. Mr Ari Lahti, managing
director of Protos Stockbrokers, says parliamentary authorisation exists for
a further FM11bn worth of privatisation excluding Neste. He argues that this
is too big a burden for the market to absorb in the short term, when the
total supply of cash from mutual funds, foreigners and domestic institutions
is unlikely to exceed FM18bn.
Mr Vuoria says foreign institutions will continue to play a crucial role
both in the privatisation process and the development of the stock exchange,
but he expects their interest to become 'more focused' and 'selective'. At
the same time, he believes the growing domestic interest in the country's
privatisation process will continue.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (11): Specialist shuns subsidies / Profile
of Masa-Yards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a moment in early 1993 when Mr Martin Saarikangas, president of
Masa-Yards, took on the status of national hero.
It was the day that Masa clinched a Dollars 1bn contract to build four
sophisticated liquefied natural gas carriers for the Abu Dhabi National Oil
Corporation, beating off intense competition from Japanese and European
yards. Hailed as Finland's biggest ever export order, its importance to the
country at the time could hardly have been greater, with the economy stuck
deep in recession and other industry stalwarts, such as the forestry
companies and Nokia, apparently still not on the path to recovery. The stock
market celebrated and tabloid newspapers suggested Mr Saarikangas should run
for the presidency.
The achievement was all the more remarkable because only a few years earlier
the yard had almost gone out of business with the bankruptcy of its former
owner, Wartsila Marine, in 1989. The Norwegian group, Kvaerner, eventually
came to the rescue, buying the yard for NKr700m in March 1991.
The purchaser is unlikely to have had any regrets about its move, given the
spectacular revival of Masa-Yards in the past three years. Its order book
has more than doubled to FM15bn, providing work for its 4,700 employees - at
yards in Helsinki and Turku - until the end of 1997.
Finland, with generally high wage costs, is not a natural home for
shipbuilding and it is therefore something of a surprise to find one of
Europe's biggest shipyards located there. Masa has managed to be successful,
even without the subsidies enjoyed by some of its competitors, because it
has concentrated on building up a strong position in a few niche,
technically-sophisticated areas.
Take cruise ships, for example. Here, the group has built up a 25 per cent
world market share through orders from leading operators such as Carnival
Cruise and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. The company currently has seven
cruise ships on order: two each from Carnival and RCCL, two from the German
operator DSR and one from the Japanese group NYK.
It has been a good industry for Masa to specialise in, given the average 10
per cent a year expansion of the cruise market over the past 10 years. Mr
Saarikangas is confident that the trend will continue. 'The Caribbean has
been the main focus of cruise market development so far; there is a great
deal of potential in other parts of the world,' he says.
LNG vessels are the company's other big speciality, with the Abu Dhabi order
alone giving it a 20 per cent market share. It has also penetrated other
niches including cable layers and ice-breakers, and hopes one day to build a
presence in the Arctic market for vessels trading in the icy waters of
northern Russia and Canada.
'We are not series-building ships like a lot of yards,' stresses Mr
Saarikangas, 'Our vessels are tailor-made.'
The group's results would seem to vindicate the strategy. Last year it
achieved a FM386.9m profit on turnover of FM2.76bn, the best figures in its
history. Return on investment has been around 25 per cent a year for each of
the last three years.
Mr Saarikangas dismisses suggestions that the yard's success has hinged on
the hefty devaluation of the Finnish markka since 1991. 'All our results
until now have been based on orders placed before the devaluation,' he
states.
Having said that, the weak markka was crucial to the yard's success in
winning the LNG contract and Mr Saarikangas is alarmed at the recent
strengthening of the currency. 'I am looking forward to the time when the
markka reaches its proper level, which is weaker than today,' he says.
Productivity improvements have been the other factor in the group's success.
Despite the big expansion in the Masa-Yards order books over the past few
years, the company employs 1,800 fewer people today than when Mr Saarikangas
took over. Although numbers have risen slightly from their lowest point, the
company's main response to its greater workload has been to increase
sub-contracting.
The impact of EU membership on the yard is likely to be limited. However, it
will gain access to EU research and development funds, and perhaps more
importantly, it will get a say in the community's shipbuilding policy.
Mr Saarikangas says the yard will certainly make its voice heard if
competitors are unduly favoured by subsidies and other state support. 'I
consider all kinds of subsidy unfair. You are not allowed to have drugs in
sport. Why should you have them in industry? I would like to have a doping
committee in industry,' he adds.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (10): Success stimulates - The gold
sector, from ore to earrings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold crops up in some of Bolivia's most unlikely-looking settings. The
promising Don Mario deposit, jointly owned by Billiton of the US and
Bolivia's Emusa, juts out starkly bare above the lush surrounding vegetation
of the eastern jungle. The rich Inti Raymi gold mine, Bolivian-run but now
majority owned by Battle Mountain of the US, lies on the barren plains of
the Altiplano, lifeless but for a few small herds of vicuna.
Inti Raymi claims to be South America's most modern and technically advanced
gold mine. It is also one of the largest, with 1994 output expected to top
300,000 ounces.
'It's acting as a magnet for other prospective investors,' says Mr Charles
Bruce of Mintec, a private mining consultancy which operates in Bolivia in
association with Minproc. Mr Bruce has been evaluating for clients more than
150 claims in Bolivia's western cordillera, hitherto neglected by miners. He
is 'convinced we'll see at least eight gold mines developed in this area.'
Bolivia's gold output, an estimated four tonnes in 1991, is already about
three times that now - 'and likely to triple again in another five years,'
says Mr Bruce.
Inti Raymi started back in 1982 as Bolivia's first small open-pit operation,
leaching oxides for gold and silver. By 1986, it was producing a relatively
modest 30,000 ounces of gold a year. But for Bolivians, accustomed to
traditional underground mining, Inti Raymi's technology already represented
a quantum leap.
Just two years ago, Battle Mountain increased its stake to 88 per cent. An
investment of Dollars 160m (including Dollars 40m each from the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Opic, plus Dollars 15m from CAF,
the Andean Development Corporation) permitted construction of an agitation
leaching plant and a vast 2.5km-diameter tailings dam designed by Knight
Piesold.
With 2.3 grams of gold per tonne of ore and production costs at Dollars 220
an ounce, Inti Raymi is attractive business. In this, its first full year of
operation, sales are expected to top Dollars 105m. Next year, a new recovery
plant will boost output to some 320,000 ounces.
Inti Raymi's success has helped stimulate investor interest in Bolivian
gold. In early October, three foreign companies won concessions for a total
of 175,000ha of potentially attractive gold deposits, owned but never
developed by state mining company Comibol, in Bolivia's western cordillera.
One section went to American Barrick, another to La Barca (a Battle Mountain
joint venture with Emusa) and the third to Samex, a new Canadian-Bolivian
joint venture. The three beat off bids from Auspac of Australia, and Orvana,
Echo Bay and Teck, all of Canada.
The other facet of Bolivia's incipient gold bonanza is hundreds of
kilometres from the ore deposits. Perched above the modern city of La Paz
lies a sprawling, often ramshackle town known simply as 'El Alto': the
heights. Most of El Alto's inhabitants are country folk, escaping the
crushing poverty of the barren Altiplano.  Many of them are miners and their
families, refugees from the mid-1980s tin crisis which threw tens of
thousands out of work.
Set amidst tyre repair shops and small grocery stores, down an unsurfaced
side-road, is El Alto's response to the unemployment problem: a collection
of buildings where 400 youngsters make gold jewellery for export. This year,
this company, Orbol, will export bracelets, earrings and gold chains worth
nearly Dollars 100m.
Located in the nearby industrial free zone of El Alto is Christies, a joint
venture between Bolivian entrepreneur Ms Christina Leon and Italian
jewellery makers Gori &amp; Zucchi. Christies employs some 600 in its main
factory with another 1,400 outworkers in surrounding villages who
painstakingly thread tiny links for gold chain necklaces.
'Gold jewellery has been an enormous success story,' says Mr Carlos Morales,
trade and industry minister. In the first half of 1994 alone, exports in
this category earned Bolivia Dollars 53.8m, more than three times the
revenue for the same period last year. And most of that comes from a handful
of factories and small workshops in La Paz.
Orbol started operations almost six years ago. The initial stimulus came
from the 'Ritex' law which allows temporary duty-free import of goods to be
re-exported under the 'maquila' process.
'At first, we imported 100 per cent of our gold as wire from the US,
transformed it into jewellery and re-exported,' says Mr Jesus Sillerico,
general manager. 'Now we're buying 85 per cent of our gold locally from
small producers and co-operatives. Most of that used to leave Bolivia as
contraband with no benefit to the country.'
Orbol's gold jewellery is aimed at mass market, distributed through some 40
wholesalers mostly within the US. The gold is lightweight and hollow but
workmanship is good quality. At start-up, Orbol brought in craftsmen from
Mexico and Peru to train locals.
Orbol and a handful of similar outfits now employ thousands of Bolivians,
almost all young, often straight from the countryside and in their first
jobs. Working conditions are unsophisticated but relaxed and workers are
apparently content with the Dollars 100-Dollars 120 they can take home each
month.
Mr Sillerico says that even at these wages, profit margins are slim. The tax
drawback system, he says, returns to exporters the equivalent of 5.4 per
cent of sales; profits are maybe 1.5 per cent.
'We're doing what the country needs most - providing work and earning
foreign exchange,' he says. 'But we couldn't survive without incentives. The
jewellery export business will continue as long as the government doesn't
change the rules of the game.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (9): Minerals have always been a mainstay
 -The mining industry is undergoing a series of profound changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Bolivian mining is undergoing a series of profound changes - in the types of
minerals extracted, in production techniques and in patterns of ownership.
Minerals have always been a mainstay of the Bolivian economy, but successive
price collapses affecting silver, tin and antimony drove minerals exports
down to less than one third of Bolivian foreign exchange earnings in 1986.
Today, with zinc and gold output increasing rapidly, minerals again account
for almost half of export revenue: some Dollars 380m last year.
An estimated 80,000 Bolivians still depend on mining for their livelihoods,
some of them literally scratching ore from narrow veins in underground
shafts with long, primitive nails. But the open-cast mines and heap-leaching
techniques being introduced by foreign concerns in joint ventures with
Bolivians point to a different mining future.
'Eight years ago, no one would touch Bolivia,' says Mr Charles Bruce, chief
executive officer of local mining consultancy Mintec. 'Even in 1991, there
were only four foreign companies operating here: now there are 40.'
Simultaneously, the state is rapidly withdrawing from productive mining
activities. While mining giant Comibol was responsible in its 1980-85 heyday
for about two-thirds of all Bolivia's tin and zinc output, by last year its
share had fallen to 35 and 20 per cent respectively.
Comibol's smelters and refineries are on the capitalisation list. Mines,
deposits and exploration areas, meanwhile, are being made available to
private investors either via leasing contracts or joint ventures with
Comibol to get round constitutional restraints on ownership transfer of
nationalised assets.
Only three of Comibol's mines are operational: Huanuni, Colquiri and
Caracoles. Continuing losses obliged the remainder to be closed down.
Comibol's workforce, which peaked at almost 30,000 in 1984, has been cut
back severely - mainly in the second half of the 1980s - to some 2,500, of
whom more than 1,000 are employed at the Vinto smelter complex. Cash flow is
now positive.
Comibol's most attractive opportunities are in the department of Oruro, on
the altiplano south of La Paz. Largest is the Huanuni tin deposit near the
town of Oruro, originally owned by Bolivian tin magnate Simon Patino.
Despite its already-long life, Huanuni has some 8m tonnes of proven and
inferred reserves and mining experts consider prospects for further finds
bright.
Colquiri has good unexploited zinc reserves along with its tin. And the
polymetallic San Jose mine, non-operational since mid-1992, could also prove
an interesting prospect for zinc and gold; its traditional lead-silver
concentrates will acquire new worth if and when the Karachipampa smelter is
finally started up.
Comsur (Bolivia's largest mining concern, owned by the Sanchez de Lozada
family and now in association with Rio Tinto Zinc) will be the first private
company to commence joint production with Comibol. Comsur-RTZ has put up
Dollars 15.8m for a lead-zinc concentrator at Comibol's under-exploited
Bolivar deposit. Profits from the 15,000 tonnes of concentrate, the
projected output from next year onwards, will be split 50-50.
'We've found Comibol to be very good partners,' says Comsur's CEO Mr John
MacLean. 'Reserves are better than expected; we're on budget and on time.'
Part of the attraction for foreign companies is the modern 1991 mining code
which guarantees equal treatment for foreign and national companies and free
remittances of profits abroad.
Foreigners may now also - in joint ventures with Bolivians - explore and
develop the previously prohibited but potentially rich zones within 50km of
Bolivia's borders.
The code is being further modified to improve the present chaotic claims
procedures and to clarify certain elements of tax law. Mr Gonzalo
Barrientos, under-secretary of mining, is confident that these provisions
and promotion of joint ventures with Comibol will boost minerals exports
earnings to Dollars 800m within five years - 'and that's without factoring
in new exploration,' he says.
In the brave new world of Bolivian mining, traditional tin and tungsten have
a declining role: tin earned just Dollars 83m last year, down from the 1981
peak of Dollars 266m (even though gross production is little changed). Zinc,
however, is on an upward path: last year's sales of Dollars 120m represented
16 per cent of total Bolivian export earnings. And revenue from gold should
outstrip zinc by next year.
To date, exploration has been restricted to the so-called 'Cordillera Real',
the traditional silver and tin-mining zone. But new companies, in search of
precious metals, are concentrating on the western Cordillera and the
pre-Cambrian and greenstone belts east towards the Brazilian borders.
Among other diversification possibilities, Bolivian miners are once again
talking seriously about developing their iron reserves. 'El Mutun' is a
40,000m tonne deposit - one of the world's largest - with between 30 and 50
per cent iron. It is located in Bolivia's Busch province, some 600km east of
Santa Cruz on the border with Brazil.
El Mutun's potential has been known for decades but development has been
limited to small-scale open-pit exploitation due to local power and
transport problems. All operations are presently suspended.
A Brazilian-Japanese consortium, however, is reviving a large-scale
exploitation project. And the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi)
has recently proposed construction of iron and steel plants nearby to serve
Bolivia and export to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (10): Pulp and paper near peak - Nobody
cares if the country relies on its forests when things go well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of the Finnish economy are inextricably linked to the health of
the country's pulp and paper sector. It is no accident that both are pulling
strongly out of a slump at the same time. Forestry accounts for 36 per cent
of Finnish exports and its success has done much to promote the country's
export-driven revival over the past two years.
This overdependence on one industry is widely acknowledged but critics find
it harder to make their case when things are going well. And, right now,
things are going well.
In 1994 the Finnish pulp and paper sector will produce total profits of
about FM5bn - a massive improvement on last year's break-even level. At the
eight-month stage the country's four big quoted forestry groups, Repola,
Kymmene, Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, produced combined pre-tax profits of
FM2.9bn, compared with a loss of FM64m in the same 1993 period.
Although combined operating profits at FM5.52bn were higher than FM4.49bn in
1993, the major component of the improvement has been a reduction in
financial costs. Debts are lower, average interest rates are down, and there
have not been any big currency losses.
At the operating level, a number of conflicting influences are at work. On
the positive side, demand has risen strongly, driving up operating rates,
and prices are increasing across all product lines. On the negative side,
there has been a significant strengthening of the markka and wood and waste
paper costs have risen sharply.
Pulp and fine paper producers will undoubtedly benefit, with pulp prices up
80 per cent and fine paper prices around 50 per cent higher. But in other
product lines - publication papers, for example - the stronger markka and
higher costs will outweigh the impact of increased demand and prices,
leaving earnings in markka terms lower than in 1993.
Even so, there is no doubt that the pulp and paper sector is on the way to
its next cyclical peak. Finland with its modern machines, its value-added
emphasis, its stringent cost-cutting during the downturn and its still weak
currency, is well positioned to benefit.
Mr Jarl Kohler, head of the Finnish forest industries federation, cautions
against over-optimism, saying profits this year will still fall short of the
FM7bn level which he calls 'normal'. Past experience shows that gains can
easily be squandered, he warns.
It is a question both of costs and strategy. Can companies keep wood costs
down? Can they keep wages down? Will they restrict investment?
The 1991-92 downturn in the Finnish forestry sector was undoubtedly
exacerbated by a huge corporate investment spree in the late 1980s which
drove debt up sharply. Companies invested as much as 20 per cent of their
annual turnover to create the world's biggest and most modern paper and
board machines. When the markka fell by 30 per cent between 1991 and 1993,
the cost of servicing the foreign portion of the debt rose sharply.
The situation is improving rapidly due to consolidation, increased cash flow
and reduced investment. But debt as a percentage of turnover is still around
75 per cent - down from a peak of 110 per cent but still higher than rivals
in Canada and Sweden.
'The Finnish companies' most important task is to get their capital
structure in a better condition. Debts must be paid back,' says Professor
Eero Artto of the Helsinki School of Economics.
However, it remains to be seen whether the big companies have learned their
lesson. Ironically, the late 1980s investment programmes, widely castigated
as over-ambitious at the bottom of the cycle, are now giving the Finns a
real competitive advantage. Will they be tempted to go on another binge?
So far, the signs are encouraging. Most current investment programmes
involve upgrading and are designed to ease bottlenecks and add value rather
than increase capacity. A significant exception is a FM3bn project to build
a new pulp mill at Rauma in the west of the country.
In any case the constraints will be greater. Greater levels of foreign
ownership mean company strategies are being viewed more critically, says Mr
Jukka Huuskonen, a forestry analysts with Protos Securities. He believes EU
membership will force companies to keep costs under control to remain
competitive. In the longer term, EU membership will take Finland along the
path to monetary union so it will be unable to devalue its currency (as it
has in the past) simply to rescue its forestry sector.
There is, on the other hand, a strong chance that expansion will come
through acquisition rather than investment. Enso-Gutzeit has just agreed to
buy a 35 per cent stake in Veitsiluoto, the country's fifth largest pulp and
paper group, for FM1.5bn, in a move which significantly strengthens its
operations in fine papers and light-weight coated (LWC) magazine paper.
The move in effect involves a switching of assets between one arm of the
state and another as the state owns 91 per cent of Veitsiluoto and 52 per
cent of the votes in Enso. Logic suggests Enso will acquire the state's
remaining stake in Veitsiluoto as and when the government decides to sell.
A much bigger merger involving Finland's two biggest forestry groups, United
Paper Mills (the main unit in Repola) and Kymmene, was almost clinched
during the summer. This would have created a company as big as Stora, the
Swedish group which is currently Europe's largest pulp and paper producer.
The plan is understood to have foundered because Kymmene's main owners were
unhappy with the valuation placed on the company. Rumours have since
circulated that the deal might be revived, although there have also been
suggestions that the two companies are seeking other partners.
A big question will be whether Finnish groups seek to expand at home or
abroad. Already 26 per cent of the forestry industry's production capacity
is based abroad - most of it in Europe near the big markets and sources of
recycled material. There was always a danger that more investments would
have been directed towards Europe if the country had voted to stay outside
the EU.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (8): Liberal who may be next prime
minister / Profile of Paavo Lipponen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the opinion polls prove correct, Finland's next prime minister will be Mr
Paavo Lipponen, the personable and pragmatic leader of the Social Democratic
party (SDP).
The Social Democrats were the losers in the last general election in 1991,
winning just 22 per cent of the national vote. The government was formed by
the Centre party led by Mr Esko Aho, now prime minister, which surged ahead
to win 25 per cent of the vote and forged a coalition with the Conservative
party - which had been in coalition with the SDP - and the small Swedish
People's party and the Christian League.
But under the leadership of Mr Lipponen, who took over from Mr Ulf Sundqvist
as party leader last year, the SDP has consolidated a rebound in the polls
which has shown the party winning well over 30 per cent support throughout
this year.
With the incumbent government, suffering in popularity because of the deep
recession and high unemployment, the Social Democrats are now widely
expected to lead the new government after the election due in March next
year. At this stage, the party is reluctant to speculate on the shape of an
SDP-led coalition - which could include either or both the Centre and
Conservative parties. But the one certainty is that it would be headed by Mr
Lipponen.
A political scientist and journalist by profession, 53-year old Mr Lipponen
is a Social Democrat who, like many of his left-of-centre colleagues in
Europe, has moved his party significantly away from old-style western
European socialism to embrace market reforms to achieve a 'citizen's
society'. A keen advocate of Finnish membership of the European Union, he
summed up his position in an article published during the EU referendum
campaign.
'An efficient market economy adhering within the context of the EU to the
basic values of Nordic welfare states will produce a better society of
citizens in Finland,' he wrote.
In an interview for this survey, Mr Lipponen explained his approach further.
'I am a liberal in the sense that I believe people have really suffered
because of a lack of competition. We need a real paradigm change. Ours has
been an economy of big companies, big co-operatives, big banks, big
wholesale companies and, if you like, big government. There hasn't been a
role for a citizen's society.'
His remedy for unemployment, the country's biggest political and social
problem, is therefore unequivocally reformist. He readily accepts that his
aim is to foster a more entrepreneurial climate in Finland. 'Yes,
absolutely,' he says. 'It is a question of getting unemployment down. The
public sector cannot employ more people and the export sector is already
efficient. So it is mainly in the small service companies that future
employment will come. We have to get more flexibility and reduce labour
costs - and social security costs.'
But if Mr Lipponen's message contains elements more familiar from the
right-of-centre in recent years, he still offers a distinct policy change
from the present government. He is especially critical of the coalition's
record on unemployment, saying the failure to provide training schemes for
more than one-fifth of the almost 500,000 unemployed has been a 'waste of
human capital'.
He attacks the government's protection of Finland's highly subsidised
farmers and the maintainance of subsidies to industry - especially the big
and once again profitable forestry industry. These are areas where he
believes savings can be made to help trim Finland's budget deficit and
control a state debt set to reach the equivalent of 70 per cent of gross
domestic policy next year.
His approach is also to defend the basic structure of the country's welfare
system which, like those of neighbouring Sweden and Norway, far exceeds most
in Europe in the extent of benefits it offers. His intention is to carry
vital interest groups such as the trade unions with him when it comes to
reforms by involving them in the changes. 'I'm sure the elected members of
the trade unions know what is needed. It is just that they need to feel the
policies are fair and just.'
As prime minister, Mr Lipponen would play a key role - along with President
Martti Ahtisaari - in framing Finland's positions in the EU's vital 1996
Intergovernmental Conference on the future shape of the union. A former head
of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, he is at ease - but
cautious - in discussing such tricky topics.
'Finland should not take any dogmatic line in the debate between the
federalists and the anti-federalists. That way we would lose our influence,'
he says. 'European Monetary Union has to come sooner or later and if it
comes you need greater political integration. But there is a need to
guarantee the influence of national parliaments. Subsidiarity should be made
to work.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (9): Agriculture faces shake-up - The
likely impact of joining Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavily protected and generously subsidised for years, Finnish agriculture
has looked ripe for a shake-up for a long time. The crunch will finally come
on January 1 with European Union membership.
Producer prices will fall by as much as 50 per cent in an overnight
alignment with European levels. There will be compensation, but average
incomes will still fall by at least 10 per cent. In the longer term, as
transitional payments are phased out, the pain will increase, threatening a
big wave of restructuring in three to five years' time.
With this sort of future ahead, it is not surprising that farmers were at
the heart of the campaign against Finnish EU membership. Their economic
argument was relatively weak - after all, farmers account for only 7 per
cent of the working population and as little as 2.5 per cent of gross
domestic product. What counted far more were the psychological and political
factors.
Psychologically, the farmers benefited from the Finnish population's strong
attachment to the countryside - 35 per cent of the country's inhabitants
still live in rural areas - and a security-related reluctance to see large
areas of the country being depopulated.
Politically, they were helped by the fact that the Centre party, the
dominant power in the centre-right coalition government, has traditionally
drawn much of its support from rural areas.
The irony is that despite the importance Finland gave to agriculture in its
EU negotiations - no other issue received greater emphasis - the farmers
ended up getting a deal which even EU supporters felt could have been
better. The Finns complain that this was partly because neighbouring Sweden,
which radically overhauled its farm support system in 1990, did not make an
issue out of agriculture in its own EU accession talks.
Finland's settlement allows it to provide farming support over a five-year
transitional period in return for accepting immediate price alignment. Next
year's aid will be worth around FM5.65bn, FM1.8bn less than would be needed
to make up the entire income shortfall.
The immediate adjustment to EU prices, together with the scrapping of import
controls, is one of the main grievances of the MTK, the farmers' union. The
MTK believes a transitional regime, with prices being lowered gradually over
a five-year period, would have helped farmers to adapt and plan ahead.
Its second complaint is over the way the country has been carved up into
different areas qualifying for different amounts of support. Around 53 per
cent of the country's arable land qualifies for assistance under a special
'Nordic' category, while 85 per cent has been designated a so-called Less
Favourable Area (LFA). Both areas qualify for subsidies on top of normal EU
price support. Excluded, however, from either category is 15 per cent of the
country in the south, where most of the country's cereal and vegetable
production is based.
According to Mr Antti Haavisto, MTK director of trade policy, the
designations are completely arbitrary. 'Neither line has any justification
in terms of agricultural conditions. It's a lottery,' he argues.
The situation is unfair, say the Finns, because thousands of farms in more
productive areas of the EU further south are treated more generously since
they are part of LFAs. The MTK says a farm in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany,
with an average yield of 6.8 tonnes per hectare, could end up getting three
times the support available to a farmer in southern Finland, where the yield
is 3.1 tonnes.
The final grievance is the uncertainty that still remains. Even though the
overall sums have been agreed and a general payment mechanism outlined, it
is still not clear how much individual farmers will receive and when. Part
of the reason for the delay is that the package has to be approved by the
European Commission. If it is rejected, the farmers frustration will only
grow further.
Mr Mikko Pesala, agriculture minister and a member of the Centre party, is
confident of EU backing. But, acknowledging the uncertainty, he says his
'top priority is to ensure the national support measures are applied in
January'.
The transitional support measures should cushion farmers from the worst
effects of the abrupt changes, at least initially. However, life for farmers
in the south of the country could become very much tougher towards the end
of the transitional period if Finland cannot grant them support under
article 141 of the commission's code covering serious economic hardship.
This has still to be negotiated.
In any case, it is hard to believe there would not have been a clampdown on
agricultural support, even if Finland had remained outside the EU. Many feel
that farmers have been cossetted at the taxpayer's expense for too long and
they will be glad to see food prices fall. Domestic budgetary pressures
would almost certainly have forced the issue - sooner rather than later, if
Finland had rejected EU membership and the farmers were blamed.
The point is that everyone expects the number of farms to shrink as the
sector consolidates towards the end of the decade. Mr Pesala says he expects
the number of farms to fall to 70,000 within 10 years from 120,000 today, at
the same time as the average farm size rises from 20 to 30 hectares. He
hopes those who stay the course will be able to compensate for the drop in
their incomes through lower costs and advantages of scale.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (7): Face-lift is overdue - Sally Bowen
examines the infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of neglect, the vital 500km road link between the rich
agricultural flatlands of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba in the central
cordillera is being repaired. Along the highway, caterpillar trucks and
bulldozers - many belonging to Brazilian road-builders Andrade Gutierrez and
Odebrecht under Bolivian government contracts - are shovelling, levelling
and asphalting. Flood-damaged bridges are being re-fashioned; new ones
built.
The country's road system is getting a face-lift, and not before time.
Historically, according to Mr Lucio Paz, transport minister, Bolivia's road
and rail system has been the prime obstacle to national economic
development. Only 4 per cent of the country's 43,000km of roads is
asphalted; more than three-quarters are virtually unusable for six rainy
months each year.
Now that Bolivia's development plans hinge on becoming a strategic hub for
the South American continent, transport is a high priority. The ministry's
ambitious brief is to build 2,700km of roads within the next five years - at
an estimated cost of Dollars 1.9bn - as well as improving and asphalting
many of the existing land connections.
'Our road communications are a hundred years behind our telecommunications,'
says Mr Paz. 'Unless we can make a dramatic leap forward, investors simply
won't come to Bolivia.' Road improvements could cut high Bolivian transport
costs by as much as 50 per cent, he says.
Underlining this message is the rapidly improving condition of the road
between Chile's port of Arica (presently the principal route for Bolivia's
imports and exports) and La Paz. By late next year, travelling time will
have shrunk from as much as six days in bad weather conditions to six hours.
With the decline in relative importance of minerals transportation, and the
boom in soya and other agricultural exports, roads rather than railways have
become the focus of attention for Bolivia's planners. Officials hope to
leave the new investor-operator of soon-to-be capitalised state railways
company Enfe to resolve the problems of upgrading, boosting standards and
investing in the vital 'missing link' between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.
But road-building is costly. One Bolivian kilometre can cost Dollars 300,000
on the flat eastern plains and Dollars 1m or more on a mountainous stretch.
The government has some Dollars 280m in its present annual budget for roads,
'but we need to find new sources of financing construction,' says Mr Paz.
One plan is to hive off as concessions certain potentially profitable
sections to private companies which would build, collect tolls and maintain
highways.
Bolivia's rugged terrain means that efficient air links are essential. Many
of the 37 airports are rudimentary: only 10 have tarmac and just two (La Paz
and Santa Cruz) are classified as international. By the end of 1996, the
government plans to have 17 more provincial landing strips surfaced and
their infrastructure improved.
The government of Japan, meanwhile, is donating Dollars 30m to re-equip the
capital's El Alto airport, extend the runways, upgrade lighting and improve
communications and traffic control systems. Japan has also helped out with
road-building equipment and seven bridges to link primarily Japanese
agricultural colonies in Santa Cruz department to main highways.
'We're knocking on everyone's door for financing,' says Mr Paz. He has
Dollars 12m in the bag from the Inter-American Development Bank to upgrade
the road link from La Paz to the Peruvian frontier at Desaguadero, thus
opening up access to the as-yet undeveloped free port facilities and coastal
strip granted by Peru to Bolivia in Ilo.
In the other direction, an international tender will soon be sought for
upgrading the 640km dirt road eastwards from Santa Cruz to San Matias on the
Brazilian border.
This will open the way for thousands of tonnes of soya beans from the Mato
Grosso in south-west Brazil to cross the continent through Bolivia for
eventual shipment to Asia through Peruvian or Chilean Pacific seaports.
Also arousing the enthusiasm of top-level politicians and planners is the
so-called 'hidrovia', a 2,700km Paraguay-Parana waterway system which
provides a link between landlocked Bolivia's Puerto Suarez, a river port on
the frontier with Brazil, and the River Plate estuary.
Initial investment - in dredging the shallow upper reaches and providing
proper signalling so that barges may also move cargo by night  - is
estimated at about Dollars 11m. These improvements, say analysts, will cut
transport time in half and slash the high costs (between Dollars 15 and
Dollars 18 a tonne) between Bolivia and Buenos Aires. Financing has already
been offered by the IADB and the UN Development Programme.
A totally new port is also planned at Puerto Busch, on the Paraguay river
and some 140km south of existing Puerto Suarez. The state will build the
road, say government officials, and leave private enterprise to develop port
facilities. The European Union, and in particular the Belgian government,
has offered assistance.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (8): A cherished ambition - Richard Bauer
assesses Bolivia's role as an energy exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BAUER

<TEXT>
Bolivians are sloughing off their century-old dismay at being landlocked.
Suddenly, the condition is perceived as a positive asset. 'We aim to become
the natural gas distribution hub for the southern cone of Latin America,'
says Mr Mauricio Gonzalez, president of the state-owned petroleum company
YPFB.
Mr Claude Besse, adviser to the government on the capitalisation of state
power company Ende, is in equally optimistic and expansionist mood. 'We want
to use our geographical position to satisfy growing demand for electric
energy in surrounding countries which have poor supply and high prices,' he
says.
The idea of serving both as an energy 'bridge' and exporting gas and
electricity to its neighbours has become a Bolivian leitmotiv.
'Macro-economic stability and the possibilities of sustained growth depend
in large measure on the health of the hydrocarbons sector,' says Mr Herbert
Muller, the former Bolivian energy minister who helped engineer the
ground-breaking February 1993 gas export agreement with Brazil. 'The
projected gas pipeline will be the engine for Bolivia's economic growth.'
Bolivia's proven natural gas reserves of 6-7 trillion cubic feet are enough
to meet south-west Brazil's energy needs for the next decade, says Mr Fred
Drew of the Santa Cruz office of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian gas
exploration and production specialists. Bolivian gas output has been steady
at about 500m cu ft a day for the past 12 years.
Hydro-electric generation, meanwhile, has scarcely been touched. Presently,
only 2 per cent of an estimated 18,000MW potential is exploited.
Possibilities for cheap hydro projects abound, according to Mr Julio Leon
Prado, founder and president of ICE, Bolivia's largest construction company.
He believes local construction costs will be substantially lower than in
neighbouring countries.
For 22 years past, Bolivia has exported 200m cu ft a day of natural gas to
Argentina via a 600km, 24-inch pipeline originally co-financed by the World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the New York State Common
Retirement Fund (NYSCRF). The contract expired in 1992 but delivery
continues uninterrupted at Dollars 1 per 1mBtu despite recent Argentine
deregulation and competition from the local hydrocarbons industry.
But Bolivia's cherished ambition is to break into the huge Brazilian market.
For years, it has been thwarted by internal squabbles within Bolivian
governing elites on the one side and protectionist, oil-burning Brazilian
state industry on the other. Now, the two state hydrocarbons companies, YPFB
and Petrobras, have reached a 20-year sales purchase agreement.
Initially, YPFB will supply 280m cu ft a day rising to 560m cu ft within
seven years. But Brazilian demand for natural gas could well increase to
1,500 cu ft a day by the year 2000 and 2,300 cu ft by 2005, says Mr
Gonzalez.
He predicts: 'There will be Bolivian gas in Sao Paolo by the end of 1997'.
The projected 32-inch 1,800km pipeline will run from Bolivia's Rio Grande to
Campinhas, 90km west of Sao Paulo. In a second stage, a 420km, 22-inch line
would serve the town of Curitiba. And Petrobras plans another 570km line
running south from Curitiba to Puerto Alegre.
Brazilian-Bolivian negotiating tensions were relaxed by President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada's personal intervention in August. Now Petrobras will have
only a 15 per cent stake in the 560km Bolivian section and 80 per cent in
the Brazilian stretch of the pipeline. YPFB will have 85 per cent of its
home stretch and 20 per cent of the Brazilian end.
Bolivia's partner on both sides of the border will be Texas-based Enron,
which has a 40 per cent stake in the YPFB participation. Petrobras,
meanwhile, has gone into association with the 'BTB' Group, which holds 25
per cent of the holding for the Brazilian side. 'BTB' comprises BHP, US
natural gas company Tenneco and the experienced distributors British Gas.
Biggest nuts still to crack are finalising finance for the Dollars
2bn-Dollars 2.6bn project, the largest of its kind ever in Latin America,
and fixing the gas price. The World Bank, meanwhile, still appears reluctant
to commit itself to a venture where Petrobras, a state-owned company, holds
the majority stake.
Industry sources, however, say the pipeline will easily secure private
sector financing provided there are adequate guarantees against political
risk - particularly against a possible Petrobras pull-out.
Analysts say Bolivia could deliver gas to Sao Paulo at a highly competitive
rate of les than Dollars 2 per 1mBtu, half the ceiling price it would cost
to ship Venezuelan or Nigerian liquefied gas to the region. Bolivia's
negotiating position as a purveyor of clean natural gas has been
strengthened since the 1992 Rio 'earth summit' boosted ecological awareness
in badly-polluted Sao Paulo, according to Mr Muller.
A Bolivian government adviser points out another crucial factor: 'The
Brazilians have realised that, without Bolivian gas, they'll be suffering
energy brown-outs in two or three years.'
A similar project for exporting gas to northern Chile is in an advanced
stage of planning. The 1,100km Villa Montes-to-Antofagasta pipeline could
start delivering to one of Chile's main mining regions by early 1997. A
20-year agreement in principle has been signed between YPFB and Enap,
Chile's state oil company.
YPFB has entered a joint venture with BHP. The two will split equally a 90
per cent stake in constructing and operating the pipeline, while Enap will
take the remaining 10 per cent. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has been
selected as financial adviser.
While gas exports to Argentina are already two decades old, and new ventures
with Brazil and Chile are presently top priority, exporting electrical
energy from Bolivia would be a complete innovation. The idea apparently
sprang up only recently when state power company Ende was being offered to
foreign investors.
'We were told our tiny, 750MW internal market is not attractive enough for
overseas bidders,' says Mr Gonzalo Chavez of the energy ministry. 'Investors
are seeking opportunities to convert Bolivia into a major electrical energy
distributor for the southern cone.'
Mr Fernando Campero, a former industry minister and now chief executive
officer of Saxxon Capital, a Bolivian stockbrokerage, is more sceptical
about this late-in-the-day brainwave. 'They invented the scheme of
electrical energy exports to speed up Ende's capitalisation but without
proper feasibility studies,' he says.
Other experts fear that electricity exports may directly compete with
natural gas in little-developed markets.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (7): The bad news may be over - The
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's battered banks are still struggling to overcome the huge credit
losses which engulfed them two years ago. But though the path to recovery is
long and hard, the banks are sticking to their forecasts of a return to
profit next year or in 1996 at the latest.
Overall, the Finnish Bankers' Association expects the sector's total losses
in 1994 to be about two-thirds of the FM13bn deficit run up in 1993 - which
was in turn a sharp improvement on the worst year, 1992, when losses
exceeded FM20bn.
This year has been a frustrating one. In the early months, there was a burst
of optimism as interest rates tumbled and Finland's economy began to emerge
from severe recession. But a jump in long-term interest rates over the
summer, the resultant turbulence in bond markets and additional credit
losses slowed down the banks' recov- ery process.
Finland's banks fell victims to a wicked combination of circumstances in the
early 1990s. The recession, which hit elsewhere in Europe, was deepened by
the loss of the country's big trade with the Soviet Union. The slump
exploded a frantic credit boom which had been fuelled by financial
deregulation. As interest rates shot up and asset values collapsed, hundreds
of companies were forced into bankruptcy, particularly in real estate,
construction, trading and tourism.
By the end of 1993, the banks as a whole had non-performing assets of
FM53bn, only slightly less than a year earlier. This was after write-offs of
FM16.5bn - equivalent to 5.2 per cent of average balance sheets. In 1992,
the banks had been forced to write off FM22bn.
Most leading figures in the banking sector say the worst is now over. Mr
Pertti Voutil- ainen, chairman of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading
commercial bank, summed up the position facing his bank: 'I think we have
come to the situation where we know where we stand. The worst risks have
already been written off, so when the economy gets better - and it has
turned around - that will help us to return to profit.'
But KOP's own difficulties this year highlight how heavily the banks are
still burdened by credit losses - and how vulnerable they are to unex-
pected twists in the economy.
KOP announced a new bad loan charge of FM800m in its eight-month results,
triggered by problems in the construc- tion company Puolimatka. This pushed
credit losses in the period up to FM1.67bn, not far below last year's loss
at the same stage of FM1.96bn. Meanwhile, a FM150m loss in bond trading
helped push net income from financial operations down 7 per cent to
FM1.48bn.
Overall, KOP's operating losses in the first eight months rose to FM1.3bn
from FM869m. The bank has been forced into a further round of fundraising to
strengthen a capital base drained far beyond the expectations of most share-
holders. It has launched a FM2bn share issue and the sale of FM1bn in assets
this autumn, on top of share issues last year worth FM2bn and hefty bonds
issues.
In the case of Unitas, the main rival to KOP, credit losses rose by FM137m
in the first eight months to FM1.82bn compared with the same period last
year, due mainly to the collapse earlier in the year of two companies - a
construction group called Haka and Eka, a retail and wholesale group.
But, like KOP, Unitas insists that all the bad news is now known and
accounted for. The bank says credit losses in the last four months of the
year will be sufficiently reduced to make overall loan losses for the year
less than those of last year. Unitas expects to halve last year's overall
pre-tax loss of FM2.57bn and hopes to break even in 1995. KOP still
forecasts a profit in 1995.
Although borrowing demand remains low in Finland, Mr Vesa Vainio, the
president of Unitas, believes the country's return to significant growth -
GNP is expected to rise by 5 per cent next year - and its entry into the
European Union will trigger more investment. 'We are still on the track we
estimated,' says Mr Vainio. 'I am quite confident the worst is over.'
Part of the dogged optimism shown by the banks is due to their belief that a
significant post-crisis restructuring of the bank sector will work to their
benefit. At the end of 1993, the government sold off the savings banks of
Finland in four equal parts to KOP, Unitas, state-owned Postipanki and
Okobank, the umbrella bank of the country's big co-operative bank sector.
The SBF and Skopbank, which acted as a central bank for the savings banks,
were taken over by the state at the height of the loan loss crisis and
swallowed most of the FM60bn that the government was forced to pledge to
keep the banking system afloat. After transferring FM40bn in non-performing
SBF assets to Arsenal, a specially created state 'bad bank', the government
parcelled out the rest of the FM86bn in SBF assets to the four main players.
The effect has been a significant boost in customer base and assets for the
buyers, combined with a narrowing of competition. Mr Voutilainen says this
has helped restore interest rate spreads which previously were extremely
tight. 'The competition situation is much sounder - it is causing less
damage to the banks,' he says.
Certainly, the rationalisation has reinforced an overdue trend to slim down
the banking sector. The recipient banks were free to close SBF branches they
acquired and in many cases have done so. The Bankers Association says the
numbers now employed in banking have fallen to 37,000 from 53,000 in 1989
and will fall further to around 30,000. Meanwhile, the number of bank
branches has contracted by almost 900 to 2,500.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (6): A chance to catch up / Profile,
Invest in Finland Bureau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few people in Finland can have had more reason to celebrate the October 16
decision to join the European Union than Mr Nils-Christian Berg, head of the
government's Invest in Finland Bureau, writes Hugh Carnegy.
The bureau is charged with attracting direct foreign investment to the
country, so a referendum vote to stay outside the EU would have been a
severe handicap to its work. Finland already lags far behind most of
Europe's smaller peripheral countries in winning inward investment.
Inclusion in the inner circle of the continent's top political and economic
club is a vital step if Finland is to catch up.
'We have made several surveys outside Europe - notably in the US and Japan -
and we can clearly see that for a country like Japan it is a must for us to
be in the EU before companies even think about investing in Finland,' says
Mr Berg. 'They want you to be inside the EU market. That is a fact and you
cannot overcome it any other way except by joining.'
Now that Finland is set to become an EU member from January 1 - barring
unforeseen obstacles in parliament - the Invest in Finland Bureau can get on
with its job with much greater assurance and confidence. It faces a
formidable task.
The bureau was set up only in 1992, long after Ireland, Portugal and
Scotland, for instance, had established sophisticated agencies to pursue
foreign investment, armed with alluring inducements in the form of generous
tax breaks, subsidies and other incentives.
Indeed, while such countries were attracting multinational corporations to
their shores in the 1980s, Finland maintained barriers against foreign
investment, requiring any foreign investor to gain government or, in some
cases, parliamentary approval for the acquisition of more than 20 per cent
of a Finnish company. The last of these restrictions was dropped as recently
as the beginning of 1993.
Big names such as Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss/Swedish engineering giant,
Sweden's Saab Automobile, Norway's Kvaerner and Britain's British-American
Tobacco have established a presence in Finland, but the list is not long.
Mr Berg's mission is to make sure that the list now starts to grow. The
extent to which he is successful will be an important element in restoring
long-term growth to an economy deeply scarred by recession. At last Finland
realises that it can no longer rely on protected home industries and a
privileged trade with a Soviet Union that no longer exists to sustain
employment levels.
The Invest in Finland Bureau is not attempting to lure foreign investors
with state incentives. Instead, it seeks to establish Finland as a centre
for investment in what Mr Berg calls 'New Northern Europe'. Central to this
concept is the geographical proximity and established trading links that
Finland has with other industrialised Nordic countries to the west and with
the newly emerging markets of the Baltic countries and Russia to the east.
The bureau describes New Northern Europe as a region of 80m people,
including more than 40m in north-west Russia. The bureau's sales pitch is
that Finland has all the geographic, economic, legal and cultural attributes
to be the hub of this region as its new markets take off. The most important
of these could well be St Petersburg, with its population of 8m, just 150km
across the Finnish border.
'Finland is the only place that can reach and deliver throughout this region
within 24 hours,' says Mr Berg.
The obvious potential weakness in this argument is that the concept may make
more sense in theory than in reality as western companies either prefer to
invest directly in Russia and the Baltics, or may shy away altogether from
such uncertain and unstable countries.
But Mr Berg insists that Finland is already becoming a popular stepping
stone for doing business in Russia. A number of western companies operating
in St Petersburg use Finland for forwarding mail and as a telecommunications
pivot. The bureau says western investors and Russians alike can benefit from
setting up joint ventures in Finland, where the legal structures lacking in
Russia are in place and transparency is assured.
Mr Berg says using Finland as a base can help speed up approval of projects
from financial backers such as the European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development, which worry about the security of such investments.
Above all, Finland believes it can offer the benefit of experience and
contacts in Russia gained by Finnish companies. 'Finland has always traded
with Russia - long before the creation of the Soviet Union,' says Mr Berg.
'In Czarist times, when we were ruled by Russia, Finland was a conduit for
trade with the west.'
He cites a joint venture project involving Conoco of the US in oil
production in Ardalin, western Siberia. The USDollars 400m project was in
danGer of falling behind schedule last year because Conoco ran into problems
inbuilding the infrastructure of roads, dwellings and rigs. The Finnish
contractor YIT was brought in to help and got the project back on schedule.
But to foster more such success stories, the Invest in Finland Bureau must
first reverse the old image Finland has of being hostile to foreign
investors. Being a member of the EU will help. But Mr Berg has a big
marketing task ahead of him. As one of the bureau's own brochures candidly
admits: 'Not many people know  .. the place to invest in now is Finland.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (4): Diversity takes some odd shapes - The
effect of the trend away from conglomerates on big companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many international corporations, Finnish companies have in recent years
undergone a marked trend away from diversification. But the process has
still left a clutch of oddly-shaped companies whose activities include such
strange combinations as tennis racquets and cigarettes, sweets and
contraceptives and diesel engines and lavatories.
Finnish companies branched out into increasingly diverse areas of industry
and business in the 1970s and 1980s, partly to find ways of continuing to
grow in a limited home market and partly to take advantage of the relative
lack of foreign competition, kept out by restrictions on foreign ownership.
The rigours of recession, the falling of regulatory barriers and growing
pressure to focus operations in areas where maximum returns can be gained
have meant Finnish companies have followed the international fashion away
from conglomerates.
The most famous example is undoubtedly Nokia. Originally rooted in the
forestry industry, by the late 1980s Nokia encompassed a sprawl of
businesses covering forestry, engineering, computers and telecommunications
 -to name but a few. Its concentration since 1992 on fixed and mobile
telephony has reaped Nokia huge rewards (see article below).
Other less well-known companies have followed a similar path with some
success, becoming overwhelmingly dependent on foreign markets. But they have
nevertheless remained, if no longer conglomerates, at least strangely-shaped
groups with unlikely collections of interests. The following are three
prominent examples:
Amer Group. With annual turnover of around FM8bn, the group combines
ownership of Wilson Sporting Goods, one of the world's top sports equipment
labels, with concessions to sell Toyota, Citroen and Suzuki vehicles and
make Philip Morris tobacco brands in Finland and a printing and publishing
division.
The group was set up in the 1950s to manufacture American-style cigarettes
for the Finnish market - hence the name Amer. But Mr Seppo Ahonen, the chief
executive brought in from Nokia two years ago, is steadily narrowing the
group's focus down to sporting equipment and leisure products. Sporting
goods already account for almost 50 per cent of group sales.
This year Amer's remaining interests in the paper industry are being sold
off. Mr Ahonen, who announced a three-fold rise in pre-tax profits in the
first eight months to FM135m, says he is ready to consider offers for all
non-sporting goods operations, which are all profitable.
If they are sold, Amer will be a company whose dominating interest is a
high-profile company involved in a highly competitive and
marketing-sensitive business based thousands of miles away in Chicago. But
Mr Ahonen is undaunted. He sees advantages in being headquartered in
Helsinki, guiding a business with worldwide sales. 'I like the European
way,' he says. 'I think we are prepared to give more time for long-term
investments to develop than they are in America.'
Huhtamaki. Started by Finnish confectioner Heikki Huhtamaki in the 1920s,
the group had grown to encompass more than 10 business areas in the early
1980s. Since then a pattern of restructuring has left Huhtamaki in three
industries - confectionery, food packaging and pharmaceuticals.
Like Amer, annual sales stand around the FM8bn mark, with 41 per cent in
North America where the Leaf business is the third largest player in the
non-chocolate confectionery market. Leaf accounts for more than 60 per cent
of sales, followed by the Polarcup packaging division with 25 per cent and
Leiras, a company focused on contraceptives, with 12 per cent. Group profits
in the first eight months were FM309m on sales of FM5.6bn.
'We don't think of ourselves as a diversified company any more,' says Mr
Eero Aho, chief financial officer. 'Generally speaking, we are a food
company as confectionery is a branch of the food industry and Polarcup is a
food service industry.'
Huhtamaki does not make any attempt to pretend that there are great
synergies between the divisions, however. And Mr Aho admits: 'There is some
kind of conglomerate discount in our share price, but it is difficult to say
how much.'
But the group says it is happy with the shape of the company and has no
plans for further rationalistion.
Metra. In its present form, the group was founded in 1991 through the merger
of two diversified groups, Wartsila and Lohja. Today it revolves around the
Wartsila main businesses of diesel engines - in which it is a world leader -
bathroom equipment and security systems.
After the merger, Metra, which last year had group sales of FM9.5bn, began a
process of slimming down the newly-formed group. That included divestment of
such diverse interests as Lohja Caravans, the largest supplier of caravans
in the Nordic region, and Lohja building materials operations in the US.
This year a further big step was taken when agreement was reached to merge
Abloy Security, the group's locks and security systems unit, with the lock
operations of Sweden's Securitas to form AssaAbloy, in which Metra will
eventually have a 40 per cent holding.
The move will leave Metra heavily weighted towards Wartsila diesel, which in
the first eight months of this year accounted for FM3.7bn out of Metra's
total sales, including Abloy, of FM7bn. The diesel operations are widely
spread around the globe and Wartsila is a market leader in diesel
generators.
It sits oddly with Sanitec, the sanitaryware operation that remains Metra's
second largest area of operations. But with sales and profits in the diesel
division hit this year by project postponements and engine line development
costs, Metra can argue that a simultaneous improvement in Sanitec's
profitability is a valuable counter-balance, contributing FM195m in
operating profits to the group's eight-month operating profit of FM413m -
more than Wartsila.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (5): Mobile phone success story / Profile
of Nokia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland has no other corporate success story to match Nokia. Europe's
biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones has performed spectacularly over
the last two years with explosive profits and sales growth driving a 15-fold
rise in its share price.
The company now accounts for more than 25 per cent of the value of the
Helsinki Stock Exchange. Such is the dominance that its market
capitalisation at around FM50bn is greater than the combined value of the
country's four big listed forestry groups: Repola, Kymmene, Enso-Gutzeit and
Metsa-Serla. Foreigners have been particularly enthusiastic buyers of the
shares and now hold more than 50 per cent of the company.
Two years ago, with Nokia's share price languishing at less than FM50
compared with a peak of more than FM700 this year, such a revival was far
from predictable. At the time the group was heading for its second
successive year in the red amid substantial losses from its troubled
consumer electronics division.
Factors which have driven the recovery include surging worldwide demand for
Nokia's cellular equipment and mobile phones as well as an internal
reprogramming which has transformed the group from a sprawling conglomerate
to a focused telecommunications company. Cost-cutting, the weak markka and a
halting of the haemorrhage within consumer electronics have also helped.
The rapid growth in the world mobile telecommunications market has probably
been the most important factor. 'The two things which have helped us most
have been the entry of new operators into cellular market and the shift from
analogue to digital,' says Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia chief executive.
This year, for example, around 25m mobile phones are expected to be sold
worldwide, well above last year's 14m. Nokia, which is the world's second
largest mobile phone supplier after Motorola of the US, will manufacture
around 5m phones, double last year's production, to achieve a 20 per cent
market share.
The outlook is no less positive. Mr Ollila forecasts that the world market
for handsets will continue to increase by between 50 and 80 per cent for at
least the next two years.
If growth rates like this materialise, the biggest constraint on the group
could simply be its capacity to deliver. It has already had to turn away
some orders. The group is tackling the problem by investing and taking on
additional staff. It has recently expanded mobile phone capacity in the US
and last month it announced a FM280m programme to increase phone and
cellular network production at Salo in Finland.
The dominance of telecommunications within the group's business is
increasing all the time. Partly this reflects the strategic focus which has
seen the group pull out of such areas as data, forestry and chemicals.
Partly it reflects the annual 50 per cent growth in the core telecom
businesses, when the company's other remaining activities - consumer
electronics, cable and machinery, tyres and power - are hardly growing at
all.
There is little doubt that the emphasis on telecoms will continue. The trend
will be reinforced by a likely disposal of the cable and machinery, tyre and
power businesses if they fail to produce adequate cash flow. The group is
already considering floating off most of its 80 per cent stake in Nokia
Tyres.
By contrast, the company seems to intent on hanging onto its consumer
electronics unit, which is finally within sight of profits after hefty
losses and considerable restructuring over the last three years. Retaining
the operation will assist its ambitions to build a presence in multimedia.
The group's confidence is reflected in the increasingly global scale of its
activities and its readiness to take on some of its toughest competitors in
their home markets. In Japan, for example, the group talks of capturing a 25
per cent digital market share by 1996 despite tough competition from
domestic manufacturers.
The going has been tougher in the US, where the company has been hampered by
a relatively low profile and a poor distribution system. But opportunities
will increase in the US market with the planned auction of broadband
licences next year.
In any case, the group's US profile was lifted in the summer when it became
the first Finnish company to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
This was after it had raised FM2.4bn in the largest international share
issue ever made by a Finnish company.
The group's main problem now will be to meet the market's high expectations
of it. Its capacity for pleasant surprises was on display again recently
when it announced a near-fivefold surge in pre-tax profits to FM2.29bn for
the first eight months, comfortably ahead of market predictions. Net sales
were FM18.2bn, a 40 per cent increase adjusted for currencies and
restructuring.
One danger is that bigger competitors with greater resources will push Nokia
aside through technical innovation.
As analysts from Lehman brothers said recently: 'Nokia operates in the world
telecommunications market alongside significantly larger competitors . . .
Many of these companies spend more in absolute terms on R &amp; D than Nokia.'
Another danger is that the group will simply not be able to manage its
growth, becoming cumbersome and bureaucratic where until now it has been
fast and flexible. This, for Mr Ollila, appears to be the greater threat and
he has made the achievement of disciplined growth one of his main
priorities.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (2): Economic recovery starts to take root
 -After a severe recession, the country hopes for growth of 5 per cent in
1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since 1990, economic activity in Finland shows signs of
reviving.
Between 1990 and 1993, the country suffered the hardest recession to have
hit any member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development
since the second world war.
The economy, hit simultaneously by the international recession, the collapse
of trade with the neighbouring Soviet Union, the bursting of a credit boom
and the burden of an expansive welfare system, shrank by some 15 per cent
over the period. Unemployment shot up from 3.4 per cent of the workforce in
1990 - one of the lowest rates in Europe - to today's level of 18.5 per
cent, putting Finland alongside Spain and Ireland at the top of the European
jobless league.
This year, however, a recovery that began to show itself in late 1993 has
taken root. Driven by a powerful surge in exports, gross national product is
set to grow by 4 per cent this year; with domestic demand also beginning to
revive, official estimates forecast up to 5 per cent growth in 1995.
'That is regarded by many economists as too cautious and I hope they are
right,' remarks Mr Sixten Korkman, the finance ministry's chief economist.
The sense of rekindled optimism was reinforced on October 16 when a
referendum of the electorate approved Finland's entry next year to the
European Union. The result was greeted with enthusiasm by business leaders,
the trade unions and most of the political establishment as an important
confirmation of Finland's trading position and a spur to new investment.
'EU membership is good for our economy,' says Mr Korkman. 'It should help to
sustain the momentum of our recovery and help to bring down long term
interest rates. Investment activity should benefit because there will be
more certainty about the rules of the game.'
Several factors have combined to provide the turnaround. Above all, the
country's exporting industries - notably the big forestry companies and
manufacturers such as Nokia, the telecommunications group - have been able
to exploit fully a pick-up in international demand, thanks to the sharp
devaluations of the Finnish markka in 1991 and 1992 and productivity gains
that have made them much more competitive than previously.
This year exports are set to rise by some 15 per cent over last year,
producing a surplus on the balance of payments current account equivalent to
2 per cent of GDP, after 10 years of deficits.
Meanwhile, both consumption and investment are set to grow this year and
next after long periods of contraction, but annual inflation is among the
lowest in Europe at less than 2 per cent.
The prospect of a vigorous recovery after such a tough recession has caused
considerable satisfaction in Finland that the country has managed its
affairs better than neighbouring Sweden. Although Sweden has suffered much
less of a contraction in its economy, its recovery is threatened by a deep
budget deficit and rapidly growing public debt that have pushed up interest
rates.
Finland, too, has experienced a sharp deterioration in its public finances.
But under the stern guidance of Mr Iiro Viinainen, finance minister in the
centre-right government, fiscal policy has been kept largely under control.
State debt has gone up fast from very low levels to approaching 70 per cent
of GDP. But by sticking to a policy of not allowing government spending to
grow in real terms, the debt has not reached the levels of almost 100 per
cent of GDP reached in Sweden.
Even in his 1995 budget, with the unpopular government facing defeat in the
March general election, Mr Viinainen has pushed through a small cut in
expenditure in real terms, despite having to allow for some FM10bn in net
extra spending stemming from Finland's accession to the EU. Finland's debt
growth will peak next year and the country should start meeting the EU's
convergence criteria of budget deficits not exceeding 3 per cent of GDP by
1997.
But the optimism about the recovery is dampened by the overwhelming
political and social problem posed by unemployment. Just how difficult this
will be to reverse was outlined by a special commission appointed earlier
this year by President Martti Ahtisaari to study the problem.
The commission concluded that to achieve a target of cutting unemployment to
200,000 from the present level of 480,000 by the year 2000 would require
annual growth of 5 per cent a year. Even if that was achieved, unemployment
would still be running at 8 per cent of the workforce.
A key factor in attaining such growth will be investment and consumption
levels. Both were depressed during the recession. Household consumption was
cramped by high levels of indebtedness while public consumption has been
squeezed by the need to control the public finances.
The latter will continue to be depressed. But there are now signs of renewed
private consumption and investment is set to grow by 3 per cent this year
and by 15 per cent in 1995. However, with long-term interest rates still
around 10 per cent, and many households and businesses still wary of
borrowing, the conditions for expansion are still limited.
The presidential commission's prescription for engendering sustained growth
included more stringent spending cuts - that would inevitably cut into
popular welfare provisions - a cut in marginal income tax to 50 per cent
from the present rates of around 60 per cent, cuts in employers' social
security contributions and a variety of labour market measures. These ranged
from trade union-friendly proposals on sabbatical leave to employer-friendly
measures on more flexible working hours and hire-and-fire regulations.
Members of the commission, a mix of non-overtly political academics and
industrialists, clearly hoped their report would attract a political
consensus behind it. It has at least achieved the merit of having set the
economic agenda for the general election. But political action to enact its
recommendations before then is far from certain as the Social Democratic
party has so far hesitated to join the government's call for early
legislation.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (4): Debt burden has been eased - Stephen
Fidler examines the external economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia's inflation rate has fallen dramatically and moderate growth has
resumed. Its debt burden has been lowered through judicious negotiations
with commercial and foreign government lenders. The government has no
outstanding debt to foreign banks having bought back the loans to banks, in
two stages,at steep discounts to face value.
The country remains nonetheless highly susceptible to external financial and
price shocks and over-dependent on financial help from foreign governments,
multilateral institutions and non-government organisations from abroad.
The involvement of these agencies significantly reduces - for better or for
worse - the government's freedom of policy action and undoubtedly lengthens
the time it takes to make decisions.
Bolivia's exports are still highly concentrated in a few commodities, prices
of which are dependent on uncertain world markets.
Between 1985 and 1993, the government estimates its terms of trade
deteriorated by 60 per cent and the deficit on the current account averaged
about 7 per cent of gross domestic product.
Last year, the deficit widened to an unsustainable 13 per cent of GDP,
although the picture has improved this year, helped by a sharp rise in
non-traditional exports.
To cover its shortfall, the government has needed international assistance.
In the past, this has run at some Dollars 700m a year. After the government
signed a Dollars 140m three-year loan agreement with the International
Monetary Fund in Washington last month, Bolivian officials headed for Paris
to secure a further Dollars 1.1bn aid package to help finance their reform
programme in coming years.
However, the government recognises the reliability of such future flows is
open to question. The governments of industrialised countries face
intensified budget pressures, and the emergence of competing regions for aid
 -the former communist countries, the Middle East and southern Africa -
suggest that the future availability of finance cannot be taken for granted.
Bolivia has one of the highest per capita dependencies on foreign assistance
in the world. 'We are going to lower our dependence on aid. It's not
sustainable,' says Mr Fernando Candia, the central bank president.
Indeed, debt ratios remain high. Total foreign debt totalled Dollars 3.79bn
 -55 per cent of GDP - at the end of last year, of which about Dollars 1.6bn
is owed to foreign governments and Dollars 2.1bn to multilateral agencies.
The ratio of total debt to exports was 536 per cent at the end of 1992, and
debt service accounted for 39 per cent of export revenues.
Because the government's reform efforts are expected to increase the budget
deficit in the next two to three years - the World Bank says the programme
will cost 3.5 per cent of GDP during the period 1994 to 1997 - the
government's need for finance will increase.
The government is expected to take on the debt of the railways and mining
company, but other debts are expected to be transferred to the capitalised
companies. The net effect, says Mr Candia, is a net reduction of Dollars
300m in public sector debt.
After 1997, the government hopes that increased tax revenues from the
capitalised companies will start to improve its financial position.
Furthermore, after capitalisation, increased foreign investment flows should
allow the country to reduce its dependence on foreign aid and increased
exports lower its need for foreign finance.
In the meantime, the sharp increase in non-traditional exports - up 83 per
cent in the first half of 1994 over 12 months earlier - has helped the
current account position. This year's first-half current account deficit
fell 67.3 per cent to to Dollars 86.1m from Dollars 263.3m last year.
The increase in exports has also been helped by firmer commodity prices. It
may also be that at last the economy is responding to a central bank policy
which aims to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate and to
hold it stable in real terms.
At the same time, lower interest rates overseas and an improved perception
of the political and credit risk of placing funds in Bolivia has allowed
some repatriation of flight capital. As a result, net foreign reserves have
now risen to their highest level in Bolivian history: Dollars 550m -
equivalent to about 5 1/2 months of imports.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (3): A healthier footing - Trade and
foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accelerating process of opening Bolivia up to international markets,
started in 1985, is beginning to bear fruit. A combination of
entrepreneurial thrust and bilateral free trade agreements has helped close
the yawning 1993 trade gap. Now, in 1994, growing non-traditional exports
are helping put Bolivia on a healthier footing with trading partners.
'Bolivia adopted market-oriented reforms and low import tariffs earlier than
any Latin American country except Chile,' says Mr Carlos Morales, trade and
industry minister. 'It's been tough for businessmen but they now realise
that, with a small domestic market and low per capita income, we must export
in order to produce.'
Official figures show revenue from non-traditionals - principally soya
beans, gold jewellery and textiles - jumped 83 per cent in first half of
1994 compared with the same period last year. By year's end, the trade
ministry estimates, non-traditionals could earn Dollars 400m, approaching
half of all export revenue.
Last year, almost 40 per cent of Bolivia's trade was with other Latin
American countries. The European Union accounted for 28 per cent - mainly
traditional mineral exports - and the US for 24 per cent. High transport
costs mean Bolivia's present exports to Asia are a slim 8 per cent -
products are mainly natural-resource based with little value added.
The US has become the main market for Bolivia's non-traditional exports.
Under the Andean Trade Preference Act - instituted during the presidency of
Mr George Bush to help support alternatives to illegal drugs trafficking -
some 6,000 Bolivian products can enter the US free of duty.
Although landlocked, Bolivia has the advantage of sharing borders with many
countries. Under the Paz Zamora administration, Bolivia started negotiating
a series of bilateral trade accords with neighbours and other Latin American
countries. These initiatives have been stepped up under President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada.
'The adoption by the Andean Pact countries of market-oriented economic
policies has been good news for Bolivia,' says Mr Morales. Peru is Bolivia's
chief customer within the Pact, buying Dollars 42m in Bolivian
non-traditional goods (mainly soya and its derivatives) in first-half 1994 -
nearly a quarter of the total exported and 63 per cent more than for the
first six months of 1993.
Boosting the chances of closer integration with Peru is the 1992 agreement
which granted Bolivia rights to an industrial free trade zone and a 5km
strip of desert coast near the southern Peruvian port of Ilo. In return,
Peru won access to Bolivian river port facilities in Puerto Suarez, on the
borders of Brazil, with an outlet to the Atlantic.
Bolivia, however, is in pursuit of the largest possible number of trading
partners. It is particularly attracted to the Mercosur group of countries
comprising Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Bolivia was granted
'observer status' last December.
'We see ourselves as a hinge between the Andean Pact and Mercosur,' says Mr
Morales. 'We believe in a larger trade area and we're negotiating
aggressively within the vision of Mercosur.'
In January and March this year, Bolivia signed preliminary free trade
agreements with Paraguay and Brazil to complement its existing accords with
Argentina and Uruguay. These are seen as essential, if limited, first steps
in fulfilment of the ambition to join Mercosur.
A landmark trade accord with Chile, signed in April 1993, has so far proved
disappointing. La Paz businessmen claim that Chile is blocking Bolivian
exports by over-rigidly applying non-tariff regulations while swamping the
Bolivian market with Chilean consumer goods. Re-negotiations in October,
however, should give Bolivians a chance to level the trade score.
Bolivia's most recent trade accord was signed with Mexico in September,
allowing for phasing in of total free trade within 15 years. However, 98 per
cent of all products will be traded tariff-free within 10 years and a
significant portion immediately.
Trade between the two countries is small - worth less than Dollars 20m in
1993 - and weighted in favour of Mexico. But Bolivians expect exports of
wood, alpaca textiles and gold jewellery to expand fast. Government
officials estimate that bilateral trade will jump to Dollars 50m in year
one.
Meanwhile, Bolivia is also starting to see benefits from its five free trade
zones established from 1991 onwards. Their objective is to cut incentives
for the flourishing contraband business which for years has sliced into
state revenue from import duties and value-added tax.
Mr Oscar Ewel, general manager of GIT, the company which holds the 40-year
concessions for the La Paz and Santa Cruz free trade zones, estimates that
some 60 per cent of the Dollars 400m or so imported into Bolivia via Chile's
free port of Iquique is smuggled. Mr Ewel believes that illegal goods
entering Bolivia from Brazil via Santa Cruz account for Dollars 300m of a
total of some Dollars 420m.
GIT (part of the Banco Industrial-ICE group) has invested Dollars 8m in La
Paz free zone infrastructure to date. Some 350 Bolivian companies are now
regular users and GIT expects to handle in excess of Dollars 100m this year.
With a standard 10 per cent import duty and 13 per cent sales tax, GIT is
collecting some Dollars 25m for the Bolivian customs.
In a late October initiative, the La Paz free trade zone inaugurated a
direct import service 'to help formalise the informal trader who spends
under Dollars 2,000 at any one time,' says Mr Ewel.
Those buying through the free trade zone will receive and supply proper
invoices, an innovation for the street-sellers of La Paz and their
customers.
Santa Cruz's free trade zone started operating in January. This year it will
handle some Dollars 30m in merchandise, not yet making much of a dent in
contraband from Brazil. Smaller free trade zones have also been set up under
concession in the cities of Cochabamba, Oruro and Puerto Aguirre.
Still pending is reform of Bolivia's customs service which is scheduled for
privatisation in the near future.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (1): A coming of age as a shadow is lifted
 -Hugh Carnegy assesses the impact of the country's significant decision
last month to vote in favour of joining the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On October 16, as the first snows of the long Nordic winter fell across much
of the country, Finland accepted the most important change in the political
alignment of the nation since it achieved independence from Russia in 1917
when the electorate voted in favour of joining the European Union.
The referendum result - acceptance of membership by a margin of 56.9 per
cent to 43.1 per cent - was decisive without being overwhelming. There was
little sense of drama on the day and no jubilation when the outcome was
announced. Indeed, there was considerable disquiet over the way the issue
had divided the country between the more urbanised south, which voted
heavily Yes, and the rural, remote central and northern regions, which voted
No.
But the decision was welcomed with satisfaction and relief by the vast
majority of Finland's political establishment, the leaders of industry and
the trade unions and the nation's media.
After Finland's uncomfortable neutrality in the shadow of the Soviet Union
since the second world war and the hardest recession since the 1930s,
stepping into the EU fold is regarded by its supporters as a vital step
towards long-term strategic and economic stability. 'It is a coming of age
for Finland,' declared Mr Paavo Lipponen, leader of the opposition Social
Democratic party and, if the opinion polls are right, the man who will be
prime minister after the general election next March.
For the European Union, too, Finland's entry will be a significant moment.
The EU will acquire its first direct frontier with Russia in the form of the
1,270km-long Finnish-Russian border. EU territory will extend for the first
time into the Arctic Circle, taking in expansive forestry resources - which
will be even greater if Sweden and Norway also join.
Some uncertainties persist which contributed to the subdued mood after the
referendum. Finland will be deeply disappointed if its Nordic neighbours,
with which it worked closely as they all pursued their EU applications last
year, vote against membership in the Swedish and Norwegian referendums on
November 13 and 28 respectively.
Opponents of membership also mounted a tenacious filibuster to postpone this
week's scheduled parliamentary vote needed to confirm accession until after
Sweden's referendum in the hope that a Swedish No might swing enough MPs to
form a blocking one-third minority. But if the government wins, as expected,
Finland will join Austria as a new member of the EU on January 1 next year.
What will membership mean for Finland?
In economic terms, there are some immediate difficulties which, again, were
part of the reason why the country reacted coolly to its decision. Above
all, joining the EU is set to trigger a fall in incomes of up to 45 per cent
over the next few years for Finland's influential farmers. Helsinki has long
subsidised agriculture at levels well above those provided by the EU, partly
to ensure the continued population of rural areas and partly as a political
pay-off for support from rural communities.
But under the terms of its accession agreement, Finland must adjust
immediately to the farm price regime of the common agricultural policy.
Brussels rejected Helsinki's demand that the whole country be treated as a
special case for subsidies because of its harsh climate. A national package
of transitional supports has been outlined, but its cost, on top of
Finland's 'membership fee' will add FM10bn to government spending next year,
deepening the budget deficit.
As a member already of the European Economic Area agreement, Finland will
not achieve any significant immediate economic benefit from membership,
apart from the removal of customs barriers with the EU. But the strong
belief in government and industry is that membership of the EU will serve to
underpin Finland's economy just as it is pulling out of a severe recession.
Between 1990 and 1993, the economy shrank by some 15 per cent following the
collapse of the Soviet Union (with which Finland enjoyed lucrative trade
ties), the impact of the international recession and the collapse of a
credit boom at home. Unemployment neared 20 per cent of the workforce.
An export-led recovery is now under way, producing growth this year of some
4 per cent and probably more than 5 per cent in 1995. The hope is that EU
membership will help foster confidence in the economy both at home and
abroad, ease long-term interest rates which presently stand at around 10 per
cent and generate a much-needed revival of investment and consumption.
On the strategic front, joining the EU is of great significance for Finland,
which was ruled for centuries by Sweden and then by Czarist Russia.
Finland's 77 years of independence have been marked first by conflict and
subsequently by cold war tensions.
Finland fought several bloody wars to preserve its independence, first a
battle against the nascent Soviet Union complicated by a simultaneous
virtual civil war and then, during the second world war, an awkward struggle
initially against Moscow and then against Nazi Germany. In the post-war
period, Helsinki adopted a neutral stance in which it maintained a delicate
balance between its capitalist economic and instinctive cultural ties to the
west and its pragmatic political and trading ties with the Soviets.
Now, Finland is taking advantage of the changed circumstances brought about
by the disappearance of the Soviet Union to move firmly into the west's
political and strategic orbit as an insurance policy against future threats
from Russia. 'No one can say Russia is a country of stability today. There
is a certain hazard in Russia today, so it is a question of security,' says
Mr Pertti Salolainen, deputy prime minister in the centre-right government
of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister.
'The mere fact of being a member of the EU will give security because then
you are untouchable militarily - with out having to make any new military
arrangements. The EU could never accept any aggression against one of its
members,' says Mr Salolainen.
Nevertheless, Finland is treading cautiously over its strategic and military
future. Helsinki has joined Nato's Partnership for Peace initiative. Mr Aho
says the country will take up observer status in the Western European Union.
In addition, Finland will participate in the EU's move under the Maastricht
Treaty towards a common foreign and security policy.
But Mr Aho, mindful of Russia's continued sensibilities about the stance of
a neighbour that commands the Baltic approaches to St Petersburg, says
Helsinki does not intend a sudden change in Finland's military stance. 'It
is in the interests of the EU that the present stability in this part of the
continent be preserved. We have no intention of changing this stability and
that is why we have no intention of changing our basic political
orientation,' Mr Aho said last month.
Instead, the prime minister likes to stress the opportunities for Finland,
Russia and the EU offered by Finnish membership. He sees Finland acting as a
conduit for increased trading and political links between Brussels and
Moscow. 'Our skills and experience in dealing with Russia will be at the
disposal of the EU for the development of the Russian economy,' he says.
As for Finland's stance in the evolving debate over the future structures of
the EU, both Mr Aho, leader of the rurally-based Centre party, and Mr
Lipponen say Finland will play a pragmatic role. It has accepted the
Maastricht Treaty with its plans for European Monetary Union and closer
political co-operation. Although some way from meeting EMU convergence
targets because of the size of its public debt and budget deficit, Helsinki
is committed to achieving them.
For the time being, however, all the main political parties are being
careful not to become identified as belonging either to the federalist camp
within the EU or the anti-federalist camp. Mr Lipponen accepts that if EMU
occurs it will require closer political ties, but he, like the prime
minister, stresses the importance of avoiding over-centralisation and, above
all, of protecting the interests and influence of the smaller nations.
In this approach, Finland will undoubtedly be joined by Sweden and Norway if
they also become members. With Denmark, they would form a Nordic bloc, which
is likely instinctively to resist federalist pressures.
But Finland is not comfortable with talk of different grades of membership
according to a willingness to push towards federal structures. Mr
Salolainen, who as trade minister was one of Finland's negotiators with
Brussels, put it thus: 'They may be onion rings in the European Union, but
from the outset we do not accept a situation where certain countries
constitute a core and the others are outside. There must be organic
development that is not artificial or imposed.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (2): 'Very important steps have been made'
 -Interview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, RICHARD BAUER and SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada talks to Stephen Fidler, Richard Bauer
and Sally Bowen
Question: Your government gives the impression of having a lot of vision, a
lot of ideas, which seem forward-looking and coherent. But some of the
measures you have introduced - for example the reform of the executive - may
have put back other aspects of your reform. And after 15 months of your
government, its practical impact seems to have been limited.
Answer: In the first year of this government, the legislation which came
about, including constitutional reform, was simply extraordinary. But that
is very far away from people's lives.
Let's start with our reform of the executive branch. If you don't take that
step at the beginning of a new government the cement gels and you can never
change it. But there's a cost - in time lost until people adjust and until
the system works - but the steps that have been made have been very
important.
Let's go to step number two - popular participation. For the first time in
500 years we have recognised the existence of native communities. Why
Bolivia works with a low level of violence, and is a working, functioning
democracy with our terrific, critical poverty is basically because the
family and the community is very important. We've created territorial
municipalities - true local government - as opposed to the traditional,
colonial, Spanish city where the landowners lived and which governed the
countryside.
We've given economic and political power back to the people. Two-thirds of
Bolivians are Indian communities and the great majority of Bolivians don't
speak Spanish - as the president doesn't speak it well. We also took 20 per
cent of the central government's income and distributed it according to the
population, so for the first time in 500 years people received money instead
of sending money to central government. They're deciding what they're going
to spend the money on, and we've also given them the administration of
health and education.
The central government will provide the teachers and the doctors, but the
community will administer them. Of course, the teachers' unions are
indignant and the doctors are outraged because they have these poor, dirty
Indians telling them what services they need. It started on July 1, so the
people are starting to get the money. Of course, they'll wake up and realise
the money's nothing next to the problems, but before they had nothing.
Aren't you worried about local corruption?
The church asked me about that and I said if that should happen we'd be the
first country to have democratised corruption. Why should only the big guys
steal? Let the little guys steal. But I don't think so - I asked that of the
local mayor in a community I visited and he said: 'I can't because
everybody's looking at me'.
What about central government?
The third thing was constitutional reform, and we've gone for the German
(electoral) system where we have proportional representation in the
congress, but half the legislators are voted by districts.
Now, we just have a list, so if you vote for the president in every
department you get the president's men. But they're going to have the right
to vote for the guy that represents them and for the president, but we will
still have proportional representation.
In the constitutional reform, we've brought in the ombudsman, and we've
brought in complete reorganisation of the judicial branch.
Finally, we come to capitalisation which is probably the cornerstone of the
whole thing. In traditional privatisation you sell the state-owned assets
and whoever buys them has to invest and modernise.
What we're saying is, don't buy it from us, put in the money to modernise it
and what is left in the hands of the state, which would be up to 50 per
cent, we then distribute to the Bolivian people for pension plans. That's
easier said than done: individual capitalisation pension plans.
Are you optimistic that capitalisation will work, will attract investors?
We're very sure that it will. Let me give you a reason why: Bolivia is a
relatively large country but it's a small, poor economy. But we had never
taken into account, living up here in the Andes, that it is a hub: its
location is what makes it valuable.
Let's take the electric energy sector: we have 31 companies interested in
the capitalisation which we hope to have finished by March. What they've
told us is you're sitting at 4,000 metres and an awful lot of water goes
down to sea level, and it's environmentally friendly. We can sell the
electricity into southern Peru, northern Chile and Argentina and into
Brazil.
You take the second sector; hydrocarbons. Bolivia, on top of very important
reserves, is situated strategically so that it can export into northern
Chile, southern Peru, Sao Paulo.
For big oil companies, gas was a nuisance and an unnecessary by-product. But
in an environmentally-conscious world, big companies have to be
gas-orientated. We think the prices are ridiculously low, we think we are
being taken to the cleaners, but we know that the trend as people get used
to gas, and see the benefits of an abundant, economic and clean fuel, we're
sitting on a gold mine.
The last thing on the agenda is educational reform. Here we're talking about
something that nobody ever accepted - that you should learn to read and
write in your native language.
Nobody can learn another language until he's learned to read and write and
think in his own language. This doesn't sound like much, but this is
revolutionary. They grab these poor children, they throw them into school,
they have a teacher that talks to them in Spanish and are prohibited to even
use their native clothes.
Secondly, we've decided that all schools, public or private, must be
accredited. We want to have standard testing; we've created a regulatory
body that's elected by a two-thirds majority to do this. The schoolteachers
are outraged because they will be dependent on the community. Isn't it true
that you're really not informing people much about capitalisation?
In a way, you're right. We learn from Machiavelli that change is not
advisable because those affected realise it immediately and those benefiting
take a long time. So there's a terrific problem in communications, and it's
basically because the president isn't talking to the people. The reason he's
not talking to them is that we are in this gestation period - these are very
hard policies to put in place.
This is the critical year; we must finish capitalisation this year, we think
we can do it - easily we'll get it done by 1995. But people won't see
anything till 1996 because the people who capitalise this country will have
billions of dollars on deposit but then they have to do the studies, they
have to place the orders and then they'll be seeing it moving.
Do you have a clear strategy of what you will do about Bolivia's illegal
coca production?
Obviously not; who has a clear strategy with drugs? The day somebody invents
a synthetic cocaine it's all finished. But the damage is to us because our
institutions are too weak to resist the cartels.
The amount under cultivation hasn't grown in the last few years. Is that
good news?
In drugs, all I can say is it's like having cancer and saying it's not
growing. You haven't got free of the cancer but at least it's not growing.
Are the armed forces and police involved?
Well, no. The armed forces were intensely involved before democracy came
back. These institutions have a great ability to cleanse themselves through
promotions, and they retire so quickly and they move up, and we have
isolated the armed forces; they only give a support role to the police.
The police, who were terribly corrupt have again been purified, I won't say
lily-white, but I think that the area of greatest preoccupation is the
judicial branch. We're working very hard because a country without justice
is like a land without water. We're working very hard to depoliticise it;
make it independent; make it impartial; make it competent.
Generally, institutionally we're doing relatively well. Where we're not
doing well is that the so-called farmers' unions are the bottom rung of drug
trafficking. I'm not saying they're taking it to England or taking it to the
US, but they're definitely getting the paste to the boys in the line.
Colombia's integrating backwards; they want to produce their own coca so
they don't have to depend on Bolivia. The Bolivians want to produce their
own cocaine so they can sell it directly to the market. It's a very, very
dangerous situation and I must admit that we're racking our brains.
                        *       *       *
Don't forget that Bolivia was, like most countries, not only ineffective at
providing goods and services, it was really ineffective at providing social
services. We recognise that that's the role of the state - the real
mechanism of redistribution of wealth - but we think governments, including
the developed countries' governments, are awful at doing that. They're
better at producing electricity or oil than they are at producing health and
education. So we're giving it back to the people. . .
There's one thing that makes me see the light - there's no way I can do it
worse than the others have done. When they say 'How can you give all these
Indians all this political power and economic power?' I say 'They can't do
worse than we've done.'
You're worried about corruption, you're worried about them having a party;
at least it'll be a good party. They can't do it worse than we've done for
500 years.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (1): Economic growth is the key - Despite
a bleak background, or in part perhaps because of it, there is now a strong
sense of change in many parts of the country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is the poorest country in the western hemisphere after Haiti. Seventy per
cent of the population live in poverty; average life expectancy is 60 years;
86 out of every 1,000 babies die before they are a year old.
Bolivia is still suffering the legacy of four centuries of plunder
capitalism. Its 1952 revolution nationalised the mines, the centrepiece of
the Bolivian economy, and opened the countryside to land reform. But in
driving out the mine owners and landowners, the revolution drove away
capital too.
The state, beset by corruption, proved an inefficient investor and little
better at improving the lot of the population. In a country of more than 7m
people, fewer than 1m have formal jobs and only 350,000 have bank accounts.
The indigenous majority of Bolivians does not speak Spanish, suffers the
racism of the European-descended minority and still ekes subsistence from
the land or from petty commerce.
Landlocked, with prices for its main commodity exports plunging in the
1980s, Bolivia's survival without continued foreign aid in a competitive
world market remains in doubt.
Yet, despite this bleak background, or in part perhaps because of it, there
is now a strong sense of change in many parts of the country. Some regions -
in particular, the plains to the east around the city of Santa Cruz - are
enjoying growth led by agricultural exports.
The caricature image of a country beset by military dictatorships and
political instability - Bolivia has experienced 78 governments in 169 years
of independence - is losing its relevance now that elected governments have
been in place for 12 years.
There have been nine years of economic stability since 1985, when inflation
topped 23,000 per cent. This year, inflation should fall to 7.5 per cent or
less - only Argentina's will be lower in Latin America. Once heavily
protectionist, the country now has a maximum tariff of 10 per cent and
allows free inflow and outflow of capital.
Yet, economic stability has not been followed by sufficient overall growth
to improve the lives of the poor majority. Slow growth, the present
government believes, is an inevitable consequence of low investment over
many years. Sharply increasing the investment rate is therefore its prime
objective.
The architect of the successful 1985 economic stabilisation plan is now Mr
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the president. The cornerstone of his policy to
increase private investment - he hopes it will reach more than 20 per cent
of gross domestic product by 1996 compared with about 14 per cent at present
 -is a plan to transfer six state companies responsible for one-eighth of
the country's economic activity to the private sector.
The process is being called capitalisation. It aims to entice foreign
private operators to make a significant equity investment in the businesses,
typically 50 per cent, and to distribute the remaining portion to Bolivians
through newly created pension fund accounts.
The process is expected to start with the capitalisation of the state
electricity generator.
The single most important capitalisation will be that of the state oil
company, YPFB, which, despite its poor investment record, still accounts for
about 9 per cent of GDP.
Mr Edgar Saravia, the senior official responsible for guiding through the
process, says that by next year the first stage of capitalisation -
transferring the companies to the management control of the new foreign
shareholders - should be completed by July next year. Already though, he
admits capitalisation is running six weeks behind schedule.
The completion of the process - let alone its ultimate success - cannot be
taken for granted. It requires a heavy legislative programme and although
the government coalition has with difficulty retained majorities in both
houses of Congress, they may not be reliable or durable.
Furthermore, because the Bolivian market is small, the amount that foreign
investors are willing to plough into the companies will depend significantly
on the extent to which they can use the companies to penetrate foreign
markets.
Bolivia is therefore depicting itself as an entrepot - particularly for
energy and transport - for South America's southern cone. And with regional
economic integration proceeding apace, both at the governmental and
entrepreneurial level, the idea of Bolivia as a hub is no longer the
pipe-dream it would have been a decade ago.
But, while capitalisation may be a necessary condition for accelerating
economic growth, nobody sees it as sufficient. If potential foreign
investors are less worried about the country's political stability than they
were, they have significant concerns about other obstacles to business.
One big obstacle, particularly to investment in agriculture, is land
titling. The country's competing titling authorities have now more or less
ceased to function and the present law allows for different owners of the
land, the underground resources beneath it, and the forest above.
Mr Jose Guillermo Justiniano, the minister of sustainable development and
the environment, says 'complete chaos' surrounds the titling issue, but that
the government is drafting a law to address the problem.
Corruption remains another pressing problem - and the aim of reducing it
provides a further reason for ending state ownership of productive
enterprises. Congress is wrangling over whether to lift the diplomatic
immunity of the previous president, Mr Jaime Paz Zamora, who has been
accused along with other members of his party of ties with drug traffickers.
The company running La Paz's cable television channel, for example, has
complained it is being targeted for bribes by city officials. There is a
price for not paying: the frequency with which the company's cables get
damaged by municipal and other vehicles. Other obstacles cited by foreign
investors include poor infrastructure, the continued strong influence of the
trade unions, and the legal system.
Mr Guido Antesana, a former head of Bolivia's banking association, describes
the legal system as 'morally bankrupt and technically obsolete'. For
business, it presents 'a big roadblock. There is no certainty that any
contract will be enforced,' he says.
The government has already begun to move on this, although the task is
enormous. Constitutional reform has, among other things, established a new
tribunal aimed at cleaning up the judiciary. In another unprecedented
development, two supreme court justices were impeached for corruption.
It is not only in the economic domain that the government has directed its
reform efforts. It has overhauled the executive branch, the drawback being
that getting accustomed to this new structure has delayed other aspects of
the government's programme.
It has passed a law aimed at decentralising political decision-making.
Called popular participation, it is designed to devolve power and finance to
local municipalities and community groups in all parts of the country, many
parts of which have never had local government. Education reform has for the
first time permitted instruction in languages spoken by the country's
indigenous majority.
By any standards, this is an ambitious reform programme, and unlike some
leaders, the US-educated Mr Sanchez de Lozada does not lack the 'vision
thing'.
What is in question, however, is application. The president, a philosophy
graduate from the University of Chicago, loves 'brainstorming' sessions. He
follows opinion polls closely - too closely, say some of his supporters.
And, partly as a result, he makes decisions and then often reverses them
days later.
Because of the country's heavy dependence on foreign aid - which he hopes
his economic programme will end - his decision-making has to take into
account the often conflicting opinions of the international financial
institutions, the more than 400 non-governmental organisations operating in
the country, and the US and other donor governments.
The president has no love either for Bolivia's pork-barrel political
culture, or the cut-and-thrust of politics, which he is widely said to see
as an obstacle to his reform ideas.
Another subject he is said to despise is the controversy over the growing of
coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. The importance of coca to the
Bolivian economy has declined over the past five years - the area under
cultivation has remained more or less stable, while it has quintupled in
Peru - but it remains a thorn in the government's side.
He has been caught in the middle of Washington's policy of repressing coca
cultivation and the Bolivian population's romantic, if possibly misguided,
attachment to the growers of the plant.
Already, 15 months has passed of a short four-year presidential term. The
president makes no bones about the enormity of the task he is undertaking.
But he says he has a consolation: 'There's one thing that makes me see the
light - there's no way I can do it worse than the others have done.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: M&amp;S caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caution about second-half trading from high street retailer Marks and
Spencer saw shares in the group surrender an early advance that followed the
release of favourable interim figures.
Profits rose 15.1 per cent to Pounds 354m, beating the most optimistic of
the market's forecasts, and the stock initially rose to 413p. However, the
company hinted that the market should not to be over-optimistic about the
second half.
Researchers pointed to uncertainty over Sunday trading, and lower than
expected sales in women's clothing because of continued mild weather. The
general tone remained positive and BZW, which held its full-year forecast at
Pounds 970m, retained the stock as a core holding in the sector. The shares
closed 5 1/2 off at 404p after heavy trading of 8.7m.
Elsewhere, Boots ended 3 ahead at 520p following a press report that it was
about to accept an offer of nearly Pounds 900m for its pharmaceuticals
division from BASF, the German chemicals group.
SmithKline Beecham remained in positive territory as Goldman Sachs
reiterated its positive stance on the stock. The US investment bank believes
that the effect of the US patent expiry of Tagamet is entirely discounted in
the current share price. SmithKline closed a penny up at 409p.
Pilkington, the world's biggest glass maker, slipped 3 to 192p, with dealers
saying that Cazenove attempted but failed to place some 20m shares.
Composite insurer Commercial Union held its ground ahead of third-quarter
figures today as Smith New Court cited it as its preferred stock in the
sector. The shares firmed slightly to 543p, although a number of analysts
expect CU's exposure to a weak London market to result in disappointing
figures.
Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson fell 16 to 176p after the group announced
that its main subsidiary has been named as a defendant in legal proceedings.
Continued speculation that Unigate was about to sell its 34 per cent holding
in Nutricia, the Dutch food company, boosted the shares 7 to 358p.
Associated British Foods succumbed to switching into conglomerate Tomkins.
The former closed 10 down at 547p, while the latter gained 4 at 215p in busy
trade of 6.9m.
Bumper second-quarter profits put some thrust behind British Airways,
sending full-year profit estimates racing upwards and lifting the shares 8
to 365p in 7.9m turnover.
The statement made gloomy allusions to USAir, but it was the rapid progress
within the underlying business that captured analysts' imaginations.
UBS upgraded their 1994-95 forecast by Pounds 29m to Pounds 439m and are
confident that the airline - following the 10 per cent interim payout
increase - will pass some of the goodwill on to shareholders via a chunky
final dividend.
Anglian Water helped stir up the water sector, jumping to 541p on news of
robust interim results and dividend before lapsing back to 534p, down 4 on
the day. Hoare Govett is looking for Pounds 225m this year, up from an
earlier Pounds 213m estimate.
Hoare Govett also expects strong interims from Northumbrian Water tomorrow.
But given its solid earnings cover, the main focus is likely to be on
Northumbrian's dividend. The company has French-owned North East Water as a
neighbour and some brokers see takeover fears putting some real zing into
Northumbrian's dividend this year. The shares lost 4 at 705p.
News that British Aerospace and GEC had negotiated an agreement not to bid
for each other until July 1995 added fresh impetus to the VSEL takeover
saga. BAe slipped 2 to 452p, shading the value of its all-share offer for
VSEL to 1243p a share. GEC has a cash bid on the table worth 1400p.
VSEL closed 12 lower at 1358p, which suggests that the balance of
probabilities - at this stage - lies with the GEC deal not facing a
monopolies reference. Equally, the betting among analysts yesterday was that
BAe will come up with an increased offer later this month.
Several stocks in the property sector were hurt by a property bulletin from
James Capel entitled 'mid-term blues'. MEPC lost 5 at 415p and British Land
relinquished 6 to 382p, after the broker said: 'The rating of MEPC ahead of
its finals allows for no disappointment. In spite of its dividend support we
would be sellers and would sell the stock to below 400p. Equally, the rating
of British Land is very forward looking, with little yield support.'
Oil recovery group Greenway rose 5 to 98p as it was appreciated that interim
profits were substantially higher once the boost from a one-off disposal had
been discounted.

FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg volatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant bank SG Warburg saw its shares whip around in an otherwise dull
market as the effect of poor figures was offset by takeover talk and a large
market deal.
The shares were 5 off initially. Warburg reported first-half profits down at
Pounds 62.5m from Pounds 148.8m previously. But the bank had warned in early
October that they would be badly affected by the global slump in bonds, and
the fall had no substance to it so the price began to recover.
Then, whispers resurfaced that a US investment bank was interested in making
an offer for the UK bank. Also, one dealer crossed a line of half a million
shares at 635p, well above the market price, and the underlying price leapt
forward to close a net 20 higher at 629p.

FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers active on switching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading life assurance companies saw exceptionally heavy trade yesterday as
a technical view on relative performance clashed with the attitude towards
long-term prospects.
Several leading securities houses had noted that Legal &amp; General had
underperformed the broad market by 5 per cent over the past month, while
Prudential had outperformed by the same amount.
However, heavy switching was counterbalanced by the feeling that L&amp;G was
more prone to regulatory changes surrounding the selling of pensions. And
the 'feel bad factor' was compounded by Tuesday's news that its US
subsidiary faces an Dollars 8.7m fine.
The chartists won the day. L&amp;G gained 3 at 431p on turnover of 7.9m, while
Prudential slipped a penny to 320p on unusually high trade of 13m.

FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wall Street strength prompts rally in
London - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market fought back strongly from a dismal opening, shrugging
off another bout of intense speculation of an imminent UK base rate rise. It
responded immediately to a good opening performance from Wall Street ahead
of the first news from the congressional mid-term elections for both houses.
The recovery trend in London was boosted by a spate of well received trading
reports from some of the UK's leading companies, such as Marks and Spencer,
British Airways and Anglian Water.
At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index had almost erased an earlier
17.4 fall, ending the session only 2.0 down at 3,063.8. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, which again put on a much more resolute performance than its senior
index, closed just marginally off, down 0.4 at 3,519.7.
Dealers in the second liners said the trading session was 'tedious' and
activity remained at minimal levels.
Senior traders in London expect a good opening from the London market this
morning, following a strong finishing run by international bond markets. UK
gilts, down around  1/8 early in the session, gradually improved to close
ahead on balance. German bunds were better on the day and the long bond in
the US was up around half a point as London closed.
At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which opened under
pressure, rallied strongly to show a gain of more than 22 points.
UK equities opened in reasonably good shape with the FT-SE 100 up almost 4
points at the outset, traders reassured by the resolute showing by US bonds
and equities in the face of continued nervousness about the US elections.
But the market suddenly lurched downwards as the futures market opened and
the rumours of a UK interest rate rise swept the market. Although these
stories were quickly rejected, confidence remained severely dented until
shortly after midday when dealers responded to a trickle of US-sourced
buying orders, always a sure sign of a steady opening on Wall Street.
The FT-SE 100 clawed back most of its earlier losses and was showing a fall
of 5 points as Wall Street opened, gradually improving to end 2 points off.
The lack of genuine customer business remained one of the main talking
points. Turnover reached 589.8m shares at the close, well up from Monday's
398.8m, but a figure that still prompted widespread dismay among brokers and
marketmakers. Monday's total managed to produce just above Pounds 1bn of
customer business. Non-Footsie volume accounted for 369.9m, or 63 per cent
of yesterday's turnover.
A dealer at one of the top UK securities houses was impressed by the
market's resilience as it dipped through 3,055 on the FT-SE 100. 'The
futures boys had a real go at driving the market below 3,055 but could not
keep it there. The fact that we closed well clear of that level augurs well
in the short term.' He said a half-point rise in the US Fed Funds rate was
already in the market. Lack of movement from the Federal Reserve after next
Tuesday's FOMC meeting would be viewed as weakness and would probably
trigger a sharp sell-off in international markets.
SG Warburg was the FT-SE 100's biggest winner yesterday, the shares
responding to the expected sharp decline in interim profits and, late in the
session, revived speculation that JP Morgan, the US investment bank, may be
taking another hard look at it.
There was intense speculation that Cazenove, the stockbroker, had attempted
to place 20m Pilkington shares, around 2.5 per cent of the issued capital,
at 190p but failed to find buyers for the stock.
Marks and Spencer and British Airways attracted strong interest after
delivering excellent results and double-digit dividend increases.

FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures mostly marked time in line with the cash market,
drifting slightly higher in continued low trading volume, writes Jeffrey
Brown.
There were 10,862 contracts, up from 8,091 on Monday. But some 2,000 of this
was spread trading as investors moved from the December to the March
contract, so underlying volume was little changed.
At the official 4.10pm close the FT-SE 100 December contract had clawed back
above the 3,070 critical chart level to end at 3,072, up 11 points. The
premium to the cash market was 10 points, with fair value around 7.5 points.
There was some excitment in the early morning when the market appeared to
take a serious run at cash equities on the back of rumours of an imminent
rise for base rates. But this fizzled out by mid-morning and the session
took on a slightly unreal atmosphere with very little business being done
either way.
However, sentiment picked up towards the close, with Wall Street showing
signs of a strong rally, and traders were hopeful of continued upward
momemtum today.
Turnover in traded options rose to 28,478 lots after 21,113 on Monday. FT-SE
and Euro FT-SE business totalled 16,500 lots. Lonrho stood out among
individual stock options with 4,230 dealt. Cable and Wireless and ICI were
active.

Toronto bounced back in moderate trading from five straight losing sessions.
The TSE 300 index finished 21.12 up at 4,209.09, although advances led
declines by just 359 to 357 after volume of 71.6m shares valued at CDollars
71.5m.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by gold, financial services,
transportation and pipeline stocks. The heaviest losses came in real estate
and paper issues. The paper group dropped 1.68 per cent as its most heavily
weighted stock, Macmillan Bloedel, fell CDollars 7/8 to CDollars 17 3/4 in
heavy trading.
Gold shares were bid up on rising bullion prices as the New York spot price
for gold climbed USDollars 1.70 to USDollars 383.15 an ounce. The group

CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 32 3/4 , and Placer Dome, up CDollars 1/2 at

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets firmer ahead of
poll result
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US shares put on a firm showing yesterday on program buying as the market
awaited results from the mid-term elections, and producer price news
expected tomorrow, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 21.87 ahead at 3,830.74,
slightly below its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.58
at 465.65, while the American Stock Exchange composite improved 0.64 to
451.05 and the Nasdaq composite rallied 5.23 to 767.54. Trading volume on
the New York SE came to 289m shares.
The markets were also influenced by expectations of a rise in interest rates
after next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. An
increase in rates could draw money out of equity markets and into fixed
income instruments. Merrill Lynch yesterday advised investors to reduce
their stock holdings in favour of bonds and cash.
Program buying caused moderately active volume, but investors remained
generally cautious as they awaited the government figures on producer
prices, which are expected to show a 0.1 per cent rise for October. If the
number is significantly larger it could provoke fears of a large or early
move to increase interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Markets were uncertain as to the impact of the mid-term elections, but some
believed that a strong showing by Republicans could bolster markets today.
Smaller issues trading was boosted by gains in software stocks. Broderbund
Software advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 5/8 and Boole &amp; Babbage moved
forward Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 25.
The day also saw gains for the large high-technology stocks, IBM, Apple
Computer and Motorola, in further response to Monday's news of a joint
venture by the three computer makers to design a new personal computer. IBM
rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73, Apple picked up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars
42 1/4 and Motorola advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Hewlett-Packard
also rose, by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 97 7/8 , on news that its printer
business was very profitable, in spite of decreasing profitability seen
elsewhere in that market.
Southwest Airlines fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22. It reported higher
traffic in October but fourth-quarter yield figures showed lower revenues
per passenger mile than for the same period last year. AMR, parent of
American Airlines, was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 51 3/8 on similar news.
Allied Signal firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 after announcing a joint
venture on Monday with General Motors to produce a part for a catalytic
converter that decreases pollution.
Ann Taylor, the retailer, retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 after
Monday's report that third-quarter earnings were well below both last year's
figures and analysts' expectations.
The Argentine telecommunications company Telefonica de Argentina forged
ahead Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 after New York brokerage, Oppenheimer
&amp; Co initiated coverage with a buy recommendation.
The broking house's analyst covering Latin American telecommunications
companies said he based his recommendation on the fact that average bottom
line growth at the Argentine group had been higher than that of other Latin
American and US telephone companies.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil falls back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sao Paulo fell from the day's peaks to stand a net 0.5 per cent
down at the close in the wake of a new batch of bearish inflation indicators
released yesterday, which prompted profit-taking after the 7.3 per cent
rally seen in the previous two sessions.
Trading was concentrated in short term deals as players remained mostly
sidelined, wondering how the government would keep inflation down until
president-elect Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso is sworn in on January 1.
The Bovespa index lost 267 at 47,821. Traders, who reported slow foreign
activity, said prices tested the 49,000-point resistance barrier earlier.
Brazil's national consumer price index (INPC) for October jumped by 2.82 per
cent, after a 1.4 per cent September rise.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds pressured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares ended down but off their lows as concern about the prospects for
the bullion price overshadowed a jump in the metal towards the close.
Industrials were also lower amid uncertainty about the future direction of
world markets.
The overall index finished 35 softer at 5,805, industrials fell 25 to 6,742
and golds closed 46 or 2.1 per cent off at 2,181, after a day's low of
2,160.
Meanwhile, the exchange said that it supported planned legislative changes
permitting dual-capacity trading, which allows members to trade both as
principals and as agents, and which could be passed by March 1995.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich ends weak despite UBS
rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours apart, bourses seemed to be waiting for America: for the US
congressional mid-term elections yesterday, and for the FOMC decision on
interest rates next week, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH was enlivened by a flurry of activity in UBS amid rumours, stirred by
an Italian newspaper report, that the bank had settled its differences with
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision investment trust.
The SMI index, underpinned in early trade by UBS, subsequently turned back
to finish 14.0 lower at 2,543.9.
UBS bearers picked up SFr24 or 2.1 per cent to SFr1,183, off a high of
SFr1,190, and the registered stock was SFr8 or 3.0 per cent ahead at SFr272,
after a peak of SFr280, with the bank's refusal to comment on the rumour
helping to fuel the speculation. BK Vision, which was said to have denied
the rumour informally in the stock market, was marked SFr5 higher at
SFr1,315.
BK Vision owns 18 per cent of UBS registered shares and opposes the bank's
plan to introduce a single, bearer share and scrap the registered stock.
Analysts, who said that there had been rumours of a reconciliation for the
last 10 days, dismissed speculation of a settlement of the dispute ahead of
an extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 22. They said UBS looked
set to win approval for its proposal at the meeting, although some thought
this was likely to be the prelude to a protracted legal battle.
FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's losses, but the two big department
store groups, Karstadt and Kaufhof, stayed weak as the Dax index rose 9.92
to 2,053.44 on the session, and inched higher to 2,056.36 at the end of
afternoon Ibis trading.
Karstadt fell DM18 to DM578 and Kaufhof DM101.10 to DM474.40, the most
obvious manifestation of worries that German consumption is potentially
weak, and that economic recovery is slowing.
Mr Werner Wanke, who gave up his partnership at B Metzler in Frankfurt and
set up his own consulting company there at the beginning of this year, said
that Europe was only about a year out of recession, and that the extremely
sharp rise in interest rates this year, so early in recovery, was likely to
have a negative effect on the economic cycle.
PARIS made a modest recovery, following a lead from the bond markets. The
CAC-40 index gained 15.47 at 1,921.54 as turnover remained low at FFr3.2bn.
Alcatel Alsthom suffered a sharp fall, down FFr14.30 to FFr447.60, on
reports of problems at its German unit. The group had lost FFr11.10 on
Monday after it was reported that France Telecom might make a claim of up to
FFr400m in connection with over-pricing of equipment provided by another
division.
CarnaudMetalbox was unchanged at FFr188 after reporting a rise in nine-month
sales. Hoare Govett, maintaining its buy recommendation on the stock,
commented that the group had benefited recently from a recovery in its
foreign markets, productivity gains and improved market share. The group, it
added, had re-embarked on an acquisitions strategy in areas of strong growth
potential - such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and China - and should see sales in
emerging markets account for 16 per cent by 1998, compared with just 6 per
cent in 1993.
MILAN edged lower amid heavy trading in Credito Italiano and as attention
turned to insurers as they began to count the cost of the floods in
northwest Italy. The Comit index dipped 3.66 to 620.15.
Credito Italiano picked up L44 to L1,596 in hefty volume of 44.8m shares,
amid arbitrage trading between the ordinary shares and the rights, trading
for the final day on the bourse.
Bid speculation in other banks eased. Ambroveneto fell L147 to L4,411 on the
conclusion that the BCI bid would fail. BCI firmed L6 to L3,508.
Generali fell L375 to L37,450 and Toro was L259 lower at L22,650 as the
insurance industry association said that the sector would suffer
substantial, but not disastrous, losses from the recent floods.
AMSTERDAM finished a lacklustre session barely changed, the AEX index
slipping 0.87 to 407.69.
KPN, the telecommunications company which was privatised in the summer, shed
10 cents to Fl 54.80 as James Capel issued a bullish report. The broker
commented that with estimated eps growth of 17 per cent for 1995 and 1996,
an estimated p/e ratio of 12 for 1994, representing a 4 per cent discount to
the Dutch market, appeared to be unjustified.
Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of window coverings, went in the direction
of the market, off 20 cents at Fl 78.20, after reporting a rise in
nine-month sales and forecasting higher full-year profits.
STOCKHOLM mounted what may be a fragile recovery, the Affarsvarlden General
index rising 18.60 or 1.3 per cent to 1,445.80 on unconfirmed rumours of an
opinion poll showing 'yes' voters in the lead ahead of Sunday's EU
membership referendum.
COPENHAGEN concentrated on Den Danske Bank, the commercial bank, following
Monday's news that it was to acquire a controlling interest in Baltica, the
country's largest insurer. The KFX-20 index dipped 0.70 to 91.57 in low
turnover of DKr329m.
Den Danske Bank was unchanged at DKr312, after a high of DKr318, while
Baltica added DKr160 at DKr1,460. Novo Nordisk, which reports nine-month
results today, lost DKr6 at DKr538.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Second high for Sonae
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sonae Investimentos, Portugal's largest conglomerate, hit its second
consecutive 1994 high yesterday on forecasts of strong earnings growth and
increased liquidity, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
The shares were Es56 higher at Es3,734 by the close. Dealers said foreign
investors led the surge, and projected a rise to above Es4,000 by the end of
the year. Yesterday's high represented a 55 per cent jump since June 20,
when the shares began to climb on anticipation of robust half-year results.
Sonae forecasts that net consolidated earnings for 1994 will double to
Es10bn.
Earnings for Sonae's core business of hypermarket and supermarket chains are
expanding rapidly and a turnround is under way at the group's smaller
industrial division, Sonae Industria, based on wood processing.
A recent study by Banco Portugues de Investimento and Schroder Securities
also highlighted strong earnings potential for the group's unlisted
divisions: Sonae Imobiliaria, a shopping mall real estate company, and
Pargeste, which groups together non-core interests.
Mr Belmiro de Azevedo, Sonae chairman and chief shareholder, said last week
that these two subsidiaries would be floated on the Lisbon stock exchange in
1995. The free float of Sonae Industria is also expected to be increased
from about 32.2 per cent to 40 per cent later this month.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US elections subdue
Pacific Basin equities

<TEXT>
Volume stayed low ahead of the US mid-term elections, and share prices
declined marginally, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost 10.20 at 19,609.02 after moving in a narrow
range between 19,637.93 and 19,543.71. Activity was dominated by
cross-trading, companies and banks seeking to realise profits on their
shareholdings. Traders said many investors expected a further fall in share
prices and had tried to unload their holdings in advance.
Volume amounted to 210m shares, against 182m. Analysts said daily average
trading value and volatility, although improving, remained subdued. On the
first section, the ratio of daily turnover to market capitalisation was at a
40-year low, said Mr Alan Livsey, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson. 'It is
much worse than the bear markets in the 1960s and in 1973-74,' he added.
Mr Livsey went on to say that corporate and institutional investors were
still in the process of liquidating their investments and that overseas
investors, who had bought shares earlier this year, had reduced their
activity; so market turnover and volatility, he reckoned, were unlikely to
pick up soon.
The lack of investor participation was highlighted by the margin balance
released by the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday. The outstanding buying
balance fell for the 15th consecutive week, by Y5.9bn to Y2,030bn, while the
balance of stocks sold short increased by Y17.7bn to Y437.3bn.
The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 5.14 to 1,550.27 and the
Nikkei 300 eased 0.49 to 283.92. Losers led gainers by 728 to 227, with 214
issues unchanged. The ISE-Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.71 to 1,272.86.
Profit-taking hit pachinko, or Japanese pinball, related shares.
Nakabayashi, an office equipment maker, fell Y25 to Y953 and Sailor Pen
dropped Y47 to Y889.
Steels and electronics companies met profit-taking. Mitsubishi Electric, the
most active issue of the day, slipped Y2 to Y699 and Nippon Steel Y9 to
Y388. Hitachi declined Y5 to Y969 and NEC Y10 to Y1,170.
Japan Tobacco, the partially privatised tobacco and salt monopoly, shed
Y40,000 to Y1.01m, down 30 per cent from its initial offering price of
Y1.438m. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone receded Y5,000 to Y892,000 and East
Japan Railway was off Y3,000 at Y478,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 125.83 lower at 21,684.17 in volume of 41.5m
shares.
Roundup
Activity around the Pacific Rim was generally muted.
HONG KONG eased in extremely thin trade, preoccupied by expectations of an
increase in US interest rates next week. The Hang Seng index finished 18.22
down at 9,416.09 in turnover estimated at HKDollars 1.80bn, against Monday's
revised HKDollars 2.30bn.
Looking to the year ahead, Baring Securities expected interest rates to rise
further over the next two quarters at least, with no reversal in the trend
before late 1995.
SEOUL registered another record close in active trade, after a late buying
spurt of primary blue chips outweighed earlier selective selling. The
composite index closed 5.76 firmer at 1,138.75.
Trading companies were in demand on hopes that they would benefit most from
the government's plan to lift its ban on investment in North Korea. Samsung
and Hyundai rose by their daily upper limits of Won1,300 and Won1,000, to
Won36,400 and Won25,700.
SINGAPORE was lower in cautious trade, the Straits Times Industrial index
losing 4.65 at 2,327.01. The multimedia company Aztech Systems rose 5 cents
to SDollars 1.45 in heavy volume of 10.8m shares on news that it had bought
into the US-based Reveal Computer Products and had entered a joint venture
in Indonesia.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up from the day's lows after a session which saw
speculators selling stocks in the absence of fresh buying incentives, and
the reallocation of share portfolios by institutions.
The composite index finished 12.18 down at 1,057.96 in turnover of 156m
shares.
MANILA saw heavy selling on the rise in the peso against the dollar. The
composite index lost 41.43 at 3,006.51.
The peso's rise and PLDT's Dollars 3 decline in New York overnight drove the
telephone stock's local price 5 per cent lower to 1,315 pesos. PNB fell 3.7
per cent to 327.50 pesos.
WELLINGTON was undermined by weakness in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge,
down by 6 and 5 cents respectively to NZDollars 5.32 and NZDollars 4.39. The
NZSE-40 Capital index retreated 22.02 to 2,085.64.
FCL suffered some profit-taking in spite of reporting at its annual meeting
that its current year earnings, before tax and abnormal items, should
substantially exceed those seen in 1993-94.
BZW in London recently published a bullish assessment of the New Zealand
equity market, commenting that it offered 'one of the more exciting
prospects longer term', and suggested that a more optimistic outlook for US
bonds, which have a marked effect on the market's performance, could signal
an upgrade from the current neutral stance.
SYDNEY weakened in thin turnover after the start of trading was delayed by
more than an hour due to technical problems with the stock exchange's
automated trading system.
The All Ordinaries index dipped 12.0 to 1,967.3, its lowest since July 11.
Westpac slipped 7 cents to ADollars 4.29 after reporting 12-month earnings
at the lower end of expectations.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US elections keep dollar in narrow trading
range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday again traded in a narrow range as the market sat on its
hands awaiting the result of the US mid-term congressional elections, writes
Philip Gawith.
Traders said, however, that next week's meeting of the policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee would be more important for the US currency.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.5097, from DM1.5172, and at Y97.005,
from Y97.31. It has slipped back over the past two days from the levels
reached at the end of last week, in the wake of supportive intervention by
the US Federal Reserve. It ended New York trading yesterday at DM1.5085 and
Y97.10.
With no important data releases, little comment of note, and the uncertainty
of US elections and the impending FOMC meeting, foreign exchange activity
was extremely subdued.
In Europe, the D-Mark was stronger against most currencies, helped by
political worries in countries such as France and Italy, and uncertainty
surrounding European Union membership in Sweden and other Scandinavian
countries. It finished at FFr3.436 against the French franc, from FFr3.427.
The trade weighted sterling index ended at 80.5 from 80.6. The pound closed
at DM2.4432, about a pfennig lower than a week ago.
The general market view is that the congressional elections ought not to
have too much impact on the dollar. Insofar as they do, it is likely to be
negative. Mr Rob Hayward, economist at Bank of America in London, said the
possibility of Republican gains leaving Mr Clinton a lame-duck president
would be bad news for the dollar.
Also damaging for the dollar is the growing perception that last week's
intervention was politically motivated, designed only to ensure that the
Democrats did not contest yesterday's election against the backdrop of a
falling dollar.
'The market's view is that if the dollar weakens after the results, the Fed
will be less inclined to intervene,' said Mr Hayward. There were already
indications that the market was again testing the downside on the US
currency.
Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, commented: 'People
are waiting for decisive action. It is not the elections that are going to
be relevant. It is what the Fed does next week.
'The market has hyped itself into the view that it needs to get more than a
50 basis-point rise in rates, and it must be doubtful that it is going to
get it. The Fed has got to do something dramatic, or the need to do
something dramatic has to be seen not to be there. But the market is not
prepared to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt.'
Mr Thomas added that the potential upside for the dollar lay in US
short-term rates rising above German short rates; 'historically that has
always been good for the currency whose rates are rising'.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said the presentation of a
monetary tightening was probably as important as its scope. He added that
the Fed's statement last time it raised rates, that another tightening would
not be necessary for some time, may have undermined the effectiveness of
higher rates.
Probably the main mover on the day was the Philippines peso, which rose by 3
per cent to an intraday high of 23.52 pesos against the dollar, from
Monday's close of 24.2 pesos.
Mr John Davitte, emerging markets analyst at IDEA in London, said the peso
had been buoyed by strong capital inflows into the stock market, and
remittances from foreign based Filipino workers.
Two other factors helping the peso recently have been less assertive central
bank intervention, to curb the currency's rise, and strong economic
fundamentals. Economic growth is expected to be 5 to 6 per cent this year.
Mr Davitte issued a note of caution, however, saying that the central bank
would be unlikely to allow the peso's rise, from around 26 pesos early last
month, to continue unhindered. Indeed, President Fidel Ramos announced
yesterday that forward foreign exchange cover on oil imports was being
scrapped in an effort to halt the peso's rise.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 680m late assistance, and Pounds 437m
help at established rates, in its daily money market operations. The
shortage was forecast at Pounds 1.15bn.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian companies get head
start in race for Chinese gold
</HEADLINE>

A company owned by American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, and
Power Corporation, the Canadian investment holding company, is close to
finalising two gold exploration and development ventures with the China
National Gold Corporation.
The letters of intent signed yesterday are part of an ambitious drive by the
two Canadian companies, operating as Barrick Power Gold Corporation of
China, to lead the modernisation and expansion of China's fragmented
gold-mining industry.
Barrick Power, which is 75 per cent owned by Barrick and 25 per cent by
Power, is confident that it has a head start on other western mining
companies in China. It has a staff of more than a dozen in its Beijing
office. CNGC agreed earlier this year to submit prospective gold-mining
properties to Barrick Power for evaluation.
Under one of the proposed joint ventures, Barrick Power will acquire a 75
per cent stake and provide management, technology and financing for the
Paishanlou project in Liaoning province. The venture will have an initial
capital of USDollars 40m. A pre-feasibility study, started earlier this
year, envisages an open-pit mine producing 30,000 tonnes of ore a day, plus
a 4,000 tonnes-per-day mill. Barrick Power said that further drilling was
due to take place next year near the existing deposit and that a mining plan
would be completed by the end of 1995.
The second joint venture centres on the Changkeng deposit in Guangdong
province. Samples from this refractory deposit have already been tested at
Barrick's Goldstrike mine in Nevada, with 'high recovery rates'.
Barrick Power said that it planned a 'major' exploration programme at
Changkeng in 1995 once the joint venture company had been set up.
The announcements coincided with a 400-strong trade mission to China led by
Canada's prime minister Mr Jean Chretien.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea growers have mixed feelings
on bumper harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India, the world's biggest tea producer, is racing towards a record crop of
anything up to 770m kg compared with 758.01m in 1993. By August the harvest
had reached 466m kg, up 11.8m from the same stage last year.
Producers' associations have started thinking aloud, however, about whether
they should be asking the tea estates to cut production in December, when in
the north mostly common to inferior varieties are plucked. Last December's
record production of 43.51m kg was one of the major factors behind the fall
in tea prices from which the market has yet to recover.
It is still being debated to what level the December production of the
gardens in the north and the south should be restricted. Moreover, even if
the associations are able to reach an agreement on cutting production it is
by no means certain that all the gardens, particularly the small ones, will
fall into line.
According to the Tea Board officials: 'The silver lining is that the tea
companies today are mostly market driven. Seeing the premium available for
quality tea, they are investing in the modernisation of plantations and
tea-processing factories. Even the small, single garden tea companies in the
south are making efforts to produce better tea'.
The Indian domestic market, which is likely to grow to 585m kg from 578m kg
last year, wants medium to good quality tea. The share of plainer and poor
end-of-season varieties in the total tea production is to fall in the
current year, even in the absence of an agreement on December production
cuts.
In the eight months to August, Sri Lankan production rose 14.9m kg to
164.5m. In the same period, however, the Kenyan crop, hit by bad weather,
fell by 18.4m kg to 122.9m. While Bangladesh stepped up production by 1.9m
kg to 31.2m, the Malawi crop was steady at about 28m kg and Indonesia's was
reported to have suffered a setback.
By the end of August, world tea production had reached 870.3m kg, up from
864.6m kg in the same period last year.
In 1993 world production, aided by strong growth in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya
and Malawi and despite the crop shortfall in Indonesia, rose by 142.5m kg to
1.47bn.
As for India, the gardens in the north, including Assam, produced an extra
4.82m kg at 345.24m while those in the south harvested 120.67m kg, up 6.95m.
In keeping with the trends in recent years, the industry had further raised
the production of CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea to 409.76m kg from 378.11m,
while there was a drastic cut in production of orthodox tea to 52.16m kg
from 72.27m kg. Green tea output was up marginally to 3.98m kg.
Orthodox tea sales have fallen as currency constraints have cut imports into
former Soviet countries. 'While we continue to face problems with shipments
to Iran, Russia, traditionally the most important destination for Indian
tea, is not buying enough. The same is the case with the other CIS
countries,' said an exporter.
However, India is selling more tea to the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Poland.
The rising production and the slow export offtake have kept prices low at
the Calcutta auction. The average for Assam leaf CTC up to the end of
September was Rs50.84 a kilogram, against Rs53.30 in the same period last
year.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures bounce ahead of
Brazil's official crop estimate - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures prices leapt yesterday as traders
took the view that Brazil's official crop estimate for 1995-96, expected
today, might be at the lower end of the range of recent forecasts.
The January contract closed at Dollars 3,570 a tonne, Dollars 10 off the
day's high but still Dollars 131 higher on balance, after Brazilian broker
Wolthers and Associates predicted that the crop would be 13.95m bags (60kg
each). On October 26 the Brazilian Government it made a preliminary estimate
of 13m-15m bags.
Traders said the sudden move higher triggered stop-loss buying orders,
especially just above Dollars 3,500 on the January contract. And the move
higher was helped by a rumour highlighted in a Brazilian newspaper that the
government was considering a 10 per cent export tax on coffee.
White SUGAR futures recovered earlier losses to trade at fresh four-year
highs in late afternoon.
'Sentiment is still very firm,' said one trader. 'People are expecting the
market to go even higher.' He cited continued confusion over the future of
the Russian/Cuban oil-for-sugar deal as one of the main bullish factors.
At the London Metal Exchange BASE METALS prices recouped early losses and,
aided by a strong rally in copper and aluminium, ended with most showing
gains at the close.
'A sharp correction was on the cards early today but they turned round
quicker than expected. I think a lot of the afternoon buying was
short-covering,' a trader said.
'These markets are still rather nervous but the (speculators) are not
letting go. . . we could be testing the highs again soon,' said another.
ALUMINIUM had dictated the early trend. News that extra metal from the US
north-west might be available as a result of additional power and of a
possible potline restart at Ghana's Valco sent prices lower.
But once the initial wave of selling had been absorbed an across-the-board
fall in stocks, except for aluminium alloy, was the signal for buyers to
return and movements became rather choppy.
Quality buying and short-covering helped lift the GOLD prices after a
bearish start.
A firmer opening in New York also contributed as the London bullion market
price rose Dollars 2.05 to close at Dollars 385.10 a troy ounce. But
resitance appeared to be capping the recovery, a dealer said.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Former eastern bloc 'could pose
food threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful economic reforms in the former Soviet bloc could turn those
countries into net food exporters and depress world food prices early in the
next century, a report predicts today.
'If the policies that currently distort food markets are phased out, eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union would shift from a net food deficit to a
surplus of 30m to 50m tonnes of food per year,' says the report by the
Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.
The study says international grain prices could drop by up to 20 per cent as
food from the former communist bloc enters the world market.
Increased food production in eastern Europe could upset predictions of
higher world prices resulting from the Uruguay Round world trade agreement
to reduce subsidised exports by western European countries.
Lower world prices would hurt both big exporting nations and poor farmers in
developing countries, who would suffer if food imports become cheaper than
domestic production, the report says.
The institute carries out research into sustainable food production,
improved incomes and nutrition, and better agricultural trading conditions
for developing countries.
'The majority of the world's poor subsist on agriculture and
agricultural-related activities in the rural areas of developing countries,'
says the author, Mr Rod Tyers, an economics professor at the Australian
National University.
'Cheaper food would decrease the level of economic activity from which they
earn their living.'
His report highlights the impact of the sharp decline in consumer demand for
meat in the former Soviet bloc, which has led to a fall in the number of
cattle and pigs and cut the amount of imported grain needed to feed them.
'This change alone has caused so substantial a reduction in net food
imports, it could potentially reverse the direction of the whole region's
net food trade,' it says.
Eastern European nations are expected to be self-sufficient in food by 2000
on average, a sharp turnaround from the 1980s when the Soviet bloc was a net
food importer.
However, the report emphasises that the shift towards self-sufficiency and
net exports of staple foods will take place only if collective farms are
broken up into smaller, more efficient units and if transport, processing
and marketing systems are reformed successfully.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commission to investigate
Australian sugar price 'war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A review of Australia's sugar industry is to be undertaken by the Trade
Practices Commission, the country's competition watchdog, following
speculation that a sugar price war is being waged by Australian companies.
The TPC yesterday noted that 'media reports have indicated that long-term
sugar contracts are being executed by Australian companies at significant
losses'. This situation would be 'unusual' in the sugar market and warranted
investigation, the TPC said.
The move was welcomed by Mackay Refined Sugars, which alleges that CSR,
traditionally the big player in the country's refining industry, has
embarked on 'a deliberate strategy of selling refined sugar at below cost
for a number of years forward'. MRS is a joint venture between Mackay Sugar
Co-operative Association and London-based trading house, ED &amp; F. Man, and
has established a new, low-cost refinery in Queensland.
MRS claimed that it was seen as 'a threat to the established market refiners
and in particular to CSR which has historically dominated the market'. CSR,
which originally hoped to establish a joint venture with MRS before
encountering TPC opposition, said it would co-operate fully.
'All our sales of refined sugar, without exception, have above our costs of
supplying the sugar concerned,' it said.
Jamaica's raw sugar production is to be increased by 100,000 tonnes a year
with an expansion in the capacity of three of the island's larger mills,
which were bought by a private company from the government earlier this
year.
The Sugar Industry Company of Jamaica will spend USDollars 70m over the next
five years to rehabilitate the mills, bringing their aggregate output to
220,000 tonnes per year by the 1998-99 harvest. Their combined production
this year was 120,000 tonnes.
The company will also rehabilitate the island's only sugar refinery, lifting
annual production to 30,000 tonnes, and reducing the need for Jamaica to
import whites. Jamaica's raw sugar production this year was 220,000 tonnes,
and the industry is forecasting the next harvest to yield 240,000 tonnes.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries higher after strong auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices edged higher yesterday after a relatively strong auction
of three-year notes demonstrated solid demand for new paper. Activity was
moderate as traders awaited news on US elections and a producer price report
due on Thursday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  7/16 at 93 1/16 yielding
8.114 per cent and the two-year note up  1/16 at 99 23/32 , to yield 7.011
per cent.
Early in the day prices were steady on trader fears of low demand for the
medium-term notes, but by midday prices had climbed moderately as sentiment
turned positive ahead of the 1pm auction.
Analysts expect a 0.1 per cent rise in the producer price index for October.
A bigger increase could trigger fears of a large or early interest rate
increase by the Fed.
The markets watched for election news but with little consensus on their
impact. Mr Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities in New York, said markets could
be buoyed if Republicans make significant gains in both houses of the
legislature.
Also overshadowing markets was the increase in interest rates widely
expected from next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market
committee.
European government bonds ended another calm session slightly firmer,
supported by buoyant German bunds and firmer US Treasuries.
However, volume has dwindled sharply and traders said investor flows were
few and far between. 'A lot of people have in effect shut their books for
the year,' said one analyst.
German bunds recouped early losses to end nearly  1/2 point higher,
underpinned by firm demand for the first tranche of the government's latest
10-year issue.
Although demand for the paper was said to be subdued, dealers reported keen
interest from several banks, some of which were buying bonds to cover short
positions they had established prior to the sale.
The Bundesbank allotted DM3bn of the 7.5 per cent paper to the federal bond
consortium at 99.75, yielding 7.54 per cent. A further DM3bn to DM4bn of the
bonds are expected to be sold at today's auction; together with the
Bundesbank's market tending allotment, the issue is expected to total
DM10bn.
Earlier in the day, bunds were depressed by news of a larger than expected
drop in the October jobless rate, but shrugged off a small upward revision
in the September M3 money supply growth rate. The December bund future on
DTB closed at 89.41, up 0.41.
UK gilts rose on the back of firmer European and US bonds, with little in
the way of news or capital flows to drive prices.
'Until the FOMC meeting (on November 15), it's likely to remain pretty
trendless,' said one dealer. After that, market participants will turn their
attention to the Budget on November 29. 'We often have a slight bull run up
to the Budget because everyone hopes they'll do the right thing,' he added.
The December long gilt futures contract rose by  13/32 to 101 3/32 .
Swedish bonds clawed back some of their recent sharp losses, with the yield
on the 11-year benchmark falling by 8 basis points to 11.57 per cent.
However, the market is likely to remain jittery and volatile ahead of
Sunday's referendum on European Union membership.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Strong demand for Pounds 200m deal from
EIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank yesterday launched a Pounds 200m issue of
six-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 15 basis points over UK gilts.
Lead managers HSBC Markets and Warburg Securities were surprised by the
strength of demand from Asia Pacific investors. Interest also came from
European central banks and European retail and institutional investors, they
said.
The issue brings the total raised by the EIB this year directly in the
sterling market to Pounds 900m. The proceeds were not swapped out of
sterling.
The World Bank's Y200bn 10-year global offer, which was launched on Tuesday,
was priced yesterday at 10 basis points over the Japanese government bond No
172.
In spite of early concern that the issue would fail to attract interest from
investors outside Japan, much of the offering was successfully placed
yesterday with investors in Europe and the US, lead managers Merrill Lynch,
Nikko and Nomura reported.
About 30 per cent of the bonds were placed in Europe, 50 per cent in Japan,
10 per cent in the rest of Asia and 10 per cent in the US, they said.
A syndicate official at Nomura said the bank had sold Y25bn of its Y40bn
ticket to European investors. Sixty per cent of this trade was accounted for
by investors switching out of existing similar 10-year yen-denominated
bonds, while the remaining 40 per cent were outright sales, he said.
Only about Y6bn of bonds had been returned to the lead managers, an official
at Nikko said. The proceeds from the offer, which is likely to be the World
Bank's last yen issue this year, were not swapped out of yen, a source close
to the deal said.
In the Canadian dollar sector, Bell Canada, the country's largest
telecommunication company, launched a CDollars 150m issue of five-year bonds
with a spread of 36 basis points over Canadian government bonds.
Joint lead manager Wood Gundy said demand for Canadian dollar bonds with a
five-year maturity was strong and there was a good response to the issue,
mainly from retail investors in Europe.
The proceeds from the offer, the first time Bell Canada has tapped the
euromarkets since July 1993, were not swapped, a source said.
In the Australian dollar sector, Coca-Cola Amatil launched a ADollars 75m
issue of five-year bonds which found demand among retail investors in Europe
and Asia Pacific, lead manager Hambros Bank said.

</HEADLINE>

There has been considerable sympathy in European financial circles for the
plight of Creditanstalt.
Austria's second largest bank has been largely paralysed for the past three
years because the country's government has repeatedly failed to carry
through its promise to complete its privatisation.
However, the one area where CA has nevertheless been able to make a
significant and successful strategic thrust during this uncertain period is
in eastern Europe.
The bank itself has opened branches or commercial banking subsidiaries in
Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Ljubljana.
Meanwhile, a fledgling subsidiary, Creditanstalt Investment Bank, has pushed
its way to the top of the league tables alongside the large US and British
investment banks in many eastern European investment banking markets.
Indeed, CAIB ranks well ahead of its rivals in a listing of 1993
privatisation assignments in eastern Europe by the newsletter Privatisation
International, with 30 jobs compared with only 20 for Samuel Montagu, its
nearest competitor.
That this has happened is all a bit of an accident. CA Investment Bank was
created in 1989 to focus on Austrian clients. At the time, Austria still
operated with a house bank tradition under which it was impossible for a
bank to charge its large corporate clients for advisory services.
'We wanted to get them used to paying for M&amp;A (merger and acquisition)
services,' Mr Wolfgang Lafite, CAIB managing director, says. The bank was
capitalised at a mere Sch10m and sent on its way.
However, after the Iron Curtain lifted, it became apparent that there was a
great need for corporate finance services in many of the eastern European
countries and a wide open field for those who could provide them.
'We went systematically into all the countries where we thought Austria and
Creditanstalt could play a role,' Mr Lafite says. In general, that meant all
the former countries of the Austro-Hungarian empire where ties of language
and business custom could be levered.
Today, CAIB has offices in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, Bratislava and Sofia
and has just opened in Bucharest. Its range of activities has expanded from
corporate finance to securities business and private banking.
CAIB's first major assignment in 1989 was a private placement for
Graboplast, the Hungarian plastics group which went public earlier this
year. The bank has gone on to become the largest issuing house and broker on
the volatile Budapest market.
Its other coup was to plunge into the radical mass privatisation programme
in what was then Czechoslovakia in mid-1992. It was the only foreign bank to
set up a voucher investment fund to help Czech citizens channel their stakes
in the first round of privatisation of some 1,500 companies, and its fund is
still the sixth largest in the Czech Republic.
'No other foreign bank was so optimistic, and that gives us a very
profitable business, plus a platform for our securities and corporate
finance businesses,' says Mr Lafite.
Largely because of its experience in the Czech Republic, CAIB is the only
foreign bank leading one of the 17 consortia that are on the short-list of
Poland's forthcoming mass privatisation programme.
Now it is eyeing Bulgaria and Romania. Last year, it advised Amylum, a
US-UK-Belgian consortium that bought a Dollars 20m maize products plant at
Razgrad in Bulgaria.
'Mass privatisation programmes are bound to happen,' says Mr Lafite,
although he expects they will follow the Russian model with an explosion of
secondary market activity following free distributions of shares.
The bank has made profits every year since its foundation, and half of its
present Sch110m capital comes from retained earnings.
Mr Lafite says the bank has been careful to be aware of its limitations. It
has eschewed Moscow, for example, where CS First Boston made a killing last
year, feeling that it has no special leverage there.
CAIB has neither the skills nor the capital to compete with the big US and
UK banks on the few very large deals that come along.
Instead, the bank points out to the large numbers of small and medium-sized
eastern European companies that it is their neighbour and is exclusively
committed to their region.
There is, of course, a danger in this. As Mr Lafite says: 'We have all our
eggs in this basket. If the clock is ever turned back . . . .'

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructuring helps Omron to
rise 42%

<TEXT>
Extensive restructuring enabled Omron, one of the largest makers of
automation control components, to post sharply increased profits on slightly
higher turnover in the six months to September 30.
Recurring profits - before tax and extraordinary items - rose by 42 per cent
on the same period a year ago to Y3.1bn (Dollars 31.85m), while sales grew
by 1.4 per cent to Y176.2bn. After tax earnings increased by 38.2 per cent
to Y1.9bn.
The company said domestic demand remained very weak, and that the increase
in turnover was produced largely by higher exports. Competitive cost-cutting
and strong growth in overseas markets had helped to overcome the effects of
the strong yen.
Among the company's main divisions, only electronic fund transfer systems
saw substantially higher growth in the period - up 13 per cent  - as demand
for bank automation systems remained strong.
The core control components and systems division achieved a small gain in
turnover on higher exports.
Restructuring would continue in the remainder of the financial year ending
next March, the company said, and would include development of new
businesses and products and the establishment of a regional headquarters in
China in an attempt to expand business there.
Omron forecast annual recurring profits of Y8.5bn, up by 13 per cent on last
year, with turnover higher by 2 per cent at Y378bn.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hard times for Japan's two
biggest watchmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's watchmaking industry is still in the grip of hard times, according
to the latest interim results from Seiko and Citizen Watch, the two leading
producers.
Both companies suffered from the erosion of the yen value of their export
income, because of the strength of the Japanese currency and the price
sensitivity of their high-volume products. They provide an example of how
exporters of low-margin products have found it hard to adjust to the yen's
rise.
The two groups have tried to diversify by making small computers, but have
met fierce competition in the sector.
The result was a loss for Seiko and a sharp decline in profits for Citizen
at the parent company level for the six months to September.
Seiko yesterday passed its interim dividend after reporting a reduced
interim loss of nearly Y1.02bn (USDollars 10.4m), on sales down 10.8 per
cent at Y108.7bn.
The economic outlook is so uncertain that Seiko was unable to make a
forecast for the full year.
It warned, however, that it was under pressure in the current half from the
yen's volatility and a slow recovery in personal spending.
Seiko announced late last year that it would reduce costs substantially by
ending production of personal computers for overseas markets, a factor in
its reduced interim loss.
Citizen fared slightly better, with a 61 per cent decline in recurring
profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y2.4bn, on sales down by
22.5 per cent to Y96.2bn.
It will pay a maintained interim dividend of Y4.5 per share, but forecasts
that full year current profits will fall by 43 per cent to Y6bn.
Sales of watches, which account for more than half of Citizens' turnover,
fell by 11.2 per cent.
Like Seiko, the strength of the Japanese currency eroded the yen value of
its export sales, which account for just over 70 per cent of total turnover.
However, Citizen's computer products did even worse than its core
watchmaking business, with sales down 46 per cent.
The company also suffered from the cancellation of an order to make notebook
computers for computer producers to sell under their own names.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Westpac profits advance sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Westpac yesterday began the Australian banks' reporting season by announcing
an after-tax profit of ADollars 704.7m (USDollars 533.8m) in the 12 months
to end-September, up from ADollars 39.2m the previous year and a ADollars
1.56bn loss in 1991-92.
The profit figure translated into earnings per share of 35 cents, on a
diluted basis, compared with 1 cent previously. The final unfranked dividend
was set at 10 cents a share, compared with 6 cents, making a total for the
year of 18 cents.
The bank attributed the substantial improvement to higher net interest
income, cost reductions, improvements in the efficiency ratio and a
significant reduction in both the bad debt charge and the size of its
impaired loan portfolio.
Net interest income for the year stood at ADollars 2.76bn, compared with
ADollars 2.63bn, while non-interest expenses fell to ADollars 2.56bn from
ADollars 2.92bn.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts was almost halved to ADollars 694.9m
from ADollars 1.29bn in 1992-93. Westpac also said that the ratio of net
impaired assets to shareholders' equity stood at 30 per cent by
end-September, compared with 65 per cent a year earlier.
The general provision for doubtful debts at year-end was ADollars 735m
(ADollars 700m) - including a ADollars 35m provision for drought-related
problems - while specific provisions stood at ADollars 1.61bn (ADollars
1.98bn).
The group's tier one capital ratio at year-end was 8.9 per cent, compared
with 7.4 per cent previously.
The bank said it had moved from 'a recovery phase to one striving for
improved performance and growth'.
Its main focus in the current year would be on implementing a retail branch
restructuring programme, further reduction in impaired assets, new product
development and additional efficiencies. It said that it was budgeting for
further profits growth - with some analysts suggesting it could make between
ADollars 1bn and ADollars 1.1bn.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aiwa ahead at Y4.6bn after six
months

Aiwa, the maker of audio and visual equipment, yesterday announced a
near-doubling of recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - in
spite of Japan's sluggish market and the impact of a high yen.
Non-consolidated recurring profits in the six months to September rise to
Y4.6bn (Dollars 47.27m) from Y2.3bn a year ago as sales rose 35 per cent to
Y110.2bn from Y81.7bn.
Net profit in the period surged 166 per cent to Y2.1bn from Y797m. Aiwa
expects to pay a dividend of Y5, up from Y3 in the previous first half.
Among Japan's troubled audio-visual companies, Aiwa, a subsidiary of Sony,
stands out as a success story.
For several years the company has raised its overseas manufacturing ratio to
81 per cent - a strategy which has helped it overcome the adverse impact of
the high yen.
Aiwa's rapid response to the impact of a high yen has enabled it to raise
profits in spite of a high overseas sales ratio of 78 per cent.
It has launched a series of innovative products, particularly small stereo
units, at low prices which have been a success at home and abroad. As a
result, its domestic sales rose 17 per cent in spite of the continuing
sluggishness of the market, while overseas sales grew 41 per cent.
Sales of audio equipment rose 27 per cent on popular demand for its
miniature component stereo sets. Video sales surged 71 per cent due to the
strength of TVs which incorporate a video tape recorder and of video
recorders which offer simple functions.
Aiwa is expanding its information equipment business, and strong sales of PC
modems helped the division's sales rise by 75 per cent.
The company forecasts full-year sales of Y229bn against Y178.7bn last year
and recurring profits to climb to Y9bn compared with Y6.7bn. Net profits are
forecast at Y4bn, up from Y2.4bn.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Qantas regains right to fly
direct to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Qantas, the Australian flagship carrier in which British Airways has a 25
per cent stake, has won back the rights to fly direct to China from
Australia. At present, the only carrier offering this service is Air China,
with other carriers flying via Hong Kong, writes Nikki Tait.
Qantas held the rights previously, and operated a service during the 1980s.
However, this was abandoned in 1987, on the grounds that it was
unprofitable. The rights were then won by Australia Air, a new carrier which
tried to raise the necessary capital to begin operations last year but was
eventually unsuccessful.
The International Air Services Commission, which allocates routes, said it
expected Qantas to operate one Boeing 767-300 service a week.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Man from Wells Fargo hopes to
set stage for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Joss, the former Wells Fargo executive imported from the US two years
ago to sort out the turmoil at Westpac, the most troubled of Australia's big
banks, was asked yesterday whether he had succeeded in changing the
company's culture.
'No, not by any stretch of the imagination,' he replied, bluntly. Mr Joss
added that while he 'feels good' about the start that has been made, his
experience and observations of other companies suggested that this would be
a decade-long process.
Shareholders, who sat through Westpac's miserable performance in the early
1990s and are still seeing dividends at one-third of 1990 levels, may be
getting worried. Fortunately, Westpac's financial performance showed a
significant improvement yesterday, even if internal changes are taking
longer to effect.
The bottom-line profit figure of ADollars 704.7m was below the more
ambitious market forecasts, causing the shares to dip 7 cents to ADollars
4.29. But analysts came away from yesterday's afternoon's briefing
suggesting that this may have been harsh. The shortfall on expectations,
they said, could be explained by unforeseen items: the provision for
drought-related loan problems, and a ADollars 66.3m charge before tax
related to the pre-payment of superannuation expenses, which compared with a
ADollars 296.1m surplus in the previous year. In future, the bank proposes
to adopt UK accounting practice - at least, until an appropriate Australian
standard is agreed - which should remove this volatility.
The analysts' main focus was on three issues: Westpac's problem loan
experience, its net interest margin, and its progress in achieving cost/
efficiency gains.
On the first, the picture looked a lot brighter than in previous years, with
total impaired assets falling to ADollars 3.8bn by end-September from
ADollars 8bn in 1992 and ADollars 6.6bn in 1993. That meant that the ratio
of impaired assets to total loans and acceptances stood at about 5 per cent,
half the level two years ago. 'The key is problem assets,' said one analyst
at ANZ McCaughan, 'and Westpac is getting itself into shape.'
However, Mr Joss is the first to admit that more needs to be done. The
ratio, he commented yesterday, 'has got to get lower', and he indicated a 1
to 2 per cent target range as a sign of 'a really healthy bank'. Although
net proceeds from property disposals were about ADollars 1.6bn last year,
Westpac says it still has about ADollars 1bn worth of property to be sold.
The net interest margin improved by 50 basis points to 3.5 per cent in the
year. Westpac said that the reduced cost of funding impaired assets, as
these fell, accounted for an improvement of 30 basis points.
The spread on productive overseas assets rose by a similar amount, as the
bank cut back overseas operations, exited lower yielding corporate
facilities, and focused on 'core Australasian customer relations'.
The cost improvement was seen as slightly sluggish in the second half, with
branch restructuring taking a little longer than expected to implement.
Average staff numbers in the second half were 31,681, compared with more
than 45,000 in 1990. Mr Joss says that staff numbers will fall again in the
current year, but at a slower rate than in previous years.
The ratio of non-interest expenses to income has reached 59.5 per cent
overall, compared with 65.5 per cent previously.
In spite of yesterday's profit news, the jury is still out on the management
changes at Westpac. Mr Joss has brought in a host of new senior executives -
in many cases, from outside Australia - and some think that the objectivity
which flows from this strategy compares favourably with the less radical
approach by rivals.
But not everyone is giving the high-profile chief executive, whose US-style
remuneration package and management approach has caused much local comment,
all the credit for recent financial improvements. 'That's a little bit too
favourable towards Joss. He's benefiting, but it's really external changes
like the improvement in the property market and so on,' was one less
generous comment yesterday.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: TNT back in the black but payout
unlikely this year

TNT, the Australian transportation group, returned to the black in the first
quarter of its current year with a profit of ADollars 18.3m, compared with a
loss of ADollars 33.2m in the same period of the previous year.
Sales were ADollars 1.45bn, against ADollars 1.4bn, and operating profit
before abnormal items rose to ADollars 34.4m from ADollars 23.4m.
The release of first-quarter results coincided with the company's annual
meeting in Sydney. Mr Fred Millar, chairman, told the meeting that in spite
of the improvement in recent profits figures, he still thought it was
unlikely that TNT would pay a dividend in the current year. However, he was
'confident' that dividends would resume in 1995-96.
The chairman said Spain remained a problem area for the company, but other
European interests generally had made good progress.
He also forecast a 'significant improvement' at GD Express Worldwide, the
company's express delivery venture, which it owns jointly with various
European and Canadian post offices, during the current period.
Mr Millar added that TNT was in 'detailed discussions' with potential
partners for logistics activities in China, Thailand and Indonesia, although
it did not expect developments in these countries to move quickly.
Mr David Mortimer, chief executive, said there were no plans at present to
float Ansett, the airline which is owned by TNT and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation. He added that TNT had not urged the Australian government to
keep Air New Zealand out of the Australian internal market, and that it was
not on the current agenda to bring a third party into Ansett.
The government's recent decision to freeze an agreement which would have
allowed the New Zealand carrier to fly domestic Australian routes from
November 1 has caused a row between the two countries.
There has been speculation that the government is keen to see an alliance
formed between Ansett and Air Zealand, thus extending Australia's domestic
airline duopoly across the Tasman.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHP considers Chinese site

Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, is to look into the
commercial feasibility of developing an integrated power plant and open-cut
coal mine near Hohhot, the provincial capital of the Chinese region of Inner
Mongolia.
The company said yesterday that a letter of intent had been signed this week
with Zhungeer Coal Industry Corporation, part of China's ministry of coal
industry, permitting a pre-feasibility study. The study, which will
determine the size and timing of the potential project, should be completed
within 12 months, and will be undertaken by BHP Minerals and BHP Power.
The Chinese project is the second significant potential development
announced in recent days by BHP Power, a newly-formed 'fifth leg' to BHP's
business. Last week, the subsidiary said it had submitted a proposal to the
Vietnamese government, seeking to conduct a feasibility study for a large
integrated power and urea development.
Also included in the proposed project consortium were Japan's Tomen
Corporation, General Electric of the US, and Canada's Cominco Fertiliser,
although BHP would be the lead company.
Although the Australian company declined to speculate on the cost of the
Vietnamese project, it has been suggested it could be worth more than
USDollars 800m, making it by far the biggest foreign investment in communist
Vietnam. The largest project to date is a USDollars 288m cement plant being
built by Taiwan's Ching Fong group.
The Vietnamese project could include a 'world-scale' urea fertiliser plant,
producing around 600,000 tonnes per annum, which would be integrated with a
680MW power station, using gas turbine combined cycle technology.
The project would rely on natural gas, from gas reserves recently discovered
off the south Vietnamese coast.

<TEXT>
Reliance Industries (RIL), India's largest private sector company, yesterday
consolidated its place as a leader in the plastics market by merging with
two of its associates, Reliance Polypropylene Limited (RPPL) and Reliance
Polyethylene Limited (RPEL).
The directors of the three companies met in Bombay yesterday to finalise the
amalgamation, which will come into effect from January 1 1995.
Shareholders of RPPL and RPEL will get 30 and 25 RIL shares respectively per
100 shares, based on two independent valuations. Itochu Corporation of
Japan, which helped Reliance set up separate plants for the two companies in
1992, will continue to be an investor in RIL and maintain its earlier
agreements for export marketing rights.
Reliance said it would now have the benefit of equity-funded projects with a
short gestation period, without adding to its existing debt profile. RIL's
weighted average equity will now increase to about Rs3.63bn (Dollars 115.5m)
from Rs3.36bn as of March 31 1995, and the company's reserves will swell by
over Rs6bn.
Reliance is building a polypropylene plant, with a technology licence from
Union Carbide of the US. It is due to be commissioned by the end of next
year and will have an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes.
It is also building a polyethylene plant with a technology licence from Du
Pont Canada. The facility is expected to be commissioned by early 1996, and
will have a capacity of 200,000 tonnes.
With these two plants added to RIL's manufacturing capacity, the company
will be India's largest producer of both petrochemical products. The company
said the commissioning of the plants had been timed to coincide with the
start-up of the world's largest multi-feed cracker project, being built in
Hazira in Gujarat.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Matif president happy to follow
his own rules - Gerard Pfauwadel can see his legislation at work in the
French futures market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, president of Matif, the French futures and options
market, is in a potentially awkward position when it comes to assessing the
legislation that frames his work - he is the man who wrote the rules.
Like many of his contemporaries, Pfauwadel has moved easily from the public
to the private sector. However, unlike most of his fellow graduates of ENA,
the elite French public administration college, he is now bound directly by
the laws he drafted.
He can recall when the legislation was passed: 'I remember it precisely  -
July 13 1985.' He was then under-deputy secretary at the French Treasury.
And now that he can see the legislation in practice, would he change
anything? 'Not really,' he says bluntly. 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.
It's clear the Matif is not broken. Why do we need to change something that
is working extremely well?'
He points out that France will have to make a few modifications to its laws
to align them with the requirements for free competition, under the European
investment directive, by the start of 1996.
'Little needs to be changed. Our taxation system is good; our membership is
adapted; we are not a closed shop,' he says.
Mr Pfauwadel argues that civil servants were among those most closely
involved in and enthusiastic about creating a deregulated market for the
French 'big bang' in the late 1980s. 'There would have been no growth in the
market unless we were sure that the environment was adequate, with sensible
taxation for profits and losses, for example,' he says.
'We had another target in building the market,' he says. 'We wanted to
modernise the financing of the Treasury. The deficits were starting to be
huge and it was important to open the way for investors so it would be
possible for the Treasury to issue more bonds. Public debt was almost
exploding.'
Matif was founded in 1986, using a structure distinctly different from its
Anglo-Saxon counterparts. It is not an institutional exchange owned by its
members, but rather a corporate entity.
Mr Pfauwadel says: 'We were relatively late starting. The best way to
accelerate growth was the entrepreneurial rather than the Anglo-Saxon
co-operative approach.'
He argues that one reason for the rapid development of Matif has been the
French education system. 'We have the savoir-faire. People in France are
very well trained in mathematics, which is essential for options. It is
clear that the level of abstraction is pretty high.' In contrast, he says,
London has focused more on futures, which he argues are 'less complex'
products with which to grapple.
Mr Pfauwadel says the creation of Matif was the first time that banks and
brokers - traditional competitors - had agreed to join forces. They took a
third of the shares each, with the remainder going to insurance companies as
'arbitrators'.
The Matif has proved very profitable, generating a surplus which helps
guarantee all contracts written and fund new investment. Inevitably, there
have been calls for a broader ownership for the market.
This, he concedes, has come from brokers 'who were not sufficiently involved
in the equity at the time of the original discussions'.
'It is a very fine-tuned balance. We need to keep a third of the shares with
each of the three groups. We may have some evolution. But it needs to work
well in the interests of everybody.'
If Mr Pfauwadel sounds at times a little defensive, it is not because he is
opposed to change. 'Pragmatic' is a word that springs up often in his
vocabulary.
Last month, Matif opened a market for its latest product: rapeseed futures
contracts.
'It is becoming more and more difficult to innovate,' he says. He believes
that most currency instruments for which there is a demand are already in
place.
One result has been to focus on commodities - notably in agricultural
products. 'We are an agricultural country,' he says. 'Prices have been
completely obscured by the Common Agricultural Policy, not determined by the
market but by technocrats in Brussels. We need a market game (to develop
futures).' Rapeseed has now been introduced; wheat and others may follow.
Equally, Mr Pfauwadel says he is far from settled on the 'open outcry'
trading system, so fundamental to the exchange's current operations. 'If we
cannot innovate though products, another way is to give our members access
to other products in other markets,' he says.
This explains Matif's use of the Globex system linking it with other
exchanges worldwide, and its recent hook-up with the Deutsche Terminborse,
its Frankfurt equivalent.
He said he believed that if the Franco-German platform were successful, it
would attract other continental markets. 'The Dutch, Spaniards and Swiss
have already expressed interest,' he says.
The British, by contrast, have taken another approach. Matif approached
Liffe before Frankfurt to suggest a trading link, but it refused. 'It wants
a big market in the City (of London) to quote all European products,' says
Mr Pfauwadel.
'That is in conflict with our strategy to develop a domestic niche and link
it to other centres. They are two distinct strategies. I have no idea which
will win.'

Futures trading on Milan's new MIB-30 index should start in the week
beginning November 28, Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of Consob, the stock
market regulator said, Reuter reports from Milan. The MIB-30, based on the
existing BCI-30 index of leading shares, was launched on October 17.
Mr Berlanda said a full range of trading instruments would probably not be
available before September 1995. He said there were also hitches in the
movement of all shares to cash settlement because of liquidity problems.
'Now there are 240 (shares with cash settlement), but there are difficulties
in terms of liquidity,' he said.
A total of 370 shares, from 204 companies, are currently quoted on the Milan
bourse.

<TEXT>
Minolta, the Japanese manufacturer of cameras and office automation
equipment, said yesterday it was suspending production and marketing of
video cameras for the domestic market, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. However,
Minolta said the company would continue to export video cameras made for it
by Hitachi on an original equipment-manufacturer basis to the North American
market.
In recent years, Minolta has lost market share to competitors Sony and Sharp
as the Japanese market has grown increasingly competitive.
Minolta's domestic sales of video cameras totalled Y2bn (Dollars 20.55m) in
fiscal 1992, after peaking at Y10bn in 1987, the company said. For the year
ended March 1994, Minolta had total unconsolidated sales of Y184.26bn, with
exports accounting for 77 per cent of the total.
Minolta stressed that the move did not necessarily mean the company had left
the domestic market for good.
Minolta shares closed unchanged at Y502 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Glencore International has bought back for cash the final 25 per cent stake
in the diversified trading and industrial group held by Mr Marc Rich, writes
Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Glencore, formerly Marc Rich &amp; Co, agreed in March 1993 to buy out Mr Rich's
51 per cent stake in the business over a five-year period.
Mr Willy Strothotte, chairman of the employee owned group, said he was very
pleased that the ownership transition had been completed much more quickly
than planned.
No price was given for the transaction, but the group's capital prior to Mr
Rich's withdrawal was believed to be in the range of Dollars 1bn. The shares
will be sold among the group's 5,000 employees.
Mr Rich has resigned from the boards of Glencore and its quoted Swiss

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: The Limited recovers with a 10%
increase
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Limited, a US clothing retailer, improved on its recent weak financial
performance by reporting a 10 per cent increase in net income to Dollars
90.5m from Dollars 82.2m in the third quarter to October.
Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This quarter is early
confirmation that the changes we've made in our business are having a
positive effect.'
The Limited has been experiencing good performances in its lingerie, men's,
children's and Bath and Body Works businesses.
However, these have been outweighed by poor results from its core women's
fashion accessories stores, trading as The Limited and Lerner New York.
Yesterday Mr Wexner said the company had been focusing on margin recovery at
its women's clothing stores for several months.
'We have tightly controlled our inventories and expenses,' he said. 'As the
third quarter ended, in addition to the margin rate recovery, we began to
see improvements in our store-for-store sales comparisons at our women's
fashion businesses.'
Revenues for the group as a whole rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, with
most of the increase coming from the lingerie, men's, children's and body
care businesses.
Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 23 cents .
Mr Wexner said the Bath and Body Works joint venture in the UK launched its
first three stores during the quarter, and initial customer response met or
surpassed The Limited's expect-ations.
Dillard Department Stores, one of the biggest US department store groups
with 232 outlets, increased net income by 20 per cent to Dollars 50.8m from
Dollars 42.4m in the third quarter to September.
Revenues increased to Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 1.2bn. Earnings per share
rose to 45 cents from 38 cents.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Visa plans separate western
European unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visa International, the international payments group, is to create a
subsidiary company, called Visa Europe, to deal with the developed market in
payment services across western Europe separately from the newer markets in
eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The move is intended to allow the group to be more competitive in the
developed markets and to focus on the different skills required for building
a market in the faster-growing areas.
Both types of markets are currently dealt with in a single region called
Visa EMEA.
At the same time there will be a shift in Visa International's arrangements
for funding investment in developing markets, putting it on to a global
basis.
Under the new system, instead of European members of Visa EMEA contributing
to development within the EMEA region, they will contribute to a fund held
by Visa International, which will pay for development in all regions.
Mr Edmund Jensen, Visa International president and chief executive, said the
splitting of Visa Europe from the rest of the region had been driven by the
member financial institutions, and was a further stage in the organisation's
evolution.
The Visa EMEA region is made up of 115 countries, of which just 24 provide
95 per cent of the volume of Visa card payments.
Mr Jensen emphasised that the restructuring would also give member banks
outside Visa Europe - in eastern Europe, the Middle East (apart from Turkey
and Israel) and Africa - a greater say in decisions affecting them, as they
would have a separate organisation. Currently only one director represents
these countries on the EMEA region board.
Visa also announced that the third of the three sets of common technical
specifications for 'chip' or integrated circuit cards on which it has been
working with two other international payments organisations - Mastercard and
Europay - had been agreed.
A common specification for a 'chip' card terminal is due to be agreed by
July next year. All three payments organisations are also working separately
on prototype cards, and will pool the results of their pilot studies.

<TEXT>
Equitable, the US financial services group, continued to benefit from an
improvement in insurance earnings during the third quarter, which more than
made up for a deterioration in profits from investment banking.
The 25 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 89.3m, or 42 cents a
share, was driven mainly by higher investment spreads in the insurance and
annuities business. Mr Joseph Malone, chairman of the group's US life
insurance arm, added that an improvement in mortality experience and lower
unit costs also helped.
After-tax earnings from insurance and annuities rose to Dollars 63m from
Dollars 37.4m a year ago. Both figures are before capital gains and one-off
restructuring charges, which resulted in net charges of Dollars 3.4m in the
latest period and Dollars 7.6bn a year ago.
Net income from fund management and investment banking slipped to Dollars
31.6m from Dollars 56.9m. This was before a Dollars 28.5m after-tax gain
from the sale of part of the group's interest in Alliance Capital
Management.
While Alliance's earnings rose 15 per cent from a year ago, Donaldson Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette, Equitable's investment banking subsidiary, saw after-tax
earnings fall by 48 per cent, to Dollars 25.5m.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Data General files suit against
IBM
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO

<TEXT>
Data General has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against International
Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, charging that
IBM has 'wilfully' infringed upon seven Data General patents for several
years.
A computer technology leader in the early 1980s, Data General is struggling
to regain profitability as it switches from proprietary minicomputer
technology to 'open systems' based on industry standards.
In its suit, Data General alleges that IBM's two most profitable product
lines - its System/390 mainframes and AS/400 minicomputers - incorporate
patented technologies developed by Data General in the late 1970s.
Data General is seeking 'compensatory damages' based on IBM's mainframe and
minicomputer revenues. In its suit, Data General estimates that IBM's
cumulative revenues from AS/400 systems have exceeded Dollars 25bn, while
those from its System/390 mainframes, introduced in 1990, are more than
Dollars 50bn.
Data General claims IBM had known of its patents since the mid-1980s, but
nonetheless had used the technology in its computer systems. 'IBM's
infringement has been and continues to be wilful,' Data General said in its
complaint.
IBM said that it had not yet received a copy of the suit and declined
further comment.
Data General said the seven patents allegedly infringed by IBM were among
more than 50 issued as the result of an ambitious computer design effort
called the 'Fountainhead Project', undertaken in the 1970s, 'to design and
develop the most advanced computer system of its time.'
Data General's struggle to develop the world-beating computer is described
in The Soul of a New Machine, a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winning book by Ms Tracy
Kidder.
The company is seeking a permanent injunction to bar IBM from further
infringement of the patents by manufacturing and selling the S/390 mainframe
and AS/400 mid-range computers.
'IBM will continue to infringe unless enjoined by this court,' the Data
General lawsuit says.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kymmene in FM1.5bn cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kymmene, Finland's second-largest forestry group, is to launch a share issue
in Finland and overseas which should raise more than FM1.5bn (Dollars 319m)
to reduce debt and strengthen the group's balance sheet.
Kymmene, which returned to profit this year as the forestry products
industry swung out of recession, will offer up to 15m shares.
The move follows the breakdown in June of merger talks between Kymmene and
United Paper Mills, the forestry unit of fellow Finnish company Repola,
which would have created one of Europe's biggest forestry groups.
'This offering is very significant,' said Mr Harri Piehl, Kymmene's chief
executive. 'It will strengthen our balance sheet and provide a firm
financial base for our growth.'
Kymmene's net debt to equity stands at 210 per cent. It had interest-bearing
net liabilities in August of FM15.3bn.
Retail and institutional investors in Finland will be offered 2.5m shares in
a public offering. The overseas tranche will be divided into 4.4m shares for
North America and 6.2m for elsewhere, marketed on a book-building basis. A
further 1.9m shares will be available to cover over-allotments on the global
issue.
Merrill Lynch International of the US is lead manager for the global
tranches.
Pricing, to be the same for all three geographical offerings, will be fixed
in December. This week, Kymmene shares have been trading around FM123 in
Helsinki.
Kymmene reported a FM545m pre-tax profit in the first eight months of the
year, compared with a (restated) loss of FM337m in the same period in 1993,
on sales of FM12.11bn. The group forecast earnings for the full year of
FM1bn, compared with last year's FM256m loss.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: NEC to lift stake in Groupe Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, plans to increase its stake in Groupe
Bull as part of the privatisation of the loss-making French computer group.
The Japanese company, which is Bull's largest private shareholder, said
yesterday it was 'considering positively' an increase in its 4.4 per cent
stake. However, the company would not reveal how much it was willing to
invest in Bull.
The French government plans to reduce its stake in Bull from 75.8 per cent
to less than 50 per cent within the next few months through the sale of
shares to industry partners. French officials declined to comment on the
size of the stake which could be sold to NEC, but industry observers believe
the Japanese company could raise its holding to about 10 per cent.
The two companies, which co-operate in marketing and in the development of
mainframe computers, have strengthened business ties over the past year. NEC
invested Y7bn (Dollars 72m) in Bull at the end of 1993 as part of a
recapitalisation plan for the French group.
Earlier this year, NEC announced a plan to increase transactions with Bull
from an annual Y6bn-Y7bn to about Y20bn within the financial year.
NEC said its interest in raising its stake in Bull reflected its strategy of
expanding its operations in Europe. The development of a global information
infrastructure made Europe a particularly promising market for NEC's
computer and telecommunications equipment and systems, NEC said.
According to NEC, Bull's marketing network will assist in the development of
its activities in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States,
where demand is expected to expand.
The relationship between NEC and Bull has provided NEC with a marketing
channel in Europe and Bull with a range of NEC products.
The French government has been seeking partners for Bull to enable its
privatisation. The task has been complicated, however, by the weak financial
position of the group, which has suffered losses of more than FFr15bn
(Dollars 2.9bn) over the past three years.
The French industry ministry said it had no objection to NEC raising its
holding. This represents a shift since 1991 when Mrs Edith Cresson, then
prime minister, sought to block the Japanese group's investment in Bull.

division

<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group which is due to be
privatised, is to cut the workforce at its Spanish subsidiary by more than a
third in the next three years to try to make it profitable by the end of
1996.
The company said yesterday it planned to reduce the 2,100 staff at AGF Union
Fenix by more than 730 as part of a series of management initiatives
designed to trim costs and reduce its dependency on its parent.
Fenix had a Pta35bn (Dollars 277m) deficit last year.
AGF gained control of Fenix, the fifth largest insurance company in Spain,
earlier this year from Banesto, the Spanish banking group. The French group
holds more than 60 per cent of the shares.
AGF said it was committed to expanding the operations of Fenix Autos, which
it claims is the first telephone insurance service in Spain and now has more
than 160,000 customers.
It said it was beginning to use the same subsidiary to sell multi-risk
household insurance and would increasingly use it for the telemarketing of
its products.
AGF has invested heavily in Spain as part of its strategy of international
expansion, espoused in the late 1980s, to generate 40 per cent of its
turnover from operations outside France - a target it achieved last year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Agnelli family yesterday strengthened its links with Danone, the French
food group, by buying a 12 per cent stake in Danone Asia for Dollars 53m.
The acquisition was carried out by Ifil, the Agnellis' quoted industrial
holding company in Italy, and Exor, which is linked to Ifi, the family's
investment vehicle.
Danone Asia is a holding company for Danone's food interests in 12
countries, including India, Malaysia, New Zealand and China, with
headquarters in Singapore.
It claims to be the market leader in biscuits in Asia and has a strong
position in the yoghurt sector, cooked dishes and sauces. Its turnover in
1993, according to Ifil, was about L700bn (Dollars 450m).
The deal follows last month's announcement of planned changes in the
ownership of Saint Louis, the French food and paper group, which has a small
stake in Danone.
Saint Louis shareholders have been asked to approve a FFr1.5bn (Dollars
288m) capital increase reserved exclusively for Ifil. The operation would
raise Ifil's stake in the company to 25.9 per cent from 15.7 per cent, and
dilute the stake of Worms, the French holding group, to 27.8 per cent from
31.6 per cent.
Ifil is to pay for half the increase in cash and half in shares of the
Danone parent company, increasing Saint Louis' stake in the food group to
3.8 per cent, and keeping Ifil's indirect stake at just under 6 per cent.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, yesterday took a
further step towards concentrating its business on telecommunications with
the sale of its energy-supply subsidiary to Pohjolan Voima, a Finnish power
group, for FM1.4bn (Dollars 298.5m).
Nokia said the sale of Nokia Power, which last year contributed FM550m to
group sales of FM23.7bn, through sales of electricity, thermal energy and
natural gas, would produce a capital gain of about FM700m.
The deal with Pohjolan, which supplies about 18 per cent of Finland's
electricity consumption, includes the transfer of Nokia's shareholdings in
four other Finnish power companies.
'Divesting our energy operations is a logical step in Nokia's strategic
development,' Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive, said.
The Finnish group is riding a wave of fast growth in its telecommunications
operations. Last month, it announced a five-fold increase in group profits
in the first eight months of the year, to a pre-tax surplus of FM2.29bn on
sales of FM18.2bn.
Much of the growth stemmed from its leading position in mobile telephones,
where it is second in the world to Motorola of the US in the production of
mobile handsets.
Since taking over at Nokia two years ago, Mr Ollila has set about completing
the company's transformation from a sprawling industrial conglomerate to a
group focused on telecommunications and electronics. More than 60 per cent
of group sales is accounted for by its telecommunications divisions.
The next restructuring move is likely to be the flotation on the Helsinki
stock market of most of Nokia's 80 per cent holding in Nokia Tyres, a move
signalled by Mr Ollila last month.
Nokia Tyres last year posted sales of FM862m.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sears Tower ownership
transferred to trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, Roebuck is transferring ownership of its landmark Sears Tower in
Chicago, the world's tallest building, to a trust. Although it attracts 1.5m
tourists a year, the tower has been a financial burden to the group.
The US retail and insurance group, which is seeking cash for an expensive
corporate restructuring, took out the existing mortgages on the 110-storey
tower in 1990 after attempts to sell the building failed.
The tower, built in 1970, was financed near the height of the US property
boom and has suffered from high vacancy rates and competition from newer
offices. Local property specialists estimate the tower's value at less than
half of the mortgage amount, or about Dollars 400m.
The arrangement frees Sears from interest payments on Dollars 850m in
mortgage debt, which in recent years have far exceeded rental income from
the tower.
The company said the debt restructuring would result in a Dollars 195m
after-tax extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter, or about 50 cents a
share. In addition, it expects to save about Dollars 75m a year in interest
expenses.
Although the tower is now 75 per cent leased, income still does not cover
taxes and operating costs.
Under the two-phase restructuring agreement, ownership of the tower and its
related mortgages will pass to a trust that benefits AEW Partners, a
Boston-based partnership of pension plans managed by Aldrich, Eastman and
Waltch. AEW becomes responsible for overall management of the tower.
AEW is secondary mortgage holder on the tower, with Metropolitan Life
Insurance holding Dollars 600m of the tower's debt.
In the second phase, AEW Partners will take ownership of the tower in 2003,
a year earlier than under the previous mortgage agreement. AEW Partners will
in 2005 have to meet the Dollars 600m mortgage commitment to Metropolitan
Life.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at SSAB for nine
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish steel group, yesterday reported nine-month pre-tax profits
of SKr1.39bn (Dollars 189.1m), a near four-fold increase from SKr355m in the
same period last year.
The group has reaped the benefits of improved demand and rising prices in
Europe. SSAB said it expected full-year pre-tax profits to be about SKr2bn
if trading conditions continued. This would be more than double last year's
SKr776m.
Sales in the first nine months rose 20 per cent to SKr11.2bn from SKr9.38bn,
due to higher volumes and increased prices, SSAB said. Operating expenses
advanced to SKr9.34bn from SKr8.58bn, leaving operating profits after
depreciation at SKr1.4bn, compared with SKr343m last time.
The group's biggest division, the Tunnplat steel plate operation, saw
operating profits jump to SKr829m from SKr142m on sales of SKr5.8bn.
SSAB said steel consumption in western Europe was expected to increase 6 per
cent in 1994, bringing consumption back to 1987 levels. In the US it was
expected to rise 9 per cent, reaching the highest levels of recent years.
Price increases, and the effects of a weak Swedish krona, meant the group's
steel prices in kronor rose 17 per cent compared with last year.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UPF trebles to Pounds 4.11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits almost trebled at UPF Group in the vehicle chassis
producer's first annual results since it floated in June.
The share price rose 5p to 161p yesterday as the group announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 1.46m) for 12 months to August 31. It said
the figures were marginally ahead of directors' forecasts.
UPF floated at 108p. Its expected value was cut by a third owing to the weak
new issues market.
Operating profit rose 29 per cent to Pounds 5.45m (Pounds 4.21m) on turnover
of Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 35.3m), reflecting growth of the core 4x4 chassis
frame business.
UPF primarily supplies chassis for the Land Rover Discovery and
Vauxhall/Opel Frontera. The 4x4 market accounts for 70 per cent of turnover,
although the group also manufactures pressings for the car and domestic
appliances industries.
Mr Keith Evans, chairman, said: 'The prospects for organic growth in our
core business remain good, particularly given the continued forecast growth
of the 4x4 off-road vehicle market.'
Further sales increases are expected after BMW's acquisition of Rover, as
Land-Rover takes advantage of BMW's distribution network in Germany and
North America.
Profits were underpinned by a 51 per cent reduction in interest costs to
Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 2.75m), following debt repayments helped by the
flotation. Mr Evans said those costs would be reduced by a further Pounds 1m
this year.
Gearing stood at 33 per cent at the end of the year.
UPF was bought from the receivers to the collapsed Parkfield group in 1990,
in a Pounds 30m management buy-out. It was forced to refinance in 1992
because of bad debts and problems with a new production line.
Earnings per share increased to 12.6p (4.86p) - or 12.19p (5.96p) on a pro
forma basis - and the board proposes a final dividend of 1p.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dividend rises expected to shock
politicians - Michael Smith considers the interim results from the
electricity companies which begin on Thursday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It says something about a sector when a company is expected to kick off the
interim results season with an 11 per cent dividend rise which is likely to
be seen as uninspiring by comparison with its peers.
The sector is electricity, which has delivered an almost uninterrupted
stream of good news to shareholders since privatisation began four years
ago.
The company is Scottish Power, which reports on Thursday. It may exceed the
market's 11 per cent expectations but it would have to perform miracles to
match the England and Wales electricity companies.
Some of the 12 regional companies are considered capable of delivering
dividend rises of more than 25 per cent, extraordinary even by their
extraordinary standards.
National Power and PowerGen, the generators, should not be too far behind,
with analysts expecting about 20 per cent in each case, even though both
have lost market share in recent years.
Profit increases for all companies will be meaningless because so much of
power companies' sales are in the second half of the year. But the dividend
rises will show that this is a sector in very good health. Far too good in
the view of critics. A political row seems inevitable.
The Labour Party will use the results to promote its view that the
electricity companies were floated too cheaply and are given too easy a ride
by the regulator.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, warned last weekend that his party
believed some companies should be subject to a windfall profits tax,
especially in view of the regional companies' forthcoming flotation of the
National Grid.
The Grid is expected to fetch at least Pounds 4bn, whereas it was valued at
just Pounds 1.2bn in 1990.
Shareholders in Scottish Power and its neighbour Scottish Hydro-Electric
should suffer less than the regional electricity companies from the
political row's fall out.
They have no stake in the Grid and have had to cope with considerably
tighter price controls than the regional companies in England and Wales.
Furthermore this year's regulatory review of prices, to take effect from
next April, was viewed by the market as being much tougher on the Scottish
companies than those in England and Wales.
Hydro agreed. Two weeks ago it announced it was rejecting the controls on
its distribution business, triggering a referal to the Monopolies and
Mergers and Commission.
With such an important issue at stake Hydro may be relatively subdued when
announcing its results next month. Even so, it is expected to produce an
interim dividend rise of about 10 per cent. The City will be looking for
guidance from Hydro as to how it sees the referal taking shape.
The main question investors will ask of Scottish Power is what it intends to
do with its likely cash surplus. Unlike the England and Wales companies it
has not sought shareholder permission to buy back shares.
Does it intend to make a large acquisition, perhaps buying one of the
England and Wales regional companies? Or will it follow the example of East
Midlands Electricity and provide a large special dividend.
South of the border similar questions will be put to Southern Electric and
Yorkshire Electricity. Both have approval to buy back shares but have not
yet done so.
Yorkshire's recent withdrawal from a deal to buy a stake in Stockholm Energi
could free up about Pounds 150m.
Most of the other regional companies can still effect buy backs since all
but two, Midlands and Northern, have yet to reach the 10 per cent limits
which have been approved.
Other topics of interest will include the regional companies' non-core
activities, including retailing and contracting, in which some companies are
struggling to make profits.
The main focus, however, will be on dividends. Opinions differ as to how far
the England and Wales companies dare go.
One theory is that with the regulatory review over and an election still
probably two years away, the companies will throw off their inhibitions and
pump out as much money as they can.
'The gloves are off,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, the
securities house. 'Conveniently the Budget on November 29 pre-dates the
(main) reporting season, so aggressive dividend announcements will not add
to the clamour for the government to impose a savage one-off tax on the
planned disposal of the National Grid.'
Mr Kevin Lapwood, at Smith New Court, disagreed. 'The recs have a political
dilemma. Share buy backs mean that some companies could push dividend
increases per share, rather than total dividend payments, past 25 per cent.
'But companies have to be sensitive about what the Tories might do to them
as a result of the Grid sale. MPs are acutely aware that a spot of
rec-bashing could do them some good in the polls.'
The English generators both report next week with PowerGen on Tuesday and
National Power on Thursday. Their results are the last before the government
sells its remaining 40 per cent holdings in February, so there will be more
than usual interest.
Issues include the companies' diversification and their attempts to try to
sell up to 6,000MW of capacity by the end of next year, as agreed with the
regulator.
Northern Ireland Electricity, the last of the 17 companies to be privatised,
is expected to show dividend growth of about 15 per cent. But this is the
one company where dividends may taken second place to other issues.
The main interest will centre on the effects of the IRA ceasefire. Company
engineers have already been investigating the possibility of re-opening the
interconnector with the Irish Republic.

Bournemouth

Stakis, the hotels and leisure group, is paying Pounds 7.6m cash for the
Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, Dorset. The purchase of the 110 bedroom
hotel brings the group's chain to 38. It also runs 22 casinos.
Mr David Michels, chief executive, said: 'This is one of the best hotels in
one of the best resorts in the country.' Much of its business comes from the

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forte pays FFr1.82bn for Meridien hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte has paid a total of FFr1.82bn (Pounds 217m) for the Meridien hotel
chain.
The final purchase price for Meridien is less than the FFr1.9bn envisaged
when the deal was first announced in September. This is because some
minority shareholders agreed to accept lower amounts in return for earlier
payment.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, has been appointed chairman of Meridien.
Meridien will have an eight-member board, of whom six will come from Forte.
Mr Jean Didier Blanchet, Meridien chairman until the purchase, is to be vice
chairman.
Air France, which owned 57 per cent of Meridien until the Forte acquisition,
is to retain a place on the board in the form of Mr Patrick Durant, an Air
France director.
Forte has signed a seven-year co-operation agreement with Air France, under
which it will jointly market Meridien hotels, and possibly other Forte
properties. Forte said Air France flights to Germany and the US might be
useful in marketing its hotels in the two countries.
The cost of purchasing Air France's stake is FFr1.09bn, of which FFr871m was
paid yesterday. The balance is payable on March 8 1995, but is dependent on
both detailed structural surveys and on how many hotel management contracts
Meridien retains.
Of the minority shareholders, those with 11.35 per cent of the shares agreed
to sell to Forte on the same terms as Air France. This meant Forte was
required to pay FFr173m yesterday.
A further FFr43m is payable on March 8, again subject to the same conditions
as Air France.
Minority shareholders representing 31.33 per cent of the shares agreed to
accept final payment yesterday at a 15 per cent discount to the payment
received by the other shareholders. The cost was FFr508m.
Forte said yesterday's payments were mainly met from the proceeds of last
week's Pounds 175m placing of Forte shares.
The balance was paid from existing borrowing facilities.

Operating profit was ahead at Pounds 912,000 (Pounds 427,000) from increased

AG Holdings, the Doncaster-based cable reel maker, reported pre-tax profits
down 5 per cent at Pounds 2.76m for the year to July 31, against Pounds
2.91m.
The company blamed a second half reduction in demand from the UK cable
companies, its largest customers. The acquisition of a 67 per cent stake in
EMS, the French cable drum maker, was completed in June, too late to have an
impact.
Turnover was Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 15.9m),including Pounds 1.37m from
acquisitions. Earnings per share were 10.6p (11.4p). A final dividend of
3.25p is proposed for a total of 5.5p (2p).
Mr Richard Battersby, chairman, said turnover for the first two months of
the current year was up 9 per cent but margins had come under pressure.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hoare Govett launches index
tracking investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett is launching an investment trust to track its recently
developed HG 1000 index, which covers the smallest 2 per cent of UK listed
companies.
An institutional placing of shares in the new trust, which is to be called
Hoare Govett 1000, is expected to raise up to Pounds 30m. Trading in the
shares starts on November 15.
The trust will aim to match broadly both changes in the capital value of the
index and its gross dividend yield by investing in 300 or more of the 1,000
companies which constitute the index. The largest are capitalised at just
over Pounds 50m, and the smallest at under Pounds 1m.
The size of the fund is limited by the lack of liquidity in the target
market. 'The typical smaller company trades about once a week, and clearly
considerable patience is required if a stake is to be built in smaller
components of the HG 1000,' said Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, of
the London Business School, in a report on the new index.
The fund will be managed by Broadgate Investment Management, which already
manages a trust tracking Hoare Govett's main smaller companies index. Both
have an annual management charge of 1 per cent.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;S advances 15% to Pounds 354m - Clothing,
food and financial activities ahead, but furnishing suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, lifted interim profits
by 15 per cent on the back of a 7 per cent increase in sales.
Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to October 1 grew from Pounds 308m to
Pounds 354m, while sales increased from Pounds 2.87bn to Pounds 3.07bn.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, yesterday described the trading climate as
'com-petitive' and consumers throughout the group's markets as 'cautious and
value-conscious'.
But the group was well placed to contain raw material price increases as its
suppliers benefited from large production volumes. It would also continue to
build on its 'traditional strengths of quality and value'.
The shares yesterday closed at 404p, down 5 1/2 p.
The UK, where the group now has 11.1m sq ft of selling space, continues to
account for most of the turnover and profit. UK sales improved to Pounds
2.52bn (Pounds 2.37bn) and operating profits to Pounds 343m (Pounds 297m).
The group continued to win market share in clothing, where sales improved by
8.9 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn. Food sales were ahead by 3.9 per cent to
Pounds 1.1bn.
The group said that food sales had suffered from the fact that Easter, a
traditionally strong period, had fallen in the previous financial year. It
was confident the supermarkets were not eroding its market share.
Home furnishing sales were down by almost 1 per cent. Sir Richard said the
market had suffered a bad few months, with consumers cautious on big ticket
items following tax increases.
The group's financial activities lifted profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds
18.5m following an increase in personal lending and a better performance on
bad debts.
The plan to accept debit cards, although not credit cards, will require a
massive reprogramming of tills and information systems, which will begin
after Christmas. Customers should be able to pay by debit card by next
spring.
The group is planning to open most of its stores on the four Sundays
approaching Christmas now that Sunday trading is legal. But Sir Richard said
it would continue to be 'very selective' in the stores it opened on Sundays
for the rest of the year.
At present about 30 are open regularly, although this could rise to 50.
Outside the UK and Europe, sales were up from Pounds 276m to Pounds 291m,
yielding operating profits of Pounds 10m (Pounds 8.7m).
Operating profits at Brooks Brothers, the North American clothing
subsidiary, fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 700,000. The group is looking
for a US chief executive to replace Mr William Roberti, who leaves next
month.
The loss in Canada increased from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.9m. Sir Richard
said the losses could mainly be blamed on rental costs - but said that
Canada, with annual sales of Pounds 80m, was no longer a big problem.
Earnings per share improved to 8.6p from 7.6p. The interim dividend is
increased from 2.5p to 2.8p.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions behind rise at
Wyndeham Press
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contributions from three acquisitions made earlier this year helped Wyndeham
Press, the printing and packaging company, double pre-tax profits from
Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1.51m for the six months to September 30.
The purchases - of Westway Offset, B&amp;P, and Unity Paper Tubes - follow the
acquisition in July last year of the Gait group.
Turnover of the enlarged company for the half year was up by 85 per cent
from Pounds 6.27m to Pounds 11.6m, of which Pounds 4.03m came from
acquisitions. The pre-tax outcome was struck after a net interest charge of
Pounds 141,000 (Pounds 28,000).
Despite the issue of some 6m shares during the period, earnings emerged at
4.9p (3.3p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.4p (0.75p).
Since the period end Wyndeham has acquired BR Hubbard Printers, a label and
magazine printer.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Gt Portland Pounds 18.9m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Portland Estates has acquired a portfolio of seven freehold properties
from a private company for Pounds 18.9m, satisfied by the issue of 5m shares
and Pounds 9.6m in cash.
The portfolio comprises two office buildings, one retail, and four
distribution warehouses located in Cardiff and Plymouth. The properties
generate an annual rental income of Pounds 1.5m, suggesting that Great
Portland is buying on a yield of about 8 per cent.
The company said that it expected rental income to increase by 10 per cent
over the next year as a result of rent reviews, which would push the yield
on the properties to 8.75 per cent.
Mr Patrick Hall, deputy managing director, said that all the properties had
been built or refurbished within the last 10 years and were let to blue-chip
tenants. The deal will leave the vendors holding 1.5 per cent of Great
Portland's enlarged share capital.
In June, Great Portland bought a portfolio of buildings from a private
company for Pounds 28m and the Royal Oak Industrial Estate for Pounds 30m.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: The sombre and sensitive subject of pricing
/ A look at the uncertain process by which the market value of new issues is
determined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional investors remain in a sombre mood over new issues.
In what has been a record year for flotations, a rapid succession of profit
warnings, poor results and share price underperformances has rattled
investors
It has also served to focus attention on the sensitive subject of pricing.
'The feeling remains among many fund managers that some of the new issues
which came to the market during the first quarter of the year, in
particular, were overpriced,' says Mr Geoff Douglas, smaller companies
analyst at BZW.
This attitude has been reflected in several recent issues where companies
have been forced to scale back their valuation expectations.
Cellular components group Filtronic Comtek, for example, which was expecting
a market valuation of about Pounds 60m, had to settle for Pounds 44m.
TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group, was valued at Pounds 205m
against hopes of about Pounds 225m.
But significantly, both companies have been successful at the issue prices
dictated by the market.
Filtronic leapt to a 15 per cent premium within days of its flotation, while
TLG's offer has been subscribed 3.2 times. Its shares begin trading tomorrow
. Fashion retailer New Look, however, refused to countenance the price
institutions were putting on its shares last week, and became the latest in
a growing list of companies to postpone its float.
While criticisms have been levelled at the quality of the companies coming
to the market and at investors' eagerness to exit at the earliest
opportunity and the highest price, it is the financial advisers which have
borne the brunt of the disquiet over pricing.
However, they counter that pricing is largely a function of investor demand,
which was high during the last quarter of 1993 and the beginning of this
year, helping to push up prices. They also argue that, as they are often
involved in placing only part of a company's equity, it is not in their
interests to float a company at a price that is not sustainable, because
there may well be more to come.
Traditionally, new issues have been priced at a discount to either their
nearest listed competitors, or to the sector, or to the market, the purpose
being to give investors an incentive to subscribe for the shares.
Keen pricing should also stimulate demand in the after market when the
shares begin trading.
The two-week period prior to the shares being priced is a crucial one when
the company and its broker meet with potential investors and gauge feedback
to the issue.
'Although it is not a completely passive process, pricing is largely a
reflection of institutional appetite,' says Mr Paul Hamilton, a director of
corporate finance at SG Warburg, the investment bank.
Another adviser commented: 'If the institutions won't wear it then it won't
get away. It's as simple as that. They call the tune.'
Mr Tim Linacre, corporate finance director at Panmure Gordon, says that the
important thing is to establish benchmarks for a company so that a valuation
can then be more easily established.
The process is, however, more problematic when companies are not easily
defined.
'The pricing issue becomes less scientific and more selective after that,'
Mr Linacre says.
Panmure was responsible for advising Filtronic, the first company in its
field to come to the London market.
'We had to tell the institutions what we thought the company would make and
apply our own multiple to the prospective earnings', says Mr Linacre. 'Not
all of them bought the story and we eventually settled for a price at the
bottom of the range we had set ourselves.'
But the company was supported by firm American interest - the placing was
being undertaken simultaneously in the US - and a strong management story.
As a result, the flotation price put the shares on a prospective p/e of
about 20 times, still well ahead of the market average of 13.5 times for
1995.
Other companies which have jumped or dived on or shortly after the day of
issue have similar individual tales explaining their performances, making
generalisations over pricing difficult.
Finelist, a motor components group, jumped to a 16 per cent premium on its
first day's trading, which might indicate a slight underpricing. Like
Filtronic, Finelist was a difficult company to compare with others and the
shares came on a slight premium to the market on a prospective basis,
although at a discount to its sector. BZW was the broker to the issue and Mr
Douglas says that the strong early performance of the shares enabled the
company to come back to the market in July to finance an acquisition.
Coda, the accountancy software group, came to the market in February on a
prospective p/e of about 19, according to analysts, again a hefty premium to
the market. Unfortunately, this was also at the market's peak, and the
shares trailed downwards, although outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share.
However, the group dived into the red in July and the shares lost 25 per
cent of their value.
ED&amp;F Man, the commodity broker, also suffered from the sour sentiment
towards new issues, having its issue price reduced by 15 per cent from the
expected figure when it floated in September. The offer price gave it a
notional yield of 6 per cent; the prospective p/e was about 9 times, a good
discount to the food manufacturing sector's 12. But the shares went to a 10
per cent discount within two weeks of their issue, which the company's
advisers attribute to the falling market. They have since recovered but are
still trading below their issue price.
Mr Douglas says that investor nervousness has prompted an increase in yields
among new issues. 'In a growth market, the yield plays little part in
investor interest. But now they've started to creep back up again.' One
institutional investor added: 'Falling prices and improving yields is the
only way the new issues will come back into favour with the big
institutions.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Water rises 20% but sector falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 120.6m and declared a 9.6 per cent increase in its
dividend from 7.3p to 8p.
In spite of the announcement, water shares closed 2 per cent lower
yesterday. This contrasts with the reaction last week when Thames Water's
surprise 11 per cent dividend increase left the sector 2 per cent higher.
The market interpreted Thames's action as a signal to increase dividend
expectations for the sector. 'It is not surprising that the sector is now
weak,' said Mr Bill Dale of SG Warburg. 'Expectations ran wild after
Thames's results.'
Anglian said it had increased the dividend in line with its underlying
earnings improvement.
The headline profits advance had been helped by a Pounds 10.3m reduction in
the provision for water and sewerage pipeline maintenance to Pounds 9.8m.
Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 358.3m, against Pounds 341.4m when
pre-tax profits were Pounds 100.5m. Earnings per share for the half year to
September 30 rose from 32.2p to 38.7p.
Mr Alan Smith, managing director, said Anglian was confident it would be
able to maintain real dividend growth under the new five-year pricing regime
set by the industry regulator in July.
Customers would also benefit, he said, with an extra Pounds 8m to be devoted
to issues such as low water pressure, sewer flooding and cleaning up
estuaries. This funding was in addition to the Pounds 154m invested in the
first half and Pounds 170m already budgeted for the latter part of the year.
Anglian said operating costs had been held at Pounds 174m (Pounds 173m)
through tight spending controls and other efficiencies in the regulated
business. The regulated business improved operating profits by 18 per cent
to Pounds 139.5m (Pounds 118.7m) on sales 5.4 per cent higher at Pounds
315.5m (Pounds 299.3m).
Losses in Anglian's two main non-regulated businesses rose from Pounds
400,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Mr Smith said this was due to marketing and research
and development costs. The process engineering business was expected to
return to profit in the second half.
COMMENT
After the brief excitement sparked by Thames, the water sector has returned
to earth with Anglian's results. The company's emphasis on a dividend
increase backed by similar underlying growth could be seen as a warning not
to expect too much under the new pricing regime, when earnings are expected
to be flat. However, the company may not be as constrained as once thought.
The substantial cut in the infrastructure renewals charge has enhanced its
cover and its prospects for dividend growth. Anglian is also making
noticeable progress on efficiency savings. Nevertheless, the non-core
business remains disappointing, Forecasts are for about Pounds 225m this
year, with a prospective p/e of 8. There is still little which sets Anglian
apart, in a sector depressed by limited exposure to economic upturn and
substantial political risk.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: WEW Group returns to black with Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After its first full year at the helm, the new management team at WEW Group,
which currently runs 71 What Everyone Wants discount stores, was yesterday
able to announce a return to the black.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to July 30 emerged at Pounds 3.25m,
against losses last time of Pounds 2.09m, on total turnover of Pounds 112m
(Pounds 106m) - Pounds 2.04m was from discontinued activities.
The turnround was helped by a reduction in net interest charges to Pounds
355,000 (Pounds 744,000) after the injection of Pounds 15m of new capital in
January.
The group has had to take Pounds 397,000 as an exceptional charge,
representing compensation to Mr Ian Grabiner, who resigned as managing
director in August.
There have been provisions of Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 3.21m) in respect of
properties and operational guarantees from the discontinued Dennis Day, the
clothing manufacturer now sold.
At the operating level, profits from continuing operations were Pounds 5.13m
(Pounds 6.02m restated).
Earnings were 1.35p (losses 2.7p) per share, and the final is lifted to
0.35p (0.25p), though the total falls to 0.7p (1.35p). Shares closed down 2p
at 31p.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Getting policy in sharper focus / A look at
the changes taking place at SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg Group has completed an overhaul of its senior policy-making
structure following the most rigorous internal management review since the
Big Bang deregulation of London markets in 1986.
The changes sweep away what Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive,
described as a 'fuzzy' decision-making structure in which too many people
had to be consulted. Even those most informed about key areas felt they
lacked the authority to make choices.
Lord Cairns said the effect of the structure was to make decision-making a
time-consuming process in a business which, by definition, must move
quickly.
'Decisions became rather fuzzy. Nobody felt ownership of anything, and
everything was referred up to the top,' he said. The management structure
had evolved since Big Bang, when various acquired businesses were integrated
into the group.
The changes, which were announced internally in October at the same time as
Warburg issued a profits warning, abolish the 18-member investment banking
management committee. It is replaced by a smaller investment banking policy
committee consisting of eight of those 18 executives.
The old IBMC had been responsible for overseeing the decisions of other
committees, several of which 'were in the high teens' in their own members,
Lord Cairns said. Sometimes the IBMC would be discussing matters which some
members knew little about.
Under the new structure, four new committees, each with eight members, have
been created. These committees are intended to make the sort of decisions
which used to be referred to the IBMC.
The management changes were unrelated to current trading conditions at
Warburg, he said. They were put in train about a year ago. Mr Peter
Wilmot-Sitwell, then chairman of SG Warburg Securities, was coming up to
retirement and Mr Herman Van der Wyck, chairman of SG Warburg and Co,
intended to step back from executive responsibility. 'The environment was
right for change,' Lord Cairns said.
Overhauling the management structure, for an institution like Warburg, has
not been easy. 'We come from a culture which is pretty consensus driven.
There is a great respect for the views of others. What we need is a balance
between a hierarchical structure and a consensus structure,' he explained.
Deciding who should and who should not be on decision-making committees was
a 'sensitive' issue, he said.
The new policy committee consists of Lord Cairns, Mr Derek Higgs, chairman
of SG Warburg and Co, Mr Nick Verey, chairman of SG Warburg Securities, Mr
Simon Leathes, group finance director, Mr Michael Gore, chairman of SG
Warburg Asia Pacific, Mr Piers von Simson, head of Europe, Mr Rodney Ward,
head of Asia except Japan, and Mr Thomas Wyman, head of US operations.
Reporting to it is a new long-term strategy group chaired by Mr John
Trueman, head of group risk.
Reporting to the policy committee are four functional committees: corporate
finance, equity, fixed interest and treasury and operations, which includes
the functions of custody, settlement, information technology and
administration. Some former members of the old IBMC are on these committees.
Beneath that is a business development group, chaired jointly by Mr Higgs
and Mr Verey, whose job it is to make short-term decisions.
Securities analysts welcomed the changes. 'When people start to look
internally when things go wrong, that starts a period of self-cleansing,'
said Mr Rodney Maryan Green, merchant banking analyst at James Capel.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Losses prompt cuts at Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday said it would review
staff levels and delay planned investments as part of a drive to cut costs
after losing money on trading in the six months to September 30.
Warburg, which issued a profits warning last month, saw a slump in
investment banking profits from Pounds 98.4m in the first half of last year
to Pounds 5.5m. Asset management contributed the rest of the Pounds 62.5m
pre-tax profit, down from Pounds 148.8m.
Dealing income fell from Pounds 140.6m to Pounds 45.3m in volatile and
illiquid markets. Lord Cairns, chief executive, said Warburg made profits on
proprietary trading, but dealing for clients - the 'vast majority' of its
trading - did not cover costs.
Lord Cairns and Sir David Scholey, chairman, insisted that Warburg had to
remain a trader and marketmaker in securities to support other activities.
They said the company remained 'strongly committed' to becoming a leading
international bank.
Total costs rose 10 per cent from Pounds 343.3m to Pounds 378.8m despite
staff costs falling from Pounds 214.1m to Pounds 202.3m. Other operating
charges, including investment in sales and trading technology, rose to
Pounds 157.1m from Pounds 111.5m.
Lord Cairns said Warburg would delay some investment in trading systems,
particularly those preparing for higher volumes.
There would not be 'a massive redundancy programme', but staff requirements
would be scrutinised carefully.
He and Sir David said that although reduction of expenses could not replace
revenue generation as the prime engine of profitability, 'a reduced and more
flexible cost base will contribute considerably to improving performance'.
Lord Cairns was satisfied with risk management systems for trading. Warburg
had reduced open positions after the tightening of US monetary policy in
February, but 'if you are a marketmaker, you have got to be there'.
Annualised return on equity fell to 9.1 per cent from 29.5 per cent, with
earnings per share falling to 14.4p from 41.8p.
The bank declared an unchanged interim dividend of 13.1p, as predicted in
the profit warning.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MAM to capitalise on German demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest independent fund management
company, is setting up an investment company in Germany to capitalise on the
growing demand for international investment expertise.
MAM is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, the investment bank. Mr Harald
Schussler, joint managing director of SG Warburg Asset Management Frankfurt,
said: 'The target client is the German institutional market - pension funds,
insurance companies, corporates.'
Recent European Union legislation on insurance funds which forced Germany to
lift restrictions on investment outside the country had prompted increased
interest in international bonds and equities.
'Our intention is to market our experience in the global equities market,'
Mr Schussler added.
The German institutional funds market has grown between 40 and 50 per cent
in each of the last three years as corporations discovered that professional
fund managers earned better returns than in-house investment managers, he
said.
MAM has obtained a licence to establish a Kapitalanlagegesellschaft, which
will allow it to set up so-called 'spezialfonden' carrying special tax
advantages.
Mr Schussler said it had several potential clients already.
Meanwhile, Mercury Asset Management reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for the six months to September 30 from Pounds 50.4m to Pounds 57m.
The interim rises to 4.5p (4p).
Assets under management rose from Pounds 55.5bn a year ago to Pounds 62.7bn.
Some Pounds 1.3bn represented net new cash in both institutional and retail
accounts, said Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman.
However, with the rise in profits and revenues came a significant increase
in operating expenses.
Operating costs rose from Pounds 56.8m to Pounds 82.2m but were only
slightly ahead of spending in the second half of the last financial year.
Mr Stevenson said almost all the increased expenses related to the hiring of
additional back office support for MAM's global custody operations and its
growing retail funds business.
'Spending has been frozen for three years and we had a lot of catching up to
do,' he said.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Birmingham Midshires buys Pounds 550m
mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has acquired
the Pounds 550m UK residential mortgage business of the UK subsidiary of
Credit Agricole, the French mutually-owned bank.
The purchase is more than three times larger than any of Birmingham
Midshires' mortgage book acquisitions to date and is a further example of
the departure from the UK market of the centralised lending subsidiaries of
overseas groups. It represents more than 10 per cent of the society's
assets, taking them to just over Pounds 5bn.
The society would not disclose the price, which is thought to be less than
Pounds 20m.
The Credit Agricole business is administered from Richmond, Surrey. Staff
based there will continue with the day-to-day management of its 11,000
customers for the time being. Birmingham Midshires said, however, that in
the longer term management of the business would be integrated with that of
the other mortgage books it has acquired and managed from its Wolverhampton
office.
Credit Agricole Personal Finance said yesterday that the decision to sell
had been strategic. The company considered a customer relationship limited
to mortgages alone to be insufficient in the UK.
Credit Agricole is the largest bank in France with total assets of FFr1.67bn
(Pounds 199m).
In a similar move, Banque Nationale de Paris is leaving the UK market:
further progress of the sale of its outstanding mortgages of Pounds 1.5bn to
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, is expected to
be announced later this month.
In a generally flat UK mortgage market, where margins are low, acquisition
of mortgage books and businesses is a popular way for mainstream lenders to
gain market share. Last week Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking
group, announced that it was buying Household Mortgage Corporation, the UK's
largest centralised lender with about Pounds 1.6bn in outstanding mortgages,
in an agreed cash offer of Pounds 56.3m.
Centralised lenders sell through intermediaries rather than through
branches, so for the purchaser there is the prospect of growth without the
task of reconciling two branch networks.
Many centralised lenders entered the UK housing market in the boom years of
the 1980s and have found conditions much more difficult since. Where they
are owned by foreign banks, the UK is often seen as no longer a core area of
business.

<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group which reports its interim
results today, announced a surprise senior management reshuffle  - including
the appointment of a new chief executive for its Mercury Communications
subsidiary - last night.
Mr Mike Harris, currently chief executive of Mercury and executive director
Europe, is moving to become chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless Federal
Development, which is responsible for developing the group's worldwide
services, features, applications and technologies.
Mr Harris, who joined Mercury in October 1991 having previously been chief
executive of Midland Bank's Firstdirect unit, is being replaced by Mr Duncan
Lewis, director of Business Networks and Cable &amp; Wireless' US operations.
The management changes come at a time when Mercury faces growing competition
and the need to improve productivity and cut costs.
Commenting on the changes, Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable &amp;
Wireless, said they reflected 'the development of Mercury as it faces
intensified competition and regulatory change'.
Among other appointments Mr Edward Astle is to become chief executive of
Cable &amp; Wireless Federal Communications while retaining his present
responsibilities.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ashbourne to join market with Pounds 80.5m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashbourne Holdings yesterday announced its shares would be offered to
potential investors at 150p, valuing the nursing homes operator at Pounds
80.5m.
Ashbourne, which was the subject of a management buy-out last year from
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, is raising Pounds 48m after expenses
through a placing and public offer to pay off debt.
Some 15 per cent of the 33.3m shares being issued will be offered to the
public and the rest placed with institutions. Existing shareholders will
retain 38 per cent of the company.
The company is coming to the market on a p/e of 12.9 times, based on
historic earnings of 11.6p. Ashbourne said that if it had been listed for
the year to October 2, the board would have recommended a dividend of 3p.
This represents a notional yield of 2.5 per cent.
Ashbourne caters for the upper end of the private pay market and is one of
the largest nursing home groups in the UK with 19 homes and 1,599 registered
beds.
Mr Tom Hamilton, chief executive, plans to open four new homes and build two
extensions to existing homes by the end of 1995. Ashbourne has the land and
planning consent to build homes with a further 515 beds.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Placing and intermediaries offer values
SeaPerfect at Pounds 59m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors with a yen for molluscs are being offered a stake in SeaPerfect,
the world's largest controlled producer of shellfish, for 120p a share. The
price values the seafood farmer at Pounds 59m.
SeaPerfect, which was founded by a US computer entrepreneur in the 1980s, is
coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer of 20.8m
shares. The issue will raise Pounds 25m, of which Pounds 18.4m will go to
the company and Pounds 6.6m to existing shareholders.
Of the offer, 15.6m shares, or 75 per cent, have been placed firm, with the
balance placed conditionally and made available to intermediaries.
SeaPerfect farms shellfish in Chile, Florida and South Carolina, producing
seed in its hatcheries and setting the young clams and scallops in protected
coastal areas.
Mr Bill Lord-Butcher, chief executive, argues that with declining stocks of
shellfish in the wild due to overfishing and pollution, controlled farming
is the only way to meet rising demand.
The company is forecasting a loss this year of not more than Pounds 1m,
after 1993's deficit of Pounds 2.7m. However, Mr Lord-Butcher has said the
company is making a profit in the final part of this year.
Sir David Orr, former Unilever chairman, is chairman and Mr Andre Benard,
the former co-chairman of Eurotunnel, is a non-executive director.
The issue has been fully underwritten by Williams de Broe, the stockbroker.

FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 10m law suit fears hit Lloyd
Thompson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lloyd Thompson, the insurance and reinsurance broker, fell 16p to
176p yesterday after the company warned that its principal subsidiary was
expected to be named as defendant in a Pounds 10m law suit.
Commercial Union, the composite insurer, is understood to be planning legal
proceedings following a dispute over a marine insurance policy arranged via
Lloyd Thompson. CU, which today announces its results for the first nine
months of this year, would not comment last night.
Lloyd Thompson said it would 'vigorously resist' any claim. The group said
in a statement that the proceedings had arisen 'in the ordinary course of
business' of its main broking business. The statement added: 'Such
proceedings could, if instituted, give rise to a claim of approximately
Pounds 10m.'
Lloyd Thompson has had to weather difficult trading conditions over the past
year which have curbed profits growth. In September it announced pre-tax
profits up 5 per cent to Pounds 18.2m for the 12 months to June 30.

FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Currency influences restrict
growth at Elan Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elan Corporation, the Irish-based drugs company 75 per cent owned by US
investors, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 19.8m (Pounds 19.5m) for the
six months to September 30.
The interim results last time showed a loss of IPounds 69m but included a
write-off of IPounds 85m for goodwill when Elan acquired Drug Research
Corporation.
Excluding the write-off, profit before tax amounted to IPounds 16m.
Turnover rose from IPounds 50m to IPounds 59m. Manufacturing and
distribution income was flat at IPounds 29m as an 8 per cent increase in
sales was offset by the strengthening of the punt against the dollar.
The main market for Elan's products is the US, which accounts for more than
50 per cent of sales.
The group's main product is the range of hypertension and angina drugs known
as the Cardizem family, which are projected to have sales of approximately
Dollars 900m (Pounds 550m) in the US and Canada this year, according to Mr
Tom Lynch, the chief financial officer.
The drugs are made under licence by Marion Merrell Dow and Elan takes 5 per
cent of sales.
Royalty income fell from IPounds 10m to IPounds 8m, also the result of
currency influences.
Contract development income increased from IPounds 7m to IPounds 11m,
representing an increased contribution from Advanced Therapeutic Systems, a
research affiliate.
Earnings per share were 55p compared with losses of 206p. Earnings before
the exceptional charge amounted to 45p.
The group is maintaining its policy of not paying dividends at the interim
stage.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Business class lifts BA to record: Warning of heavy
write-downs on USAir investment if talks with union collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday announced record second-quarter profits and an
'encouraging' outlook for the full year, as it reaped the rewards of a
campaign to win business travellers and tight cost controls.
However, BA said it would make provisions against its Dollars 400m (Pounds
244m) investment in USAir, if negotiations with the troubled airline's
Pilots' Union are not 'successfully resolved'. A full write-down would add 3
percentage points to its current net debt/capital ratio of 53 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose 45 per cent to Pounds
341m, with Pounds 253m coming from the second quarter, which covers the key
summer period. The figures were above expectations, and the shares closed 8p
higher at 365p.
Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive, said the company was on target to
achieve its previously-stated aim of Pounds 150m of cost savings for the
full year.
Operating costs rose 7.7 per cent to Pounds 3.18m during the period,
compared with a 9.8 per cent increase in group turnover to Pounds 3.62m. The
cost base was helped by a 5.4 per cent fall in fuel and oil costs.
The airline carried 16.4m passengers during the period, an increase of 6.8
per cent. Its performance was improved by the fact that revenues from the
more profitable first and business-class passengers grew at almost double
the rate of economy class. In addition, cargo revenues increased by 14.6 per
cent.
Qantas, the Australian flagship carrier in which BA has a 25 per cent stake,
announced profits of ADollars 301.8m (Pounds 141m) for the year to June, up
from ADollars 32.9m, and it is operating in what IATA expects to be the
fastest growing market in the world over the next four years.
However, TAT and Deutsche BA, BA's European affiliates, reported losses
similar to 1993.
Analysts estimate that the two companies will lose more than Pounds 50m this
year as they have been hampered by the competitive impact of the French
government's Pounds 2.4bn subsidy to Air France. Overall, associates
contributed Pounds 2m, compared with a Pounds 13m loss in 1993.
BA was adamant that its relationship with USAir has been positive, arguing
that the tie-up would bring in incremental profits of Pounds 70m in the
current year, due to their joint frequent-flyer programmes and cost sharing
arrangements.
Sir Colin said it was impossible to predict when negotiations with USAir's
unionised employees would be resolved.
Earnings per share increased by 17.2 per cent (fully diluted) to 23.9p
(20.4p), reflecting a return to a more normal tax charge of 25 per cent.
BA is to pay an interim dividend of 3.5p (3.18p).

FT  09 NOV 94 / Watching for fall-out as dollar rates climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the mid-term elections are over, the US Federal Reserve can return from
its sabbatical. The markets are assuming that the Fed open market committee
will agree to raise short-term interest rates by at least half a percentage
point when it meets next Tuesday.
Astonishingly, short-term dollar rates are still lower than those on
D-Marks, French francs and sterling despite higher inflation, a weak
currency and a serious trade imbalance. However, the money market yield
curve is artificially steep, and at six months dollars yield about 75 basis
points more than D-Marks.
Since the Fed last raised rates in August the dollar has weakened markedly,
and so has the Treasury bond market. During August and September 10-year
German government bonds outyielded the corresponding US Treasuries but now
the T-bonds return 40 basis points more. Europe has managed to de-couple
from the ailing dollar markets.
Thus at the long end the 30-year T-bond yield has been moving up through
8.15 per cent. This has provided a weak background for the Treasury's
auctions of bonds totalling Dollars 29bn (Pounds 17.6bn) yesterday and
today.
Although the US funding requirement is scarcely formidable in relation to
the size of the economy, this is not a favourable time in the economic cycle
for bonds. Not only are Americans notoriously unenthusiastic savers -
nothing new there - but several main sources of demand have largely dried
up.
Flows into retail bond mutual funds have ceased this year in the face of
capital losses, and modest (so far) rises in CD rates. Meanwhile foreigners
are steering well clear of dollar bonds, at least until the Fed has
tightened and it looks as though the dollar has bottomed.
Then there is the problem of the banks. Until the bond market turned a year
ago, US banks had bought more than Dollars 300bn of Treasury securities
within about four years. They are now sellers, as the profitable spread over
the carrying cost shrinks and meanwhile more attractive lending
opportunities appear in the expanding US economy.
The big question is whether they might become forced sellers. The huge
interest rate spread available a year and more ago on two to five-year paper
has been narrowed by the rise in overnight money costs from 3 to 4.75 per
cent, but it would be much worse at 5.25 per cent, let alone the pre-emptive
5.75 per cent that the bears talk about; the positions would probably run at
a loss and the banks might no long be prepared to maintain them to maturity.
Nor will the story end there: by mid-1995 the market expects short rates to
be at 6.5 per cent.
A great deal depends on the extent to which the leveraged exposures in the
US securities markets have been unwound. According to the Wall Street
newsletter Grant's, very little: securities credit outstanding to banks,
broker-dealers and households stood at Dollars 274bn at the end of June,
having doubled in about three years.
Meanwhile, the US equity market wriggles uncomfortably, trying to pretend
that problems in bonds can be ring-fenced. The stock market is still only 4
per cent below its peak, although transports and utilities have sold off by
a fifth. But if the long bond yield continues to edge up towards 8.5 per
cent the pressures on equities may become unbearable.
However, as the bulls argue, the bears have already had plenty of chances,
and they have not taken them. Meanwhile there has been plenty of sector
rotation to chase.
The general summary of the US economy is that monetary policy has for
several years been too loose. This has not shown up in exceptionally high
monetary growth because the credit has been mopped up by the securities
markets, or dollars have piled up abroad where Asian governments have been
holding down their currencies. Nor has inflation been particularly high,
because the balance of payments has taken much of the strain.
Now the dollar overhang has become much more threatening, however, and
policy must be sharply tightened. Yet Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has
to move with care. Having saved the banking system in the late 1980s he
surely does not want to have to rescue the securities markets.

FT  09 NOV 94 / M&amp;S sees sales in Europe rise 20%: UK retailer plans
continental expansion as pre-tax profits rise 15% to Pounds 354m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, has lifted continental
European sales by 20 per cent since exporting its Outstanding Value Campaign
from the UK. The campaign, run in the UK for the past couple of years,
passes on to customers cost savings made through improvements in efficiency
and information technology without damaging operating margins. It is
operated jointly with suppliers, who benefit from higher production runs.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, yesterday stressed that it was a long-term
project to improve and sharpen the products on sale.
Sales in Europe rose from Pounds 134.5m to Pounds 152.3m in the six months
to October 1, the group said yesterday. Operating profits were down from
Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 5m after charging Pounds 3.8m for the opening of new
stores.
Sir Richard said Europe had been through 'a very, very tough period, with
the consumer in the trenches. But if we can keep sales going at 20 per cent,
it will come through strongly in the second half.'
Total group pre-tax profits were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 354.2m on the
back of a 6.9 per cent sales rise to Pounds 3.07bn.
M&amp;S is accelerating its expansion plans, and is lifting capital expenditure
to a record Pounds 400m this year. While most of this will be spent in the
UK, Sir Richard says there are few high streets and out-of-town sites where
the group has no store.
In contrast, there are only 25 stores on continental Europe. M&amp;S has already
identified a further 45 to 50 sites across France, Holland and Spain, but
Sir Richard stressed that the group would proceed with caution.
It had taken four years to find and negotiate an appropriate site before
opening the Valencia store last year.
'Our continued expansion is geared to the right sites and the speed at which
we can get them,' said Sir Richard. 'It's a marathon, not a sprint.'
The group is also looking at Japan and China following the success of its
Hong Kong operations, which are yielding better returns than anywhere else.
Operating profits in the Far East rose from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 8m in the
half, while sales were up from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 32.1m.
Sir Richard said a decision on whether to go ahead with its first store in
Japan would be taken within the next 12 months.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Munich Re feels global warming's impact on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance group, warned yesterday of a
trend towards increasing natural disasters which is forcing it to reduce or
end exposure to some high-risk areas of business.
It said this policy was the result of high population growth, greater
concentrations of people and property in vulnerable areas, and climatic
changes, associated with global warming, which are causing unusually severe
storms and floods.
This more selective approach to business will lead to much slower growth
this year but strengthen future profitability, said Mr Hans-Jurgen
Schinzler, chief executive. Premium income growth will be well under 5 per
cent after a 12 per cent rise to DM28.6bn (Pounds 12bn) in the year to June
30, 1994.
Although Munich Re benefited from a reduction in natural disasters and
higher premiums last year - underwriting losses fell from DM1.3bn to DM379m
and earnings rose 4.6 per cent to DM300m - Mr Wolf Otto Bauer, a director,
said the company was convinced the global trend to more frequent and
damaging catastrophes would continue over the long term.
'If I was a betting man, I could offer you a bet that the records of recent
years will be beaten by new damage records,' he said. Munich Re placed great
stress on risk management, and was studying the danger of changes in climate
through global warming.
'The signs that we are experiencing such a change in climate are
increasing,' he added. This meant the industry had to pay out for damage by
storms and floods as well as on claims for buildings, vehicles and crops
damaged by hailstones. A hailstorm in the Cologne-Bonn area in July, for
example, will cost the company around DM40m.
Mr Schinzler said the earthquake near Los Angeles this year would lead to a
claims burden of some DM150m for Munich Re, though the figure would be
higher if it had not previously reduced its exposure there. With total
damage of around Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19bn) and insured losses of Dollars
10bn, this was the second-most costly loss in insurance history since
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Last year, however, was the first since 1987 without a new record being set
for insurance losses on a natural catastrophe. Munich Re took the
opportunity to stock up its provisions for earthquake and other risks, as
well as for outstanding claims, by DM850m.
It has already announced a DM1 rise in the dividend to DM12; earnings per
share were DM48.60 (DM30.70).
Ahead of tighter German disclosure regulations, Munich Re revealed stakes of
just over 5 per cent in BHF-Bank, Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank,
IKB Deutsche Industriebank and Mannheimer Versicherung. It also owns more
than 8 per cent of the Aachener und Munchener insurance group.
In the UK, it owns 6 per cent of SG Warburg, the merchant banking group, 3
per cent of Commercial Union and 8 per cent of Trade Indemnity Insurance.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Agreement signalled on Ulster peace framework
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish
foreign minister, are set to meet in the Irish Republic on Monday amid signs
of a breakthrough in efforts to agree a joint document on the province's
future.
This emerged as the Irish government yesterday sought to play down its plans
for the early release of IRA prisoners, announced on Monday, after an angry
response from unionist politicians and warnings that they could derail the
peace process.
The meeting, expected to be informal, follows the postponement of talks due
last week. It will come after a meeting between British and Irish officials
this Friday to resume detailed work on the so-called framework document.
Expectations are mounting that the document could be completed by
mid-December.
A meeting on it last week is understood to have resulted in progress on the
issue of north-south relations, one of the sticking points that has impeded
progress since the summer. There are also long-standing differences over
constitutional issues, in particular Dublin's territorial claim over
Northern Ireland enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution.
A completion date next month would coincide with the first anniversary of
the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 1993. Downing
Street said yesterday that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would launch
an international investment conference in Belfast, two days before the
anniversary.
Irish officials said yesterday the release of IRA prisoners did not have an
immediate bearing on the framework document.
The issue is not controversial in Dublin and Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish
prime minister, and other government officials had signalled the prospect of
an early release of IRA prisoners several times since the IRA ceasefire on
August 31.
The Irish government's move was attacked by the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader
of the Democratic Unionist party, and some mainland British politicians. Mr
Paisley claimed the British government had a secret agenda and was working
on plans of its own for prisoner releases.
Mr Andrew Hunter, leader of the Commons back-bench committee on Northern
Ireland and Tory MP for Basingstoke, said: 'It is a very serious
miscalculation on the part of Dublin, the sort of miscalculation which can
undermine confidence in the peace process.'
An IRA commander was jailed for 25 years yesterday. English-born Dr Feilim
O'Hadhmaill, 36, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire,
Preston, was sentenced for spearheading an IRA bomb plot on mainland UK
before the August ceasefire.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arms seized in French crackdown on Islamic 'militants'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French police yesterday launched a crackdown on suspected Islamic militants,
seizing a cache of firearms and detaining more than 90 people, including
alleged supporters of an Algerian guerrilla organisation.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, said the operation revealed a
support network for Algerian guerrillas which has links in four other
western European countries and in Canada. 'It provides evidence of a network
of extremists determined to pursue clandestine or terrorist actions from our
territory or other nations,' he said.
Mr Pasqua said surveillance carried out since mid-October had confirmed the
existence of a support network for the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) with
branches in Germany, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada.
The interior minister declined to comment on whether he expected arrests in
those countries, but has previously demanded that France's allies take
stronger action against suspected Moslem terrorist groups.
Yesterday's operation reflects the tough line taken by the French
government, anxious to avoid the spread of the conflict between the
military-backed regime in Algeria and its Islamic opponents. The GIA is the
most radical of the Moslem fundamentalist groups attempting to overthrow the
Algerian government.
The conflict in Algeria has escalated in recent months, fuelling fears in
France of a possible wave of immigrants from its former colony.
Yesterday's action - mainly in the Paris region - was the second large-scale
operation against suspected Islamic fundamentalists in France since the
summer. In August, 20 suspected Moslem extremists were expelled.
The French government has maintained the pressure on suspected Islamic
extremists. Last Sunday, France deported an Algerian Moslem cleric accused
of spreading fundamentalist propaganda.
Mr Pasqua claimed yesterday's operation demonstrated the threat posed to
internal security by militant Islamic groups. Officials emphasised the scale
of the arms seizures, which included assault rifles, handguns and
detonators, found in a building in the southern suburbs of Paris.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Greece forced to put back telecoms float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece yesterday postponed the partial flotation of OTE, the state telecoms
monopoly, because conditions on international capital markets were
considered unfavourable. It would have been one of the largest
privatisations in the European Union this year.
Although the government said postponement of the 25 per cent flotation, set
for early December and expected to raise about Dr320bn (Pounds 847m), was
temporary, Greek analysts believe it could be delayed indefinitely.
Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said: 'The situation in world
stock markets would not guarantee a satisfactory price for OTE shares.'
He said the flotation would go ahead early next year but analysts doubted
whether it would take place, because of rising opposition to privatisation
within the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
The postponement was announced only a few days before CS First Boston and J.
Henry Schroder Wagg, global co-ordinators and lead underwriters for the
offering, were to begin three weeks of soliciting bids.
Ten other international investment banks are in the underwriting syndicate
for the issue's international tranche, amounting to 18 per cent of the
company. National Bank of Greece, the other joint co-ordinator for the
issue, is lead manager for the domestic tranche of 7 per cent.
OTE is one of only a few profitable Greek state enterprises. It reported
pre-tax profits of Dr77.8bn on sales of Dr210.8bn in the first half of 1994.
However, the issue has not attracted much interest in Athens, where
investors were invited to pre-register for shares last week. A stockbroker
said OTE's growth 'would be limited because the government insists it should
remain under state management'.
The postponement came amid growing political tension, with Mr Papantoniou,
who leads the pro-European reformist faction in the cabinet, under attack by
radical Socialists intent on maintaining government control over industry. A
failed attempt last year by the then conservative (New Democracy) government
to privatise OTE was revived in a modified form by the Socialists after they
returned to power last October.

about the fees its Mercury Communications subsidiary has to pay BT for
channelling calls over its rival's network. But it is a bit rich to blame
yesterday's management shake-up on the regulatory regime that governs such
fees, as some in C&amp;W are prone to. True, the system is ungainly and flawed.
But Mercury has known about it for over three years. It has spent too much
time complaining about the raw deal it received and not done enough to make
the most of a difficult situation. Now the chickens are coming home to
roost. Not only are network fees rising; BT is making sharp cuts in long
distance call rates. Given that Mercury has set out its stall as little more
than a discount competitor, it has had no option but to match BT's price
cuts. Today's results from Cable &amp; Wireless are expected to confirm the
uncomfortable squeeze in which it finds itself.
The management shake-up should enable Mercury to attack its cost base. The
new chief executive should find it easier to cut back parts of the operation
since he was not involved in building it up. But cost reduction alone will
not be enough to give Mercury a sustainable competitive advantage. If it is
to differentiate itself from its rivals, Mercury will also need to place a
much greater emphasis on innovation and improving the reliability of its
service.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg faced two problems in the half-year to end-September: falling
revenues and rising costs. Shareholders will be encouraged by yesterday's
promise to remedy both. But they may be mystified about exactly how the
investment bank plans to deliver.
On the cost side, Warburg is not planning to reduce staff. And though
bonuses will be lower this year than the bumper payments made last year,
there is no indication that the remuneration system will change. Warburg
continues to pay its staff more than rival British merchant banks. But given
its global ambitions, it will be hard pushed to cut remuneration much below
the levels of its big US competitors. The only concrete cost-cutting measure
Warburg would point to yesterday was its intention to curb investment in
information technology.
On the revenue side, the bank's main hope is that dealing profits - the half
year's black spot - will rebound. Certainly, bear markets cannot last
forever. But Warburg's poor performance continued long after bond markets
collapsed in February. It takes a leap of faith to believe that the group's
return on equity over the medium term will average the 15-20 per cent it
thinks reasonable. But the vagueness of Warburg's plans for improving its
performance does not mean the shares are overvalued. When the group's 75 per
cent stake in fund management group MAM is stripped out, the banking
business is being valued by the market at only Pounds 535m. One would have
to take an extremely gloomy view of its prospects to argue that it is worth
less.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the 5.5p drop in Marks and Spencer's shares yesterday seemed
a churlish reaction to a characteristically robust performance from the UK's
leading retailer. After all, M&amp;S brushed off fierce competition to turn in a
15.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, ahead of brokers' best estimates.
The interim results did however give rise to slight mystification over the
composition of the profits.
M&amp;S could have helped dispel this by disclosing more information about how
it achieved the 15.7 per cent increase in UK operating profits. It is, for
example, disingenuous on its part to claim that it cannot produce meaningful
data on 'like for like' sales, as other retailers do. M&amp;S should also have
disclosed more about the impact of the group's cost control programme - a
central if unquantifiable factor behind the increase in operating margins.
The absence of such information raises questions about the quality of the
profits, taking the shine off M&amp;S's success in increasing its share of the
non-food retail market, and apparently holding its own in food.
M&amp;S's ambitious expansion plans for the UK and continental Europe ensure
that despite its size, growth prospects remain excellent relative to the
retail sector. Yet earnings growth is not expected to outpace the market as
a whole. With the shares on a 25 per cent premium, assuming pre-tax profits
of Pounds 950m for the full year, this is demanding. The record and the
group's financial strengths ensure that M&amp;S is in no danger of losing its
standing as a core holding within the sector. But there is better value
elsewhere.

<TEXT>
BA's second-quarter figures were so good that for a moment the market could
almost forget the continuing headache that is USAir. BA's stern cost control
was again in evidence and the strong growth in business traffic brought a
healthy increase in overall passenger yields. Year on year growth is bound
to slow now, if only because the business traffic recovery started in the
third quarter of BA's last financial year. But BA still has plenty of
momentum behind it and there are even signs that tariffs are firming.
It is the size of the final bill for BA's international expansion that is
the worry. Losses from France and Germany were unchanged in the first half
as the flag carriers attacked BA's Trojan horses. But it is USAir which is
the immediate concern. The Dollars 500m of cost reductions being asked of
the unions would barely offset its current losses and as the negotiations
grind on its low-cost rivals are leaving it further behind. The real fear is
not that BA will have to write off the Pounds 260m value of its stake, which
it could handle comfortably. It is that USAir will slowly die, threatening
the Pounds 70m of benefit BA expects this year, or that BA will feel
compelled to pour more money in to keep it alive.
The loss of Pounds 8m in preference dividends will be the only pain BA will
suffer from USAir in the current year which should see group profits jump by
over 40 per cent to around Pounds 430m. With the shares trading on about
11.5 times prospective earnings, it is hard to argue that they are
expensive. But until there is better news from USAir they are likely to
remain grounded.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Europe's big challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The events of 1989, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall five years ago
today, presented Europe as a whole with its greatest challenge since the
Berlin blockade of 1948, and its best chance to build a 'just and lasting
peaceful order' since 1919.
It was a challenge to the peoples of eastern and central Europe themselves,
but also to the west, which was asked to put its money where its mouth had
been for 40 years. And not only money. During those 40 years western Europe
had achieved unprecedented security and prosperity through a model of
economic and political integration which, even while rhetorically deploring
the division of the continent, tacitly assumed that it was here to stay. Now
western Europe had either to renege on its proclaimed ideals, or find a way
of sharing its security and prosperity with the rest of the continent.
Three questions were unavoidably posed:
Which west European institutions could be expanded to take in the newly free
countries?
How much adjustment of those institutions would the expansion imply?
Were some existing institutions, on the contrary, rendered redundant or
anachronistic by the end of the cold war?
Only in relation to one small part of the former east were those questions
given a definitive answer. West Germany absorbed 16m East Germans into the
whole gamut of its internal laws and external commitments. Even this
relatively small-scale exercise proved almost ruinously expensive for the
strongest economy on the continent. Clearly the model is not applicable to
the continent as a whole.
Nato, the successful guardian of western Europe in the cold war, has proved
itself largely irrelevant to the challenge of peace. It feared to jeopardise
its previous success by reaching out too quickly to new member states where
democracy was new and fragile, and it allowed itself to be manoeuvred into
giving Russia an implicit veto over any future expansion. It tried to find a
new raison d'etre in peacekeeping, but in the former Yugoslavia it is now
deep in the conceptual quagmire between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.
Strategic leadership
The European Community (as it still was in 1989) has been less troubled by
self-doubt. Its special stock in trade, economic integration, was clearly
what the east was looking for. But its first instinct was to reinforce the
integration of its existing membership, in order to forestall any
disintegrative effect that the sudden crumbling of its eastern border might
have, and to endow Europe with a political centre capable of giving
strategic leadership.
The instinct was sound but the rationale was not clearly spelt out, nor the
measures proposed clearly related to it; and the economic climate was hardly
conducive to an enthusiastic response. The result is a European Union in
name more than substance: divided, sulky, and offering more difficulties
than attractions to potential new members in the east. But at least the EU
has paid lip-service to the need to absorb the states of central Europe.
Several of them, meanwhile, have risen impressively to the challenge. They
already look more credible potential members than they did a year or two
ago.
What is needed now is a plan to make the next five years a period of
adjustment for both east and west, during which an eastward expansion of the
EU can be seriously prepared. The intergovernmental conference scheduled for
1996 should mark an important stage in that plan, but it can do so only if
it takes full account of the views and interests of candidate as well as
existing members.
Radical reform
The plan will have to include a complete opening of the west European market
to central and east European products (including 'sensitive' ones), and a
more radical reform of the common agricultural policy and the regional and
structural funds than so far envisaged. That is not an agenda that France
and Spain, which will hold the presidency next year, are at all keen to
embark on. But they have to face the reality that the EU does not have the
resources to bring central European food prices up to west European levels,
even if that were an economically sensible thing to do. Nor does it have
funds to dish out to central Europe on the scale that it now does to
southern Europe. Yet the EU is committed in principle to eastward expansion,
and Germany, the biggest net contributor, will not let it renege on that
commitment.
Germany will also keep pushing for a central core of countries to lead the
way in forming a fully-fledged federation, with political integration as the
counterpart to monetary union. France appears less and less sure of the
value of this bargain, but is more than ever keen on a joint European
defence, partly to provide a framework within which German military
capabilities can be cultivated without seeming dangerous to Germany's
neighbours. Britain too is keen on this aspect of European integration, but
it must be doubted whether a common defence will really be credible unless
there is also a unified political leadership to give it its orders.
In any case, the existence of such an integrated hard core will be of
interest to the candidate members only if it provides Europe with the
strategic leadership that has been lacking for the last five years. Most of
them now understand that their security depends less on military guarantees
than on being fully integrated into a pan-European economy and society. By
November 9 1999 that process must be well under way.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Small business management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Policymakers frequently trot out the view that public support is needed if
managers in the UK's smaller companies are to be competitive. Unfortunately,
neither the government, nor consultants in the training-and-advice game,
have dared ask whether such support actually works. That failure should be
remedied by investigating what benefit, if any, this subsidised consultancy
is providing.
In a refreshing departure from its previous position, the Confederation of
British Industry acknowledged this on Monday by questioning whether
government spending on management development is being wisely focused.
Picking up on research carried out by Warwick Business School earlier this
year, the CBI warned that nobody knows whether taxpayers' money is well
spent in this area. The point is not that there is proof that spending on
management development does not work, but rather that the opposite
presumption is unfounded.
The warning is timely. Each year, the government indirectly spends more than
Pounds 100m on management support - business counselling, export support,
the Investors in People programme and a host of other schemes - mainly for
owner-managed businesses. Most of this is from the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Department for Employment and is delivered via Training and
Enterprise Councils and Business Links - the network of one-stop advice
shops being put in place across the country.
The skills these organisations are trying to enhance are doubtless lacking
in many smaller businesses. Some companies recognise this and pay a full
market rate to consultants to help solve the problem. But when government
peddles subsidised services, there is a danger companies are being
encouraged to use programmes that do not work to tackle management issues
that are not important. In that case, both the subsidy and the companies'
own costs are all wasted.
The CBI's questioning of management development spending is particularly
timely given the advance of the Business Link network. Later this month,
when London's application is approved, the government will be more than half
way towards its goal of opening 80 Business Links in England. These new
organisations may be keener to meet their targets for providing services -
hours of consultancy given and numbers of companies supported - than they
are to evaluate the benefits their customers derive.
The CBI should be congratulated on questioning the worth of public support
in this area. This is so quite apart from the potential for waste and
economic distortion. Medium-sized companies increasingly provide the jobs
big business is shedding. For this reason, they need to be helped in the
most effective possible ways. More effort should be devoted to determining
what kind of state-aided support for management development works best. Only
then could taxpayers and medium-sized companies feel confident that the most
effective possible assistance is on offer.

FT  09 NOV 94 / The Fall of the Wall: When the people went over the top - In
the first of a series, Anthony Robinson analyses the consequences of the
fall of communism five years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overnight transformation of the Berlin Wall five years ago today from
the symbol of divided Europe into a quarry for souvenir hunters marked the
end of a 200-year historical cycle. The wall which symbolised oppression was
built by the heirs to a violent revolutionary tradition which began in Paris
with dreams of liberte, egalite, fraternite.
The French revolution led inexorably from liberty through anarchy and terror
to tyranny before crashing to military defeat. The bloodier communist
revolution ended with the internal collapse of the militarised Soviet
dinosaur and the joyous shouts of liberated East Berliners.
The climactic moment of the 'six months that shook the world' in 1989
remains the surge of delirious crowds through the Berlin Wall on November 9.
But the spark that exploded communism and ended the cold war was struck at
the round table power-sharing talks between Solidarity and Polish communist
leaders that began six months earlier.
The talks began in the spring and ended in June with an agreement to hold
multi-party elections, heavily rigged in favour of the communists and their
allies. But the elections produced a tidal wave of anti-communist votes that
gave Solidarity most of the freely-contested seats in the Sejm, the lower
house, and all 100 seats in the largely decorative senate. It was a crushing
moral defeat for the communists and opened the way for post-war Poland's
first non-communist government, led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
The Poles had shown that it was possible to remove a communist government
peacefully. But that was not enough for others to follow suit. Fear of
violent reaction from Moscow remained until Mikhail Gorbachev and his small
band of close advisers let it be known that Moscow would no longer intervene
in what they hoped would be limited to a generational change of leaders and
style.
The Brezhnev doctrine, which had led to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in
1968, was replaced by the 'Sinatra doctrine'. Each country would be free to
follow its own path, and 'do it my way', as Mr Gennadi Gerasimov, Mr
Gorbachev's smooth and cynical press secretary, crooned in reply to
journalists' questions about Moscow's policy on the changes in central
Europe. Throughout the region, subject peoples took the hint and regimes
began to fall like skittles in a bowling alley.
In September, Hungary's reformist communist leadership cut open the frontier
with Austria and thousands of East Germans fled through the holes. Soon
afterwards, old tyrants such as East Germany's Erich Honnecker and
Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov were elbowed aside by younger apparatchiks. They in
turn were rejected by milling crowds in central Europe's towns and squares.
A month after the Berlin wall collapsed, Czechs and Slovaks exulted in a
'velvet revolution'. The communist leaders were peacefully replaced by
dissident writers, poets and, unremarked at the time, a steely-minded group
of passionate free-market economic reformers.
There was bloodshed only at the tail end of this extraordinary process of
rebirth. On Christmas day 1989, Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator,
and his even more hated wife, Elena, were summarily tried and executed after
fleeing Bucharest by helicopter. Bloody street-fighting followed.
Overall, freedom brought euphoria. It did not last long. The cold light of
day and freedom of expression quickly revealed the extent of moral decay,
physical deterioration and economic backwardness bequeathed to the entire
region by 45 years of communism.
All over the former Soviet world, previously unknown and untried leaders
have since faced the daunting tasks of constructing a democratic state out
of the totalitarian wreckage and transforming their planned economies into
market systems.
In the European parts of the former Soviet empire, there have been few
witch-hunts. In Lithuania, Poland and Hungary, former communist politicians
have been returned to power in free elections as new-look social democrats.
All over, historic roots and ancient rivalries have been rediscovered. The
Soviet doctrine of 'proletarian internationalism' was quickly rejected by
peoples who were deemed by communist ideologues to have submerged their
identity into international working class solidarity.
In Europe, this led to the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia, instigated
by former communist officials re-packaged as rabid nationalists.
Further east, ethnic wars broke out in the Caucasus and parts of central
Asia. Russia itself faced disintegration as peoples subjugated for centuries
by Tsar and commissar alike re-opened claims for greater autonomy and the
revival of old customs and laws.
There remains a danger that a wider conflagration will erupt out of the
Balkans, the Caucasus or central Asia. But the threat of nuclear destruction
has been lifted from the world. Large parts of central Asia and the Baltic
and Black seas have been opened to normal trade and commerce. Above all,
economic, political and human rights and freedoms have been restored over
one sixth of the globe.
Western leaders have been slow, however, to recognise the momentous
challenge presented by the collapse of Soviet control over eastern Europe -
not least because the events of 1989 came largely as a surprise.
Germany single-mindedly concentrated on re-integrating the five eastern
Lander into a re-united state. But the initially generous emotional response
of western Europe was blunted by recession as the European Union grappled
with rising unemployment. Governments and lobbies often reacted to cheap
eastern labour and products as a threat rather than an opportunity to lower
costs and expand trade and investment.
Slowly Brussels embarked on a series of bilateral trade negotiations that
have resulted in 'association agreements' with the six former Warsaw Pact
countries. It began with the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia,
the fast-track reform states known collectively as the 'Visegrad 4' after
the Hungarian town where they sealed their loose alliance. The four, and
Slovenia, are working hard to bring their institutions, laws and economies
as close to EU standards as possible in the hope of full entry by the turn
of the century. The EU Copenhagen summit in 1993 opened up the prospect of
full membership but remained tantalisingly imprecise as to timing.
The timetable stretches further into the future for Albania, Romania and
Bulgaria and remains obscure for the former Soviet Baltic states, Belarus
and Ukraine, and the war-entangled former Yugoslav states. The greatest fear
of all the countries of east and central Europe is of being left in limbo
between a prosperous western Europe defended by Nato and an eventually
resurgent Russia claiming special privileges and influence over what it
terms 'the near abroad'.
The fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of the cold war and removed
the physical barriers to the creation of a united Europe. But creating the
political and economic structures needed to keep such a rich, varied but
potentially fractious family of nations pointing in the same direction
without frightening Russia back into its old aggressive defensiveness is a
task which has only just begun.
The next milestones are the forthcoming summit of EU leaders at the European
Council meeting in Essen next month and the Intergovernmental Conference of
1996. But it would be an illusion to imagine that the architecture of such a
Europe could be drawn up by politicians and bureaucrats alone. They are
already way behind the businessmen, bankers and investors whose contribution
to the creation of a pan-European market will be reviewed in the second
article of this series.

Exeter police have fingered a pig. It has to take part in an identity
parade, they say, and sniff out its rightful owner - ownership is being
contested by four people.
Of course, this problem could be avoided if yet another Japanese idea were
to be rapidly imported. Japan's health ministry is now thinking of
implanting identification microchips into dogs. A hand-held radio decoder -
similar to technology used by shop-workers - would give instant details of
the dog's owner.
This could be highly embarrassing: 'Excuse me, sir, but we have a dog here
claiming to be Fifi-tinkerbelle and that you are its owner. . .'

Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader of Britain's Labour party, has always
had a bit of a love-hate relationship with trade unions. Now he reckons that
there should be a 'judicial separation, if not a divorce, from the unions'
to help Labour win the next general election.
A scribbler of great fecundity, Hattersley has written so much in his time
it's no wonder he forgets his earlier words. Back in 1987 in his book Choose
Freedom - The Future for Democratic Socialism he said: 'We have to persuade
trades unions and trade unionists that they have a vested interest in
socialism and they should conduct themselves in a way that socialism
requires.'
Seven years on it's clear what that vested interest is - to clear off.

Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, has a way with words. Peter
Jay, Britain's former ambassador to the US and former Robert Maxwell
employee, told yesterday's Wall Street Journal how once, when walking next
to Henry Kissinger, he was 'more or less knocked to the ground physically'
by Black trying to get between them.
According to the WSJ, Black describes Jay's account as 'a wild
bowdlerisation'. Thomas Bowdler, it will be recalled, made his name by
publishing an edition of Shakespeare with the dirty bits left out. Which
raises the question - what was really going on between Black and Kissinger?

Try as it must, Britain's new-look Labour party will have a struggle on its
hands to convince the financial markets that it is not 'soft' on inflation.
Take Ruth Kelly, a bright young economics writer on the Guardian, who
moonlights by writing an occasional column for Tribune, the traditional
Labour party weekly.
In her latest offering there she notes that 'if inflation were allowed to
rise from its 27-year low in the first few years of a Labour government,
with a drop in the rate pencilled in towards the end of its term, that would
allow government and companies to tackle the bottlenecks in the economy and
raise it on to a higher growth path, uninhibited by an absurd inflation
constraint'.
This sort of thinking is not going to shock Kelly's normal followers. For
them the belief that there's nowt like a whiff of inflation to sort out the
problems of the British economy is still conventional wisdom.
But it may raise a few eyebrows at the Bank of England, where she starts
work on Monday morning as deputy head of its inflation report division. If
people working on the inflation report do not believe in the importance of
the target it is evaluating, why should anyone else?

It's ironic that, at a time when increased activity and rising prices have
raised the profile of commodities trading organisations, thus making them
attractive to people on the lookout for acquisitions, Marc Rich should
finally quit.
Rich, one of a handful of internationally-known Belgians, has built up his
eponymous Marc Rich International since 1974 into a world-class trading
business. In turnover terms it became Switzerland's second-biggest
corporation after Nestle.
But Rich has lost a power struggle with Willy Strothotte - now chairman and
chief executive - and since March last year has been slackening his grip on
the company until yesterday he sold his final 25 per cent to management and
employees.
Apart from being one of the most feared adversaries in the oil and aluminium
trading world, Rich is also one of the best-known fugitives from the US
legal system. He was charged with tax evasion and other offences by the US
authorities in 1984 and so far has refused to return to answer the charges.
One spot he probably won't be spending his retirement in.

<TEXT>
When Americans went to the polls yesterday, choosing the best candidates
wasn't the only challenge some faced. What we must term the 'vertically
challenged' voters - observing all due political correctness - apparently
don't get a fair crack at democracy, because they aren't tall enough to read
the name at the top of the huge voting machines.
A researcher at Ohio State University has videotaped 19 people in a mock
polling booth. She finds that 44 per cent did not record any vote at the top
of the machine. 'It was too high for shorter people to see comfortably - 67
inches from the floor. The average American woman's eye height is only 60
inches,' says Susan King Roth.
This sits rather uneasily with other US research showing that Americans
usually vote for the tallest candidate. In all but one of the presidential
elections this century the taller candidate won; the exception was Jimmy
Carter's victory over Gerald Ford in 1976. And look what happened to him.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Personal View: Goodbye to 'good chaps' government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary and head of the British civil service,
subscribes, it has been said by a former senior civil servant, to the 'good
chaps theory of government'.
And why not? When I first came to the UK in the 1950s, everybody did.
Good chaps ran the royal colleges, the chartered institutes, the inns of
court, the merchant banks, public companies, Lloyd's insurance market,
Oxbridge colleges, public schools and the House of Commons.
Former prime minister Harold Macmillan - a little too clever to be a really
good chap - presided over the nation with wit and cynicism, turning aside
from cares of state to read Aeschylus in the original.
Bowler-hatted good chaps poured from the underground every morning, properly
dressed for their stations in life, umbrellas rolled, detachable collars
firmly held in place by studs and waistcoats with the bottom button undone.
They wore the right ties and held the right views.
They knew what was done and what not. After six o'clock, one put on black
shoes. Gentlemen and players changed in separate dressing rooms at Lord's
cricket ground.
I remember asking a director of the Hamburg bank where I trained why we lost
consortium business to the City. 'Ah,' he replied sadly. 'We cheat. They
play according to the rules.'
The good chap was a type. The English gentleman belonged, along with the
Jesuit father, the German general staff officer or the southern American
planter, to a group of human beings instantly recognisable and, even more
important, utterly predictable.
As Gilbert and Sullivan, whose comic operas chronicled the Victorian good
chap, put it, 'he never thought of thinking for himself at all', and this
was his greatest advantage.
Educated at Marlborough and Balliol, he knew how 'to play the game'. His
degree in classics helped him to learn Urdu or Swahili. He could be sent up
the Zambezi or into the Indian hill country for months without orders from
headquarters or modern means of communication.
He kept a straight bat, maintained no concubines and remarkably rarely took
a bribe. The less he thought for himself, the more rapid his promotion.
The good chap was the product of brilliant Victorian social engineers, men
like the Reverend Elijah Woodard, who founded Lancing, Ardingly, Denholm,
Bloxham and countless other public (ie private) schools. These schools
created the 'gentleman', a social type which blurred the distinction between
noble and bourgeois, a cause of revolution on the continent.
Rules were understood, not written. Hence Britain ran its affairs without
those cumbersome documents known as constitutions, without state
examinations to regulate the professions, without government agencies to
control business and commerce.
Victorian and Edwardian governments probably produced better value for money
than any governments in modern history. The system responded heroically to
the challenge of two wars and the introduction of the welfare state, but it
began to creak in the 1960s and 1970s. Unwritten rules turned into cosy
arrangements to avoid conflict, and economic decline wrote its verdict on
British performance.
Margaret Thatcher - not a good chap herself - understood that the system had
to go and she dealt it every sort of blow. She hated establishments,
corporate bodies and restrictive practices, closed societies and tacit
understandings.
Like her great predecessor, Robespierre, she was a Jacobin democrat, the
descendant of those furious Parisian shopkeepers who destroyed ancien regime
France. She hoped that banishing the good chap would liberate Britain from
the dead hand of customary rule. Her great experiment failed. The boom of
the 1980s proved artificial, rouge on the cheeks of a corpse. But in forcing
us to be free she centralised the state and destroyed local autonomy.
The legacy of her unfinished revolution is state power without control. Now
good chaps no longer regulate themselves, nothing has taken their place.
Britain has the least representative electoral system and offers its
citizens the lowest civil rights of any developed state.
They have neither the written constitution and bill of rights of the
Americans nor the continental system of administrative courts which protect
citizens against the agencies of the state.
Sir Robin Butler may still believe in the 'good chaps theory of government'.
The rest of us can see that it no longer works in practice.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Formula for explosive reaction: The buoyant chemicals
industry is preparing for the eventual downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the world's chemical giants, the good times are rolling. Sales are
rising, prices are rising, and profits are soaring.
Yet in this notoriously cyclical industry, the next downturn is never far
away. How far depends on whether this year's rising chemicals prices owe
more to an underlying rise in demand or to temporary constraints on
production.
The industry is divided on the matter, but not on the fall-out:
third-quarter results have been excellent. Dow Chemical of the US reported
post-tax profits 102 per cent higher than a year earlier, while US rival Du
Pont turned a Dollars 680m loss a year ago, affected by a restructuring
charge, into a Dollars 650m profit. In Europe, ICI's pre-tax profits were 59
per cent higher than a year earlier. There were spectacular figures too from
BP Chemicals in the UK, France's Rhone-Poulenc, DSM of the Netherlands, and
Dutch-Swedish combine Akzo-Nobel.
Industry leaders have been only too willing to claim the credit for this
turnround. 'The majority of the improvement has come from hard-won market
volume gains and improved productivity,' says Sir Denys Henderson, ICI
chairman.
Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont chairman, says: 'This performance confirms that
transformation efforts to make all of our businesses globally competitive
are working.'
But this pride would seem to be inflated. The previous five years of
depressed prices and heavy losses brought only modest restructuring to the
industry and few real capacity cuts.
Efforts were made to secure deeper cuts, but they proved unsuccessful. A
year ago, European producers of ethylene, perhaps the most important of the
ingredients for plastics, formulated a plan to shut more than 10 per cent of
capacity in Europe. Prices were so low that all but the largest and most
efficient plants were losing money.
But the plan collapsed because each individual producer feared it would have
to bear the brunt of the cuts. Piecemeal closures followed, including the BP
Chemicals plant at Baglan Bay in Wales. But European capacity fell by less
than 3 per cent.
US producers made only modest cuts. Ethylene production capacity, for
example, rose throughout the recession. The story was repeated in other
sectors, such as propylene and styrene in Europe and North America.
Rather than plant closures, the recovery in chemicals has been driven by
economic recovery in the US and continued growth in Asia, says Mr Richard
Sleep, a consultant with industry consultancy ChemSystems.
Chemicals and their immediate derivatives such as plastics are vital to
almost every sector of manufacturing, and are particularly important to the
producers of cars and trucks, packaging and construction materials.
As economic activity has picked up, so has the demand for chemicals.
In the face of increased domestic demand, US and Asian producers have all
but abandoned exports to Europe, thereby boosting the fortunes of European
producers in their own home markets. European producers have also been
gaining export markets in the US.
'Petrochemicals and polymers production in the US and Europe is up about 10
per cent. But in Europe, what's really driven prices up is exports to the
US. This is very unusual,' says Mr Sleep.
Increased demand has been pushing up chemical prices for several months. But
traders in the world's chemical markets have been just as affected by a
series of accidents, which have curbed the industry's production capacity.
Some of these have been plant failures, blamed on tired machinery struggling
to cope with a sharp rise in production. 'It's like running a rather old car
very gently for several years and suddenly putting your foot down,' said one
industry executive.
Among the biggest were fires and an explosion at Exxon Chemical's complex at
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 8 which hit the US ethylene market. A
ruptured pipe and fires at Enichem's Priolo plant in Sicily cut production
of ethylene and polyethylene in Europe. The industry has even suffered
natural disasters, such as last month's floods in southern Texas.
All these accidents have caused capacity cuts. In August and September, US
and Italian producers experienced a 3m tonne fall in their naphtha cracking
capacity - a vital early stage in petrochemicals manufacture. This was
equivalent to an 8 per cent cut in capacity for ethylene production.
At a time of rising demand, chemicals markets have proved highly sensitive
to such unplanned cuts. An explosion on October 12 that shut a 420,000
tonnes a year methanol plant in Texas - closing more than 6 per cent of US
capacity - triggered a 14 per cent rise in European spot methanol prices.
Methanol is used in the manufacture of petrol and of plasterboard for the
construction industry.
Mr Edmund Clinckspor, director for supply and planning in basic chemicals at
Exxon Chemical, says that the combination of economic recovery and plant
shutdowns has triggered price rises that have, in themselves, pushed up
demand.
'Prices are rising, so people want to buy today before the price rises
again,' says Mr Clinckspor.
Such restocking can be only a temporary phenomenon, however. Within months,
distributors and customers will have tied up as much working capital in
stocks as they feel comfortable with.
But optimists argue that the initial causes of the price rises are likely to
continue for some time. It takes at least three years, from approval, to
achieve significant production levels in new plant, they say. Furthermore,
even if exports from Europe dry up as new plants are commissioned in north
America and Asia, they argue that the European recovery that is only just
starting will take up the slack.
More cautious voices say that damaged factories can be repaired within
months. They also argue that European and Asian manufacturers will find the
US a more difficult market once Dow Chemical's new cracker capacity has come
on stream in the US next year.
In addition, some of the greatest growth in demand has been coming from
price-sensitive Asian customers, such as China.
'China will not stop buying at once, but if prices are moving too high too
fast, there may be some slowdown (in sales),' says Mr Philippe Goebel,
vice-president of planning at France's Elf Atochem, part of the
petrochemical giant Elf Aquitaine.
Mr Clinckspor echoes his concern: 'We can't count on Chinese imports
remaining at this level. I wouldn't be surprised if profit margins across
the whole industry peaked in the first half of 1995.'
That profit margins will recede is a matter on which optimists and
pessimists alike agree. High prices will trigger capital investment that
will lead to overcapacity and price competition. The cycle will continue,
and the industry will be faced with its next downturn.
However, the industry is determined that there will be no return to the
loose cost controls of the 1980s, when inefficiency and under-investment
proved sustainable thanks to high demand.
Some companies claim that they have done enough restructuring to stay
profitable through another recession.
Mr Ettore dell'Isola, chief executive of EVC, the PVC manufacturing joint
venture between ICI and Enichem, says that EVC would not have made losses
during the last recession with the cost base it hopes to have by the end of
next year.
Others place more emphasis on the shift in their attitude. One such is Mr
Earl Timmons, Du Pont's vice-president of finance, who says: 'Although our
formal restructuring programme is over, we don't think that cost-cutting
will ever end.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / The Balkan disease: West Europeans may not be immune, as the
Slovenia-Italy dispute shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one indisputable success story in post-communist central Europe,
five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is surely Slovenia.
I think of Slovenia as 'the one that got away'. It was part of Yugoslavia,
but succeeded in extricating itself at the price of a phoney war lasting one
week, in which only eight of its people were killed. Since then, its leaders
have been at pains to explain, to anyone who will listen, that Slovenia is
not a Balkan country.
It is, they tell you, a central European country: normal, peaceful, a
showcase of transition to democracy and the market. Already 60 per cent of
its foreign trade is with the European Union, and that will rise to more
than two-thirds when Austria joins the EU in two months. Per capita income
is higher than that of Greece or Portugal.
Like the Czech lands, Slovenia was formerly in the Austrian part of the
Habsburg empire, whereas Croatia, like Slovakia, was in the Hungarian part.
It may not be pure coincidence that Slovenia and the Czech Republic are the
two central European countries identified by the European Commission as
likely to be ready for EU membership by the end of the decade. Certainly
Slovenia, with its lush Alpine scenery and evident prosperity, feels like a
southward extension of Austria, only with much lower prices.
British ministers will have heard all this ad nauseam in the past two days,
as they have been entertaining the Slovenian prime minister, Mr Janez
Drnovsek. Slovenia's leaders have an obsessive fear that their achievements
are not recognised in the west. They react instantly to any implied hint
that Slovenia is still in the 'Balkan' or 'former Yugoslav' category.
Ironically, in its haste to escape from the Balkans and join western Europe,
Slovenia has tripped up on a dispute of what might be considered the
'Balkan' type, only with a west European country.
What would be a typical Balkan conflict, in the sense in which Slovenes and
west Europeans use that term? One in which ethnically defined states make
claims on each other in the name of kinsfolk living the 'wrong' side of a
frontier. One in which the crimes of people long since dead are called in
evidence to justify an alarmist interpretation of the behaviour or
intentions of people wearing the same state or ethnic labels today. And,
perhaps, one in which inter-state quarrels are exacerbated by domestic power
struggles, as some politicians raise nationalist slogans to advance their
cause, while others fear losing popularity and influence if they resist.
All those elements are present in the dispute between Slovenia and Italy.
Its roots lie deep in the more unpleasant episodes of 20th century European
history, when nation states in the grip of totalitarian ideologies tried to
set their exclusive stamp on lands where different identities had long
coexisted and overlapped.
The eastern coast of the Adriatic was such a land. For centuries its ports
and fishing villages had a Roman or Venetian culture, while the shepherds
and farmers of the overlooking hill country spoke south Slavonic dialects -
but goods, ideas and vocabulary were freely exchanged between the two. Only
in the 19th century did the difference become political, as Italian
nationalists laid claim to the area and the Habsburg authorities countered
by encouraging education in the Slav vernaculars.
After the first world war, Italy, as a victor power, annexed the Istrian
peninsula. Soon afterwards Mussolini came to power and set about ensuring
its Italian character with all the tact and subtlety for which he was
famous. In the second world war the wheel of fortune turned. Italy was
defeated. Tito's partisans triumphed and incorporated the area into
Yugoslavia, except the city of Trieste, from which the western allies
evicted them. In 1954 the great powers converted de facto control into de
jure sovereignty. Italians living in what became Yugoslav territory were
given the choice of accepting Yugoslav citizenship or moving to Italy. Most
of them moved, preferring democracy among their kith and kin to life in an
alien and unsympathetic communist state.
Altogether some 350,000 Italians left Istria after 1945: roughly 60 per cent
from the Croatian part and 40 per cent from the Slovenian. In 1983
Yugoslavia agreed to compensate them for the property they had left behind.
Slovenia, as a successor state, is happy to continue its share of the
payments. But Italy now refuses to accept compensation, arguing that
Italians should have the same rights given to Slovenian citizens - to claim
back property taken from them by the Yugoslav state, and to bid for publicly
owned real estate when it is put up for sale.
Slovenes fear being bought out of house and home by superior Italian (and
German and Austrian) purchasing power. They also see the Italian request as
an attempt, egged on by neo-fascists in Silvio Berlusconi's government, to
reopen the postwar borders: a dangerous precedent for Europe as a whole.
Italy is now blocking the opening of negotiations on an association
agreement between Slovenia and the EU until the bilateral dispute is
settled. Last month Slovenia sent a lame-duck foreign minister to negotiate,
then repudiated the compromise text that he brought back. Which side, one is
tempted to ask, is behaving in a more 'Balkan' manner?
But perhaps that is the wrong question. The right question is whether west
Europeans are justified in thinking themselves immune from 'Balkan' reflexes
 -or whether, if they do not find better ways to treat it, they will not
gradually fall victim to the Balkan disease themselves.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chuzzlewit dull in part, but mostly
absorbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I should be grateful for the opportunity to enlighten Christopher
Dunkley (Television, November 7) on Martin Chuzzlewit. Even Dickens's
Victorian readers, who were blessed with much wider attention spans than
most people are able to demonstrate today, found the novel's American
chapters extremely dull and uninteresting. It is possible that they were
invented by the author to promote the novel's disappointing early sales.
Indeed, then and since, these chapters have proved so much of an annoyance
that they have frequently been skipped over and left unread so that the
enthusiastic reader can concentrate on the wonderful characters and
thoroughly absorbing events contained in the main part of the book.
I urge Dunkley to read the novel; I am sure that once he has, he may well
find that he agrees with these sentiments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK CALLANAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To set the record straight, the Royal Mail's pay deal with the
executive of the Union of Communication Workers ('Royal Mail flouts pay
freeze with 3.4 per cent offer', November 5) does not breach government pay
guidelines.
The deal consists of an increase in basic pay of 2.5 per cent plus a further
0.3 per cent in respect of current unrewarded productivity improvements. Its
effect on the annual pay bill is a net reduction of about 0.2 per cent
provided by a fall in headcount.
The 'supplement' of Pounds 1.50 does not add a further 0.6 per cent to
earnings as stated by you. It is, in fact, a straight transfer from
non-pensionable pay to pensionable pay of that amount, and it will lead to a
small reduction in take-home pay because of the employees' contribution to
the pension scheme.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M PATON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Karl Lamers (Personal View, November 7) puts forward a compelling case
for monetary union in the development of the European Union. The Treaty of
Rome put the case for free trade within the community in the 1950s in much
the same way .
Some 40 years down the road, however, we have the UK with the most efficient
steel industry in Europe but with companies being forced out of business
because of ongoing blatant internal subsidy of many European steel producers
elsewhere, not least in Germany. Is this not an aspect of national
sovereignty which Germany and others choose to ignore?
Let us put first things first, before moving on to more sophisticated
alignments which will generate more problems than economic unity.
When will continental Europe understand that we in the UK are not opposed to
European union but are sickened by holier-than-thou appeals proclaiming
higher aspirations while ignoring fundamental shortcomings in meeting the
requirements of the Treaty of Rome?

FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better environment not costly
exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ANTHONY CLEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr David Slater's call for volunteers to help prove that tighter
environmental controls need not be as expensive as critics believe
('Pollution cost plea to industry', November 2) is most welcome and timely.
All my experience of working with companies which have invested in upgrading
their environmental performance has persuaded me that it is often possible
both to do this and to improve profitability at the same time.
The experience of AEA Technology as a leading environmental consultancy
confirms that the key to success lies in integrated environmental solutions
which embrace the entire plant or process, rather than in spending money on
'end-of-pipe' add ons.
Wider adoption of the integrated approach will deliver significant
competitive advantages for UK industry and a cleaner environment for us all.
As well as volunteering for Dr Slater's experiment, interested companies
would be well advised to participate in the Environmental Technology Best
Practice programme. This is being managed by AEA Technology and aims to
promote better environmental practice at the same time as increasing
competitiveness.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Market has the right AIM for young
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN DON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your epitaph for the Alternative Investment Market (Lex: 'Questionable
AIM', November 7) is premature, to say the least. M&amp;G's statement that its
funds will avoid the market comes as no surprise to those involved in the
design of the AIM, and indeed we would have been more surprised had M&amp;G
indicated that it would be investing.
The AIM has from the outset been conceived as a market for the larger retail
investor, and the stock exchange's proposals have quite rightly focused on
balancing the needs of those investors with the need to reduce access costs
for young companies to the minimum. The likely size of AIM companies will
automatically lead the great majority of institutions to ignore the new
market.
You lament the absence of private sector initiatives to meet the needs of
young companies. Past experience of such markets has shown that the
confusion created by a diverse portfolio of products obstructs their growth
and acceptance (witness the confusion among investors, intermediaries and
companies over the relative merits of the Unlisted Securities Market, Rule
595.2/4.2 and the Third Market).
A single, effective solution, launched on the back of an infrastructure
already in existence and paid for, which can provide one forum for the
raising of capital in amounts well below the range of the Official List,
should be welcomed as a significant tool for the support of industrial
investment. The USM, in being too much like its elder brother, failed in
this respect, as would the European Venture Capital Association's proposals.
Provided the exchange remains true to its current vision, the AIM has every
chance of meeting an urgent need.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Ariadne' revived - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the English National Opera, Graham Vick produced Richard Strauss's
Ariadne on Naxos eleven years ago. His master-stroke was to insulate the
high-flown Ariadne story completely from the low comedians' antics; but
since the original Strauss-Hofmannsthal plan was to engineer comic friction
between the competing troupes, respectively opera seria and commedia
dell'arte, the Vick version was perverse in principle and dreary in effect -
and not especially happy in its principal singers either.
As revived once again by Lynn Binstock, it looks better. The edges have been
softened; the mechanical high-jinks in the prologue act are still tedious,
but the singing comedians get a looser rein later, and soon hit upon the
right improvisatory, happy-go-lucky spirit. If Peter Snipp's sturdy
Harlequin scores low on romantic appeal, his colleagues (all new) are an
engaging crew: Timothy Robinson, Alasdair Elliott and particularly Mark
Richardson as a daft Truffaldino. There is a sparky Dancing Master from John
Graham-Hall, too, and a Malvolio-like Major-Domo from Nicholas Le Prevost.
Above all there is Cyndia Sieden's Zerbinetta, whose charm and sparkling
accuracy are a great tonic. This American soprano misses only the note of
wry, world-weary amusement - but that is not perhaps compulsory. Her scene
with the young Composer is hobbled by his being a mature, matronly mezzo,
the Canadian Judith Forst: an admirably dignified singer, but no substitute
for the slim youth Hofmannsthal had in mind. (Another breeches-role like the
Rosenkavalier Octavian was not what he intended, but Strauss insisted that
most opera companies could field an intelligent mezzo more reliably than a
second tenor.)
As for the heavies: well, there is much to admire in Jane Eaglen's
monumental Ariadne, and Ian Caley has a good stab at Bacchus, a part that
requires more sustained bellowing than Caley's usual repertoire. But the
modern habit of doing Ariadne with Wagnerian voices in a large theatre has
meant that thousands of people have heard the opera only on that inflated
scale; its real delights suffer, and not least its wistful intimacies.
There are plenty of those written into the score - almost a miniature score,
by Strauss's standards - and they evaporate easily in a big house. The
conductor Alexander Sander lets them do that rather often, though he makes a
workman-like job of it all. He is curiously brisk and un-tender with the
nymphs' music, forthrightly sung by Maria Bovino, Judith Douglas and Yvonne
Barclay (whose Echo never sounds like one when it should). If Ariadne must
be staged in the cavernous Coliseum, the present production will do, I
suppose; but as seen and heard in, say, Munich's little Cuvillies-Theater,
it is a different and much more lovable opera.
In repertory until December 14.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: A dramatic lack of originality - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They had a full house at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, on Sunday, not
for an early panto but for a tribute to a television playwright: a local
boy, the late Dennis Potter. There were readings and video extracts from his
work, from Stand Up Nigel Barton (1965) to Lipstick On Your Collar (1993),
and then a debate on the question of whether new and challenging writing
could find a place in television drama during the 1990s. It is a subject on
which Potter was characteristically vituperative, claiming that there was an
occupying power in our society, threatening our personal sovereignty, a
power sustained most subtly through the broadcasting media. He was
pessimistic about the idea of anybody setting out in the 1990s as he had in
the 1960s to get his voice heard via television drama.
So what is the state of television drama in Britain today? Judging from what
could be seen last week there is far greater freedom now than there was 30
years ago to show, say, sexually explicit material, one of several
'difficult' areas with which Potter was particularly identified. The Spanish
film Lovers, shown by Channel 4, about a young man seduced by his landlady,
an older but decidedly attractive woman, contained remarkably vivid erotic
scenes. Dropping a silk scarf onto her young lover's naked backside the
woman murmurs 'Put it in', promptly adds 'No, you're so clumsy, I will' and
does. Then the camera pans down to mattress level to show her whipping it
out again at the moment of climax. There was more: no hints, no trains
rushing into tunnels, but the sort of explicit material which, even 10 years
ago, would have been available only in stag movies. It made the
much-protested bonking scene in Potter's The Singing Detective look genteel.
Of course a late night movie is not what we generally mean by 'television
drama', yet it is drama on television, and what is in movies today will be
in television's own material tomorrow. I am not aware of any protest about
Lovers.
Of course you would not find such material on ITV. There the most drastic
changes following the last lot of broadcasting legislation have been not in
journalism, as some of us feared, but in drama. ITV is now using drama like
extruded plastic building blocks: 55-minute series about firemen, soldiers,
doctors and policemen are being spat out for the 9 o'clock slot as though by
automata and used to build the ratings edifice. Cracker is the high quality
end of this phenomenon, a special-edition, hand-finished example which is
well worth watching: Robbie Coltrane is on top form as the intolerable yet
fascinating Fitz in the current story about a girl in the clutches of
religious loonies.
Revelations, the late night ITV soap, looked at first as though it might
break some new ground. However, time is proving that even though we have a
bonking bishop, with a nymphomaniac schoolgirl daughter, a drug addicted
son, and a wife who personally administers the son's methadone injections,
it has none of that chutzpah with which Dallas captured so many viewers.
Ninety per cent of ITV drama today is forgettable the instant it finishes,
and the idea of ITV - the channel which, during Potter's career, took us
from Armchair Theatre to Jewel In The Crown via The Naked Civil Servant -
even bothering to consider the work of a new young non-conformist iconoclast
like Potter nowadays is laughable.
And the BBC? Far more difficult to summarise. Pessimists will note that
Peter Ransley, who in 1981 gave us the deeply felt and unforgettable account
of 19th century rural life in Bread Or Blood, is now giving us the 1940s
saga Seaforth which is highly professional but looks as though it was made
for that 9 o'clock slot on ITV. There was a striking science fiction drama
in The X-Files on BBC2 last Thursday about a killer-building driven by
artificial intelligence: the washroom dunnit (killed the unsympathetic
boss). It was not only entertaining but thoughtful, yet no more so than many
episodes of The Twilight Zone, and The X-Files is another American import.
In the area where it is so often urged to put its main drama effort, the
classic repertory of Shakespeare and Dickens, the BBC has looked pretty
impressive in the past week. True, there were infelicities in Measure For
Measure, for example in the scene - so heavily trailed - where the director
had Angelo drag Isabella across the floor and fling her on the sofa. He says
'Redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will', but scarcely in the
heat of passion since he adds 'Answer me tomorrow'. So much for the dragging
and flinging inserted by the director. This production was, however, bent to
television's purposes pretty successfully and, considering how odd the scale
of values seems to many of us today (particularly death before loss of
virginity) a difficult play was made impressively accessible.
Better still is Martin Chuzzlewit. As with the Shakespeare, this is not one
of the author's easiest texts, but the opening episode of David Lodge's
dramatisation took us straight into the essentials and established many of
the key elements - Pecksniff's humbug, his daughter's alliance of offence
and defence, Tom Pinch's naivety - astonishingly fast. When backbench Tory
MPs call on the BBC to stick to its last and keep delivering those
programmes which cannot make a nice profit for commercial broadcasters, it
is doubtless the likes of Martin Chuzzlewit that they are thinking of. This
is cosy winter television of a deeply comforting sort; watching it is like
pulling a rug round your shoulders and sipping a whisky-mac.
Which was never the purpose of Dennis Potter. In the week before The Singing
Detective began in 1986, this page carried the most enthusiastic review I
have ever written, including: 'If all this sounds complicated, so it is -
but in a wonderfully entertaining way. Here we have not some old novel
adapted for television but an original work created specifically for the
electronic medium, by a master craftsman who has served a long and
productive apprenticeship. Today Potter uses television with the familiarity
and assurance that Dickens brought to the writing of novels.'
We now know that we are to receive Potter's legacy next year: two drama
serials, Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, the first produced by the BBC with
repeats on Channel 4, and the second produced by Channel 4 with repeats on
the BBC. So there are still two of Britain's four terrestrial networks which
will finance and screen his work. But long before he died Potter had won
himself a very special position in British television, and there was never
much chance of these being turned down. Going back to Potter's own doubts,
the question is: what would be the reaction if someone came along now whose
work seemed as different and difficult as Potter's was by the standards of
his day? Despite the presence of Michael Grade from Channel 4 and Alan
Yentob, Controller of BBC1, on the stage of the Everyman, and their
co-operation over the legacy serials, there must be great doubt whether the
work of such a person would make it to the screen given the new ethos in
British broadcasting.

On Channel 4 Dispatches tells the story of how a British based company sold
land mines to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, some of which, it is claimed,
were later responsible for British casualties in the Gulf war. The company,
the Casalee Group, is also said to have supplied heavy artillery, ammunition
and anti-aircraft guns to Iran. The programme asks whether the British
government could have remained ignorant of these activities (9.00). BBC2 has
another story to tell of bombings and injuries: Aftershock looks back to the
Birmingham pub bombings of 20 years ago in which 21 people were killed and
162 injured and finds 'No counselling for them, no memorial, small
compensation, and now no chance of justice: police recently announced they
had abandoned the hunt for the killers' (9.25). It is no doubt the sign of a
trivial mind, but more than either of those I have a hankering to watch
Counter Culture which promises the lowdown on one of those shops for
computer freaks in Tottenham Court Road, London (9.45 C4).

FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Chase Manhattan boost for BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Museum yesterday announced the first step in its ambition to
renovate its galleries to celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2003. Chase
Manhattan Bank is giving Pounds 1m, spread over five years, to pay for a new
gallery of North American ethnic art.
At the moment the BM's ethnographical collection is housed in the Museum of
Mankind, off Piccadilly. The aim is to return it to Bloomsbury to fill the
space left by the departure of the British Library to St Pancras. It will
also occupy some of the additional square footage the BM will gain if Sir
Norman Foster's Pounds 50m plan to enclose the inner courtyard comes to
fruition as a millennium funded project.
The BM has one of the finest collections of ethnographical material from
North America in the world, with around 20,000 objects, few of which are
currently displayed. The artifacts of Innuit and Indians, from northern
Canada to southern California, are well represented, with confirmed datings
of items stretching back to 1702.
This will be Chase Manhattan's first major sponsorship in Europe, although
it has a reputation for backing contemporary art in the US. The new gallery
will open in 1997, even if the British Library has still not moved out.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Time running out in Bulgaria -
Tough choices on power must be made
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with heavy dependence on nuclear power to serve growing energy
demands, the Bulgarian government is urgently looking for a way out of a
dilemma.
Last week a report outlining options for Bulgaria's energy sector was
presented to the Bulgarian authorities and to the safety regulator's office
by Energoproekt, a Bulgarian institute. No decision is likely until a new
parliament is in place next year, but the government is under pressure from
safety organisations to act as soon as possible.
Three years ago, the nuclear power plant at Kozloduy on the Danube, which
supplies up to 45 per cent of Bulgaria's power, was dubbed the most
dangerous in the world by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The two
oldest units, Russian-designed 440MW WWER pressurised water reactors built
in 1974 and 1975, were closed for two years for repairs, and work on a
second plant on the Danube at Belene was stopped.
The government says it has spent some Lv550m (Pounds 55m) on safety
improvements at Kozloduy since then. The European Commission and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have committed Pounds 58m
for further work.
The Pounds 19m being managed by the EBRD is intended to facilitate the
earliest possible closure of the four 440MW WWER reactors at Kozloduy. The
EBRD recognises that alternative energy sources must be found before the
units could close, but the pressure is on Bulgaria to find a safe, reliable
and affordable alternative.
The Energoproekt report sets out options ranging from closing the plant
immediately, which has little support in Bulgaria, to allowing Kozloduy to
work at full capacity until the oldest reactors reach the end of their
design life.
Ivan Ivanov, deputy manager of the plant, believes the oldest units could
last until 2006.
Although a great deal of safety work has been carried out, there are still
concerns among western safety organisations. There are worries over
weaknesses in the design of the 440MW units, including the embrittlement of
the pressure vessels and an absence of containment for primary pipe ruptures
The lack of storage for spent fuel at the plant is also causing concern.
Russia, which supplies the uranium, used to reprocess Bulgaria's spent fuel
at a nominal fee, but now charges Dollars 1,000 per kilogramme of heavy
metal. The Bulgarians cannot pay this and wet storage tanks at the plant are
nearly full.
Prof Ivan Uzanov, at the department of nuclear physics at Sofia University,
is particularly concerned about storage facilities for the 600 tonnes of
spent fuel in an area prone to seismic activity. 'If a catastrophic
earthquake leaves this spent fuel without cooling water, it is easy to
calculate that the emitted activity could be four times more than from
Chernobyl,' he says.
Nikita Shervashidze, president of the government's energy committee, says
several western companies have tendered for a contract to build new storage
facilities, but there will be no decision until the end of the year.
Yanko Yanev, Bulgaria's atomic safety regulator, says a 'medium' option of
closing units one and two, perhaps as soon as 1996, and devoting more
resources to thermal-powered plants, might be the best. He believes that
coal-powered plants can be made economic, but that Bulgaria will need help
from western agencies, such as the World Bank.
Steps are also being taken to find funding for the completion of two 1,000MW
WWER reactors at Belene. When these are finished, says Shervashidze, two
Kozloduy units can be closed.
The Bulgarians are in talks with Russian and Turkish private investors about
funding the plant's completion, which would take up to 10 years.
Energy consumption in Bulgaria increased by 3 per cent between 1993 and
1994, against all predictions. Such figures suggest that the time for
decisions on an alternative to Kozloduy may be running out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellman, the specialist engineering group, announced five senior
appointments yesterday as part of a reorganisation following the Pounds 46m
acquisition of three businesses from FKI, the electrical engineering and
components concern.
Two external appointments have been made. Andrew Carnegie takes over as md
of Wellman Robey, which makes industrial boilers and pressure vessels. He
was formerly md of a competitor, NEI Cochran. Don Lupton has been appointed
operations director of Wellman Furnaces. He too was previously at a
competitor, Davy Priest Furnaces.
Three internal promotions to md have also been announced - Alan Phillips at
the Wellman Data Recording Group, Craig Pilkington at Wellman Garage
Equipment, and Jim Wright at Wellman Service Group.
Carnegie has replaced Ken Homans, who is retiring, but the other posts are
new. They are the first stage in a planned post-takeover reorganisation at
West Midlands-based Wellman, says chief executive Alan Baxter.
Baxter was a former main board director at FKI, joined Wellman last
November, and first approached FKI with the acquisition proposal. The deal
was completed in August, and has increased Wellman's annual turnover from
Pounds 25m to about Pounds 125m.

Geoff Henry, 50, is to be the next chief executive of the Merchant Navy
Officers Pension Fund. He takes over from Tony Ashmore, 57, who retires at
the end of the year after ten years at the helm of the Pounds 2bn fund.
The MNOPF is one of the largest industry-wide pension schemes although the
decline in Britain's merchant navy means that the number of contributing
members has fallen from around 40,000 in the 1950s to just 6,000. However,
the fund services 17,000 pensioners and also has another 33,000 deferred
members.
Henry, who used to work for British Shipbuilders pension fund, has been the
MNOPF's director of finance for the past nine years and managing director of
its pensions administrations subsidiary for the past four years.

FT  09 NOV 94 / People: Biffa's Bettington floats up at Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to the waste management
business, Biffa, with the appointment of two new executive directors to its
board.
Brian Duckworth, 45, and Martin Bettington, 42, are joining the board in
advance of the retirements next year of Roderick Paul, chief executive, and
Michael Upstone, former director of customer service. Paul and Upstone are
both retiring at the age of 60.
Bettington, managing director of Severn Trent's waste management business,
joined the company in 1991 when it bought Biffa from BET for Pounds 212m.
Severn Trent said yesterday that Bettington's appointment signalled the
company's 'commitment to developing the waste side of the business through
Biffa'.
The appointment was seen by analysts in London as Severn Trent's attempt to
dampen speculation that it was considering selling the waste business.
Severn Trent has been criticised in the past for locking itself into onerous
financing for Biffa.
Duckworth is strongly linked with the regulated utility side of Severn
Trent, and led the price negotiations with the industry regulator in the
last review. He was recently appointed customer services director.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: EU's electronic mountain -
Negotiations on the best fate for discarded equipment in Europe are growing
more urgent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF NAIRN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's electronics and electrical industries are about to meet
environmentalists and European Commission officials to renew efforts to find
a solution to the growing mountain of end-of-life products that the two
industries produce.
Electronic waste comprises everything from old computers, photocopiers and
stereos to telephones, cables and light bulbs. The range of products and
diversity of interests - more than 60 representatives will meet in Rome -
have hampered negotiations, and the group's aim to deliver a document
detailing practical solutions and regulatory proposals by next July looks
increasingly ambitious.
For Brussels, this latest meeting of the Rome project group on 'electronic
waste', one of the 'priority waste streams' identified by the Commission as
requiring specific action, has a particular urgency if it is to head off
unilateral action by EU member states frustrated by the lack of progress so
far.
German manufacturers fear that the German ministry of environment may not
wait and will push through laws next year that would compel them to take
back a broad range of electronic waste and meet specific recycling targets.
Manufacturers could charge to recycle equipment already on the market, but
would have to take back their future products free of charge.
'The model proposed by the ministry entails huge problems,' says Bernhard
Diegner, project group representative for ZVEI, a German electronics
manufacturers association, which claims that such a policy could add between
5 per cent and 15 per cent to the price of electronics goods sold in
Germany.
The annual cost of a Europe-wide end-of-life scheme for consumer electronics
could be around Ecu2.25bn (Pounds 1.77bn), according to the European
Association of Consumer Electronics Manufacturers.
ZVEI wants take-back schemes to be generally voluntary, with manufacturers
obliged to take back only bulky own-brand products. Environmentalists
counter that voluntary schemes do not work and cite battery recycling
programmes, where collection rates remain low - between 15 and 40 per cent -
even when collection is free.
A take-back bill for electrical and electronics goods was presented in the
last Italian parliament in 1993 and could soon be presented again.
Denmark, France and Austria are among the European countries currently
considering specific legislation for electronic waste. Manufacturers now
fear a patchwork of conflicting, national schemes that will add
substantially to their costs and distort competition by sucking in cheaper
imports from EU or non-EU countries with less stringent rules.
Their worst nightmare is a repeat of Germany's Duales System Deutschland
compulsory packaging recycling scheme, which produced more used paper and
plastic than German recyclers could handle.
The manufacturers say that electronic waste in quantitative terms is less of
a problem than in other sectors, In France, for example, it amounts to 1.3m
tonnes each year, against 20m tonnes of household rubbish and 150m tonnes of
commercial and industrial waste.
However, much electronic waste is difficult to recycle, the quantity is
growing - new products now entering the market in France amount to 2.1m
tonnes a year, for instance - and environmental credentials have become
important selling points for manufacturers.
'The market is very conscious of the ecological image and contents of
products,' says Bruno Mapelli, environmental director for IBM's southern
European operations.
According to a recent survey by the German environmental organisation Bund
(Bund fur Umwelt and Naturschutz Deutschland), most PC manufacturers now use
recycled plastics, have banned CFCs and solvent-based paints, use
snap-together construction (for easier dismantling), mark new plastic parts
for recycling and reuse old components for repairs. Four have free take-back
schemes operational in Germany: Vobis, Apple, Actebis and Acer.
While manufacturers stress how environmentally-friendly current models are,
they are less enthusiastic about taking back products now reaching the ends
of their lives, since they were never designed to be recycled.
To disassemble an old computer can take one and three-quarter hours, says
Helmut Finchk, head of Hewlett-Packard's three-year-old recycling programme
in Germany. To cover its costs, HP Germany charges DM10 (Pounds 4) for each
returned unit; for monitors, where the lead and other metals in the cathode
ray tube causes particular recycling problems, the charge is DM25. The
products must be predominantly HP ones and the customer pays for transport.
HP's European subsidiaries currently send unwanted equipment to a specialist
recycling centre, Hardware Recycling Europe, in Grenoble, France. Less than
5 per cent of the 100 tonnes that arrive each month goes for land-fill; four
years ago, the figure was more than 30 per cent, but HP can now separate and
recycle nearly all materials.
Disc drives are reused as spares, circuit boards are refined to recover
precious metals, plastic is stripped from copper cables, old microprocessors
and memory chips end up in electronic toys, high-grade plastics are
recycled, low-grade mixed plastics are burnt in a nearby cement kiln for
their energy content.
The recovered copper, precious metals and components are sold to help pay
for the costly treatments of batteries, cathode ray tubes and mixed plastic.
'Today we break even, but it all depends on the volumes handled and we still
do not know whether a large-scale scheme would be economically viable,' says
Denise Furet, environmental project manager for Hardware Recycling Europe.
The costs of transporting end-of-life products to Grenoble from other
countries have prompted HP to set up similar recycling plants in the UK and,
soon, Germany, but ultimately the company would like to contract out
recycling, as it is not seen as a core activity.
Several manufacturers in Europe are acting in advance of take-back laws. At
the beginning of this year, for example, Deutsche Telekom formed a
consortium with equipment manufacturers Siemens and Alcatel SEL to recycle a
planned 12,000 tonnes of telephones, facsimile machines and other equipment
this year. In Italy, IBM sent 4,500 tonnes of end-of-life equipment for
recycling in 1993, with a recycling ratio of more than 90 per cent. Digital
Equipment operates a similar scheme in the Netherlands.
However, left to market forces, it seems unlikely that electronic waste
recycling can be extended throughout Europe. Specialist recyclers are rare
in many countries and spot prices for recycled materials are volatile. White
goods and consumer electronics contain little valuable material. For other
products, the time and effort required to dismantle, separate and identify
the different materials can make recycling uneconomic.
DST Logistica, the recycling subsidiary for IBM in Italy, has tested
specialised X-ray and infra-red equipment to sort recovered plastics into
more than 30 recyclable classes, but not all recyclers can justify such
investments.
Ferruccio Mori, chairman of DST Logistica, identifies a more general
problem: 'It costs L50-L60 (a few pence) a kilo to dump in Italy. If
land-fill were to rise to L1,000 a kilo the economics (of recycling) would
change,' he says.
Maria Almeida-Teixeira, the Commission's co-ordinator for the electronic
waste group, set up nearly a year ago, admits that progress has been slow,
but believes that with two further meetings next year there is still time to
achieve a broad consensus. However, 'it is too early to say what will come
out.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Time to spread the jam more evenly - Doubts
linger over merit of executive share options as incentive or performance
yardstick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are UK companies justified in persisting with Inland Revenue approved
executive share option schemes when the argument for their retention as an
incentive has grown progressively weaker during the past 10 years?
At the time they were introduced in the 1984 budget, Nigel Lawson, then
Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was convinced of the 'need to attract
top calibre company management and to increase the incentives and
motivations of existing executives and key personnel by linking their reward
to performance.'
With the top marginal income tax rate of 60 per cent and 30 per cent capital
gains tax that existed at the time, there was considerable attraction among
boardrooms in introducing such schemes. They converted income into a capital
gain and the cost of them was borne by shareholders in diluted equity and
did not impact on the company's profit and loss account.
Without hesitating to consider whether or not what they were doing was fair,
both to shareholders and to other employees who did not - although the rules
would have allowed it - benefit from such schemes, companies clamoured to
introduce them to such an extent that now some 90 per cent of publicly
listed UK companies have Revenue-approved share option schemes, mainly for
directors and senior executives.
Today, with the top marginal tax rate at 40 per cent, the same rate as
capital gains tax, the tax advantage is less important. That has done
little, however to stem enthusiasm for renewing schemes as many come to the
end of their 10 year life.
A newly published study of executive share options, by Incomes Data Services
Management Pay Review, suggests that probably the most important reason for
renewing schemes is that companies dare not retreat from what has become the
market norm.
'Any company knows that it would be out of line with market practice if it
jettisoned its option scheme, even if it was replaced with an alternative
long term incentive,' says IDS.
It quotes a conclusion by the board of Inchcape that failure to renew its
scheme would have hindered its ability to recruit outside executives.
The Labour Party says it will end income tax relief on options, but it seems
doubtful whether that in itself will be enough to end the practice of paying
them.
Whether it would be applied on options already issued but not exercised is
still unclear.
While Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor has estimated that an extra Pounds
200m a year will be collected in tax revenue, it represents only 1.3 per
cent of the Pounds 15bn that Labour suggests is the annual value of shares
taken in options. That figure, however, is disputed. Some put it at less
than half that amount.
The main effect of ending income tax relief would be to make income tax due
when the shares are exercised rather than CGT when they are sold.
Given that only five per cent of executives have continued to hold their
options beyond the three-year minimum period, the biggest significance of
this would probably be the loss of the annual Pounds 5,800 tax free
allowance for CGT.
Perhaps the greatest unfairness to all other employees who did not benefit
from the award of share options is that the options were introduced on top
of salaries and not instead of some portion of existing executive reward.
They were an unearned bonus that carried no risk whatsoever. It was like
winning the football pools without having to fill in the coupon. Neither
were they related to the performance of companies. Only if the company did
badly was there no point in exercising options.
IDS says: 'Executives could make large sums even if the share price rise had
more to do with inflation and a general rise in the stock market than with
their personal contribution. In some instances, poor company performance
could lead to takeover speculation and share price growth, thereby giving a
reward for bad results.'
The volatility of share prices has made options at times something of a
lottery. It was possible, for example, for a chief executive to be awarded
options to buy shares when the market was high and yet for a less senior
manager to enter the company and obtain options when the market was
comparatively low, thus benefitting more than the company boss.
Tarmac is one company which experienced unintended consequences. In its
letter to shareholders in May, it observed that many of the options granted
to its executives under the existing approved scheme provided no effective
incentive to management because the exercise prices were fixed at a high
level in a different economic climate.
'Further, their existence discriminates against longer-serving executives
who have played a key role in the recent turnaround in the fortunes of the
group,' said the company.
In most cases, however, options have resulted in substantial gains. The IDS
calculates that the median profit from options exercised in the last three
years has varied from between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
Among the highest profits under the UK arrangements found in the study were
Pounds 2m and Pounds 1.7m made respectively by two directors of Glaxo
Holdings in 1991, and Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 1.1m made by two directors of
Smith New Court in 1993. In the same year, Clive Thompson, chief executive
of Rentokil, made Pounds 2.8m from exercising options. Sir John Egan, the
chief executive of BAA, last year netted Pounds 1.6m from share options.
That is dwarfed, however, by the sums paid out in the US, home of the share
or stock option. Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman and chief executive
officer, realised Dollars 203m, equivalent to the gross national product of
Grenada, when he exercised stock options in 1993.
The intrinsic invalidity of such schemes has begun to be accepted in some
companies. Reuters, Courtaulds and GEC have discarded their option schemes
in the past year and replaced them with alternative long-term incentive
arrangements. Sir Christopher Hogg, the chairman of Reuters, has called the
assumption of a tight linkage between management performance and share price
'fallacious'.
Under pressure from institutional investors' organisations, most renewed
schemes have introduced performance conditions which must be met before
options can be exercised, the most common of which is that growth in
earnings per share should be two per cent above inflation each year over
three years. Another trend is to phase options in with smaller annual
grants.
Very few companies have made schemes more equitable among all employees.
Wellcome and ALPHA Airports Group, have introduced all-employee share option
schemes that qualify under the same tax rules as the typical executive share
option plan. The Inland Revenue does not specify that the schemes should be
limited to executives.
It is arguable that such schemes, in addition to being fairer, have greater
tax merits for less highly paid employees. While all can take advantage of
the annual Capital Gains Tax exemption, senior executives might be expected
to have greater overall capital gains, making the exemption proportionally
less meaningful to them. As Sir Bryan Nicholson, the president of the
Confederation of British Industry, this week joined in the criticism of
large boardroom pay rises, arguing that business leaders have a 'clear
responsibility, moral and political, to set an example on pay discipline,'
it is perhaps time for companies to address honestly a fundamental question
about share options: what purpose do they serve?

FT  09 NOV 94 / Management: University challenge at De Montfort / A look at
issues forcing departments to think in terms of cost-efficiency and rapid
expansion / Public Services Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Montfort University in Leicester has a grand vision. Its aim is to be
'internationally competitive' and 'everywhere excellent'. Bold words from an
institution known as Leicester Polytechnic until two years ago.
But De Montfort is well on the way to making a reality of this vision. It is
western Europe's fastest growing university, according to the World Bank,
and attracts investment from both the UK government and the private sector
for projects such as its new, massive and imaginatively designed engineering
faculty building.
The university is also making a new role for itself in local communities.
Kenneth Barker, vice-chancellor, believes that higher education 'has been
too busy chasing Nobel Prizes instead of giving industry and the community
the service they really need'.
This breezy attitude to the opportunities created by higher education
expansion has manifested itself in a sheaf of plans to boost recruitment. De
Montfort's marketing department has ex-tended for a second year the most
expensive university advertising campaign mounted in the UK.
Innovations to course structure are also planned to chisel away lingering
perceptions of De Montfort as a former polytechnic. Mike Brown, an executive
pro-vice-chancellor and one of the key managers in the university's
expansion, has held discussions with independent schools about allowing
pupils to start a De Montfort degree course in their last year at school.
The university's cause will also be helped by serving industry as directly
as possible. A limited company, Leicester Expertise, now markets the
university's know-how to companies, and has helped funnel consultancy fees
to the university's technical specialists.
All this institutional change has been managed during rapid expansion. In
1987, 8,000 students were on Leicester Polytechnic's roll: in the current
academic year that figure is nearer 18,000 while new campuses in Lincoln and
Bedford will bring numbers up to 25,000 this year. Managing change on this
scale is not easy.
The main elements in De Montfort's strategy, according to Brown, are an
innovative executive structure modelled on private-sector companies, and an
approach to cost control that makes individual departments directly
responsible for both costs and revenue.
Beneath the board of governors, which includes Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is a
vice-chancellor who doubles with the role of 'chief executive', and then
four executive pro-vice-chancellors, including Brown, whose jobs are chiefly
managerial.
Below them come 'cost centres', which include both support services, such as
those for accommodation and catering, and academic cost centres. These
include the university's 'schools' - applied sciences, arts and humanities,
built environment, business, combined studies, computing studies, design and
manufacture, engineering and manufacture, health and community studies, and
law.
These cost centres are 'the first point where academic aspirations meet
resource reality', Brown says. 'The philosophy was to have the academic and
the resources units coinciding, headed by someone who was an eminent
academic with the ability to manage.'
Each school was required to set targets for the next five years, in the form
of a series of performance indicators. Brown ensured they were aware of
their costs and the attributed income they brought in each year - including
government tuition fees, government and corporate research funding.
He also made it 'quite clear' to the schools that if they could not justify
their existence in financial terms they would be shut.
In fact, several schools have seen a sharp increase in the effective profits
they have generated - in one case exceeding Pounds 1m. This was not the
victory of commercial incentives over academic freedom: De Montfort's growth
strategy allowed for the possibility that some departments might deserve a
cross-subsidy, to help nurture the standing of the entire institution.
Brown's contribution was to establish a mechanism that made the
cross-subsidies transparent, and forced academics to think in terms of
cost-efficiency. Without this discipline, De Montfort's sharp expansion
would almost certainly not have been possible.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Management: Doing justice to just in time - Success with
this controversial philosophy depends on the manufacturing process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLOS CORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For almost a decade, just in time (Jit), a manufacturing management
philosophy and practice developed and very successfully applied by Toyota,
has been enthusiastically embraced by many managers and academics in the
west. Papers with titles such as 'What is your excuse not to use just in
time?' preached its virtues without reservation.
Now, critics are questioning its impact on profitability. An article in this
newspaper on August 10 cited a study published by the University of
Cambridge which concluded that a higher use of Jit was associated with lower
operating profit margins for UK companies.
Should we infer that these techniques work in Japan but not in the UK (or
other parts of Europe)? Or, is it unrealistic to expect profit margins to
improve automatically by applying these Japanese practices?
The Cambridge study has initiated a healthy debate about this management
philosophy without, however, answering the above questions. To do this, it
is critical to consider the degree of applicability of Jit to different
companies and how it has been implemented.
Our research at the International Institute for Management Development shows
that the actual application of Jit varies very much from industry to
industry. In the automotive industry, almost all European car manufacturers
have adopted these techniques, while in the pharmaceutical field only a few
companies are starting to use them.
Given that the last recession has affected some industries more than others,
it is probable that the lower profitability found in the Cambridge study has
much to do with the industry in which companies compete, rather than with
the application of any particular technique.
While advocates of these techniques argue that its principles are universal,
the reality is that Jit does not have a dramatic impact on certain types of
production process. For example, one of the objectives of Jit techniques is
to transform the factory so that a continuous flow in materials is achieved,
resulting in lower work-in-process inventory levels and shorter production
lead times.
Its application to many electronic manufacturers has resulted in significant
benefits because these companies used to operate with high work-in-process
inventory levels and long lead times. By comparison, many chemical companies
have always had continuous production processes and relatively low inventory
levels because the high volumes they manufacture do not allow them to do
otherwise. Therefore, in this type of business, the application of Jit does
not make the same impact on the production process as it does in electronic
companies. To expect improvements of similar proportions is therefore
unrealistic.
At the opposite extreme of the manufacturing spectrum there are companies
making non-repetitive products to customer specifications, such as special
machine tools or large electric motors. These companies usually apply Jit
only in the most repetitive part of the factory, where it is possible to
achieve a continuous flow. After such application these factories are, quite
often, effectively divided in two parts: the Jit part, where there is a
quasi-continuous flow of materials, and the traditional job shop where the
less repetitive operations are made.
The introduction of Jit will usually not significantly affect profitability,
because only a fraction of the operations change. Furthermore, an unexpected
consequence is that some of these companies making customised products,
embrace Jit too enthusiastically and decide to drop or to out-source the
products or processes that do not fit in the new system. Thus, products
whose manufacturing process fell out of this new quasi-continuous process
are abandoned because they are no longer a 'core' product.
While these decisions may be sound in some cases, in others they could imply
reduced volume and lower profitability. Even if Jit improves the factory
operations, this practice implies a radical change in the 'factory culture';
thus, its implementation requires many resources and a high dedication from
top management. This represents an opportunity cost that should not be
underestimated.
For instance, if a company wants to become a Jit supplier it is likely that
customers will demand the supplier has a quality certification, so that
products need not be tested for quality when received and an almost
continuous flow of products between supplier and customer is achieved.
However, some companies complain that they were too busy obtaining the
certification to dedicate any effort to actually improving quality. In some
of these cases, it is not clear whether the benefits outweigh the
implementation costs and opportunity costs of management distraction.
Lastly, to expect superior financial profits by just applying Jit could even
be absurd in some cases. In an industry where all the competitors adopt Jit,
it becomes a necessary but a not sufficient condition for comparative
advantage.
If a company in such an industry does not apply this technique it could be
forced out of business. In other cases, companies facing serious problems
have tried to apply Jit as a last resort. While in some cases this has saved
the company, in others the companies have gone bankrupt and have given birth
to the circulation of Jit horror stories.
Jit is neither a manufacturing panacea nor the manufacturing equivalent of
alchemy. The profitability of a Jit application depends strongly on the
company and the type of manufacturing process rather than on the UK culture
being different from the Japanese.

Institute for Management Development, Lausanne, Switzerland.

FT  09 NOV 94 / River information paid for by the piggy bank: Charges levied
on children, and others, for access to government documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep pockets may be needed by children requesting information for school
projects under guidelines introduced by the government on how official
information should be made more widely available.
The National Rivers Authority, a quango, has said that it may levy a fee on
children and students who request information under the Code of Practice on
Access to Government Information if it takes more than half an hour of staff
time.
The code was designed to 'make information about the policies, actions and
decisions of government departments, agencies and public bodies more widely
available'.
The government said that departments and quangos, supervised by the
parliamentary ombudsman, would have to make available on request some
information previously kept secret.
The code stipulates that officials would be able to charge for certain
information but left departments to set their own fees.
Seven months on, a survey by the Campaign for Freedom of Information has
found confusion and wide variation in fees charged by government departments
and quangos.
Mr Maurice Frankel, the campaign's director, said: 'What we have found is
extraordinary differences between departments' arrangements, showing how
arbitrarily charges have been set.'
The survey found that three departments - the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food; the Inland Revenue, and the Foreign Office - allow no
free time and charge for all requests involving additional work for
officials.
The Home Office and Department of Health waive charges only for requests
which take less than one hour to answer. They charge Pounds 20 an hour for
other requests.
According to the Campaign for Freedom of Information the worst example is
the rivers authority, where it is not just children and students who face a
fee. Its regulations say that requests for information by journalists 'to
facilitate the writing of articles should, however, be subject to charge'.
Documents provided by the authority show that the authority will charge up
to Pounds 150 for each A2 sheet of paper containing information such as
tables of periodic rainfall and flood risk maps.
The authority said: 'Charges for such data reflect the requirements for
those who obtain specific benefit from the work the NRA does, and has done,
to pay a fair contribution towards this.' It said most information it held
was provided free.
The Ministry of Defence told the campaign that it had implemented an 'upper
ceiling of Pounds 200 so that no charge will be made above that level,
irrespective of the actual additional cost'.
The Campaign for Freedom of Information believes that this Pounds 200
ceiling will put much official information out of bounds for the public. The
Ministry of Defence confirmed this: 'It is unlikely that divisions will be
able to answer inquiries more expensive than Pounds 200, however, since it
would probably represent an unreasonable diversion of manpower from defence
activities.'
The Office of Public Service and Science yesterday defended the fees and
said anyone dissatisfied should complain to the parliamentary ombudsman.
'There are bound to be some anomalies. The overarching principle is that all
charges must be reasonable and must not exceed the total cost of the work
involved.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Lottery may win overseas players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Lottery, due to be launched next week, could gain international
players next year.
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the Office of the National Lottery
(Oflot) said yesterday he would consider allowing non-UK residents to take
out a subscription to the game.
When tickets go on sale next Monday players will be able to choose numbers
for up to eight weeks ahead.
At some stage participants will be able to take out a six-month subscription
to the lottery so that the same number can be entered into the weekly Pounds
2m jackpot draw once the subscriber's cheque has been cleared. At the moment
only those with a UK address and bank account will be accepted as
subscribers.
Mr Davis said he was prepared to extend the subscription rules as long as he
could carry out his regulatory duty to look after the interests of all
players.
Camelot, the consortium operating the lottery, said yesterday it would be
interested in the possibility of international sales after the launch
period.
The main possibilities are areas with British connections such as Hong Kong,
Cyprus or South Africa. Oflot has had requests from potential players in a
number of countries including Australia.
Business in the European Union is unlikely. The European Court recently
upheld the right of the UK to prosecute German citizens for selling German
lottery tickets in Britain.
The court held that lotteries were a matter for national jurisdiction.
In the US considerable limits are placed on lottery sales. Tickets cannot be
posted across state boundaries, although they can be sent by courier.
National Lottery tickets will be available at Pounds 1 each.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Council compensation 'inadequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals for compensating council workers who lose their jobs as
a result of reorganisation in England are unacceptable, the chairman of the
quango charged with organising the process said yesterday.
The government wants workers to be offered discretionary compensation, with
a maximum of 66 weeks' pay.
But Mr Alan Atherton, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission,
told the annual conference of the Association of County Councils yesterday
that any scheme had to be mandatory, and the proposed level of compensation
was 'intrinsically inadequate'.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's local government spokesman, told the conference
his party would vote against all reorganisation orders in parliament unless
the compensation package was changed. He described the local government
review as a 'shambles'.
County councillors said that the proposals were unworkable and barely half
as generous as those offered to workers when metropolitan counties were
abolished in 1986. They predicted that nobody would volunteer for
redundancy, creating 'chaos'.
Mr Atherton also predicted that councils would need extra government funding
to deal with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations of 1981, known as Tupe. Where Tupe applies, all employees in a
concern transferred from one owner to another must keep their job on
identical terms and conditions.
According to legal advice published yesterday by Mr Atherton, Tupe would
apply to district council employees - meaning that they were guaranteed a
job with newly created councils - but not to most county council employees.
Councils denied this. The associations for both county and district
councils, and the Local Government Management Board, which represents
councils in negotiations with unions, said that this would be vulnerable to
legal challenge. Tupe should be assumed to apply in all cases, they said.
Mr Keith Sonnet, head of local government for Unison, the public services
union, said the union would mount legal challenges if all employees were not
transferred on Tupe terms.
Baroness Farrington, who chairs the association, said government funds must
be provided for compensating and employing existing workers.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Company fined over missing trade statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intrastat, the system for collecting trade statistics among European Union
countries, has acquired teeth.
This week magistrates in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, fined Dams International, a
furniture dealer based in Liverpool, a total of Pounds 11,550, including
Pounds 300 costs, after it pleaded guilty to failing to supply Customs and
Excise with information on goods acquired from and supplied to EU countries.
Dams, which has annual turnover of about Pounds 12m and exports of Pounds
1.5m to the EU, is the first UK company to be prosecuted for failing to
supply statistics under the system introduced in January last year to
provide trade figures in the European single market.
It is one of 31,000 businesses registered for value added tax with annual EU
trade of more than Pounds 140,000 that are required to supply data on
so-called supplementary declarations.
These forms, which must be sent to Customs within 10 working days of the end
of the month, oblige companies to fill in nine boxes on each type of goods
traded. They provide 97.5 per cent of the statistics for Intrastat.
The remaining 2.5 per cent are drawn from smaller VAT-registered businesses
which have to complete two boxes on their VAT returns showing the value of
goods supplied to and acquired from EU countries. According to Customs and
Excise this is the only contribution that 150,000 companies make to the
compilation of national statistics.
Customs and Excise is generally satisfied with the level of compliance of UK
companies. Fewer than 200 cases of non-compliant traders are under
consideration.
But this case is a sign that the agency is prepared to take recalcitrants to
court when all other means of persuasion have failed.
Customs acted after Dams failed to supply monthly details from January 1993.
The officials made a compliance visit in July last year, sent a warning
letter in November and another warning letter by recorded delivery in
January. In March a prosecuting officer interviewed company officials under
caution.
Customs and Excise offered the company a 'compound penalty' of Pounds 3,450.
This is an administrative fine, offered to all first offenders in lieu of
court proceedings, and has been used to settle with about 10 offending
companies. Dams paid the penalty, started to produce monthly returns for
Intrastat, but failed to produce 16 missing monthly returns.
Customs decided to prosecute as a last resort. After Dams produced one of
the missing declarations the company was charged with 15 offences of failing
to provide the information. It pleaded guilty to Southend magistrates on
Monday and was fined Pounds 750 per offence, compared with maximum possible
fine of Pounds 2,500.
Mr Paul Nelson, Dams' company secretary, said problems with the computer
system caused the failure to comply with the Intrastat rules. He was having
to work through 2,000 invoices a month to complete the forms and the job was
too time-consuming.
The case has puzzled Customs officers, however. Officials say the Intrastat
system is less burdensome than the declarations that were previously
required. The net annual saving to UK businesses of the new system has been
estimated at Pounds 135m.
The high level of compliance has increased official confidence that the
figures give an accurate picture of Britain's trade with the EU.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Vaccine for cancer to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A personalised cancer vaccine, using genetic material cloned from the
patient's own tumour cells, is to begin a clinical trial this month.
The trial was approved yesterday by the Medicines Control Agency. It is the
latest example of 'gene therapy' - one of the fastest growing medical
research fields - and the first in which a vaccine is tailor-made for each
individual.
Scientists from the Cancer Research Campaign and Medical Research Council,
working at the MRC Protein Engineering Centre in Cambridge, devised the
approach. It is aimed initially at B-cell lymphoma, a relatively rare cancer
of the lymph nodes affecting about 2,500 people a year in Britain. It could
later be extended to more common cancers.
B-cell lymphoma is especially suitable for treatment with a personal vaccine
because the cancer cells have marker proteins - targets for attack by the
body's immune system - which vary distinctly between individuals.
The experimental procedure involves removing the marker gene from the
patient's lymphoma cells and splicing it into bacteria which make millions
of copies of the gene as they multiply in a culture. The genes are cut out
of the bacteria with special enzymes, purified and injected into the
patient.
The idea, backed by promising results from animal experiments, is that the
re-introduced genes will make relatively large amounts of the cancer marker.
This should stimulate the patient's immune system to attack the cancer cells
more effectively than before.
Ten patients at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and the Royal Bournemouth
Hospital will take part in the initial trial. If they respond well the trial
will be extended.
Dr David Secher, drug development director of the Cancer Research Campaign,
said: 'It's important to stress that currently this vaccine is only
appropriate for patients with a particular type of B-cell lymphoma.
'However, our researchers hope that further work may lead to vaccines being
developed for other more common cancers.'
The campaign is testing a non-personalised vaccine for bowel cancer at
Nottingham University. It is also designed to prime the immune system to
attack cancer cells.
The personalisation procedure is far too elaborate for potential commercial
use. It would have to be automated and simplified if designer vaccines were
ever to become a routine treatment.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace process flies free of jails issue: Dublin's IRA
prisoner release announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, STEWART DALBY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dublin's announcement that it intended to release several IRA prisoners
before Christmas sparked a critical reaction yesterday from unionists and
some Conservatives.
But there seemed little prospect of the move blowing the Northern Ireland
peace process off course.
British and Irish officials working on the framework document, which the two
governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in
the province, are understood to be making headway again after a period when
little progress was achieved.
The recent suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that
the much-delayed document should be ready before the first anniversary of
the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 does not seem
to be regarded as unrealistic in Whitehall.
Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, would have an
opportunity to discuss the matter at the European Union summit in Essen,
Germany, on December 9 and 10.
More may become clear following a meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister,
which is expected to take place next Monday in Ireland.
Meanwhile, there seems no reason to suppose that preliminary talks between
the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should not
start before the end of the year, as Mr Major has indicated.
Topics to be covered would include the dismantling of republican arsenals.
The two governments disclosed last month that officials had started talks on
the logistics and mechanics of arranging for weapons in the hands of
paramilitaries to be given up.
But Mr Major declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely
to begin in advance of the preliminary talks.
Unionist reaction to Monday night's announcement by Dublin was divided. The
hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP) referred to a 'secret agenda' under
which London would agree to the IRA's demands. But the moderate Ulster
Unionists (UUP) said they were worried about the 'increasing divergence'
between London and Dublin.
Mr Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP spokesman, said: 'The Irish government has behaved
recklessly in announcing prisoner releases. It confirms what we have been
saying all along. The British government is surrendering to the IRA and the
republic.'
Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said: 'I do not think there is a
two-handed conspiracy between Westminster and Dublin. Quite the reverse. I
am worried about the increasing divergence between the two governments;
between Ireland's piecemeal approach and Mr John Major's correct structured
approach.'
Mr David Trimble, UUP legal affairs spokesman, said: 'I think the prisoner
releases underline the growing differences and widening gap between London
and Dublin. Dublin is trying to put pressure on London over prisoners
because London put pressure on Dublin over arms surrender.'
Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee,
described the announcement as 'a serious miscalculation by the Irish
government'. He said: 'The peace process can only maintain its momentum if
it retains the confidence of both sides of a deeply divided community . . .
this is the first incident which, if repeated, could spell trouble.'
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, said the republic's decision did not mean arbitrary releases.
He said: 'It is an approach which should be applied in Northern Ireland
through review procedures so that as peace lasts, so the prison population
decreases in a way which would signal a new era for Northern Ireland.'
Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Dublin's policy on the release of
prisoners in the Irish Republic had no implications for London's policy on
convicted prisoners. It said it had repeatedly made clear that those
convicted of criminal offences would serve their sentences.
Dublin's move was widely seen as evidence of its concern to maintain the
peace initiative's momentum in order to bolster moderate voices in the
republican movement.
According to security and republican sources, the Sinn Fe'in leadership is
coming under increasing pressure from hardliners in the IRA to obtain
significant political concessions from the British government.
Restlessness is deepening among IRA volunteers in the rural areas of Armagh
and Tyrone who feel that the peace process is bringing about no radical
change in the British government's position on Northern Ireland. This
section of the IRA is seeking an early release of political prisoners, a
withdrawal of troops, and a commitment to united Ireland.
The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in
British jails.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Scots accountants seek review on audit liability risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish accountants are to call for independent research into claims that
court action over audit liability could destroy one of the Big Six
accountancy firms.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland will ask the government
later this week to begin an inquiry into calls for reform of the law on
liability.
At present the Big Six, backed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, are pressing the government to reform the Companies Act.
They say that 'joint and several liability' means they are exposed to claims
after corporate failures which could eventually lead to the collapse of one
of the Big Six.
But the Scottish institute's report, written by a working party headed by
Sir James McKinnon, takes a radically different line and seeks to get an
independent judgment on the real risks the big firms face. It says if a case
does exist, it will be strengthened by independent research.
It argues that an imbalance appears to exist between the level of damages
sought and the funds available to meet such actions.
The public interest claims made by the profession for reform of the law on
audit liability are not proven, the report says.
In the medium term the report seeks a statutory limit on liability and a
series of other reforms.
The report is likely to call for the limit to be substantial to meet
responsible claims. It should be based on a set amount or a formula. One
suggestion made in the past has been 10 times the turnover of the company
involved.
It also calls, controversially, for the principle of 'joint and several
liability' to remain. It considers the alternatives to be inequit-able.
Finally it asks the successor to the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance, to be appointed next year, to consider requiring company
directors to hold insurance cover against claims for damages.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Life is not yet a beach for business leaders: Roderick Oram
finds delegates uneasy in spite of the more benign climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rather than basking in the most benign economic climate for years, business
is worrying that the government could turn the recovery into a wash out
before the next election.
Delegates to the CBI's annual conference were also concerned that rising
output and low inflation had failed to solve some of business's most
persistent problems such as lack of finance.
Business is also having to cope with some new difficulties. The most
pressing is how to persuade customers to accept price increases to cover
higher raw-material costs.
Mr Simon Eccleston, chief executive of Trans-Tech Industries, said: 'I'm
scared something will go wrong again.' The west Midlands manufacturer of
automation equipment has survived the recession, but, added Mr Eccleston:
'We have to trust politicians but now we can all see through them.'
Mr John McKeown, a director of Allied Domecq and managing director of the
Tetley Pub Company, said its pubs across the country have seen a slow
improvement in business over the past six months. The future is now
promising, 'provided someone doesn't over-correct near the next election'.
Mr Ernest Kidney, managing director of Balcas, said: 'We need continuing
stability, not just for a few years but longer-term.' His Ulster-based wood
processor depends on the rest of Britain for some 85 per cent of its sales
in construction, packaging and other fields.
Calls for government policy action ranged widely across fields from
transport and environment to training and education. Business also pressed
for more effort from the government on European integration.
The dominant theme, however, was that industry could solve many of its
problems through its own investment, but only if the government made tax
changes to encourage the process. The CBI has made capital allowances and
similar measures the central plank of its Budget submission.
The need to spend more on infrastructure, particularly transport, was a
concern expressed by business leaders from diverse industries. Mr Pat Lee,
development director of Wincanton, a distribution company based in
Wincanton, Somerset, said the south-west, for example, was ill-served by its
transportation links.
Many delegates welcomed private finance of infrastructure projects, an
approach reaffirmed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, at the conference
yesterday. Some Pounds 500m of private sector funding will have flowed into
transport projects this year, he said.
Mr Ivor Warburton, managing director of the West Coast Line, said securing
such funding was the key to rebuilding the railways. He said: 'It's a race
to do it before we get caught in a downward quality spiral' as existing
equipment wears out.
The pressure to invest in infrastructure and other capital equipment appears
to be building rapidly judging by the brisk rate of growth across the
spectrum of economic activity. Inevitably, of course, a few areas are
struggling. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said: 'It wouldn't be
much fun standing on a doorstep trying to sell pensions.'
Two barometers - train trips and packing cases - give a guide to the breadth
of the upturn. Mr Warburton said leisure travel on the West Coast Line began
to grow at the turn of the year and business travel in March. Mr Kidney of
Balcas said demand for packing cases, flat for the past two years, began to
recover about three to six months ago.
Mr Bill Good of Sterling Tubes, which supplies seamless stainless steel
tubes for process industries, said: 'Business is recovering but margins are
tight and I'm worried about unfair competition (from foreign suppliers).'
Of the few clouds gathering on the economic horizon, it is rising prices and
lack of finance which appear to worry business leaders most. With paper
costs up 30 per cent over the past year, for example, it has been hard for
Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, a large printer based in the west Midlands to pass them
on to customers used to unchanged prices over recent years.
Mr Stephen Adams, a divisional director of the company, said: 'It could be
easier next year when people have built them into their budgets.'
Mr Peter Pring, director of corporate affairs of 3M UK, said: 'We're a
little concerned with the trend of raw material prices.' It has, however,
managed to keep in check the prices of its 60,000 products across a range of
markets from consumer to healthcare and industrial.
Mr Eccleston of Trans-Tech, which makes of automation equipment, said:
'Demand is marvellous, but we can't do some of the business because we can't
finance it.'
He believes that it is a widespread problem, judging by his experience as a
board member of Walsall's Training and Enterprise Council. 'Of 1,500
companies the Tec ran a health check on, over half were concerned about a
lack of funding,' he said.
His unhappiness was echoed by several other delegates who, although they
were satisfied by the general state of the economy and their business, were
heading back to work to tackle this and other lingering problems.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Private cash for transport projects set to reach Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The private sector will have committed Pounds 1bn to transport projects by
March next year and Pounds 3.5bn worth of other schemes are being competed
for, the government announced yesterday.
The initiative was launched two years ago to get private finance into
projects traditionally funded by the public sector.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said the scheme was still in its early
stages but forecast that in 10 years it would be an integral part of the way
the government managed transport programmes and not 'an optional extra'.
He said: 'We have some considerable consortia who are saying that the
Channel tunnel rail link is a do-able deal. When the private sector can
define the risk, it has shown a willingness to invest.'
The main private projects under way are the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line
extension to the London Underground, the Pounds 300m Heathrow rail link and
a second bridge across the Severn River.
Schemes open to competition are the Pounds 2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link,
the Pounds 400m plan for new Northern Line rolling stock for the Underground
and four road schemes valued at Pounds 340m to be built and operated by the
private sector.
Attention has focused on larger schemes but there should be opportunities
for contributions to projects such as refurbishment of rail stations.

FT  09 NOV 94 / CBI cool on union chief's training call: Bill Jordan warns
conference of complacent attitudes - BP chief underlines the 'competitive
realities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial companies should pay a training levy if the UK is to overcome the
handicap of the least skilled workforce in Europe, Mr Bill Jordan, president
of the AEEU craft union, told the CBI conference in Birmingham yesterday.
He said the voluntary approach to training had been found wanting, and
added: 'If the CBI is serious about wanting a strategy to deliver skills for
the next century, we should not be debating whether to have a training levy
but tailoring the shape of one.'
He said budgets to improve skills had been cut by 35 per cent in the past
five years. It was 'dangerously complacent' to praise Britain's best
companies when the nation was lagging on productivity by up to 40 per cent
compared with overseas rivals.
The CBI responded cautiously to the idea. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of
Cadbury Schweppes and the CBI's education committee, said: 'The CBI has not
supported the concept in the past but we will be asking our members to
express their views and we will be consulting all members via the regional
councils.'
But Mr Jordan's argument sparked criticism from some delegates to the
conference. Mr John Phillips, chairman of Reliance-Barker-Davies, the
engineering group, dismissed the idea of a levy as 'simply an additional
payroll tax' and 'a pure addition to costs, a deterrent to employment'.
Earlier, Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, had warned that even
well-trained employees faced uncertainty. He said: 'We will not be thanked
by future generations if we duck the competitive realities of the present.'
Jobs for life were unlikely. 'I think most of us recognise that such a
prospect is no longer wholly appropriate,' he suggested.
Ms Kamlesh Bahl, who chairs the Equal Opportunities Commission, told the CBI
that inequality was 'demonstrably inefficient' and that 'a workforce trained
in a discriminatory way is inflexible'.
She noted that there had been a sevenfold increase in compensation over the
past year since the ceiling on awards had been abolished last year. In cases
of sexual harassment, awards against transgressing companies were likely to
increase.
But Ms Bahl, seeking to head off any criticism that the Equal Opportunities
Commission was a hindrance to companies' freedom of action, assured
businessmen that 'this is not a battle of the sexes'. Rather, the fair
management of human resources was 'about achieving competitiveness through
equality of opportunity'.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Imports of coal 'could be reduced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the company selected by the government as preferred bidder for
British Coal's English mines, has told miners that UK coal should be able to
displace more than a third of the 17m tonnes of imports annually.
It did not, however, assume displacing any of the coal in making its bid.
Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says in an interview with Coal News,
the British Coal newspaper for employees, that 'our commercial calculations
are based on there being no upturn in prices and no upturn in sales'.
His comments will fuel the controversy surrounding RJB's bid which, at
Pounds 900m, was at least 50 per cent higher than the next highest offer for
the three English regions.
Rival bidders believe there will be considerable contraction in the market.
Some doubt whether RJB can make significant profits if it pays as much as
Pounds 900m, and are puzzled that the company believes it can do so without
displacing imports.
In the interview Mr Budge says UK coal should be able to displace between 6m
and 7m tonnes of the 17m imported into the UK every year.
The company is not planning closures in the short term. 'We will not close
any mine that is making a profit,' he said.
In a further commitment to the future, the company is also planning a
school-leaver recruitment programme, offering apprenticeships across the
full range of mining skills.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Ashdown urges end to donations to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday sought to
exploit the disillusionment of businesspeople with the government by asking
companies to stop making political donations to the Conservative party.
Repeating a thought which has been expressed privately by many
industrialists, Mr Ashdown said: 'I do not believe you can say any longer
that this is a government which has been good for business.'
Mr Ashdown said at the CBI conference: 'Just as the TUC is beginning to
recognise that too close a link to one political party is not necessarily in
their interest, I hope that Britain's business community will begin to
reassess the extent to which unquestioning support, including financial
support, for the Conservative party is in their interest.'
Seeking to tap the sentiments in favour of strengthening the European Union,
manifest in CBI polls published earlier this week, Mr Ashdown urged the
business community to speak up for its own interests.
He said: 'It will be disastrous for Britain and business if we are excluded
from a single currency. And if that's what you believe too, it's time to be
saying it loud and clear.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Advertisement spending up in most media sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending on advertising in all the main media sectors increased in the
second quarter of the year, with particularly strong increases in radio and
poster spending, according to figures released today by the Advertising
Association.
The figures show the continued recovery of the advertising business from
recession, said the association, which is a federation of advertising trade
associations and professional bodies.
Advertisers spent a total of Pounds 1.2bn at current prices on press
advertising in the second quarter of this year compared with Pounds 1.1bn in
the second quarter last year.
Television advertising spending increased to Pounds 624m in the second
quarter from Pounds 564m last year, posters to Pounds 94m from Pounds 80m
and radio to Pounds 51m from Pounds 43m.
Spending in colour supplements is the only area to show a decline - a fall
of almost 12 per cent at constant prices.
The association said the fall 'reflects the changing definition of
'supplements' within newspapers, rather than a weakening market'.
Advertisements for office equipment increased, at constant prices, by more
than 38 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter
last year. Pharmaceuticals rose 37 per cent, while financial and household
equipment advertising rose 24 per cent.
At the other end of the scale government advertising fell 26 per cent,
agricultural and horticultural 18 per cent and drink 15 per cent.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Rifkind seeks cash for Tories: Little-known group of
industrialists rejects suggestion of subterfuge in fundraising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will tomorrow try to boost the
Conservative party's flagging finances at a private fundraising dinner in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
The gathering has been organised by the Northern Industrialists Protection
Association, a little-known outpost of the Tories' London-based treasurers'
department.
It is centred on a commit-tee of 10 prominent Tory-supporting industrialists
from north-east England, linked to a network of well-heeled party
sympathisers throughout the region.
The association is among several organisations in Britain which raise cash
for the Tories from the business world.
It is thought the Conservatives need at least Pounds 35m in corporate and
individual donations in the next two years to fight the next general
election and reduce its Pounds 15m overdraft.
The association - whose headquarters are in Front Street in the Cumbrian
market town of Alston - does little to advertise itself. But it denies any
subterfuge in its efforts to raise an estimated Pounds 150,000 a year on
behalf of the Tories.
Mr Patrick Doherty, the association's secretary, admitted that its title
could cause amusement. 'People sometimes think we are something to do with
the Mafia,' he said.
Set up in the 1950s, the association's main objective is 'to defend free
enterprise'. The word 'protection' in its title came from its founders'
perception of the threat to industry from leftwing Labour policies. In spite
of Labour's recent drift towards the centre no one has contemplated amending
the association's name, according to Mr Doherty.
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of the Sunderland-based Vaux brewing company,
is chairman of the association. Vaux has given Pounds 79,000 to the
Conservatives since 1988. Sir Paul said he was a 'substantial' personal
donor. 'I believe in the Conservative cause and am happy to do what I can to
help,' he said.
Also on the association's committee is Sir John Hall, the developer of the
Gateshead MetroCentre, Europe's biggest out-of-town shopping and leisure
centre, and chairman of Newcastle United Football Club.
Other prominent business leaders in the group are Mr Robert Dickinson,
chairman of Northern Rock building society, Sir Tom Cowie, life president of
the T Cowie car dealer, and Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of
Rolls-Royce engineering group. Rolls-Royce, one of the Tories' biggest
industrial sponsors, has given the party Pounds 275,000 in the past seven
years.
Another corporate donor is Persimmon, the York-based builder, which has
given nearly Pounds 25,000 since 1989. It is represented on the association
by Mr Duncan Davidson, its chairman. Mr Davidson said: 'Most industrialists
would rather operate under the Conservatives than any other party.'
At tomorrow night's black-tie function, 58 businesspeople from the region
will pay Pounds 50 each for smoked and marinated salmon, noisettes of lamb,
asparagus with white-wine gravy, poached peaches, wines and port. Mr Rifkind
is expected to talk for about 10 minutes and answer questions.
While the tickets for the event do little more than cover the cost of the
meal, the real business will be conducted in the next few months when Mr
Doherty follows up contacts from the dinner with requests for much larger
sums of cash.
Mr Doherty, a long-time Tory official who has been the association's
secretary for seven years, does not like the term 'arm-twisting'. He said:
'I simply say to people that there is a strong case for giving.'
But Mr Doherty recently suffered a rebuff when Cookson - a leading materials
group which is represented on the association by Mr Ralph Iley, an
unassuming pigeon-fancier who is a former Cookson managing director -
stopped donations to the Tories after handing over nearly Pounds 90,000
since 1987.
Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson chairman, said: 'We've stopped giving (to the
Tories). I personally don't think it's a good thing for companies to do.'
The other industrialists on the association's committee are Mr Elliott Ward,
chairman of the City &amp; Northern property group; Sir David Chapman, director
of Wise Speke stockbrokers; and Mr David Kelly, chairman of Kelly Packaging.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Tory councillors 'bullied staff'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative members of Westminster City Council 'bullied officers into
doing work which was political because they were frightened for their jobs',
the public inquiry into gerrymandering allegations was told yesterday.
The claim was made by Mrs Patricia Kerwan, the council's head of housing
between 1983 and 1987, who was the first senior Westminster Tory councillor
to go public with the details of the allegations when she appeared on a BBC
Panorama programme in 1989.
This led to a four-year investigation by the district auditor who said in a
provisional report that 10 councillors and council officials had 'wasted'
Pounds 21m by selling homes at a discount to entice likely Tory voters into
marginal wards.
Mrs Kerwan was called as a witness by two of the accused - Dame Shirley
Porter, former council leader; and Mr Barry Legg, a former councillor who is
now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South West.
Under cross-examination, Mrs Kerwan said she had opposed the sales scheme
and had fallen out with Dame Shirley. She said the scheme was 'drawn up with
a view to increasing the Conservative vote in eight key marginal wards -
that was wrong'. Dame Shirley had 'hammered councillors into the ground' to
produce a scheme to gentrify the marginal wards.
She said that she had been under pressure from the leadership to write
papers in 1986 on how to target housing policies towards marginal wards.
Mrs Kerwan stood unsuccessfully against Dame Shirley for the post of leader
in 1987 because she 'didn't like her style, her attitude and way of
working'.
The inquiry continues.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery could be set to falter in the months ahead, if leading cyclical
indicators for October, published yesterday by the Central Statistical
Office, are to be believed.
The shorter leading index, supposed to predict turning points in the economy
about five months ahead, turned down slightly last month after rising from
May to September. The longer leading index, which is said to indicate
turning points about 13 months ahead, has been declining since July. They
have, however, proved erratic guides.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Blair pledges union reforms will be kept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday promised business leaders that Labour would retain
the government's central trade union reforms and would consult
industrialists before introducing a minimum wage.
Speaking to senior executives at the Per Cent Club, which organises
charitable activity, Mr Blair said: 'We are not in the business of sweeping
away the trade union and labour relations laws of the 1980s.'
His comments coincided with a blunt warning by Mr Roy Hattersley, a former
Labour deputy leader, that the party must consider breaking its links with
the trade union movement if it wants to win the next general election.
Giving the George Orwell lecture at Birkbeck College, London, Mr Hattersley
said victory was possible only if Labour became a party of ideas rather than
vested interests.
He said: 'It is difficult to pursue truth wherever it may lead if two or
three mighty unions, which dominate the policy debate, have decided which
way to vote before the discussion begins.'
Mr Blair, setting out the framework for a working relationship between
business and a Labour government, offered strong support for a dynamic
market economy, and rejected the tax-and-spend approach of the last Labour
government.
He said strike ballots, union elections and curbs on mass picketing were
'here to stay', and ruled out any return to high marginal tax rates.
Mr Blair said the minimum wage would be introduced 'so as to avoid any
adverse impact on jobs', suggesting that the level would be lower than the
rate of more than Pounds 4 an hour sought by influential union leaders.
Mr Blair also spoke of the 'interdependence of business and the community'.
The club, he said, was a recognition by business that it had a
responsibility to wider society.
Business involvement in the community was more than an act of charity. 'Our
communities are your customers, and communities are your employees. The
state of society beyond the factory gate, the shop window and the office
entrance matters to business.'
Mr Blair supported the idea of a national youth and community service
scheme.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will today publish plans to reform the
tax system by toughening inheritance tax rules, simplifying corpora-tion tax
and collecting unpaid tax.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Boasting manufacturers get their nappies in a twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget soap wars. The latest battle is for babies' bottoms, as Pampers
disposable nappies slug it out with rival brand Huggies, and both sides
complain about their opponent's dirty tactics.
Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Pampers, complained to the Advertising
Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, about magazine advertisements
from Huggies manufacturer, Kimberly-Clark. The advertisements claimed
Huggies were 'significantly thinner than the leading nappy, yet incredibly,
they keep your baby just as dry'. P&amp;G, which said the 'leading nappy'
reference was clearly to its brand, Pampers, complained that the
Kimberly-Clark claims were false. It replied by sending laboratory research
to the watchdog in support of its advertisements.
Kimberly-Clark submitted its own complaint to the watchdog about P&amp;G's
advertising, objecting to magazine and direct-mail advertisements.
The watchdog, which engaged its own nappy expert to evaluate the claims,
concluded in its monthly report, released today, that the test results were
not comparable.
Both sides were sent away by the watchdog to see if they could agree a
'mutually acceptable testing procedure in order that such disputes could be
resolved satisfactorily in future'. In the meantime, both parties were told
by the authority not to claim 'anything more than an equal best ability to
keep babies dry'.
Calvin Klein Cosmetics was condemned by the watchdog for the way it used
model Kate Moss in an advertisement for its fragrance, Obsession for Men. It
said the model's naked pose, with her 'child-like form' and the brand name
of the product, were 'inappropriate and irresponsible'.
Some supermarkets use misleading 'basket-of-goods' price comparisons in
their advertising, according to a survey by the watchdog. It said some
advertisers were not comparing like with like.

FT  09 NOV 94 / ITN deadline on share limits is extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday extended the deadline
requiring shareholders in Independent Television News to reduce their
holdings to a maximum of 20 per cent.
The decision means that Carlton Communications and Granada, which each hold
36 per cent stakes because of last year's consolidation in ITV, will be able
to retain their dominant position in ITN at least until the end of next
year.
The extension has come because the government has made clear that it wants
to consider ownership of ITN in the continuing review of cross-media
ownership rules.
The announcement is a further indication that the government is taking very
seriously the whole issue of cross-media ownership. It is also investigating
whether the present restrictions in the 1990 Broadcasting Act could already
be out of date.
Media legislation is extremely unlikely in the coming parliamentary session.
The likelihood now is that there will be formal consultation, in the form of
a green or white paper next year, in advance of substantial legislation in
the 1995-96 parliamentary session.
Apart from cross-media ownership rules - and whether newspapers should be
able to own broadcasting organisations and vice versa - legislation could
address a number of issues remaining from the 1990 act.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN and Carlton Communications, yesterday
welcomed the commission's extension on ownership.
The 1990 act said that no single shareholding in ITN should exceed 20 per
cent by the end of this year. At the same time the shareholdings of the
regional ITV companies collectively must be less than 50 per cent.
At the moment the total ITV stake in ITN amounts to 82 per cent, with
Reuters at 18 per cent the only non-ITV shareholder.
The commission said yesterday the deadline for compliance with those
requirements would now be extended by one year to the end of 1995.
Mr Green said yesterday: 'ITN has benefited from having a small number of
large shareholders who are strongly committed to the long-term success of
the company.'
The ITN chairman said that the television news group had been transformed
from a loss-making company into 'a profitable and efficient news
organi-sation'.
At a time when the government has given the BBC the go-ahead to compete
commercially, Mr Green said: 'ITN would continue to compete strongly in home
markets and expand overseas.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Lloyd's to chase frozen deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London last night threatened legal proceedings against the
Alliance &amp; Leicester building society if it did not agree to release funds
held on behalf of a member of the insurance market.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester confirmed that its Isle of Man office had frozen an
account belonging to a Lloyd's Name.
It said it had received 'notice' from a firm of solicitors that the funds,
which acted as a deposit at Lloyd's, 'are subject of a fraud'.
Lossmaking Names hailed the case as a victory in their battle to prevent
Lloyd's seizing money held on their behalf to settle debts at the insurance
market. It is believed to be the first time a UK financial institution has
agreed to freeze a Name's funds in this way.
But Lloyd's insisted that the allegations on which the Alliance &amp; Leicester
appeared to have acted 'are similar to those raised in a previous court
action against Lloyd's which, on Lloyd's application, were struck out'.
A group formed to protect the interests of the wealthiest Lloyd's Names met
for the first time yesterday. The High Premium Group, which has 285 members,
is a response to reforms introducing new forms of corporate capital.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Subsidy urged for 'green' power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many types of renewable energy are too expensive to qualify for subsidies,
the industry regulator has warned.
Professor Stephen Littlechild said the government should choose the cheapest
forms of 'green' power for its forthcoming round of subsidies rather than
try to promote particular technologies.
This would mean dropping hydro schemes and projects which burn agricultural
and forestry waste, or energy crops such as coppicing. He also warned that
combined heat and power schemes would add extra costs. Instead, emphasis
should be given to wind, landfill gas and waste combust-ion.
Prof Littlechild's advice comes as ministers are finalising a new round of
subsidies for 'green' energy projects. They intend to choose about
300MW-400MW of schemes which will be allowed to charge premium prices for
their electricity.
Ministers have said they will put bidding projects into various technology
'bands' and select those that look most promising. Prof Littlechild
challenges this approach because it would lead to expensive projects
qualifying.
Instead, he says, ministers should select the 70 cheapest projects out of
the 520 submitted. This would ensure that prices would be 30 per cent below
the last subsidy round in 1991, although even these would be 50 per cent
above long-run free-market prices and will require a subsidy of Pounds 400m
over 15 to 20 years.
Prof Littlechild's report provoked a sharp response from the renewables
industry, which is trying to promote a wide range of technologies.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which is vetting the bids, said that
it had taken note of Prof Littlechild's report. Ministers hope to announce
the new subsidies next month.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Wakeham set to head press body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Wakeham, the former leader of the House of Lords, has emerged as
favourite to succeed Lord McGregor as chairman of the Press Complaints
Commission.
Lord McGregor, who is 73, is expected to retire from the newspaper and
magazine industry's self-regulation body early next year although his
contract runs to the end of next year. The exact timing of his departure has
not yet been decided.
The Press Standards Board of Finance, which has the task of finding a new
chairman for the commission, has been using Spencer Stuart, the executive
search group.
Lord Wakeham, who left the government in the July reshuffle, was top of the
list submitted by the headhunters. A formal decision is expected later this
week.
However, recent tension between the press and the government over
allegations of 'sleaze' has raised concern about the wisdom of appointing a
former senior Conservative politician to the sensitive post.
But those who argue that Lord Wakeham's political connections might be
valuable in managing the often turbulent relations between press and
politicians - and the possibility of press legislation - are likely to be in
the majority.
Lord Wakeham is seen as having an open mind on the press and has in the past
restrained those most keen on statutory intervention on press standards.
If Lord Wakeham is not chosen, or does not want the job, the most likely
successor to Lord McGregor would probably be Professor Robert Pinker, the
commission's privacy commissioner.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Ministry 'may cut 30% of jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 30 per cent of 11,000 jobs at the Ministry of Agriculture may be cut
over the next two to three years, the IPMS civil service union said
yesterday.
The cuts, part of a government review of civil service staff levels, begin
with at least 550 jobs due to go by next March.
The initial reduction of at least 5 per cent, designed to cut running costs,
is due to take effect through early retirement.
But Mr David Luxton, IPMS national officer for agriculture, said fewer than
half the 630 staff invited to apply were believed to have done so by this
week's deadline. Only those aged over 50 in middle management grades and
above have been asked to seek early retirement.
'Our fear is that we will move towards compulsory redundancies next year,'
he said. Compulsory redundancies were introduced at the ministry for the
first time in June, with 64 consultancy jobs lost at Adas, the advisory
agency being privatised, he said.
The IPMS, which represents about 3,000 senior and specialist staff at the
ministry, said it was expecting more staff cuts as a result of a review of
senior grades and a review of all aspects of ministry spending, both ordered
by the Treasury.
Mr Luxton said the senior staff review was modelled on that of the Treasury,
which announced last month that about one in four senior jobs would go.
The agriculture jobs targeted would mainly be those of advisers on the rural
economy, food production and safety, and animal welfare.
Mr Luxton warned that the 'arbitrary' cuts in staff numbers would lead to
delays and a deterioration in services to farmers.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Eurotunnel hits at government on ferry safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, last night launched a fierce
attack on the government for failing to impose the same high safety
standards on the ferry companies as it had on Euro-tunnel.
Sir Alastair broke with the tradition that has prevented the ferries and the
tunnel operator from commenting publicly on each other's safety problems in
a speech to the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and
Commerce.
He said: 'The government made us spend tens, even hundreds of millions of
pounds from our own capital - including the vast cost of transverse
bulkheads between every wagon on our shuttles. And yet that government steps
back from burdening the ferries with a few million in essential costs.'
Sir Alastair's remarks came a day after Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport
secretary, announced that a safety review of ferries operating from British
ports had found bow-door defects on one in three ferries.
The review was prompted by the sinking in the Baltic of the ferry Estonia
with the loss of more than 900 lives.
The French and British governments had compelled Eurotunnel to prepare a
300-page 'safety case', describing its safety features and procedures. As a
result it was 20 times safer than an equivalent stretch of railway, Sir
Alastair said.
Other complex industries such as nuclear power generation and aviation also
had to operate by high safety standards.
However, the ferries had only been required to reach 'a very modest and
clearly inadequate level of partial safety' under international rules for
safety at sea, he added.
The government had had several years to work out tough safety standards for
Eurotunnel and at the same time ensure that equal standards were imposed on
its competitors. 'Only now, as we start up, is it possible to confirm that
no equality of requirement has been established.
'We object fiercely and with intensity when we observe cost given by the
ferries as the reason for failing to remedy what appear to be inherently
unsafe ship designs.'
In spite of what in effect is a subsidy provided by the right to make
duty-free sales, the ferries were permitted to avoid relatively modest
investments in safety, Sir Alastair said.

but is using 'limited interventions' to smooth volatility, Mr Edgardo
Zialcita, acting governor, said. The bank's intervention in the market
yesterday was designed to 'stop a sharper decline in the dollar value'. The
central bank bought Dollars 40m as the peso surged 68 centavos to hit a
29-month high of 23.50 pesos to the dollar before easing.

A South African delegation yesterday met Mozambique's President Joaquim
Chissano and the leader of the former rebel movement Renamo to urge peaceful
transition to democratic government after multi-party elections more than a
week ago. This follows warnings by Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama that he may
not recognise the poll results, due next week.
Partial results, released yesterday, showed Mr Chissano and his ruling party
well ahead of his challengers. In the presidential race, Mr Chissano had 62
per cent of the vote at more than 2,000 of the 7,444 polling stations,
compared with 26 per cent for Mr Dhlakama. In the vote for parliament, Mr
Chissano's Frelimo led with 52 per cent, compared with Mr Dhlakama's Renamo
on 30 per cent. The possibility of renewed violence, which racked the
country for 16 years, worries Mozambique's neighbours. The South African
delegation included Defence Minister Joe Modise, Security Minister Sidney
Mufamadi and Mr Aziz Pahad, deputy foreign minister.

<TEXT>
South Africa's national assembly yesterday passed a Restitution of Land
Rights Bill in a first step towards compensating millions of blacks
dispossessed under apartheid. The bill, the first significant legislation
aimed at redressing the wrongs of apartheid to go through parliament,
provides for the setting up of a Commission on the Restitution of Land
Rights to help claimants bring their cases to a Land Claims Court. The
legislation provides for hearing of any claims dating as far back as 1913.
Most parties support the idea of land restitution for the estimated 3.5m
blacks forcibly removed from their lands over the past 80 years, but most
claims will be difficult to assess as little documentary evidence of past
tribal ownership exists. Given its budgetary constraints, the government
will also find it hard to provide financial compensation for those whose
claims are upheld. The bill still has to be passed by the Senate before it
can be signed into law.

<TEXT>
Russia's mediation drive between Iraq and Kuwait moved into top gear
yesterday, when Mr Tariq Aziz, visiting Iraqi deputy prime minister, handed
over a letter dealing with Baghdad's recognition of its former Gulf War foe,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
'Tariq Aziz. . . handed President Boris Yeltsin a message from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and
borders under United Nations Security Council Resolution 833,' a foreign
ministry statement said.
Foreign ministry officials would not comment on whether the letter had
specified Iraq would now officially recognise Kuwait. But the statement said
Mr Yeltsin had ordered Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to fly to Baghdad 'to
take part in completing the appropriate constitutional procedures'.
Itar-Tass news agency said he would leave for a three-day trip to Iraq
today.
Mr Kozyrev has been pushing for weeks for Iraq formally to recognise Kuwait,
and for the international community to lift trade and oil sanctions against
Moscow's old ally in response.
The talks with Mr Aziz follow Mr Kozyrev's announcement on October 13 that
he had won an apparently unconditional promise from Mr Saddam to recognise
Kuwait's sovereignty and borders. But the Security Council insisted this
pledge had to be fully ratified in legal form before sanctions could be
eased.
In return for full Iraqi recognition of Kuwait, Mr Kozyrev last month
promised that Russia would support a lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil
exports after six months.
Iraq has been under UN trade sanctions since shortly after it invaded Kuwait
in August 1990. The embargo includes a ban on crude oil exports, which were
the country's main foreign revenue earner before the Gulf War.
Although food imports are allowed under the ban, Iraq has refused an offer
to sell a limited amount of oil under UN supervision and use part of the
proceeds to meet domestic humanitarian needs.
Yesterday's meeting in Moscow, from which reporters and photographers were
kept at arm's length, continued moves by Moscow to recover lost status as a
player in high-profile Gulf diplomacy.
Apart from raising the Kremlin's faded profile in the Middle East, a
settlement with Iraq allowing it to resume its oil exports would clear the
way for Baghdad to resume paying Moscow an estimated debt of between Dollars
10bn and Dollars 16bn for arms supplied in the 1970s and 1980s.

FT  09 NOV 94 / DNA drugs can save 'millions of lives'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vaccines and other drugs derived from biotechnology have the potential to
save millions of lives, especially in developing countries, and to combat
diseases ranging from cholera to cancer and Aids, according to scientists
advising the World Health Organisation.
Sir Gustav Nossel of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia, said yesterday
that genetically-engineered (recombinant) drugs were 'purer and safer' than
conventional vaccines, highly effective and could be manufactured in large
quantities. Far from introducing additional regulations to control such
drugs, the need was to make them as widely available as possible, he said.
Sir Gustav was speaking near the end of a three-day meeting, which he
chaired, on the safety and ethics of using recombinant DNA vaccines and
drugs to tackle disease. He said the meeting, which brought together
doctors, scientists, ethical experts and consumer and industry
representatives, had found no innate disadvantages in the use of
genetically-engineered products compared with conventional ones and many
benefits.
Recombinant DNA products already in use include hepatitis B vaccine, insulin
and erythropoietin, which helps patients dependent on artificial kidneys.
Products in the pipeline include vaccines against cholera, typhoid, Aids,
certain cancers such as melanoma and birth control drugs producing temporary
infertility in women and men.
A new whooping cough vaccine that would avoid the 'nasty' reaction now shown
by one in 2,000 children could be available 'quite soon', Sir Gustav said.
Clinical trials on a drug to combat genital herpes were well advanced.
The WHO pointed out that some of these products, such as erythropoietin,
could not be made by conventional means while manufacture of insulin once
required the slaughter of 30m pigs a year.
The UN agency sees some of the biggest benefits coming in developing
countries where up to 12m people die each year from infectious diseases. The
hope is that genetically engineered vaccines may overcome the limitations of
existing vaccines.
The new drugs tend to be far more expensive than their conventional
counterparts. But delivery costs, which account for 90 per cent of the cost
of immunising a child, could be slashed by development of heat-stable
vaccines which do not need expensive refrigeration and 'one-shot' vaccines
giving protection from several diseases in a single dose.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace is the issue in 'widow election': Mervyn de Silva
previews a Sri Lanka poll blighted by assassination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts to resolve Sri Lanka's 11-year civil war have emerged as the single
most important issue in the country's presidential election today in which
the two main contenders are the widows of assassinated politicians.
Mrs Srima Dissanayake, the opposition United National Party candidate, has
taken the place of her husband, Gamini, killed by a suicide bomber, thought
to have been a Tamil, a fortnight ago. She is challenging Mrs Chandrika
Kumaratunga, the populist prime minister and dominant force in the
left-of-centre People's Alliance coalition which came to power after
parliamentary elections in August ended 17 years of UNP rule.
Mrs Kumaratunga, whose husband was killed by a leftist assassin in 1988, is
most likely to win the contest, propelling her into the most powerful post
in the land as Sri Lanka's first woman president.
Both women have promised peace but have sharply differed on how to end the
revolt in the 3.2m Tamil minority community which has killed more than
30,000 people and which costs nearly Dollars 1m a day.
Mrs Kumaratunga's People's Alliance government, elected partly on a 'peace
dividend' platform, put in train confidence building measures with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northern Jaffna peninsula. It
relaxed the economic embargo, restored electricity and opened a safe travel
route from the peninsula to the mainland.
It also sent a delegation to the north for talks with the rebels. A second
round was called off after Mr Dissanayake's assassination.
Mrs Dissanayake has accused the government of planning a sell-out of
majority Sinhalese interests and ceding territory to the Tamils.
She wants the rebels to lay down their arms before negotiating peace with
them, and has accused the government of bending over backwards to please the
Tigers by not naming them as suspects in the killing of her husband.
'A vote for Chandrika is a vote for LTTE,' posters around the island
proclaim.
The People's Alliance peace moves have led to the release of some prisoners,
mainly policemen held by the LTTE. But the LTTE has insisted that some
heavily fortified army camps should be dismantled and a ceasefire declared.
The army was strongly opposed to the LTTE demands. Furthermore, Mrs
Kumaratunga has angered the high command by saying that poor soldiers were
keen on peace while the senior officers were opposed to the idea.
Together with the police, the army is a large vote bank. Public servants and
servicemen voted by post yesterday and the result could be a clue to the
mood of the armed forces, now an important factor in the island's politics.
Whether or not the island's military is behind her, Mrs Kumaratunga can,
however, rely on the island's minorities. Most Tamils, Moslems and Indian
Tamil plantation workers are firmly behind her as she continues to reap the
benefits of popular moves to slash flour and fertiliser prices and raise
public sector workers' salaries.

<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed a series of measures
yesterday to speed the expansion of Palestinian self-rule, amid growing
concerns about the political and economic crisis in the Gaza Strip.
After a meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel had agreed to
complete transfer of administrative power to Palestinians over West Bank
health, welfare, taxation and tourism by the end of the month under an
agreement known as early empowerment which has already transferred education
to Palestinians.
Mr Rabin also said Israel would add talks on Israeli troop redeployment from
the West Bank and the transfer of authority to continuing negotiations about
Palestinian elections and had agreed to ease Israel's closure of Gaza and
the West Bank by increasing the number of Palestinian workers allowed to
cross into Israel by 10,000 to 23,000.
The package of measures completes the transfer after months of delay and
growing mutual suspicion. Israeli officials said Mr Rabin appeared to have
made a strategic decision to implement the Israeli-PLO accords despite
opposition from senior military officers.
They said Mr Rabin recognised that unless the peace process is implemented
much faster Mr Arafat's fragile support base will collapse in the face of a
resurgent Islamic opposition.
Mr Arafat said the meeting had been very positive. 'We hope that in this
atmosphere we will follow up and implement accurately and honestly what we
agreed upon.'
However, even with Israel's commitment to accelerating the process officials
said it was unlikely that the Israeli army would leave Palestinian
population centres before the middle of next year - a full year behind
schedule.
The pace of future negotiations, which Mr Rabin said would start within two
weeks, will depend largely on what instructions Mr Rabin gives to the
four-person Israeli negotiating team. But observers said the inclusion of
two foreign ministry officials should help to speed the talks given the
clear enthusiasm of the foreign ministry for quicker implementation.
'They will certainly be complex negotiations in which we, as Israelis, will
have to ensure ourselves all the components of security. I cannot estimate
how many months the talks will last,' Mr Rabin said.
Mr Rabin also said early empowerment would depend on an agreement with
donors to meet the additional funding gap the Palestinian authority will
incur as it takes over responsibility in the West Bank. Israel, the PLO and
donors are close to completing an accord under which Israel will assist the
Palestinians with tax collection, tax training and the transfer of tax data
in Arabic and donors will meet an estimated additional deficit of Dollars
27m (Pounds 17m) for the next six months.
Donors have agreed to meet the financing gap but have warned they cannot
continue funding Palestinian running costs indefinitely while Israel
continues to collect millions of dollars of customs duties from the West
Bank.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Bank lending fall underlines fragility of Japan's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's official economic forecaster yesterday upgraded its outlook
slightly, but the fragility of the recovery was underlined by a record fall
in bank lending last month.
Bright economic spots are continuing to spread, said the Economic Planning
Agency's monthly report for October. It pointed as evidence to a 'gradual
uptrend' in industrial production and 'signs of a pick-up' in corporate
profits. This contrasts with September, when the economy was seen heading
for recovery, the first official recognition of the end of Japan's
three-year economic downturn, the longest in post-war years.
Subtle changes in wording from one EPA report to the next are closely
watched as an influence on monetary policy. So the Bank of Japan can be
expected to take the latest prognosis as further evidence that it has no
domestic economic reason to cut official interest rates, despite the
dollar's renewed fall last week to a record low against the yen.
The EPA's cautious optimism is the latest sign that Japan's economic cycle
has slowly turned, as Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn) of government spending
programmes over the past two years and an income tax cut last summer have
started to feed through into corporate activity and private spending. On the
corporate front, industrial production rose 1.6 per cent in the three months
to September, the third quarterly rise in a row.
Meanwhile, the jobs market has become slightly less weak, shown by a rise,
for two months in a row, in the number of jobs available per 100 applicants,
from 63 in August to 64 in September. The labour market is still tough,
especially in manufacturing, which em-ployed fewer people than services in
September for the first time recorded, but the worst is over, said an EPA
official.
Yet the fall in bank lending, announced by Federation of Bankers'
Associations yesterday, is equally a sign that consumption may be lagging
and that banks' lending policies continue to get tighter.
The balance of lending by the 11 'city banks', the country's main retail
banks, fell by a record 1.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the
tenth consecutive monthly fall, and the largest year-on-year decline since
the statistics were first collected in 1954. The fall was blamed on weak
demand for personal housing loans, consumer credit and corporate capital
investment funds.
The rapid growth in problem loans produced by the collapse of property and
other asset prices in the last few years has at the same time forced banks
to adopt a more cautious approach to domestic loans.
Over a quarter of all lending by top banks is secured on property. Land
prices have kept falling in the main cities in the past year; as a result
banks have reduced credit lines to many smaller customers. Lending by the
three long-term credit banks fell 0.9 per cent from a year before, but loans
from the seven smaller trust banks registered 4.5 per cent up on a year ago.

<TEXT>
The battle between NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, and its
smaller competitors over use of NTT's local network intensified yesterday as
three long-distance telecoms operators asked the authorities to step in.
DDI, Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan have asked the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications to intervene in talks with NTT, stalled because of
differences over rates set by NTT for use of its local network.
The companies, which have been negotiating with NTT for the past five years,
claim this prevents them from offering discounts to customers equivalent to
the discounts NTT can offer for the same services. The three compete with
NTT as long-distance carriers but depend on using NTT's local network.
They want to set up so-called virtual private networks (VPNs), allowing
users to cut their communications bills substantially by using public
networks as though they were internal networks. NTT has already started
providing VPN services.
This is the second time in recent months that NTT has been accused of using
its monopoly over the local network to impede the business of its
long-distance competitors.
The latest row is likely to support claims that NTT should be broken up into
separate local and long-distance businesses to introduce greater competition
into Japan's telecommunications market and ensure existing competition is
given a fair chance. NTT faces a decision by the Japanese government next
year on its future status.
The three long-distance carriers have been asking NTT to allow them to set
their own rates for VPN calls made on NTT's local network so that they can
offer their own customers similar discounts to what NTT offers.
NTT counters it is happy to link the three carriers to its local network for
VPN services but cannot allow them to set rates for use of its own network.
'The local network is NTT's business,' an NTT official said.
Japan's telecommunications policy, which separates long-distance and local
operations, has not kept up with developments in the industry, such as the
emergence of new services such as VPN.
To accommodate the emergence of these new services, policy should reflect
the need for telecoms operators to provide end-to-end services, the NTT
official noted.

FT  09 NOV 94 / South Korea eyes the North's attractions: Economic benefits
of Seoul's easing of business links with Pyongyang
</HEADLINE>

Seoul has opened the door to economic co-operation with North Korea,
offering the possibility of long-term peaceful integration between the two
bitter foes. But investment by South Korean companies is likely to be modest
for the immediate future.
Investment guidelines announced by the Seoul government yesterday will
guarantee a gradual expansion of economic ties.
South Korea's decision to ease trade and investment curbs follows the
settlement of the international dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme
last month. Seoul suspended economic co-operation with Pyongyang two years
ago after North Korea threatened to withdraw from the international nuclear
safeguards agreement.
Initial investments will be limited to light industry, but large-scale
infrastructure and energy projects will be postponed until progress is
achieved on such political issues as intra-Korean nuclear inspections.
South Korean businessmen and technicians will be allowed to travel to North
Korea to conduct feasibility studies, establish branch offices and manage
factories. Machinery can be shipped to the North to equip factories handling
reprocessing orders from the South.
South Korean companies will also be permitted to employ cheap North Korean
labour in third countries for construction and natural resources projects.
They will also be allowed to participate in investment projects through
joint ventures with other countries, primarily China, or multilateral
programmes such as those sponsored by the UN Development Programme.
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam's decision to resume economic ties is
meant to encourage the opening of North Korea and promote the gradual
reunification of the divided peninsula, while acknowledging Pyongyang's new
leadership under Mr Kim Jong-il.
But the South Korean investment guidelines are the result of a domestic
political compromise on the issue. Full-scale economic co-operation would
have angered conservatives who argue that industrial investments would only
resuscitate North Korea as its economy appears headed for collapse.
But South Korea's powerful conglomerates, or chaebol, have been lobbying
strongly for an easing of investment restrictions because they want to take
advantage of North Korea's cheap labour force and the country's potential as
a new market for consumer goods.
They have also expressed fears that US, European and Japanese companies may
establish a foothold in North Korea before they do, if the restrictions are
left in place.
The chaebol appear ready to live with the remaining economic restrictions
since they are cautious about committing large amounts of investment to
North Korea. Concerns range from the country's poor infrastructure to the
absence of investment guarantees and a double taxation treaty.
South Korean companies have been scouting production sites in North Korea
since 1989, with 13 chaebol having sought government approval to conduct
negotiations with Pyongyang on investment projects, according to ministry of
trade, industry and energy officials.
Proposed investments mainly concern the production of light industrial
goods, including textiles, electronics, and food products. Several companies
also want to develop tourist facilities near Mount Kumkang, one of Korea's
most famous scenic areas. Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar are reprocessing
textile products in the North.
Short term, Samsung wants to expand activity to include manufacture of
electronics products. Lucky-Goldstar plans to produce daily consumer items,
while Daewoo hopes to establish an electronics assembly complex in the port
of Nampo, near Pyongyang.
The chaebol eventually want to win construction orders for infrastructure
projects and operate gold, zinc and iron mines in North Korea. Hyundai has
expressed interest in establishing a ship repair yard in Wonsan and
producing railway carriages, while Lucky-Goldstar would build oil refining
and petrochemical facilities.
These investment plans will be affected by Pyongyang's conditions governing
foreign investment. North Korea has been seeking foreign investment to
revive its troubled economy, which has contracted by an annual 5 per cent in
the past four years. It has recently copied many of China's foreign
investment laws.
But North Korea still has ambivalent attitudes to chaebol investment.
'The North Koreans fear they will become an economic colony of the chaebol
and would prefer doing business with smaller South Korean companies,' said
one western business consultant who travels frequently to Pyongyang, 'but
they also realise the chaebol are the only ones possessing enough financial
resources to undertake the big industrial projects that would benefit North
Korea.'
North Korea may try to place geographical restrictions on where the chaebol
can operate to prevent the population from being exposed to foreign
influences that could undermine support for the Pyongyang government. It has
been trying to limit foreign investment to the country's north-eastern
region, but potential foreign investors complain the area is too isolated
and lacks transport links.
The confidence of the South Korean government and chaebol concerning North
Korean investment will be strengthened if Seoul is allowed to build new and
safe nuclear reactors to replace Pyongyang's current nuclear programme,
scheduled to be dismantled under its recent nuclear deal with the US.
The project is considered a key test of North Korea's willingness to
co-operate with Seoul and accept the presence of at least 1,000 South Korean
workers who will help build the reactors - the first significant venture
between the two countries.
