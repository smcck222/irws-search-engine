FT  09 NOV 94 / Mitterrand defends Africa record: French president skims
over French role in Rwanda

France's President Francois Mitterrand mounted a strong defence of his
record in Africa yesterday but did not reply to harsh critics of France's
policy before and after this year's Rwandan genocide, Reuter reports from
Biarritz.
Addressing his last Franco-African summit, the 78-year-old leader said
France remained Africa's firmest foreign friend and its biggest aid donor.
In a valedictory message ending his 50-year association with Africa, Mr
Mitterrand appealed to whoever succeeds him as president next May to
maintain France's strong ties with the world's 'most fragile continent'.
But he skimmed over France's much-criticised role in Rwanda where hardliners
in the ousted Hutu-led government organised the genocide of up to 1m people
between April and July. Under President Mitterrand, France gave sustained
military and political support to the former regime.
The new Tutsi-led government accuses Paris of orchestrating efforts to
destabilise it, citing the blocking of European aid and delays in bringing
the culprits to international justice.
For the first time since 1975, Rwanda was not invited to attend the
Franco-African summit. France said it preferred to see the situation
'evolve' in Kigali, but many African delegates said they regretted the new
government's absence.
Delegates expected Rwanda to be at the centre of the summit's two plenary
sessions before today's close. But France was promoting a debate on the
creation of an African intervention force to respond quickly to the
continent's frequent and bloody conflicts.
French media and African opposition parties accused Mr Mitterrand before the
summit of betraying his early promises to help end the autocratic rule of
African political 'dinosaurs' personified by Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko.
Mr Mobutu, who earned French gratitude for his support on Rwanda, was in
Biarritz and back in limited favour with France despite Zaire's continued
state of economic chaos and political in-stability.

Japan's leading commercial networks yesterday hit at Nielsen Japan, the
Japanese arm of the US marketing group, over its launch this month of an
automated system measuring television ratings.
The television networks, stakeholders in Video Research, a ratings research
company which holds a virtual monopoly of the business, said Nielsen's
decision to offer the ratings service was 'regrettable'.
Video Research measures ratings per household, rather than individuals as in
the US and European countries. The data is supplemented by diaries kept by
individual viewers one week in a month.
The networks had previously warned that Nielsen's move would cause
'confusion' in the television advertising business. They had not wanted
Nielsen to start its service until all four parties involved in the ratings
business (advertisers, advertising agencies, networks and ratings companies)
had all agreed to the launch.
Nielsen's move to go ahead despite networks' strong opposition has
frustrated network officials. 'We really weren't expecting this,' said Mr
Yasuharu Urushido of Nippon Television Network. Corporate advertisers and
foreign advertising agencies, which have been calling for individual ratings
for over a decade, have backed Nielsen's decision. They want more detailed
data on the age and sex of viewers.
As a compromise, Nielsen and corporate advertisers had agreed to use data
from the 'people meter' system solely as 'marketing data' and not as a basis
for negotiating advertising rates with the networks. The company offered to
provide the networks with the data free for the first five months.
The networks describe the 'people meter' system as imperfect and the data
inaccurate. Nippon Television and Tokyo Broadcasting Service said they had
rejected Nielsen's offer of free data.

Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's combative economy minister, may fail to win
extra powers he sought to cut public expenditure following a pact by
governing Peronist and opposition deputies.
The agreement, which should clear the path for congressional approval of the
1995 budget within 10 days, excludes from the package an article that would
have given Mr Cavallo additional powers to push through privatisations and
cut state bureaucracy.
Mr Cavallo had hoped article 14 - which included authority to merge or
eliminate state bodies and to cut the number of public employees - would
have saved the treasury about Dollars 1bn next year. But many congressmen
were reluctant to grant Mr Cavallo powers to bypass the legislative branch.
The issue has taken on particular relevance because of the emergence in the
third quarter of a budget deficit, the first in more than two years. Mr
Cavallo has sought to blame the deficit on growing pensions payments, but
many commentators argue that fiscal laxity in other areas explains much of
the deterioration.
The deficit has forced Mr Cavallo to ask Congress to amend the 1994 budget,
granting extra expenditure of Dollars 1.3bn to meet pensions and bonuses
over the next two months.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Investors keep eye on Zedillo's peso policy: Pressure for
Mexico devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's next president, takes office on December
1, domestic and foreign investors alike will be watching for his
administration's views on exchange rate policy.
Despite a depreciation of more than 10 per cent against the dollar this
year, some economists worry that the peso is over-valued. Mexico's current
account deficit is expected to widen to about Dollars 28bn this year, or
more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product. With capital flows
insufficient to finance the deficit, reserves have fallen by about Dollars
10bn since February, and short-term interest rates have risen to 14.1 per
cent, more than 7 per cent in real terms.
Normally sanguine economists now conclude that for interest rates to come
down and economic growth to accelerate from the modest 3 per cent expected
for this year, a devaluation is necessary. 'It is a medium and long-term
problem rather than a short-term one: but eventually we are going to have a
change in exchange rate policy,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, head of the
economic consultancy Macro Asesoria Economica.
Mr Zedillo publicly backed the renewal of the pacto between government,
business and unions in late September, which permits a daily slide of the
peso against the dollar equivalent to 4.3 per cent in a year. Anything more
than that would require central bank intervention.
However, partly due to the rise in US bond yields and continued political
uncertainty in Mexico, the pacto has failed to bolster confidence in the
currency, or reduce interest rates. Yesterday the peso was trading at 3.42
to the dollar, just below the central bank limit of 3.45.
Mr Zedillo's close advisers insist - as they must - that there is no need to
devalue. 'Capital account inflows determine the deficit and not the other
way round,' says Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister who is one of the
front-runners to become finance minister under Mr Zedillo. 'The day you stop
having capital inflows then the rhythm of imports will slow down.'
Such a relationship has not held this year. In the six months to June the
current account deficit grew by 23.9 per cent to reach Dollars 14.2bn; the
surplus on the capital account fell by 21.6 per cent to Dollars 12.45bn.
While lower capital inflows will eventually reduce imports, many observers
believe the best mechanism to induce the adjustment is through a devaluation
of the currency.
Using a different argument, Mr Serra predicts that import growth will fall
as the rapid restructuring in Mexico's industrial sector slows. He says
import growth in recent years has been unusually high because companies have
replaced obsolete machinery with imported capital goods. Once this process
is over, he says, new capital goods imports will complement rather than
substitute for existing capital goods, leading to a narrowing between the
rate of growth of imports and exports.
But for the moment industrial restructuring is continuing, indicating that
the economy will be dependent on foreign capital for some time. With high US
interest rates turning sentiment against most emerging markets, Mr Zedillo
may seek to bolster confidence in the currency by announcing a series of
pro-market economic reforms, such as new privatisations, further opening of
sectors such as energy to private capital, and deregulation.
Such steps or similar ones, along with an expected improvement in the
political climate after Mr Zedillo takes office, may prove sufficient to
calm the markets. But if investors remain nervous, Mr Zedillo faces three
unpalatable choices: maintaining or raising current high interest rates to
draw in short-term capital; increasing the current rate of maximum
depreciation of the currency; or pushing for a one-off devaluation.
Keeping interest rates high would hurt economic growth and make it difficult
for Mr Zedillo to reach his target next year of 4 per cent. It would put
further pressure on Mexican companies that are struggling under high
financing costs. And as Mr Serra argues, high interest rates are one of the
causes of the trade deficit; Mexican companies, he says, are finding it
difficult to compete with importers of intermediate and capital goods
because they cannot offer attractive credit terms to customers.
Some members of the Salinas administration have argued in favour of
increasing the daily depreciation of the exchange rate band, believing that
such a move would improve competitiveness and take pressure off the
currency. But with investors expecting a more rapid depreciation of the
currency over time, they may demand higher interest rates to compensate for
the greater exchange rate risk. 'Widening the band would be the worst of all
worlds,' says Borja Ussia of Grupo Moneda in Mexico City.
Government officials insist that a one-off devaluation would be even more
damaging. They argue that interest rates would rise after a devaluation,
with investors concerned that inflation would rise as import prices
increase. And many of Mexico's largest companies would be hit with huge
losses on the foreign currency loans they have taken out in recent years.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Spiders, cookies and a lot of abuse: US campaign
unwholesome, hypocrisy rampant and invective childish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Forget Fleetwood Mac's 'Don't stop thinking about tomorrow,' which echoed
endlessly through President Bill Clinton's campaign rallies in 1992; the hit
political song of 1994 is, more poignantly, 'The itsy-bitsy spider.'
Film of Senator Ted Kennedy singing along with the children's ditty provided
one of the few high points in a campaign season that almost everyone agrees
is one of the dirtiest in recent memory.
The image must have been so memorable Congressman Jim Nussle of Iowa filmed
a campaign advertisement solely of him singing the Spider with his three
children.
Acting with kids or animals carries its own risks. Mr Michael Huffington,
who has spent as much as Dollars 25m, mostly his own money, in a bid to
unseat Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein in California, campaigned last
month at the Bundy Scott Child Care Centre in Pasadena, reading 'The little
seed' and 'The little boot' to the toddlers.
'They seemed to like him. I don't know why,' said Mr Anthony Henry, the
centre's director. This endorsement may have two edges, but could be
important in a campaign where one of the principal issues has been the
immigration status of Mr Huffington's nanny.
In other races the central issues have sometimes been even stranger. In the
race for Wyoming's only seat in the House of Representatives, Republican
Barbara Cubin's campaign has been rocked by 'Cookiegate' - charges that she
once passed around suggestively masculine-shaped biscuits at a meeting. The
Casper Star-Tribune reports that Ms Cubin admits passing the cookies around,
but says she did not bake them herself.
In most parts of the country, the campaign has been unwholesome, the
hypocrisy rampant and the invective childish.
A spokesman for Congressman Jim Cooper, who is running for one of
Tennessee's Senate seats against Republican lawyer Fred Thompson, calls his
opponent 'a Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey
Poupon-spreading, millionaire Washington special interest lobbyist.'
But the prize for the funniest political advertisement in a losing cause
goes to the campaign of former Congressman Jim Jontz to unseat Republican
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana. Mr Jontz drives around Indiana towns such
as Lebanon, Peru and Moscow, in a search for the billions of dollars of
foreign aid Mr Lugar has voted for.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Brittan bids to boost Europe's image in
China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner for External Trade
Relations yesterday inaugurated a European-funded management school in
Shanghai, the gesture went beyond the Ecu25m (Dollars 31.75m) being
invested.
Indeed, Sir Leon has been at pains on his second visit to China this year to
emphasis Europe's role as a trade and investment partner, and to dispel what
he clearly regards as a damaging perception of the EU as a trading fortress
unsympathetic to Asian aspirations.
His mission, he says, is part of attempts by the European Commission to
develop a 'sharper focus' on Asia and also to spread the message that Europe
is not only a huge trading bloc, but also a political entity open to the
outside world. 'We are not a fortress,' he says. 'We encourage our people to
follow open trading policies and be involved in the multilateral system.'
Sir Leon's comments reflect concern in the Commission over negative views of
Europe expressed recently by Asian leaders meeting in Singapore. It is also,
of course, a result of the growing importance of Asia, and China in
particular, to EC traders and investors.
Between 1979 - when China opened its doors to the outside world - and 1993
EU-China trade grew 13 times from Ecu2.4bn to Ecu31bn. China, which
registered an Ecu8.2bn trade surplus with the Community last year, is now
the EU's third largest trading partner.
European investment, however, lags well behind that of Hong Kong, Taiwan,
the US, and Japan. Among top 10 investors in China at the end of 1993 the UK
ranked sixth with pledged investment of Dollars 3.3bn and Germany ninth with
Dollars 1.4bn. This compares with Dollars 14.6bn for the US and Japan's
Dollars 8.9bn.
Europe's new interest in the region is also being driven in part by a
recognition that institutions such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum (Apec) are beginning to provide a regional focus where none existed
before.
But Sir Leon says that contrary to suggestions that Europe might fear
competition from Apec, it welcomes its emergence as a consultative forum and
force for trade liberalisation. 'We think that a body of that kind, if it
moves towards free trade, will provide greater opportunities for us so long
as it remains attached to a multilateral system and doesn't seek to create
new barriers,' he said.
Sir Leon concedes that Europe has been 'somewhat slow' to recognise the
extent of the change overtaking the Asia Pacific region and thus the need to
respond more actively to the demands of such a dynamic region.
Early this year he proposed a thorough review of the EU's Asia policy, and
this resulted in a series of recommendations circulated within the
Commission in July. These would lead in time to an agreed policy on Asia.
As far as China was concerned the European initiative would involve an
enlarged political and economic dialogue aimed at expanding Euro-Chinese
trade and investment, and assistance to China in its effort to integrate
itself into an open, market-based world trading system.
European support for China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade was part of this process, and in ways that may not be entirely subtle
EU officials seek to draw distinctions between their approach and that of
the US.
'The Chinese know, for example, we are playing a very much more positive
role towards their membership of Gatt than some others,' said Sir Leon on
the eve of a meeting on Monday in Beijing with Ms Wu Yi, China's minister of
foreign trade.
Differences between the US and Europe over terms for China's Gatt entry may
not be great - the Europeans appear willing to be more lenient about
transitional arrangements - but the fact that EU officials want it to be
noted that they are predisposed to be more helpful at this stage throws an
interesting light on competition for influence in the world's fastest
growing market.

Malaysia yesterday put in doubt the outcome of next week's Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum summit in Indonesia by saying that it could turn
into an elaborate public relations exercise and would not lead to any
binding agreements on regional trade liberalisation.
President Suharto, who is to host the meeting, has been pressing for a
declaration promising trade liberalisation by the year 2020 in an area which
produces roughly half the world's economic output. He is supported most
strongly by the US and Australia, both of which want a binding agreement. Mr
Suharto sees the Apec meeting as an opportunity to establish Indonesia as an
important player in world economic matters.
However, Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's trade minister, said yesterday that
Apec had no mandate to enforce any agreement. 'Why have all this exercise of
doing something which you know cannot bind people?' she said. 'It's a very
elaborate PR exercise.
'Anything that happens in Apec is non-binding. That's the principle of the
organisation,' said Mrs Rafidah. As long as Malaysia sticks to its position
it will be impossible to establish a meaningful consensus among the 18 Apec
members at next week's meeting.
Mrs Rafidah said Apec's eminent persons group which proposed the 2020 target
date should be disbanded and that the group's private sector forum which
suggested an earlier date for trade liberalisation only represented the
personal views of individuals.
She reaffirmed Malaysia's view that the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade was the appropriate forum for binding commitments on trade, and was
vehement in her criticism of the US and Japan for their slow progress in
ratifying the Uruguay Round.
Mrs Rafidah said that Malaysia was 'just a bit disgusted' that Japan and,
especially, the US have not ratified the Uruguay Round. 'The profound
statements made by the US over the past seven years when the negotiations in
Gatt were taking place indicated that they would be the first to ratify.
'If the US and Japan need pressure to ratify,' she continued, 'why don't
they give up the economic leadership of the world? Let the small countries
rule the world.'
Malaysia is concerned that the US and Australia are seeking to build up Apec
in a way that would eclipse the smaller Asean regional grouping, which has
its own more modest agenda for trade liberalisation. Apec was conceived as a
loose, consultative forum, Mrs Rafidah said.
Malaysia's stand is, however, likely to cause problems within Asean. It
risks upsetting not only Indonesia, but also Singapore which is a strong
Apec supporter and a firm advocate of trade liberalisation on a broad front.
Outside Asean China is more in sympathy with Malaysia and has expressed
opposition to a firm timetable.
Underlying Malaysia's tough approach is its desire to develop a new grouping
 -the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) which would include Japan but not
the US. Malaysia has recently criticised Japan for its non-committal
attitude to this proposal. 'There is a difference between the official
stance of Japan and the stance of Japan as we know it,' Ms Rafidah said.
Japan must decide whether it is part of East Asia, she added.

FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: World's car makers prefer the Thai tiger -
An opening market in a sea of protection makes Thailand the region's leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign by US manufacturers to break into south-east Asia's vehicle
markets - including a recent trade mission to Bangkok, Jakarta and Kuala
Lumpur - has highlighted the importance of Thailand in the rapid growth of
the motor industry in the region.
Hardly a week passes without an announcement of plans to invest in the
manufacture of cars or trucks somewhere in south-east Asia.
Toyota is considering increasing production capacity at its factories in
Indonesia and the Philippines; Chrysler is planning a Dollars 100m joint
venture in Vietnam to build minivans and possibly Jeeps; Rover, the UK
carmaker controlled by BMW of Germany, has signed a memorandum of
understanding with Malaysia's Proton about the possible manufacture of Rover
engines in Malaysia.
But it is Thailand that has emerged as south-east Asia's most attractive
investment location for vehicle and component manufacturers. 'I've never
seen it as active and energetic as it is now,' says Mr Michael Dunne,
president of Automotive Resources Asia, a Bangkok-based consultancy.
Honda, for example, announced in October that it was investing more than
Dollars 100m in a new plant that would double its capacity in Thailand and
could produce a popular small car for Asian markets. Toyota has set aside
more than Dollars 500m for expansion in Thailand.
Japanese brand names account for more than 90 per cent of vehicles sold in
Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. But US carmakers want to use their
new-found confidence and profits to invest in a region they abandoned to
their Japanese rivals 20 years ago.
Ford, which closed its assembly line in Thailand in 1976, is considering
producing pick-ups in the country in association with Mazda; Thailand is the
world's second-largest market for pick-ups after the US.
Thailand's regional pre-eminence as a car market is partly a function of its
size and wealth. The population of 60m is large enough to create a viable
domestic market, and with an average annual income per head of over Dollars
2,000, more and more Thais are rich enough to buy cars or pick-ups.
Another reason is that since 1991 Thailand has liberalised the motor trade.
It has cut import tariffs and encouraged new foreign investment, especially
in the components sector, in an attempt to make itself a regional automotive
centre.
Indonesia and Malaysia, on the other hand, maintain high protective barriers
around their domestic markets. Malaysia, which protects its
Mitsubishi-derived Proton cars because of what Mr Dunne calls 'romantic
nationalism', limits imported cars by quota; Indonesia has lifted an import
ban but applies tariffs of up to 275 per cent.
'Relatively speaking, Thailand is way ahead of its neighbours in terms of
opening up the market,' says Mr Dunne. 'Thailand's component industry is
five years ahead of the others.'
Even Thailand, however, is likely to remain a well-protected car market for
several years. Although it is the largest vehicle market in south-east Asia,
the country does not have the economies of scale that are regarded as
necessary in Japan and the west; a dozen different assemblers accounted for
Thailand's total 1993 sales of 456,461 units.
'Japanese manufacturers and their Thai joint venture partners have a
formidable store of vested interests and carry tremendous influence in
policy-making circles,' noted a report last year on the Thai automotive
industry prepared for the country's Board of Investment. 'Liberalisation
policies directly threaten the comfortable operating environment they have
constructed over the past 20 years.'
US vehicle makers will find it hard to establish networks of Thai suppliers
to match the ones that now cater to Japanese companies and help them fulfil
local content rules, but the Thai authorities appear to be serious about
allowing new entrants to compete fairly.
When Chrysler wanted to assemble Jeep Cherokees in Thailand, it found that
the Cherokee was defined as a passenger vehicle subject to an excise tax of
36 per cent, while the equivalent Mitsubishi Pajero was treated as a pick-up
with zero excise. But in March this year the Thai government put both
vehicles into a new four-wheel-drive category with a 27 per cent excise, and
Chrysler is proceeding with its investment plans.
Even the comfortably protected Japanese assemblers and parts suppliers and
Thai component makers are starting to accept the inevitability of gradual
liberalisation and are trying to improve the prospects for regional trade in
automotive parts.
One way of doing this - especially for companies such as Toyota with a
strong presence throughout the region - is to use the 'brand-to-brand
complementation' scheme embracing Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines.
The scheme, which has worked only fitfully so far despite the best efforts
of the Japanese beneficiaries, gives companies rewards in the form of tax
benefits and allows them to enjoy economies of scale by centralising
production of different components in different countries instead of
producing small volumes in each market.
Thai exports of vehicle parts continue to rise steadily. In 1991 such
exports were worth Bt3.7bn; last year the amount was Bt13.2bn (Dollars 528m)
 -and that has already been exceeded in the first seven months this year.
A pattern is emerging of a small but growing trade in vehicles and parts,
both within south-east Asia and with industrialised countries, particularly
Japan. Thailand is likely to be one of the main beneficiaries.

Rum producers have rejected an EU plan to maintain import quotas on dark
(traditional) rum until the year 2001 while abolishing the quota on light
rum from 1996. The producers, most of whom are in the Caribbean, want all EU
import quotas on rum abolished by January to end shortages of the spirit in
Europe.
Maintaining the dark rum quota was requested by the French government, which
has consistently objected to any increase in rum imports fearing damage to
the rum industry in its overseas territories, mainly Martinique, Guadeloupe
and Reunion. Caribbean producers view this as a setback to their efforts to
increase sales in Europe beyond their current annual quota of 240,000
hectolitres.
The European Commission had earlier proposed a quota of 20,000 hectolitres
per year on rhum agricole which is made from sugar cane juice and produced
mainly in the French overseas territories. 'While being opposed to any
quota, the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers' Association would have no
objection to such a quota on rhum agricole if it is deemed necessary for the
French departments,' said the Caribbean producers.
Traditional rum, however, is made from sugar cane molasses, not juice, and
is an important part of rum exports to the EU. 'To suggest that a quota
should be maintained on this type of rum is entirely contrary to the spirit
of the overall abolition of the quota system and would seriously damage
existing markets for traditional rum in Europe,' the association said.
The row is the latest between rum producers and the EU over access to the
market. The producers have claimed for the past two years that the EU has
not done enough to prevent a shortage of the spirit in Europe by increasing
the rum import quota and then abolishing it. The shortage is caused by the
EU failing to honour its obligation under the Lome Convention - the trade
and aid treaty between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries - to increase the quota in line with rising consumption.
According to the Caribbean producers, the quota for the current year (July
to June) will be exhausted by end of December. By October 7, there remained
152,817 hectolitres to complete the quota, with peak demand expected at
Christmas.
Producers fear that their markets in Europe, which they claim are highly
price-sensitive, will be destroyed by early quota shipments to satisfy
demand, to be followed by a shortage and then by high-priced product after
the imposition of customs duties for shipments not covered by the quota.
'The rum quota has now reached a level of chaos where it is destroying the
markets which the producers have painstakingly built over the years,' the
association said.
Before the Lome Convention, there were no quotas, but rum was subject to
duty. With the first Lome agreement, France insisted on a quota for duty
free imports. As demand rose, rum producers twice requested an increase in
the quota. Neither was granted, mainly because of French pressure.
'The just, equitable and only solution is now to bring the quota abolition
date forward by one year to January 1, 1995. Any measure short of this will
inevitably contribute to the disarray of the Community rum markets,' said
the producers' association.

<TEXT>
The International Labour Organisation should pursue the possibility of
incorporating certain basic labour standards in international fair trade
rules, according to a secretariat paper for discussion by the ILO's
governing body next week.
The paper suggests incorporating some ILO conventions relating to trade
union rights and prohibition of forced labour in the rules of the new World
Trade Organisation. The ILO would judge whether violations had occurred,
leaving the WTO to take decisions on trade sanctions.
Trade liberalisation 'at the very least' calls for recognition of conditions
'enabling workers to negotiate freely, both individually and collectively,
their conditions of work', says the paper. However, it rejects the notion of
equalising levels of wages and social protection across countries. If
approved, the proposal may give new life to the currently stalled debate on
linking trade and labour rights, strongly backed by the US but bitterly
opposed by many developing countries.

<TEXT>
Ford, the US carmaker, is to invest Dollars 15m in a joint venture in China
to produce automotive electronic components, its third components venture in
China this year. The world's second largest vehicle maker hopes that the
components operations will open the way for it to begin assembling vehicles
in China in the near future.
'We are eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the
earliest opportunity,' Mr Frank Macher, Ford vice president and general
manager of the automotive components division said yesterday. Ford signed an
agreement yesterday with Shanghai Automation Instrumentation for the
production of a range of automotive electronic components to supply vehicle
makers both in China and in other Asian markets.
A new plant is to be built in Shanghai with production scheduled to begin in
June, 1986. Earlier this year Ford agreed joint ventures with Shanghai
Automotive Industry for the production of plastic automotive components -
output begins this month - and with Shanghai Yao Hua Glass Works for the
production of automotive safety glass, which has already begun operations.
Mr Macher said that a further venture to make climate control systems,
including air-conditioning, heating and ventilation, could be signed by the
end of the year. This would involve an investment of Dollars 20m-Dollars
30m.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Moscow claims Caspian energy deals veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow yesterday staked a public claim to participation in, or veto rights
over, all energy projects in all of the former Soviet republics apart from
the three Baltic States.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, said Russia was 'obliged' to
take part in all energy projects undertaken by the members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. His statement comes as the parliament of
Azerbaijan is preparing to ratify a treaty with a group of foreign oil
companies to exploit reserves in the Caspian Sea worth an estimated Dollars
7bn-Dollars 8bn.
His remarks appeared to support the argument made by the Russian foreign
ministry, among others, that the contract could not be approved in its
present form by Russia because of its effect on the ecology of the Caspian.
However, Mr Shafranik widened the objection by saying that there were three
reasons why the countries bordering the sea - the four former Soviet
republics of Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and Iran -
could not independently decide on the exploitation of their part of the
shelf.
In the first place, the sea's boundaries and navigation rights had not been
defined. Second, it constituted one ecosystem and required one international
organisation to take decisions on its exploitation. Third, all projects
developed by the former Soviet states relied upon an infrastructure and
experience built up, mainly by Russia, during the Soviet period.
Mr Shafranik said: 'The example of the Karachaganak field (the huge gas
deposit in Kazakhstan where the Russian Gasprom monopoly is insisting on a
15 per cent share in a deal being negotiated by British Gas and Agip) shows
that we come back to this point: we have to work jointly on this kind of
project . . . it's all connected to issues of pipelines and the use of
energy.'
The Russian oil company, Lukoil, has taken a 10 per cent share in the Azeri
project - though that has not prevented the Russian foreign ministry from
voicing loud objections to its continuation.
Russia can put strong pressure on Azerbaijan - through its control of
pipelines, its influence over Azerbaijan's foe, Armenia, and access to its
markets. But the foreign consortium, which is now investigating a range of
options for a pipeline to carry the oil out of the area, believes Russia
will come round to accepting the deal because of the benefits which will
flow to Lukoil.
Mr Shafranik said the domestic price of Russian oil, which has hovered
between Rbs72,000 and Rbs76,000 a tonne (about Dollars 26 on present
exchange rates) was 28 per cent of the world price - down from 40 per cent
last year. He said it would probably rise to Rbs80,000 in December.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Russians seek imported goods at any price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing wealth of Russia's new rich and its burgeoning bourgeoisie has
made it a mecca for exporters of consumer goods - from Cherokee Jeeps
selling at around Dollars 60,000 (three times the US price) to packets of
cornflakes selling at Dollars 3.50 (double the average western price).
Foreign consumer goods now make up the bulk of Russia's imports because of
four factors: the liberalisation of trade from 1992; the explosive growth of
private trading companies; the increase in medium and high salaries; and
'the continuing crisis' in Russia's consumer goods industry. The trend is
particularly marked in Moscow and St Petersburg.
In these two cities, imports make up a huge 70 per cent of consumers'
purchases of food, according to a report* by the Russian company, Business
Analytica. In Moscow alone there are now some 6,500 trading companies, while
individuals can enrich themselves by becoming 'shuttles' - people who make a
living bringing in consumer goods in their personal luggage from abroad.
The 'shuttle' business is in fact a whole industry operating outside the
framework of normal foreign trade turnover, the reports says.
The 'shuttles' bring no profit to the national budget and until recently
were virtually beyond the scope of customs statistics. Their operations have
no legal provisions whatsoever. The prices fixed by the 'shuttles' are not
liable to national taxes, enabling them to undercut the prices of the
official importers.
Records of customs clearance of air travellers from Turkey and the United
Arab Emirates, the report says, showed that 3 per cent of the passengers
brought in as many goods as the remaining 97 per cent. The 'shuttle'
business involves bringing in up to 70 per cent of imported clothing; most
cheap jewellery; about half of all leather articles; and up to 30 per cent
of audio and video equipment.
The report says that consumer goods accounted for 70 per cent of total
imports last year - estimated at Dollars 26.9bn (Pounds 16.4bn), Dollars
10bn down from 1992 - and remain at roughly the same level this year. This
tendency will grow, the report says, because of the growth of real incomes,
up 80 per cent over the past three years.
Imports of foreign cigarettes have all but wiped out the local cigarette
industry, except for those plants which have concluded joint ventures with
western manufacturers. Imports now account for 90 per cent of all cigarettes
smoked. However, increased customs duties imposed in July are curbing the
sales growth of some consumer goods.
Food, for example, attracts duties of between 10-25 per cent of its customs
value. These import duties were aimed at protecting the domestic market.
However, according to the report, it is only when the price gap widens to 50
per cent between imported and domestically-produced foodstuffs that
consumers begin switching heavily to the latter.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Basque steel plant's retreat raises fears: A new threat not
linked to terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheaper energy in France has prompted a leading steel company in Spain's
Basque country to cross the frontier and invest Pta11.2bn (Pounds 55m) in a
new plant in Bayonne.
The decision by the family-owned Marcial Ucn group, which makes rods and
long bars for the construction industry, adds a new dimension to Spanish
fears about falling competitiveness. These concerns were fuelled earlier
this year by the relocation plans of the loss-making Spanish subsidiaries of
Gillette, the US consumer products multinational, and of Suzuki, the
Japanese vehicle maker.
The move also has political overtones for the Basque government, led by the
local nationalist party. Yesterday, it accused the Madrid authorities of
forcing companies out of the area by failing to frame a coherent industrial
policy.
The Bayonne plant, one of the largest single production investments for many
years by a Spanish private company, will produce 900,000 tonnes of crude
steel a year. This may prove troublesome to the Spanish government, which is
planning to build a mini-mill of roughly similar capacity in the Basque port
city of Bilbao, an hour's drive away.
'This is a very serious development because we are losing business instead
of attracting it,' said Professor Ignacio Marco of Deusto University, the
Bilbao business school, and former chairman of the Basque Energy Board. 'It
is a very big investment by a leading local company that has always been
closely identified with the Basque steel industry.'
But Mr Enrique Portocarrero, an executive of the Circulo de Empresarios
Vascos, a Basque employers' association, said the investment was more a
psychological than an economic blow. 'I doubt we are going to see a flight
of Basque industry to the other side of the Pyrenees,' he said.
Marcial Ucn opted for Bayonne despite strong pressure from local
authorities. The latter were willing to subsidise up to 30 per cent of the
investment if the plant remained in the Spanish Basque province of
Guipuzcoa, alongside the French border, where the company has its
headquarters and where four of its seven Spanish plants are located.
The steel manufacturer said the attraction of Bayonne lay in the fact that
electricity in France costs 20 per cent less than in Spain - mini-mills melt
scrap metal with huge charges of electricity. French scrap metal was also
cheaper and Bayonne had offered it a site near the harbour. It will begin
building the plant in 1996 in a venture with the Japanese Mitsui group,
which will provide 25 per cent of the money.
In order to soften the impact, however, Marcial Ucn said it would also
invest Pta4bn in its Guipuzcoa plants to increase productivity and maintain
the 850-strong labour force.
Spain's high electricity prices have been consistently criticised by
manufacturers based in the frontier zones of the Basque country and
Catalonia which are barred from hooking up directly to the French grid by
the government's monopoly over the import of France's nuclear-based energy.
The competitive disadvantage became a serious issue in the recent Basque
elections when the local nationalist party criticised Madrid.
Prof Marco says: 'We are being made to compete with Europe and we are
strapped by high inputs at every stage, from electricity tariffs to harbour
fees, and from high interest rates to labour costs.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Yeltsin recalls elder statesman of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday named Professor Yevgeny Yasin,
the elder statesman of Russian reform, as the new economics minister.
As he did so, Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank, declared after
meeting most leading members of the administration: 'I don't think there is
any change in the reform effort.' He was referring to the hectic and
contradictory shifts in the cabinet over the past few days - which are set
to continue.
Prof Yasin will work under Mr Anatoly Chubais, new first deputy prime
minister for the economy and finance. Prof Yasin has in the past five years
lost the talents of the young economists who formed the first wave of
reformers while keeping open his lines of communication with successive
governments, industrialists and latterly Mr Yeltsin, to whom he was an
adviser
He takes one of the two posts vacated by Mr Alexander Shokhin, who resigned
as deputy prime minister and economics minister last Friday in protest
against lack of consultations over the naming of a new finance minister.
Though Prof Yasin is generally admired for his openness of mind to reformist
ideas and his ability to steer clear of the backroom brawls, which
characterise much of Russian political life, he has acquired that reputation
by sticking to analysis and academic work and is not expected to emerge as a
political heavyweight. However, his appointment at the economics ministry,
heading a generally reformist team, will support Mr Chubais in his efforts
to open up the securities market and complete the second stage of
privatisation.
Mr Preston underscored his optimistic assessment by saying that Mr Vladimir
Panskov, the new finance minister, told him he supported the tough budget
strategy adopted by the cabinet - after expressing only lukewarm support
immediately after his appointment.
The budget strategy, which calls for massive support from the international
financial institutions to bring inflation down to 1 per cent a month by the
end of next year, will soon be sent to the state Duma (lower house) for a
difficult ratification process.
However, asked if he thought President Yeltsin fully supported the budget,
Mr Preston replied: 'The prime minister and the deputy premier (Mr Chubais)
reaffirmed their strong support. I had no chance to visit with President
Yeltsin and the issue did not come up.'
Mr Yeltsin's moves in naming both conservative and reformist figures to his
cabinet over the past two weeks are expected to continue - with question
marks remaining over three ministers who are strongly opposed by an apparent
majority in the Duma. These are General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister
who is due to address the Duma on Friday, General Victor Yerin, the interior
minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. The two generals are
thought to be particularly vulnerable.

US officials in Poland for talks on Nato expansion yesterday backed Mr Piotr
Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister, who is under strong pressure from
President Lech Walesa to resign. Mr Joseph Kruzel, US deputy assistant
defence secretary, said that Poland 'was fortunate to have dedicated public
servants such as Mr Kolodziejczyk' and he reiterated that Nato membership
was impossible for a country without civilian control over the military.
President Walesa has sided with army generals who blame Mr Kolodziejczyk for
failing to wrest sufficient funds out of the government and want one of
their number to replace him. The drive is seen as a severe weakening of
civilian control over the military.
Mr Kruzel said discussions with the central European countries about Nato
membership would start next year.

The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal yesterday ended its first public sitting by
making a formal request to Germany for the extradition of an alleged Bosnian
Serb war criminal being held in Munich. Germany has already said it is
willing to hand over Mr Dusan Tadic to the United Nations tribunal, but it
must first amend its laws to allow extradition to an international body. Mr
Tadic, who was arrested on a visit to Germany in February, has denied that
he was responsible for the killing of three Moslem prisoners in Serb-held
Bosnia. If extradited, Mr Tadic is likely to stand trial early next year in
what would be the first international war crimes trial to take place since
the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials began in 1945.
The case against Mr Tadic underlines the tribunal's dependence on the
co-operation of national governments and its inability to apprehend war
criminals while fighting continues in the territory of former Yugoslavia. On
Monday night, the tribunal's prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Mr
Dragan Nikolic, commander of the Susica camp in the Bosnian city of
Vlasenica, on charges of murder, torture and mutilation of Moslem prisoners.
However, Mr Nikolic is believed to be in a Serb-held part of Bosnia, and
chances of his arrest and extradition are considered to be slight.

Talks between the three German parties hoping to form the next government
are due to end on Friday, Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said yesterday.
At the same time, the CDU, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sister
party, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, expect
to elect the chancellor on November 15. A cabinet is expected to be chosen
within the next 10 days. Unlike previous coalition negotiations which lasted
several weeks, these talks, which have drawn up a rough policy agenda for
the next parliament, have tended to highlight similarities rather than
differences. The main differences, many of which were narrowed if not
resolved yesterday, have focused on taxation. One disruptive issue -
increased powers for police to introduce bugging in homes - has been deleted
from the agenda, while greater access to citizenship for the 6.8m foreigners
in Germany will be discussed on Friday. During yesterday's session, Mr
Hintze said a controversial 'solidarity' income tax surcharge of 7.5 per
cent would be decreased if the annual financial transfers to the five
eastern states were gradually reduced.

FT  09 NOV 94 / France's centre-right split over Europe: Chirac criticised
over proposal for new referendum on monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile consensus of France's ruling centre-right coalition on European
policy yesterday appeared to be fracturing fast under opposing pressures
from Mr Jacques Chirac, the newly declared Gaullist contender for the
presidency, and German Christian Democrats.
Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, justice minister and president of the CDS, which is
the coalition's most pro-European element, yesterday said he 'greatly
regretted' Mr Chirac's call two days ago for France to put its eventual
participation in any European monetary union to a second referendum, in
addition to the 1992 plebiscite that narrowly approved the Maastricht
treaty.
Another prominent French centrist, Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the
National Assembly's finance committee, said the referendum call might serve
Mr Chirac well in the first round of voting in the presidential election,
but would prevent him winning the final run-off vote.
In suggesting another referendum on economic and monetary union (Emu), Mr
Chirac is plainly paying his dues to anti-Maastricht politicians such as Mr
Philippe Seguin, National Assembly president, who are backing his Elysee
bid, in the hope of gaining the quick boost he desperately needs in the
opinion polls to rival prime minister Edouard Balladur.
But his tactic could backfire by increasing the chances that Mr Jacques
Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, might enter the
presidential race as the Socialist challenger in order to keep a Eurosceptic
out of the Elysee. The opinion polls have consistently shown Mr Chirac not
only trailing Mr Balladur but also far more likely than the prime minister
to be beaten by Mr Delors in a two-candidate run-off.
In the time-honoured tradition of French would-be presidential candidates,
Mr Delors has just published his personal ruminations in the form of a
400-page book called 'The Unity of One Man'. In Brussels yesterday, the
Commission president insisted: 'This is not a (presidential) programme but a
book of reflections. If you're looking for a programme, don't buy the book.'
But the Socialist party is also looking for a candidate, and the country's
pundits are unanimous in seeing the new tome as paving the way for Mr Delors
to announce his candidacy after he leaves Brussels some time next January.
'Delors-for-president' committees are mushrooming daily now.
Meanwhile, Mr Karl Lamers, chief architect of the German Christian
Democrats' recent paper calling on France and the Benelux countries to join
Germany in a new 'hard core' to the European Union which would set the pace
for faster integration, was in Paris yesterday to press his case. He avoided
making direct criticism of Mr Chirac but said: 'We must do all we can not to
endanger putting Emu into effect at the earliest opportunity, in 1997.'
Mr Chirac had claimed a second referendum would give France the same right
to accept or reject Emu as the Bundestag already enjoyed in Germany. But the
Bundestag has already ratified the Maastricht Treaty and Mr Lamers recalled
that the Bundestag now merely had the power to express its views on whether
individual countries fulfil the technical economic criteria for Emu, not on
the principle of Emu itself. 'It is therefore not a second ratification,' Mr
Lamers said.
Mr Balladur's officials regard the Chirac referendum call as impractical and
unconstitutional, though the prime minister himself has refrained this week
from commenting. But the Lamers plan opens up a further division in the
government.
While his centrist coalition partners generally favour the idea of France
joining Germany and Benelux in declaring themselves to be Europe's hard core
implementing all Maastricht's policies, Mr Balladur has criticised this as
too rigid. Instead, he sees European integration taking the form of several
'inner circle' arrangements, bringing, for instance, Britain in on defence
but respecting its wish to stay out of monetary union.
France's highest appeal court yesterday refused to throw out charges against
Socialist party leader Henri Emmanuelli, clearing the way for his trial next
year for alleged illegal party financing, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr
Emmanuelli has repeatedly denied charges he was an accomplice in
influence-peddling when he was party treasurer from 1988 to 1992. He is not
suspected of personal enrichment but is accused of receiving funds raised by
front companies from construction businesses seeking preference in public
tenders when the Socialists were in power.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Delay puts Greek telecoms flotation at risk: The latest
hitch in efforts to sell part of the OTE monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always going to be difficult for Greece's Socialist government to
push through the flotation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, given the
strength of trade union opposition even to partial privatisation.
Yesterday's decision to postpone the flotation of 25 per cent of the
company, set for early December, marks a serious political setback for Mr
Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, who is leading the campaign to
modernise Greece's economy.
He hoped to raise at least Dr320bn (Pounds 846m) from the offering, which
would go towards reducing Greece's huge public debt, which amounts to more
than 110 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Papantoniou's underlying fear is that last year's failure to float OTE
may be repeated, with possibly calamitous results. The conservative
government collapsed a year ago following defections by parliamentary
deputies opposed to the planned sale of 49 per cent of the company.
The latest postponement came one day after parliament finally approved
legislation to permit the sale, restructure the company and increase tariffs
for domestic calls. The bill permitting all of this had already had a stormy
passage through parliament, with 12 deputies from the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (Pasok), mainly ex-trade union leaders, abstaining or
voting against it.
Although Mr Papantoniou insisted the flotation would go ahead early next
year, its future must now be in doubt. Parliament is due to vote for a new
president next April and the governing Socialists will be keen to avoid a
fresh confrontation over OTE.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the country's ageing prime minister, had given his
backing to the economy ministry's plan to sell minority stakes in state
utilities and dispose of several state-controlled banks. But if, as
expected, he runs for the post of president of the parliament as a prelude
to retiring from politics, the privatisation programme is likely to be
placed on hold.
Potential foreign investors in OTE will be worried by the divisions within
Pasok over the company's future. The climate of political uncertainty over
the flotation has been poisoned anyway by recent threats from opposition
conservatives in parliament to take legal action against government
officials if the offering price is too low.
'The row in parliament shows just how contentious this flotation could
become. It's obviously going to have a downward impact on pricing,' one
analyst said.
The government was planning to sell 18 per cent of the company to
institutions in Europe, the US and Japan through a bookbuilding procedure,
and the remaining seven per cent to domestic investors. Greek television and
newspapers have already started advertising the issue and road shows for the
offering were due to begin next week.
However, underwriters are concerned about last minute changes in the terms
of the partial privatisation made after the parliamentary dispute erupted.
Although government officials stress that the restructured OTE will operate
like a private sector company, the unions have been promised that
redundancies will not be permitted.
Like other Greek utilities, OTE is stuffed with patronage appointees.
Trimming its 26,500-member staff is seen as crucial to improving
profitability.
The flotation's postponement also raises broader questions about the
Socialists' commitment to economic reform. Under the terms of Greece's
convergence programme, aimed at meeting the Maastricht targets for European
economic and monetary union, partial privatisations are projected to raise
Dr400bn in the next three years to offset debt.
After last year's failure to meet any convergence plan targets, confidence
remains low in Greece's ability to keep to the terms of a revised plan,
which was grudgingly approved by its EU partners in September.

West German seasonally adjusted unemployment fell again unexpectedly last
month by 23,000. Although more than 15,000 people left the jobless register
by signing on for government-sponsored job creation or training schemes, the
federal labour office said the jobs market was responding strongly to the
economic recovery. Almost 185,000 vacancies were registered during the
month. The western unadjusted total fell only slightly, leaving the jobless
rate unchanged on the month at 7.9 per cent. In the east, where adjusted
data are not yet available, the rate fell from 13.8 to 13.3 per cent,
reflecting a drop of 40,000 in numbers unemployed. However, a review from
the BHF bank said there were still no grounds for believing that the
continued recovery would lead to substantial cuts in the jobless total.
The Dutch visible trade surplus was around Fl 100m (Pounds 36m) in July,
sharply lower than a revised total of Fl 1.2bn in June, and Fl 1.5bn in July
1993.
Czech industrial output grew by 3 per cent in real terms in September
compared with the same month in 1993, but slowed from August's growth of 7.7
per cent.
Hungary's unemployment rate fell to 10.6 per cent in October from 10.9 in
September, and 12.6 per cent in October 1993.

Former Greek banking tycoon George Koskotas, central figure in a
multi-million dollar scandal which dragged down the country's Socialist
government in 1989, was sentenced yesterday to 25 years in prison for
embezzlement, Reuter reports from Athens. An Athens appeal court found him
guilty of embezzling millions from the Bank of Crete and forging bank
documents, court officials said. Seven other senior bank officials received
prison terms ranging from 10 to 16 years. A financial tycoon and press baron
during the 1981-1989 Socialist government, Mr Koskotas went on trial on
January 22, 1992, six days after a special court acquitted Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou of all charges in the case. The 13 judge court, set up by
parliament in 1989, convicted two former ministers of involvement in the
scandal. More than Dollars 200m is missing from the bank which came under
state control in 1988.

FT  09 NOV 94 / EU ministers refuse to abandon steel quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union industry ministers yesterday refused to back proposals from
the European Commission to abandon quotas on steel imports from Slovakia and
the Czech Republic.
The ministers were meeting in Brussels to discuss the commission's decision
to tear up its two-year rescue plan for the EU's steel industry after steel
companies failed to deliver capacity cuts essential for the successful
restructuring of the troubled sector.
Full abolition of the plan implies an end to quotas on steel imports from
the two east European countries from the beginning of next year. But
ministers from some member states were concerned about the impact of
increased east European imports and argued that the quotas should be
extended.
Yesterday the commission was backed by the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark
but opposition from other member states meant no decision was reached about
the quotas. This has been delayed until the new year when four new member
states - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - have joined the Union.
Mr Tim Eggar, UK industry minister, said he very much regretted the failure
to agree to end the quotas.
'It seems to me that one of the things which is giving the commission and
the whole of the EU a credibility problem is that when they reach agreements
they don't stick to them,' he said. 'I was disturbed by the attitude of a
number of my colleagues who were prepared to see the end of the plan but
wanted to keep the quotas in place.'
The lack of a decision on quotas raises questions as to whether the rescue
plan has been abandoned.
Ministers agreed to drop quarterly production guidelines and framework
agreements between the commission and the industry. But they also agreed to
maintain the social measures of the steel plan - designed to ease the
problems incurred with installation closures - for another year, even if
there were no proposals to increase the Ecu240m (Pounds 188.88m) originally
earmarked.
Furthermore, a number of delegations in Brussels yesterday said they
regretted that the commission had abandoned the plan, and the council of
ministers as a whole reaffirmed that it was 'very concerned at the
persistence of structural overcapacity, the main cause of the difficult
situation in which the European steel industry found itself'.
It added that notwithstanding the 'favourable' trends in the steel market,
'a lasting solution to the problem of overcapacity must be found'.
Ministers also discussed the future of Eko Stahl, former east Germany's
biggest steel mill. The commission has recommended that Eko Stahl should be
granted aid from the German government to permit the takeover by
Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium. However, the move has to be agreed unanimously
and yesterday the British asked for more details on the level and type of
German subsidy.
In addition, the French said they were not ready to reach a decision and a
vote was delayed. The French are understood to be using delaying tactics
over Eko Stahl in order to win concessions on French shipyards, threatened
with extinction if subsidies are withdrawn under an international agreement.
In spite of this, Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for
competition, yesterday said he was confident an agreement on Eko Stahl would
soon be reached.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Heavy fees charged as 'secret' papers are disclosed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government departments and quangos are charging large fees for information
which they must disclose under openness guidelines based on the Citizen's
Charter, a survey has found.
Some departments are charging hundreds of pounds for previously secret
information which became available under the Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information, introduced in April. The sums are usually based on
the costs of staff doing the research, and can be as high as Pounds 45 an
hour.
'What we have found is extraordinary differences between departments'
arrangements, showing how arbitrarily charges have been set,' said Mr
Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which
carried out the survey. 'Some of the charges will preserve Whitehall secrecy
as effectively as any Official Secrets Act.'
The most striking example in the survey is the National Rivers Authority,
which says that it may charge children and students who request information
for their full-time studies if it takes one member of staff more than half
an hour to undertake the necessary research.
The Ministry of Defence in effect rules out providing information which is
more expensive than Pounds 200, 'since it would probably represent an
unreasonable diversion of manpower from defence activities'.
The survey found that three government departments - the Foreign Office,
agriculture ministry and Inland Revenue - charge for all requests which
involve staff in extra work. Two - the Home Office and the Department of
Health - waive charges for requests which take less than an hour, and charge
Pounds 20 an hour for others.
Charges varied widely. The departments of Transport and Social Security only
charge for information if more than four hours' work is required, with fees
based on the average salary cost of staff involved.
The cheapest departments appear to be the Lord Chancellor's Department, the
Public Records Office and parts of the Northern Ireland Office, all of which
allow five hours' work free. The Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office
waive the first Pounds 100 of any charges.
The Office of Public Service and Science yesterday defended the charges and
said anyone dissatisfied should complain to the parliamentary ombudsman.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Clarke unveils Whitehall drive for private funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday unveiled plans to bring private
finance into the heart of government by forcing Whitehall departments to
seek outside funding for all capital spending.
In a clear attempt to combat rightwing claims that the government has run
out of steam, Mr Clarke told the Confederation of British Industry
conference in Birmingham that private finance would be 'the main source of
growth' for public investment projects.
However, his attempt to demonstrate a firm grip on public spending was
undermined by the failure of a special 3 1/2 -hour cabinet meeting to agree
to his plans for a cut of more than Pounds 4bn in next year's Pounds 263bn
expenditure control total.
As the cabinet struggled with the details, Mr John Major was forced into a
highly unusual postponement of his weekly audience of the Queen. 'He has
been delayed,' Buckingham Palace said. 'As and when he is finished, he will
come up here.' Downing Street said ministers had had a 'very productive'
debate on the package, which calls for cuts in the transport, social
security and higher education budgets.
Ministers said that a handful of outstanding details - thought to centre on
cuts in the Pounds 8bn housing benefit budget - were expected to be agreed
at a second cabinet meeting tomorrow.
Mr Clarke's attempt to pump fresh life into the flagging public finance
initiative, launched in 1992 by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, was
given a mixed reception by industrialists.
The plan was welcomed by Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general, and Mr
Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac and the construction industry's
representative on the Treasury's private finance panel.
But Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman of Vickers, the engineering group, said the
initiative would be handicapped unless the Treasury relaxed stringent
regulations designed to ensure the taxpayer received value for money.
Mr Clarke said the requirement for an investigation of the viability of
private finance for capital projects would concentrate 'finite public
capital provision on those areas where, for whatever reason, private finance
is not possible'.
He published a note setting out progress on the private finance initiative
by 12 government departments, showing that Pounds 500m of private capital
will have been employed by the end of 1994-95.
'Much more is on the way,' he said. 'There are to be privately financed
prisons, the new Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds is under construction,
there will be hundreds of millions of pounds of water and sewerage projects
in Scotland and Northern Ireland.'
Other projects worth more than Pounds 100m are under way in the health
service.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, dismissed the chancellor's
initiative as 'little more than another wish list'.

French police launched a crackdown on suspected Islamic militants yesterday,
seizing a cache of firearms and detaining more than 90 people, including

FT  09 NOV 94 / Italy to provide initial Pounds 1bn aid for flood-hit north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government declared a state of emergency in the north yesterday
and set aside L3,000bn (Pounds 1.18bn) in immediate aid to areas hit by the
country's worst floods this century.
The moves were intended to head off criticism of the authorities' slow
response to the floods that have led to the loss of at least 60 lives, left
more than 5,000 homeless and caused damage conservatively estimated at
L10,000bn.
Friday has been declared a day of national mourning.
The aid funds were agreed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting, and are only
an initial response. The government is expected to cover the costs in full
because few companies or individuals have adequate insurance.
The disaster comes as the 1995 budget targets have been undermined by higher
interest rates on Italy's debt, while trade unions want proposed public
spending cuts on pensions to be eased. The unions yesterday declined to call
off a demonstration in Rome on Saturday against the cuts.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, has consistently opposed an
increase in taxes, but last night his coalition partners suggested that the
flood damage costs be covered through a special tax. The government has also
asked the European Union for financial help.
Opposition politicians hinted that they would mount further attacks on the
government's plans to introduce a pardon on building carried out without
proper permits. The pardon, a key source of revenue for 1995, is seen as
condoning widespread abuse of town and country planning regulations - abuse
which has contributed to the flooding problems.
The worst-affected areas are in Piedmont, where flooding has damaged
industrial plant, agricultural crops and livestock as well as the region's
infrastructure. A meeting of all the main agricultural organisations in
Piedmont yesterday estimated damage at L1,350bn.
However, the local association of small farmers said total damage could be
more than L3,000bn with the loss of autumn seed, land that could not be
planted until 1996 and the effect of flooding over 400,000ha.
The floods, caused by torrential rain on Friday and Saturday, were beginning
to recede yesterday. Many areas of Piedmont and parts of inland Liguria
lacked proper water supplies and electricity. About 5,000 police, fire
fighters and civil defence personnel and 7,000 volunteers were working in
the disaster zone. The death toll is still expected to rise, with more than
25 still missing.
Andrew Jack adds from Paris: French insurers yesterday said the total cost
of the floods in the south of the country at the end of last week could
exceed FFr500m (Pounds 59.5m).
Five people were reported to have died, four in Lozere and one in Corsica.
Another person was still reported missing in Aveyron after the flooding.

FT  09 NOV 94 / All quiet on White House front as US votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was a glorious autumn morning in Washington yesterday and the White House
seemed preternaturally calm in advance of the evening's mid-term election
storm.
Most visible inside the gates was a gaggle of Finnish journalists, there
because President Martti Ahtisaari was somewhere inside. They did not seem
to have many opinions on the day's voting for all 435 seats in the House of
representatives, 35 of the 100 Senate seats and 36 gubernatorial races.
Outside were four police cars, three motorcycles and the occasional
uniformed gentleman - minimal visible protection for a building which had 27
bullets pumped into it two Saturdays ago by a furniture upholsterer from
Colorado Springs.
Across Pennsylvania Avenue in Lafayette Park, the handful of little groups
bearing home-made placards was there as always. Several seemed to be living
rough, including Concepcion and W. Thomas whose sign proudly announced that
they were in the 14th year of their 'peace vigil'. But a closer reading did
not reveal they wanted an end to political wars of the sort just witnessed
in the mid-term election campaign.
Another sign said, cryptically: 'All decisions should be made with the
Seventh Generation in mind.' This may refer politically to the 18-year-olds
who were voting for the first time yesterday; on the other hand it may not.
The FT was over at the president's house for a session on politics with what
we discreetly call 'a White House official'. But it was postponed because Mr
Leon Panetta, the chief of staff, had called a meeting - presumably to work
out the line to be taken with the media as the night's results - with
Democratic losses likely to loom large - unfolded.
President Bill Clinton was up early, as usual, on the telephone to half a
dozen radio stations. He again said he was willing to work with a Republican
congressional majority if the worst push came to shove and if the opposition
proved reasonable, which he doubted. Naturally he suggested political
paralysis could be avoided by voting for Democratic candidates.
Senator Phil Gramm, the Republican from Texas, was also up early as the
opposition's designated hitter to respond to the president. His distinctive
chainsaw howl sounded on the verge of breaking more than Democratic dead
wood as he predicted 11 party gains in the Senate, including a few not
generally foreseen, and early passage of a balanced budget amendment.
Sizeable lines were reported in Washington and suburban polling stations,
tentative evidence that the most negative campaign in years had not turned
everybody off, unless they were all spoiling their ballot papers in
retaliation. But if turnout is much over one in three eligible voters it
will confound recent history.

FT  08 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Automagic rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 9th November 1994) appended to this article.
Despite 'difficult trading conditions', pre-tax profits of Automagic
Holdings, the USM-quoted shoe repairing and key cutting group, almost
doubled from Pounds 122,000 to Pounds 243,000 in the year to June 25.
The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 1.16m to Pounds 1.12m.
Earnings came out at 2.4p (2p).
Trading during the hot summer months had not been easy, directors said, and
the difficulties had been exacerbated by the signal workers' strikes.
CORRECTION
Turnover at Automagic in the year to June 25 fell from Pounds 11.6m to
Pounds 11.2m. The figures were wrongly reported in yesterday's FT.

<TEXT>
Mr Brian Loton, chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary, and other directors of
the large Australian resources group, were yesterday alleged to have had
some knowledge of sham foreign exchange transactions in the late 1980s
involving Elders IXL, the brewing and agriproducts company now known as
Foster's Brewing Group. The allegation was contained in a statement tendered
to the Melbourne Magistrates Court by Mr Ken Jarrett, a former Elders
executive, during a long-running committal hearing which has followed the
filing of conspiracy and theft charges against Mr John Elliott, former
Elders chief, and other one-time Elders executives. Mr Jarrett agreed to
give evidence against his former boss earlier this year. He has already
received a six-month jail sentence after agreeing to co-operate.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Rakhmonov to become first Tajikistan president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSHANBE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Imamali Rakhmonov, Tajikistan's parliamentary chairman and acting head of
state, won the central Asian republic's first presidential election, taking
60 per cent of the vote, according to official preliminary results announced
yesterday, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. His opponent, Mr Abdumalik
Abdulajanov, a former prime minister and at present Tajikistan's ambassador
to Moscow, won 35 per cent in Sunday's contest.
'Despite pessimistic forecasts, the referendum for a new constitution and
election took place,' Mr Kadriddin Giosov, commission chairman, said. 'We
did our best to ensure the election was free and democratic.' Another
official said more than 90 per cent of the 2.6m electorate had voted for a
new constitution which among other things creates a presidential system.
Mr Abdulajanov's team alleged on Sunday there had been cases of ballot boxes
being fraudulently stuffed with votes for Mr Rakhmonov, and that some other
votes had been tampered with. The electoral commission and observers from
the Commonwealth of Independent States said they had seen no human rights
abuses during the vote.
'My opinion. . . is that from the legal point of view, the election went
well,' said Mr Artur Zurimbovsky of the CIS secretariat. The Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and the UN declined to send
monitors. Diplomats said the CSCE was concerned that the government's real
opposition, an alliance of Islamic groups and liberals, did not take part in
the election.
Many opposition leaders are in exile in Afghanistan, from where their
fighters have launched cross-border raids since losing a civil war in late
1992. Some analysts said that, given the opposition boycott, the election
would not help resolve deep problems in Tajikistan, where clan loyalty is
seen as more important than ideology. 'They have the same guy (again) and I
have my doubts that the opposition will accept this,' one diplomat said
yesterday.
Mr Rakhmonov, a former state farm director, comes from the southern-based
Kulyabi clan, which was at the leading edge of the battle to oust the
rebels. Mr Abdulajanov, from the industrialised north, was seen by many
diplomats and analysts as better placed to deal with the exiled opposition.
He served as premier in an opposition-led government but kept his post under
the new administration.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Brazil warns Rhone-Poulenc on toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian authorities are threatening to restart legal action against
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical company, unless an agreement is reached
over the decontamination of toxic waste deposits.
The public prosecutor in Cubatao, Sao Paulo state, alleges that Rhodia, the
company's Brazilian subsidiary, dumped 10-12 tons of toxic residues along a
100 km stretch of road near the port of Santos between 1966 and 1984.
He also claims that the company put workers at risk by exposing them to
residues at its Cubatao solvents plant, closed down by a court order in June
1993. The order was requested by the prosecutor because of fears about
workers' safety. The factory remains out of service and there has been no
appeal by the company.
Mr Geraldo Rangel, the prosecutor, said among the substances dumped was
hexachlorobenzine (HCB), which he said was considered a 'dangerous residue'
by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr Lise Monteiro, Rhodia's environmental manager, accepted the company
dumped waste from 1976 to 1978 but says the practice was then stopped. He
denied that there had been any risk to workers' health from exposure to
residues at the plant.
The case has been under way for some time. In 1988, after pressure from the
state environmental agency, the company installed an incinerator to burn
contaminated earth that it had recovered from the deposits. Mr Monteiro said
90 per cent of the soil contaminated by HCB had been recovered and burned.
Rhodia said it acquired the plant in 1976 following a merger in France. A
shareholders list supplied by the public prosecutor indicates the plant was
controlled by Rhone-Poulenc from at least 1972.
The prosecutor's office suspended its action against Rhodia in February in
an attempt to reach an out-of-court settlement. Mr Rangel said this was
because a case could last five years.
The company, which had a turnover of Dollars 900m last year, has so far
spent Dollars 60m on decontamination measures. It has agreed to a request by
the prosecutor to pay for the medical examination and monitoring of 153
former plant workers who were found to have HCB levels of up to 16
microgrammes per decilitre of blood. Doctors consulted by the prosecutor's
office said more than 1 microgramme was dangerous.
Rhodia maintains the levels of HCB found in the workers' blood is not
dangerous. Mr Monteiro said the company carried out regular medical checks
of workers and no medical problems caused by the presence of HCB were found.
The two sides have not yet been able to reach an agreement on measures to be
adopted for decontamination.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia - Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the FT survey on Italian Industry and Technology, published on October
25, the article on the telecoms sector stated that 60 per cent of Telecom
Italia's investment was financed by debt, and 40 per cent from internal
resources. The company points out that those figures refer to the coverage
of capital invested as at December 31 1993, before the merger of state-owned
telecoms companies, and not to annual investment, which is financed entirely
from internal resources. In 1994, Telecom Italia expects capital expenditure
to be more than covered by cash-flow.
The annual turnover of the company in the 1993 pro forma profit and loss
account was approximately L27,000bn (Dollars 17.27bn) and not L2,700bn, as
incorrectly reported.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hartons may receive full offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartons Group said yesterday that discussions being held between two of its
main shareholders and a third party may result in a full offer being
launched for the distributor of semi-finished plastics.
If a deal were struck, at an intimated price of 8p per ordinary share and
60p per 7 per cent convertible cumulative redeemable preference share, the
purchaser would hold more than 30 per cent of the issued voting capital,

CRH, the Irish building materials group, has expanded into South America
with a Dollars 33m (Pounds 20m) investment in Canteras Cerro Negro, an
Argentinian tile maker.
The move is the first investment by CRH outside North America and Europe and
is part of its strategy of expanding in emerging markets.
CCN is privately owned and the principal shareholders are an Argentinian
family of Irish extraction, the Diaz O'Kellys. It makes clay roof, wall and
floor tiles and has 30 per cent of the Argentinian market.
CRH is paying Dollars 5.7m for a 20 per cent stake in CCN and has invested
another Dollars 27.3m in the form of a Dollars 9.3m convertible loan and
Dollars 18m in loan capital.
CRH can increase its stake to 51 per cent through conversion of the
convertible loan.
It also has an option to increase its shareholding to 95 per cent, based on
a multiple of CCN's pre tax profits over the next three years. The
Argentinian company last year made an operating profit of Dollars 8.8m on
sales of Dollars 66m.
The loans carry an interest rate of 16 per cent and the investment would be
earnings enhancing for CRH in the first year, said Mr Jack Hayes, managing
director for finance and development at CRH. 'It should be worth Dollars 3m
a year after tax,' he said.

ABB Power Generation and Pyropower Corporation of California have won a
Dollars 363m contract to modernise two 200MW generators at the Turow power
station in south-west Poland. The consortium also has the option to work on
four more generators at Turow. Most of the equipment for the first stage of
the project will be locally produced in plants like ABB Zamech bought by the
Swiss-Swedish engineering company in 1990 and Fakop in Sosnowiec, recently
bought by Pyropower.
Turow, which is fuelled with brown coal, is in the middle of the 'black
triangle', one of central Europe's most polluted areas, between Poland, the
Czech Republic and the former east Germany. The new generators and boilers
will reduce emissions to European Union standards and increase fuel
efficiency.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (35): It's hard to get a decent room quickly
 -India has become one of Asia's busiest tourist markets, but where are the
hotels?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in decades, Indian hoteliers were pleasantly surprised to
see room occupancies soar in the summer in spite of inhospitable
temperatures, writes Shiraz Sidhva.
Hotels in the main metropolitan centres have traditionally suffered room
gluts between April and August. This year they were so full that they
withdrew the usual off-season discounts and had to turn away some of their
regular clients.
'It's now virtually impossible to get a hotel room at short notice,' says Mr
Prateek Chawla, director, Outbound Travels, Delhi-based travel agent and
tour operators. 'For the business traveller, there is no off-season.'
The Indian hospitality industry is reaping the benefits of the government's
liberalisation programme, which has made India one of Asia's most attractive
emerging markets. The top hotel chains - the Taj group, ITC Hotels and the
Oberoi group - will invest nearly Rs30bn in new projects over the next five
years, concentrating for the first time, on building budget hotels rather
than five-star ones.
The current total of 52,000 rooms in fewer than 900 government-approved
hotels across the country is woefully inadequate to cater to an estimated 5m
tourist arrivals by 1997 (double last year's figure of 2.2m). The government
has therefore cleared 524 hotel projects (till March this year), or 28,000
additional rooms.
Industry watchers doubt that all the proposed investment will materialise,
but the tourism ministry has set an ambitious target to build 125,000 rooms
by the year 2000. Several international hotel chains are tying up with
Indian partners, taking advantage of the fact that the government now allows
foreigners up to 51 per cent equity in the hotel industry.
The US chain, Holiday Inns Worldwide, has tied up with Inn Realty (owned by
a group of non-resident Indians) to open Holiday Inns in the Himalayan
mountain resorts of Nainital and Manali, and four-star hotels in nine Indian
towns. The chain will spend more than Rs500m on its plan to build 70 hotels
across India in the next four years.
The Australian Southern Pacific Hotels Corporation, which seeks to 'create a
base' for its two primary brands, Parkroyal and Travelodge, has signed an
agreement with Hospitality Resorts, an Indian company, to manage its Penta
Goa Hotel, being rechristened the Regency Travelodge Resort. The group has
invested about Dollars 2m in Indian projects so far, and is building three
new hotels, in New Delhi, Madras and Bangalore.
Other hotel chains entering the Indian hotel industry include the Hong Kong
based Four Seasons, which has signed an agreement with the Bombay-based
Leela Group, the US-based Marriott, which may tie up with the Indian Shaw
Wallace group, and Radisson of the US, which has tied up with
Singapore-based Scotts Holding and two Indian partners to build and manage
at least 12 projects, including three-star inns.
'India has never built for tomorrow, always yesterday,' says Mr Rabindra
Seth of ITC Hotels, who has been part of the industry for over 30 years. He
points out that there are more hotel rooms in cities like Singapore, Hong
Kong, Bangkok, London and Toronto than there are in the whole of India, for
all its size and wealth of tourist attractions.
In New Delhi, the capital, no new hotel has been built since 1982, when more
than a dozen hotels were hurriedly constructed for the Asian Games, creating
a glut for years. 'If we are to cater to 5.5m tourists and business
travellers by the turn of the century, then we need at least twice as many
rooms as we are offering now.'
The unavailability and cost of land, particularly in the big cities, has
deterred new investors. Socialist governments in the past regarded luxury
hotels as 'necessary evils', and levied prohibitive taxes on them, making
hotels less viable than they could have been.
While expenditure tax has been halved to 10 per cent, land continues to be a
major deterrent. The current boom has spawned a whole new breed of
first-time hoteliers, many of whom are land developers, builders and
contractors.
Entrepreneurs such as Shaw Wallace, the large liquor group, and Mahindra and
Mahindra, the Bombay-based heavy engineering, tractor and automobile
manufacturers, have diversified into hotels thanks to their ability to
withstand the long gestation periods associated with this business.
'One of the main stumbling blocks in the hotel industry is the acquisition
of land,' says Mr Seth. 'Builders are best equipped to tackle that part of
the problem, and will often allow professional hotel companies to run the
hotels for them.'
Foreign investors are also joining non-resident Indians (NRIs) allowed to
buy land.
Mr Dadi Balsara, a Singapore-based NRI businessman has recently announced a
joint venture with Howard Johnson Franchise systems of the US, to build 10
three-star hotels, with plans to build, acquire and franchise more than 70
hotels in the next five years.
India's leading luxury hotel chains are also developing medium-sized hotels,
to fill the yawning gap between luxury five-stars and cheap hotels that lack
the most basic amenities.
East India Hotels, which owns the Oberoi chain will start 11 new hotels in
the deluxe, first class and budget categories, investing Rs4.75bn over the
next four years. The group recently started its mid-market Novotel and
Trident chains, and is exploring an even more affordable class of budget
hotels.
ITC Hotels, a subsidiary of the tobacco and paper group plans to invest
Rs7bn in the next six years, out of which Rs2bn will be earmarked for the
middle segment. The company, which owns and manages the Maurya Sheraton
hotel in New Delhi, has entered into a joint venture with MS Shoes, who
recently acquired land through a Rs640m bid to build a Rs1.6bn, 400-room
super-deluxe hotel in the capital. ITC will expand its Bombay and Madras
properties, and is keen to acquire land for a hotel in Calcutta, where its
parent company is headquartered.
The Taj group, which owns and manages more than 40 hotels, including the
legendary Taj Mahal hotel in Bombay, has the most ambitious expansion
programme in the country.
Mr Pankaj Baliga, the group's vice-president, sales and marketing, says it
will invest over Rs15bn on 50 new hotels, including 10 wildlife lodges near
game sanctuaries, and golf and beach resorts. 'We are very
environment-conscious,' says Mr Baliga, insisting that the Taj hotels will
take extra care not to disturb the environment.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (34): Bedroom farce or tragedy - Married
life is not what it used to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wealthy middle class, at the heart of India's emergence as one of Asia's
most promising markets, are finding it hard to reconcile the flashy images
on their television screens with the traditions and values they have
inherited.
As this group of an estimated 250m urban Indians is remorselessly targeted
by business houses for its purchasing power, it is undergoing dramatic
social changes, and marriage and the family are coming under increasing
scrutiny.
'Urban Indians are going through a phase like that the West experienced in
the 1970s,' says Ms Sheela Batra, a sociologist at Delhi University. 'Family
values are fast eroding and marriages are not longer sacrosanct as they used
to be, even 10 years ago.'
But look through the matrimonial classified ads in Delhi's two leading
newspapers on Sunday, and you would think that the more things change the
more they stay the same.
The Times of India and the Hindustan Times, those venerable papers locked in
price wars and circulation-boosting gimmicks, have changed the format of
their most-read pages, ostensibly because readers have limited time and
would prefer the paper to offer them brides and grooms made to order under
the desired heading.
Caste considerations may have receded in 'modern' urban India, but
traditional systems of segregation have given way to others in the new
market economy. Business women, bank officers, bureaucrats and non-resident
Indians all come neatly packaged under different headings.
Read the fine print, and you see a constant demand for husbands who are
engineers, chartered accountants, doctors, civil servants, employees of
foreign banks and multinationals, masters of business administration, those
with five-figure salaries.
They must also, of course, be handsome and, better still, non-smoking
tee-totallers from cultured families.
Those hunting the ideal woman frequently specify that beside being fair,
slim, beautiful, tall, sweet-tempered, well-mannered, sober and homely, she
should also be a convent-educated virgin]
Money is always a great leveller. A father who wants his
less-than-immaculate daughter to tie the knot merely has to say that he is
willing increase the dowry and the imperfection will be overlooked.
With increased consumerism come higher demands for dowry, and there are
'fixed rates' for grooms of different professions. Working women are now
more acceptable as potential brides than in the past.
'A working woman is like a goose who continues to lay golden eggs, and is
now a more attractive proposition than a woman who brings a one-time dowry,'
says Ms Madhu Jain, a senior editor with India Today, who writes on changes
in Indian society.
'As more women enter the workplace, marriages are undergoing strains not
experienced even 10 years ago,' says Sheela Dutta, a marriage counsellor.
'It's not as if the stress is confined to a new generation - some of my
clients have been married for over 20 years.' As age-old social structures
such as the joint family collapse, roles within the home are no longer
well-demarcated.
'Many couples have a problem resolving the power issue,' explains Dr Bindu
Prasad, clinical psychologist and family therapist. 'There are invariably
problems when the families of the husband and the wife don't match, or have
strong cultural differences. While building up a new unit comprising husband
and wife they have to work out a system separate from their families.'
Dr Prasad finds that a lot of problems stem from the fact that Indians are
over-attached to their parents. 'Women are asserting their individuality and
demanding more rights, while men are finding it hard to accept that their
wives are increasingly less like their mothers,' adds Dr Prasad.
Mr Anand Grover, a Bombay lawyer whose firm represents only women in divorce
cases, is more specific. 'Indian men are male chauvinist pigs. They have not
been able to accept that women are going to work or come to terms with the
new woman.'
He adds that divorce is no longer the dirty word it used to be even a decade
ago and that, although statistics are not easily available, divorce cases in
Indian courts have increased dramatically over the last decade.
The 'new Indian women' - and the new man - belong to the English-speaking
urban elite, and come to terms with divorce in much the same way as couples
in the West do.
Most marital breakdowns are terribly boring and have nothing specifically
Indian about them. But there are also local features such as the tragic
recent case of a young mother of three, who died of 100 per cent burns. The
police, writing off her death as an accident, said it was not their practice
to investigate the state of a dead woman's marriage where she had been
married for more than seven years.
She was an example of a woman caught in the web between tradition and
modernity. She was educated enough to leave her family in the countryside to
come to Delhi and live with the man she loved, but she missed the security
she felt an arranged marriage would have provided her.
She defied her mother-in-law and insisted that she and her husband have a
separate home. Even though her husband battered her, she felt obliged to
defend him.
Her death recalled the investigation carried out by women's rights groups,
and later the police, into a spate of cases in the early 1980s in which
wives died by fire in their homes.
Indian women who cannot afford to use gas, cook on kerosene stoves on the
floor, and sometimes their clothes catch fire or the stove explodes and they
die.
What emerged was that in several cases the fatal fires had been caused by
the women's husbands, (often with the help of the husband's families), who
thereby became free to marry again for another dowry. While there was no
suggestion that she had died in this way, there was no evidence that her
husband had tried to save her life.
'Ours was a love marriage,' she once told a friend. 'I made a mistake not
marrying the man my parents chose for me. This way I expected too much, and
that's why I got so little.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (33): Some places feel like Japan - Madhya
Pradesh is flexing its industrial muscles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his office, Honda's Mr H Masuda dispenses green tea. He wears a white
uniform, as does everyone else at this scooter manufacturing plant.
Compulsory morning exercises are followed by group production meetings. The
company union avoids strife and is unaffiliated to any umbrella labour
organisation.
Apart from the complexion of his fellow-workers, only two things belie the
fact that this could be Japan: the relative lack of automation in the
assembly process, and the handle on the colonial-style teacup.
Mr Masuda is on secondment as technical director of Kinetic Honda, 51 per
cent owned by the Japanese automotive group. Its factory is at Pithampur, an
industrial zone in the central state of Madhya Pradesh which lays claim to
be the Detroit of India.
The title is presumptuous, as no cars are produced there. But Hindustan
Motors has a plant for passenger vehicle engines, and Mitsubishi operates a
joint truck making venture. Officials say it and Volkswagen of Germany are
seeking land for possible car assembly.
Pithampur, near the commercial centre Indore, is one of two dozen growth
areas designated by the Madhya Pradesh government with the aim of promoting
industry in backward parts of the country's biggest state. Others include
Mandideep, on the outskirts of the capital Bhopal, from where Procter and
Gamble of the US supplies the Indian market with Ariel washing powder.
Progressive state governments in India are competing fiercely for new
investment, domestic and foreign, with packages of incentives and
concessions. In the case of Madhya Pradesh these offer a holiday from state
commercial taxes of up to seven years, and single-window clearance of
projects to expedite approvals.
Another main thing Madhya Pradesh can provide is a central location, with
road, rail and air arteries reaching each of the biggest cities in roughly
equal time. But its position (as the region's publicists would have it) 'at
the heart of India' is also a drawback: the state is landlocked.
Undaunted, the AVN, the industrial development corporation, is seeking to
buy waterfront land in Gujarat to the west in order to build a deep-water
jetty. This it believes would stimulate an edible oils industry in Madhya
Pradesh based around soyabeans, of which the state accounts for 80 per cent
of Indian production. Most output is sold as cattle feed.
Through similar interventions the state authorities have restored an air
service to centres abandoned by Delhi's government-owned Indian Airlines -
taking a stake in a private carrier with the requirement that it include
specified destinations - and built India's first toll road as an alternative
to the pitted national highway which serves Pithampur.
Poor roads and power shortages are, as elsewhere in India, the two handicaps
most frequently cited by businessmen. Export-oriented industries enjoy a
protected electricity supply and Mr S K Jain, president of Indo Rama
Synthetics, an Indonesian-controlled spinning mill which employs 1,850 in
Pithampur, says that 'in three years we have not shut down once because of a
power cut'.
But he adds that his parent company has chosen a site near Bombay in
Maharashtra state for its newest facility because of easier access to a
port.
A state industrial policy set out in May acknowledged that 'accelerating the
pace of development requires the expansion and strengthening of
infrastructure' and that this necessitated private sector involvement. To
this end, Bhopal's budgetary allocation for industry is planned to rise to 7
per cent from 4 per cent over the next two years.
In trying to close the gap with Maharashtra and Gujarat, its two main
rivals, the state's extra spending is intended to bring in private capital
rather than create public sector employment. If the government sets up
industrial projects on its own 'we are not going to be very efficient,' says
Mr M P Rajan, managing director of the AVN.
Uniquely, he couples this bureaucratic role with that of Madhya Pradesh
president of the private-sector Confederation of Indian Industry. 'No other
state would allow this,' he says. 'The government doesn't even mind if I
criticise their policies.' Ultimately he wants to shift majority control of
the AVN itself into private hands.
Madhya Pradesh has its share of state industries, some of relatively recent
origin, for which new roles need to be found.
There are, for example, no plans to privatise Optel, set up in 1989 as an
integrated maker of telephone cable, optical fibre and telecoms equipment,
but it is seeking joint ventures with Japanese industry majors.
The present Congress party government headed by Mr Digvijay Singh, chief
minister, came to power in elections last December after Delhi ended a
troublesome period of rule by the Hindu militant Bharatiya Janata party.
Unlike leaders of several other states, Mr Singh is still a full four years
from the next polling day and can shape economic policy without looming
electoral considerations.
While accepting that new private investment is likely to become increasingly
capital-intensive, he stressed in an interview that 'wherever government
comes in, we would rather have it labour-intensive'.
However, Mr Singh, a 47-year-old engineer, said he supported 'a massive dose
of privatisation in infrastructure' which would help the government maintain
social spending while increasing the proportion of the budget devoted to
industry.
Madhya Pradesh has lower literacy levels and higher poverty and infant
mortality rates than the Indian average. It also remains less urbanised. The
European Union is the main backer in a primary education programme for
deprived areas of the state which will be worth some Rs7bn over seven years,
the largest such scheme in India.
But another large scheme, from which multilateral donors have withdrawn
backing, threatens to cause unprecedented upheaval to rural communities.
The chief minister reaffirmed his government's commitment to the Narmada Dam
project which will flood vast tracts of the south of the state, saying only
that it was 'only hesitating on the issue of lowering the height' of the dam
wall. Such a reduction, he indicated, could reduce by at least a quarter the
100,000 people who would be uprooted while losing a rather smaller fraction
of the expected generation capacity for hydroelectric power. His figures are
not far out of line with those cited by local aid agencies, but they argue
that the greater clout of Gujarat and Maharashtra, which are to share in the
project while avoiding most of the resettlement problems, would mean that
their wishes were more likely to prevail. The World Bank pulled out after
campaigners highlighted social aspects of the project.
Narmada, if it is a disaster, is at least one the locals can see coming, and
one which was decided by their politicians. That was not the case nearly a
decade ago when a leak of poisonous gas from the US-controlled Union Carbide
factory in Bhopal killed thousands of mainly slum-dwellers and hardened
attitudes across India against multinationals. In September, amid a mass of
litigation, a takeover by domestic interests was finally agreed.
Social and environmental questions will also surround future foreign
involvement particularly in the energy and mining sector, where de Beers of
South Africa is poised to land diamond exploration rights over as much as
20,000 sq km in an eastern area of the state with a large tribal population.
The state has other minerals such as coal and iron ore, but these areas are
largely coterminous with forests. Perhaps conveniently, forestry and mining
fall under the same ministry in Bhopal.
The government is trying to close the state mining corporation, though
arranging the transfer of workers has been slow.
Long-term contracts to supply iron ore to Japan are being wound down as the
recession in that country has reduced demand for steel.
Demand for Kinetic Honda's scooters has brought large-scale export orders
from as far afield as Mexico and Turkey. As Mr Masudah and his local
colleagues sip their tea, Madhya Pradesh is trying to offer other foreign
investors a handle on India.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (32): Coca-Cola is back - Foreign brands
move in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAAZNEEN KARMALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign goods, once debarred by the government, are swamping Indian stores.
Liberal policies have attracted hordes of multinational companies to this
vast market. Though imports of consumer goods remain restricted, these
multinationals are banking on India's middle class of 200m people and their
fascination with Western products and foreign labels. Some companies have
discovered that the shortest route to reach potential consumers is to buy up
local competition.
Coca-Cola chose to enter India this way. In September 1993 it paid Dollars
40m for the trademarks of Parle Exports, a private company in Bombay.
Parle's 60 per cent market share in the Indian soft drinks industry could
have been a significant entry barrier. Instead, Coke became market leader
overnight by acquiring Parle's business of 60m cases annually.
Ironically, Parle owed its pre-eminent market position to Coca-Cola. In
1977, following the government's policy restricting foreign ownership of
companies to 40 per cent, Coca-Cola had shut down its Indian operations.
Coke's departure created a vacuum in the market that Mr Ramesh Chauhan of
Parle moved in to fill with his cola concoction branded Thums Up.
Since then, Mr Chauhan had defended his brands staunchly against
competition. Pepsico, which entered India four year ago, had to fight Mr
Chauhan every inch of the way to get to the number two position. Being a
shrewd businessman, Mr Chauhan negotiated with both Pepsi and Coke before
selling out to the highest bidder.
Mr Jaydev H. Raja, Coca-Cola India's president, says that 'India was one of
our last major frontiers. The question was always when, not if.'
Originally a resident of Bombay, Mr Raja joined Coca-Cola 15 years ago. He
was sent from Coke's headquarters in Atlanta to lead the comeback into
India. In 1992 the company announced a joint venture with a non-resident
Indian businessman. That plan was later abandoned in favour of a 100 per
cent subsidiary.
The government approved Coke's proposal in June 1993, allowing it to set up
a blending plant at Pune in the state of Maharashtra. Pepsi's project in
comparison, approved before the regulations were eased, was weighed down by
export commitments and other conditions.
Apart from brands, the Parle deal provided Coke instant access to an
existing infrastructure. Now 58 bottlers, all formerly with Parle, have
exclusive licensing arrangements with Coke. The bottlers have had to invest
in upgrading their production facilities and in new 'glass float' - 300 ml
refillable Georgia green glass bottles especially designed by Coke.
Carbonated drinks in India are sold not in cans but bottles, which, when
empty, are returned to the local bottling company.
Since its first launch a year ago in the northern city of Agra, Coke has
rapidly extended its presence to eight other cities.
Shortly after the Agra launch, crates of Coke found their way into the
'grey' market in Delhi where they were sold for a 100 per cent premium.
The curiosity of consumers to taste the real thing has ensured high initial
trial rates. By convincing bottlers to trade off an erosion in margins for
higher volumes, Coke offered a 300 ml bottle for Rs5 as against Pepsi's 250
ml serving priced at Rs5.50. Mr Raja says that this more-for-less pricing
strategy will drive sales forward in long term.
The biggest problem in this business is breakage and pilferage of bottles
which reduces the glass float with bottlers. Coke tackled this by
substituting Parle's shallow wooden crates with full depth, stackable
plastic crates which cover the bottles to the crown. Old rack body trucks
were replaced by a fleet of closed trucks that allow pallet loading. A fleet
of 6,000 pushcarts and tricycles mounted with bright red umbrellas are
taking Coke into congested city areas. These measures will make distribution
quicker and faster, says Mr Raja.
A year end stocktaking shows that Thums Up continues to be market leader in
the cola segment and Coke has sold an estimated 7.5m cases. Though
competitors have often accused Coke of buying Thums Up only to kill it, Mr
Raja says that Thums Up's unique spicy taste has its own following. Coke is
also planning to launch Fanta and Sprite shortly.
Pepsi has countered Coke energetically. It has installed 3,500 fountains in
major towns to increase its retail presence. It has offered price cuts,
special deals and free offers from time to time. Pepsi has also taken over
Dukes, a regional manufacturer in Western India, thereby boosting its market
share from 26 per cent to 34 per cent.
All this competitive activity will expand the market, says Mr PM Sinha,
chief executive officer, Pepsi Foods. The market growth rate is expected to
step up from 5 per cent to 15 per cent annually. Since Coke's launch, the
industry's annual sales have risen from 110m cases to 120m cases.
Both companies see an enormous potential. Indians are poor consumers of
fizzy drinks, with annual consumption being three servings per person. In
neighbouring Pakistan, per capita consumption is four times as much.
Mr E. Neville Isdell, senior vice president Coca-Cola Company and president,
Northeast Europe and Middle East group, says that the key to building market
share is growing the market. 'We're looking for incremental growth on top of
the brands that we've acquired', he says.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (28): So many people to move - The woes of
the world's second biggest rail network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's railway system, the world's second largest, straddles the country
like a colossus. Without it, social and economic life would collapse.
The railways represent India's main form of transport, with annual passenger
levels estimated at 3.7bn, and freight traffic, including essential
commodities such as mineral ore, food grain, and fertilisers, totalling 362m
tonnes in the year 1993-94. It is one of the world's largest single
employers, with 1.6m on its staff.
The minister for railways, C K Jaffer Sharief, says that his main objective
is 'to provide an effective, dynamic, cost-effective transport system which
can serve as an engine for economic growth'.
But insuring that the railway system meets the demands of a growing
population and an expanding economy is proving a formidable task for the
state-owned Railways Board, as it looks for fresh ways of financing its
modernisation programme after having its budgetary support savagely cut by
the central government.
A stark illustration of the kind of pressures facing India's rail chiefs is
provided by Delhi's main railway station. Mr Parajeet Kumar, the station
master, contemplates the whirlpool of humanity which daily builds up on his
platforms, and the gradual encroachment by the slum dwellers who live along
the railway lines. At the height of this autumn's plague scare, passengers
with their faces covered with handkerchiefs stood watching black rats
scurrying over the lines.
'We try and put on more trains every day but we still don't seem to have
enough to deal with the population. We need more stations, more lines, and
greater capacity in our repair yards,' says Mr Kumar.
The backbone of the nationwide modernisation plan is an ambitious programme
of conversion of 6,000 kilometres of track from metre gauge to broad gauge
by 1997, to help meet an expected 25 per cent increase in freight traffic
over the next three years.
The programme represents the biggest single conversion programme carried out
anywhere in the world during this century, and the biggest single project
undertaken by Indian Railways since the first railway service got under way
in 1857.
India's vast network of metre and narrow gauge lines has been carrying less
freight traffic every year, causing heavy losses. As an alternative to
providing funds for the continuing maintenance of the network, the current
policy is to convert the more important metre gauge routes to broad gauge so
as to introduce alternative routes for freight traffic, and obviating the
need for the construction of new broad gauge lines.
The conversion is aimed at accelerating the turn-around time of wagons,
minimising transhipment bottlenecks, and by so doing improving the overall
operating ratio of the system. It is aimed at overcoming the sense of
economic isolation felt by some parts of India which have been dependant on
meter gauge.
The gauge conversion will link mineral rich areas of India with production
and consumption centres in other parts of the country. For example, the
Jodhpur-Jaisalmer area of Rajasthan with rich high quality limestone
reserves will be linked by broad gauge route with other parts of India.
As the minister Jaffer Sharief has put it: 'The problem with the railways is
that their line capacity is saturated ..With gauge conversion, several
alternative routes will become available leading to increase in line
capacity. This will result in long-haul road traffic reverting to rail.'
Another key plank of the modernisation programme is the introduction of
higher capacity trains and higher horsepower locomotives capable of handling
more tonnage and more passengers in less time.
A controversial and long running debate over whether or not India should
import high-tech locomotives has finally been resolved. Under a contract
worth Dollars 190m , Asea Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine,
will supply next year 33 new generation micro-chip-controlled
alternating-current engines. The contract involves transfer of technology to
facilitate the development and construction of a further 30 similar
locomotives in India, increasing to a production target of 150 by the year
2000.
The controversy surrounding the award of the contract showed that despite
the government's official commitment to economic liberalisation, doing
business in India can still be fraught with problems.
ABB, which has a large Indian affiliate employing 4,000, has been supplying
Indian railways since the 1960s. But members of a government advisory
committee lobbied actively against the award of the contract ostensibly on
cost grounds but with the main intention of promoting India's own
engineering industry.
In its defence, ABB claims that the state-of-the art technology it is
bringing, and which it will hand over to the Indians, has an energy
conservation potential of 35 per cent, lower maintenance cost of up to 40
per cent, and a higher turnaround that will increase the availability of
locomotives by 50 per cent.
In addition it points out that the introduction of the locomotives will
bring about a matching modernisation of signalling and telecommunications in
and and around India's railway stations. Only 10 per cent of India's railway
stations are currently semiautomated.
Mr Viren Srivastava, a senior executive with ABB, says: 'In India what is
still important is to ensure that trains get to their destinations. We hope
to ensure that. It's better to learn to walk before you can run.' Walking
rather than running also means that the Indian government is unlikely to
embark on am ambitious programme of privatisation. Some free market
economists believe Indian Railways is hugely overstaffed. One estimate is
that the railways could be run more effectively with a third of the current
staff.
However, according to senior railway officials such an estimate ignores the
huge political and social costs that the government would encounter were it
to embark on a programme of mass lay offs.
In the current five year plan, which began in the year 1992-93, budgetary
support of Indian Railways has been cut from 75 per cent of capital
requirements to 19 per cent.
Over the last two years, both passenger and freight traffic revenue have
been hit as a result of railway accidents and communal disturbances.
To offset losses the Railway Board is planning to lease or sell some of its
properties, and tighten up on passenger and freight receipts. Meanwhile, it
is extending an olive branch to the private sector while still holding on to
its overall monopoly. Thus the operation of some tourist trains - the
so-called palaces-on-wheels - are being put in private hands, while catering
is being increasingly entrusted to private contractors. The private sector
is also being given greater opportunity to advertise on Indian trains.
Such cosmetic changes may boost revenue, but may fall short of making the
Indian Railways the self reliant and efficient transport agency its
officials promise. Within the context of India, it is nevertheless near
miraculous that railways function at all.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (31): Vicious circles of violence - Shiraz
Sidhva considers India's sensitivity over charges of human rights abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shankarrao Chavan, India's Home minister, is indignant when questioned on
India's human rights record, particularly if the criticism comes from
international human rights groups.
'This is part of a disinformation campaign by Pakistan,' he says
dismissively. 'We have a very long tradition of tolerance. The attack on our
human rights record is coming from across the border - they should examine
their own record first, and stop aiding terrorists here.' India's human
rights record has taken a battering in the last decade, mainly because
Pakistan has worked at internationalising the dispute over Kashmir. Reports
of the excessive use of force, particularly against armed insurgencies, in
Punjab, Kashmir, and the North-East, have tarnished India's image
considerably.
Earlier this year, top diplomats and politicians worked overtime to salvage
India's reputation as one of the world's greatest democracies. One issue on
which the ruling Congress(I) party and Indian opposition parties are agreed
is that Pakistan's attempts to discredit India at international fora have to
be countered effectively.
'The best way to counter what the Indian government calls Pakistani
propaganda would be to improve the situation in Kashmir,' says Mr Abdul
Ghani, a leader of the All-party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella
organisation of political parties in Srinagar, Kashmir's capital. 'But there
are killings and torture in custody every single day, there are rapes of our
mothers and sisters, and there are disappearances, with young boys being
locked up in jail for months without trial. And India calls itself a
democracy]'
Pakistan, which has fought two wars over Kashmir with India, and has itself
been accused of arming and instigating separatists in Punjab and Kashmir,
threatened to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Human Rights Convention
in Geneva this March. But the hotly-contested draft was dropped at the last
minute, and India won a temporary reprieve.
But human rights violations continue unabated. The US Human Rights Watch, in
a report released in September, urged potential arms suppliers to 'pay close
attention to the government's record in Kashmir and Punjab, since it is in
these states that government forces have committed some of the worst and
most regular violations of human rights and humanitarian laws'.
'It's no use if India concentrates on diplomatic games instead of actually
improving its human rights record,' admits a senior Home ministry official.
'Even when there is a political will to to curb excesses, we find it
impossible to combat an insurgency situation without force, especially with
Pakistan pumping in money and guns to fuel the militancy.'
India has always maintained that its democratic systems adequately monitor
its own human rights record. It has consistently refused permission to
Amnesty International to visit Punjab and Kashmir. But Amnesty's problem of
access has more to do with its own rules, which do not allow fact-finding
teams to visit countries or trouble-spots without formal permission from the
governments concerned. Organisations such as the New York-based Human Rights
Watch/Asia and the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights or journalists
and other individuals not seeking formal permission have never been stopped.
'India genuinely upholds democratic values,' says Mr Rajesh Pilot, minister
of state for Home affairs. 'But sometimes things do happen here that are
beyond our control.'
'Over the decades, a political culture inimical to human rights achievement
has developed,' explains Mr Upendra Baxi, professor of law and former
vice-chancellor, Delhi University.
'The impunity of leading political players, who defy even the criminal law
of the land; the unredressed despotic use of public power; abuse of national
security laws; regime-tolerated or sponsored violence victimising hapless
citizens; torture and inhuman treatment in penal institutions; the excessive
use of fatal force or 'encounters'; custodial assault or violence against
women and the abuse of discretion to prosecute are all manifestations of
this.'
Tired of the constant criticism, the Indian government appointed a National
Human Rights Commission last year. The Commission, headed by a former chief
justice of the Supreme Court, has been accused of being a 'toothless
watchdog'. Excluded from its purview are the armed forces and the
paramilitary, against whom grave allegations of excesses in Kashmir, Punjab
and the North-eastern states have been made. This has eroded the
Commission's authority to conduct independent investigations of human rights
abuses.
The Home minister says that this is done to protect the morale of the armed
forces, already operating under extenuating circumstances. 'We are forced to
take extraordinary measures in extraordinary circumstances,' says Mr Chavan,
defending the government's refusal last month to withdraw the Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), in the face of strong
criticism at home and abroad.
Introduced in 1985 to combat terrorism in Punjab, TADA provides for special
'designated' courts with severely curtailed rules of procedure, reducing the
rights of the accused, and reversing the burden of proof on to the accused.
TADA prohibits bail and allows the death penalty to be imposed for certain
offences committed by 'terrorists' - a term so broadly defined that it may
include people who non-violently express their political opinions.
The Act also permits 'confessions' to the police as evidence, legalising
torture in custody. In September 1991, paramilitary forces burned down rows
of wooden houses destroying entire villages in rural Kashmir because TADA
empowered them to destroy any structure used to shield terrorists.
This year, the government was forced by human rights activists and
politicians to review the Act, which has been termed 'draconian'. But the
Supreme Court validated the Act in March because of its stated objective of
dealing with terrorism, and the Home minister ruled out its repeal last
month.
'TADA has no place in a democratic society, it is tailormade for abuse,'
says Mr Ravi Nair, executive director of the South Asia Human Rights
Documentation Centre. 'TADA is more deadly than any law imposed during the
South African or Pinochet regime (in Chile).'
Recent studies have revealed that out of 47,434 cases registered under TADA
till March this year, not a single individual involved in a terrorist act
has been convicted so far. The only convictions have been for illegal
possession of arms.
One reason why TADA has failed to combat terrorism is that it cannot counter
the fear of terrorists among witnesses, prosecutors and even judges, who
have been known to let off offenders in the face of glaring evidence.
In Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, where there have been few terrorist incidents,
the Act has been widely misused to silence political opponents. It has also
been used to harass members of the minority Moslem community, or even to
settle landlord-tenant disputes. In some states children, and even mothers
of suspected terrorists have been locked up without trial.
Mr Chavan says he has written to chief ministers in all Indian states asking
them to review TADA cases and ensure that there is no misuse. 'Ultimately,
the Centre can't do anything, because jurisdiction has been given to the
states to tackle an extraordinary situation.'
The National Human Rights Commission has strongly opposed the Act. Justice
Ranganath Misra, its chairman, has asked for the Act to be repealed, and is
filing a review petition at the Supreme Court challenging the Act's
constitutional validity.
'India will never be able to better its human rights record if it continues
to accord impunity to those in power,' says Mr Nair.

flourishes in a babel of languagues

About 20m newspapers are sold in India every day. This may seem small in
relation to a population of some 900m, but it is still a lot of newspapers,
and the total is growing.
The market is diverse, intensely competitive and, for successful
proprietors, highly profitable.
In Maharashtra, the state of which Bombay is the capital, 62 daily
newspapers are published, with a total circulation of more than 3m,
according to Indian Newspaper Society figures. More than half of these
publications are in Marathi, the most commonly spoken local language, but
there are also dailies in Gujarati, Hindi, Sindhi and Urdu as well as
English. A dozen English-language dailies are available in New Delhi.
Overall, India boasts 369 daily newspapers in a total of 18 languages. Add
to that a vibrant magazine market: the fortnightly India Today, for example,
publishes editions in five languages with a total circulation of around 1m.
Although the biggest selling newspapers are mostly in local languages, those
in English tend to attract more advertising and thus to be more profitable.
Increasingly, the trend has been for one English-language newspaper to win
dominance in each individual city, and thus to be a strong cash producer for
its owner.
The Times of India, for example, commands the market in Bombay but its
desperate efforts have failed to dislodge the Hindustan Times from the top
position in New Delhi. The Deccan Chronicle controls Hyderabad, the Deccan
Herald dominates in Bangalore, and the Hindu in Madras. Calcutta has seen a
fierce battle between the Statesman and the Telegraph, with the latter
recently seeming to emerge on top.
Cutting across the trend in general interest dailies, newspaper groups have
been seeking to establish broader national markets for business dailies.
Most successful has been the Economic Times, published like the Times of
India by by Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. It prints in six centres and has an
aggressive pricing policy.
Some newspaper editors feel, however, that the American-style trend towards
dominance of single newspapers in cities has been at the expense of quality
and independence. Increasingly, the proprietors style themselves as the
editors of their newspapers. Nevertheless, many newspapers are full of
irreverent comment and incisive reporting.
Confidence in the industry's prospects is underlined by the fact that new
publications are constantly being launched. Most recently, the Madras-based
Hindu has begun a business newspaper, Business Line, and Mr MJ Akbar,
formerly editor of the Telegraph, has founded the Asian Age, which has the
innovative twist of being printed in both Delhi and London.
Given this editorial and commercial vigour, it is surprising to find
sections of the Indian press so fearful about the possible lifting of a ban
on foreign companies owning equity in the Indian media. They are worried
that the Indian press will be swamped by foreigners and that Indian culture
and sovereignty will be undermined.
The issue has been stirred by the plans of several foreign groups to invest
in India. The Financial Times proposes to establish a joint venture with
Ananda Bazar, a Calcutta-based group which publishes the Business Standard
newspaper. Time Warner of the US wants to publish an Indian edition of Time
magazine in collaboration with Living Media, publisher of India Today.
However, all such proposals are on hold because of the ban on foreign
ownership imposed by prime minister Mr Jawaharlal Nehru in 1955. Mr PV
Narasimha Rao, the present prime minister, has indicated that he favours
lifting the ban in line with the government's liberalisation of other
industries. But he clearly wishes for a public debate to be played out
first.
Supporters of the ban see Indian politics rapidly being affected by foreign
interests if it is lifted. Frontline, a left-wing magazine, argued in
September that if foreign media were allowed entry, 'the propaganda role
played by the press in India will become much more emphasised, given the
ideological and political agenda of these powerful transnational interests'.
Although the government is seeking to keep the issue out of parliament on
the grounds that the ban was an executive decision, there has been lively
discussion in parliament. Mr Chandra Shekhar, a former prime minister, said
in August: 'The entry of foreign newspapers would strike at our
civilisation, our culture, our traditions, our politics, our freedom of
expression.'
Mr Jaswant Singh, deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, wrote that foreign media 'cannot improve the quality of our
print media, our newspapers, our magazines, journals or periodicals in any
significant manner. They will, however, constrict the existing cultural
space of India.'
That the ruling Congress party was divided on the issue became clear in
August when Mr Chandulal Chandrakar, a former journalist who is now the
party's spokesman, said in parliament that 'if the foreign newspapers come
here there will be pressures on us every day. It is therefore my ardent plea
that there is no need to invite foreign newspapers and their proprietors to
India.'
However, Mr Chandrakar made an embarrassing about-face when he announced a
few days later that party committees studying the issue had determined that
foreign entry would do no harm. 'After careful and detailed study of the
newspaper scenario in the country and the changes in the environment it is
felt that the Indian press can successfully compete with the foreign press
and no-one should object to its entry slowly and gradually.'
Commentators who favour lifting the ban point out that foreign newspapers
are already freely available in India and that Indian newspapers make
liberal use of copy syndicated by foreign publications. Millions of Indians
tune in daily to Star Television, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, particularly
its Hindi language channel, Zee TV, of which Mr Murdoch owns half.
It is also argued that foreign companies could wait a long time to earn a
return on their investments given the already intense competition -
especially on price - in the Indian market.
However, emotional arguments stressing the specialness of the 'fourth
estate' have been stirred by the Indian media groups which feel vulnerable
to foreign entry.
Mr N J Nanporia, a veteran former newspaper editor, wrote in the Independent
that these arguments were essentially baseless. There had been, he said, a
'deliberate creation of a fear which would not otherwise exist'. The
suggestion that Indian culture was so fragile was a denigration, not a
defence, of India's tradition.
Mr Nanporia argued that the idea that the nation needed protection from a
free flow of information and opinions was the basis of the 1955 ban but was
incompatible with economic liberalisation.
Other commentators argue that Indian newspapers, which have argued for
liberalisation in other industries, should not seek protection for
themselves. Mr Sunil Sethi, a columnist, noted that foreign investment had
pushed Indian industry to compete. 'To now stand up and say that the advent
of foreign newspapers will subvert India's future is a huge betrayal of
national self-confidence or the spirit to excel. Who's afraid of
competition?'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (29): World media zoom in on 150m households
 -Satellite television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As more than a dozen satellites swarm over Asian skies and India's
television audience expands towards 150m households by the turn of the
century, international entertainment and media companies are mounting a
space-age invasion of the country.
These are all making plans to piggyback Apstar II, a Chinese satellite that
will centre its beam over India, and some 14 new satellites to be
operational over Asia by 1996.
Together, the networks will challenge the near-monopoly that Star TV, the
pan-Asian satellite network now owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, has
enjoyed since it started beaming five channels to India in 1991.
Star's supremacy in the region will also be challenged from an unlikely
quarter. Doordarshan, India's state-owned TV network, has an advantage over
Star and other satellite networks because its main channels are accessible
through simple antennae and a base of 30m TV sets, giving it a formidable
reach of over 335m viewers.
Doordarshan, managed by socialist-minded bureaucrats, accustomed to taking
government orders, was certain that Star would never be able to match its
reach, especially in India's vast rural hinterland.
Reacting belatedly, the staid network has launched an ambitious
modernisation and expansion programme to increase its current six channels
to 21 in the next few years, and to bolster its flagging image.
Competition has already done wonders for Doordarshan's programming. When
Star failed to renew its contract with MTV, Doordarshan moved in, to review
two and a half hours of programming from the music video channel on its
metro channel. The launch of a new 'high-brow' channel with chat shows, and
live news programmes from the biggest names in Indian journalism this
October signals a welcome change.
The decision to schedule MTV, which has become a metaphor for all that is
'Western' (and thus 'undesirable'), is an indication of how desperately it
is trying to woo back the viewers it lost to Star.
Star TV kicked off a cultural revolution of sorts when it started
transmitting to India three years ago. Its five channels were a potpourri of
entertainment, sports, news, and sometimes Chinese language programmes. Much
of the programming made no sense to a majority of Indian viewers. But the
network seriously undermined the Indian government's stranglehold over
telecasting, especially news.
Embarking at around the same time on its economic liberalisation programme,
the Indian government was, on the one hand, encouraging the 'foreign
invasion' and the return of all things Western, and on the other battling
clumsily to ward off what was derisively termed the 'Coca Cola and MTV
culture'.
India's new middle classes, an estimated 300m, were, for the first time,
given a choice to view what they wanted - even if it was MTV - as opposed to
what the government decided was best for them.
The Indian government was particularly concerned about losing its grip on
the news, which it had previously carefully monitored and often
short-sightedly censored. It began to see that Doordarshan would no longer
be the powerful political propaganda tool it was when its monopoly was
unchallenged.
The state network's news bulletins were quickly upstaged by the BBC's slick
world service, with news on the hour offered through the Star network. The
government's helplessness in the face of the alien invasion was highlighted
when cable operators started offering PTV, the Pakistan television channel.
Cable operators are hardly an anti-national lot. Many of them heeded the
government's pleas to stop PTV broadcasts, but others decided to defy the
diktat and pander to the vast audiences for Pakistani soap operas.
The operators, mostly small businessmen and shopkeepers who diversified to
take advantage of the new business brought in by Star, hook several
households in a locality on to a satellite dish, for a small monthly fee
(Dollars 5-Dollars 10). The operators currently offer up to 20 channels, but
are gearing up to acquire more technical and sophisticated equipment to
handle the 100-odd channels likely to be available by 1996.
In September, the government promulgated an ordinance in a belated attempt
to regulate cable television. Under the Cable TV Networks (Regulation)
Ordinance, cable operators must be Indian citizens, and foreign investors
would have to limit their equity to 49 per cent. The ordinance makes it
compulsory for operators to offer at least two Doordarshan channels, and
empowers the competent authority to ban programmes 'in the public interest'.
The new rules, however, do not apply to the programmes of foreign satellite
channels which are received without using specialised decoders. It is
unlikely that networks like Star will do anything to antagonise the
governments of the countries they operate in, or the cultural or religious
sensibilities of the people in the region, for that matter. Which is why
Turner Broadcasting Corporation will exclude Porky Pig from its daily
cartoon channel to be aired in Indonesia, which is predominantly Moslem.
Responding to the increasing need for locally customised programming, Star
TV split its beam on October 15 to provide two services, one to India and
the Middle East and the other, to Greater China. It has also changed its
programme schedule to suit the split market.
Star's chief executive Mr Gary Davey has indicated that there will be a
seven-channel package for India soon, with more live sports programmes and
aggressive, more localised programming development.
Mr Davey, who is backed to the hilt by his boss Mr Murdoch, plans to use the
formula which turned around British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), to increase
Star's flagging revenues. The difference in programming is already evident.
When Star failed to renew its contract with MTV, it launched Channel V, a
24-hour music video network laced with Hindi and other Asian languages. The
new channel has a nine-hour-a-day window for Indian audiences, and aims at
50 per cent local programming.
And Star's newest venture will be a tie-up with Zee TV, a Bombay-based Hindi
language channel - which Star relays and part-owns - to create additional
programming, and a second Hindi channel from India. Star launched its
24-hour movie channel, India's first pay channel in October. It has yet to
catch on, but the network hopes to offset some of its losses through the pay
channel.
With the cost of running the network estimated to be Dollars 150m, and a
very real threat to Star's dominance in the region looming large, the
network is working overtime to keep its Indian viewers hooked.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (27): Cutting edge of capitalism - Paul
Taylor hears how Bombay and Maharashtra plan for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The large billboards around Bombay invite India's stock market punters to
purchase shares in the some of the 100 companies which come to market each
month while street stalls act as broker's agents, distributing share
application forms to passers-by.
'We have 25m investors in India,' says Mr Bhagirat Merchant, president of
the Bombay Stock Exchange. 'That makes India second only to the US in terms
of number of private investors.'
Bombay, India's premier financial centre, economic powerhouse and the
capital of the state of Maharashtra, is at the cutting edge of capitalism in
the sub-continent. Now, after decades of stifling state-planning, business
is booming.
The city's plush hotels are full of foreign businessmen. But such
conspicuous consumption serves to further highlight the gap between the
growing number of affluent white-collar workers and the poverty of the less
fortunate.
On the seafront outside the deluxe Taj Mahal hotel, Bombay's street beggars,
many of them children dressed in rags or women holding babies, plead with
the tourists; 'Money for food, money for food, sir.'
Since independence Bombay's population has risen from 2m to around 13m. Each
day an estimated 500 families, most from outside the state, arrive in the
city in search of a better life.
Most end up sleeping on the pavement or in Bombay's sprawling shanty-town
slums which are among the worst in Asia. Even then many try to eke out a
living, sorting through piles of rubbish or mounds of plastic bottles.
Everywhere there is activity.
Bombay has a reputation for being a cosmopolitan business centre, more
interested in making money than in politics. But inter-religious riots have
highlighted the murkier links between politics and crime.
Two months ago Mr Ramdas Nayak, local president of the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata party and a strong critic of political corruption, was
killed by gunmen using automatic rifles.
Since then Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra, has faced
mounting criticism about the rise of violent crime in the city and growing
evidence of ties between politicians and underworld gangsters.
Bombay plays a pivotal role in the the economies of both the state and the
nation. It is India's busiest port handling nearly 25 per cent of total
foreign trade; it has the nation's largest stock exchange which handles
around 70 per cent of all capital market transactions and is headquarters
for most large commercial banks and the Reserve Bank of India.
It is also a large manufacturing centre for everything from textiles to
pharmaceuticals and it is India's 'Hollywood', turning out about half the
500 to 600 full length feature films made in the country each year.
Maharashtra is one of the largest states in India with a population of 79m
and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's industrial output.
More than half India's top 100 companies are based in Maharashtra.
Multinationals such as Lever, Roche, Sandoz, Bayer, Asea Brown Boveri,
Burroughs, Wellcome, Colgate, Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca Cola and Kellog have
plants in Maharashtra, making it India's most industrialised state.
Outside Bombay several other large industrial centres have emerged including
Pune, a city of 2.5m people perched high up on the Deccan plateau.
To investigate how Maharashtra could maintain its industrial and economic
leadership in the face of increasing competition the state Investment
Corporation of Maharashtra (Sicom) commissioned a study by McKinsey, the
management consultancy.
McKinsey's report, published in April last year, identified Maharashtra's
key strengths as revolving around 'a skilled, low-cost labour pool,
availability of select minerals (coal, oil and gas and bauxite) and
agricultural products, adequate power supplies, Bombay's premier position
(in the domestic and global context) and established resource clusters in
the textiles, auto, engineering, food and petrochemicals industries'.
However, the report also identified a number of 'major barriers to continued
growth and leadership' including quality of infrastructure.
Since then the state has adopted a new industrial policy which Mr Pawar says
is aimed at freeing the industrialisation process from bottlenecks and
encouraging non-polluting high tech industries.
The chief minister, a powerful advocate for Marharashtra, runs the state as
if he were the chief executive of a large company and has a single vision of
how it should develop.
'I want to make Bombay another Hong Kong,' he says. He wants a review of
urban land policy and 'the modernisation' of India's rent control acts. In
addition he is advocating the development of a series of satellite towns 30
to 40 miles outside Bombay.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (25): Battle against black-outs - Foreign
groups join drive to electrification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Mr R Vasudevan, power secretary in the Indian government, there are 'no
push-button solutions' to the country's electricity shortages. Achieving the
needed output, he says, will require 'a long gestation period'.
His vision is helping bring private operators, including foreign companies,
into an industry which until now has often been politically manipulated by
state and central governments.
A parliamentary and legal challenge held up agreement on the first flagship
project, a Dollars 2bn plant being built by Enron of the US to supply
Bombay. At issue was central government's right to grant guarantees that the
State Electricity Board (SEB) in Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the
capital, would pay for the power it received. Without these, Enron said it
could not raise financing for the facility.
The way the power ministry has conducted negotiations with prospective
entrants has won praise even from beyond their ranks.
The task ahead, though, is enormous. Growth in installed capacity for power
generation has averaged 6 per cent annually since independence and currently
stands at some 77,000MW. Mr Vasudevan told an energy summit convened in
Madras in August by the Confederation of Indian Industry that 'the capacity
addition as planned is short of the need-based requirements and, what is
more disturbing, even the achievement of this target is dogged by serious
resource constraints'.
In short, public sector suppliers are at best treading water - capacity
being added is enough only to keep pace with economic growth rather than
redress structural shortages, and many SEBs do not have the capital to meet
expansion commitments envisaged under the current five-year plan which runs
to March 1997.
Overall power shortages are around 10 per cent, with unmet demand at peak
times nearly double that. Private sector involvement, largely foreign, is
seen as the only escape from 'load shedding', the intermittent blackouts
experienced daily by virtually all businesses and households. Only key
government installations and export industries in some states are protected.
According to Mr Vasudevan, a programme to bring reliable electricity to all
India would mean additional capacity of 142,000MW by 2007, nearly trebling
the available total. He agrees with private sector estimates that making a
start on this will require at least Dollars 6bn a year worth of plants over
the next five years.
The largest project so far agreed is a Dollars 12.7bn plan by an offshoot of
Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong to provide an eventual
10,560MW of capacity through two coal-fired plants in a deal with Powergrid,
a central government agency. The first of these 16 units is to come on
stream by early 1999, with full operation scheduled for 2003.
Powergrid is a minority supplier to SEBs, and India does not yet have a
national grid, though one is intended to evolve as part of the restructuring
of the sector.
In the short term, three main ways in which the centre is seeking to improve
power availability by getting the most out of existing capacity are:
encouraging demand-side management, limiting transmission and distribution
losses, and increasing power station efficiency.
But each of these runs up against entrenched attitudes at the SEBs, which
currently provide three quarters of the country's power, and at the offices
of their political masters in state capitals.
First, the tariff structure does not sufficiently steer larger users into
making optimal use of off-peak periods, and many smaller commercial
customers, notably farmers, are supplied at a loss.
Second, some 23 per cent of generated electricity disappears before it
reaches the customer, commonly through illegal link-ups, and few governments
are prepared to arouse the ire of slum dwellers by severing their pirate
lines.
Third, headway has been made in improving use of installed capacity
(official figures show that average plant load factor, a measure of this,
rose from 57 per cent to 61 per cent last year) but such an improvement may
not be sustainable without spending on modernisation by the cash-strapped
SEBs.
That would have to form part of a programme for the longer run, one which
also offers opportunities to foreign suppliers. States are turning towards
schemes whereby they lease an uneconomic facility to a private operator
which upgrades it and, where required, eventually returns it to public
hands. Mr S Sangameswaran of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering combine, estimates that the market for modernisation could
itself deliver 30,000MW in extra capacity.
He enumerates several areas of concern for developers entering the Indian
market. Prime among these are the tardiness in establishing a transparent
bidding and evaluation procedure for projects, together with a complex and
slow decision-making process. Under the Indian constitution, electricity is
the dual responsibility of the centre and the states. The two levels of
government are seldom of one mind on priorities or cost, and SEBs are not
conducting open tenders.
Furthermore, the sheer number of projects now being contemplated - 86 at
latest count - may lead to a dilution of efforts. Mr Vasudevan admits his
department has had problems even processing the proposals.
Duties on imported equipment stand at 20 per cent, although these have been
reduced sharply from a previous 85 per cent. ABB is in talks with Delhi to
take over a government boilermaking factory and is planning to build turbine
generators at a greenfield site, aiming to produce its first Indian-made
machinery by 1997-98.
A main plank in the government's efforts to improve supply is a greater
reliance on hydroelectric generation. Officials estimate that only a fifth
of a potential 84,000MW capacity is being exploited, and wish to increase
the contribution of hydropower to some 40 per cent of the total from a
current 28 per cent.
This will depend to some extent on the fate of the country's flagship
Narmada Dam project in central India, which has been reviled by aid agencies
because it would entail uprooting of thousands of rural communities.
Although the World Bank has withdrawn support, Narmada remains on the
drawing board.
On a different level, the World Bank in July cancelled Dollars 750m in power
loans to a small number of SEBs because of their poor financial performance.
There were little or no knock-on effects on other projects, and in the past
year half a dozen states have agreed to reform their power regimes with
World Bank help.
But Mr Heinz Vergin, head of the Bank's India department, was quoted as
describing some of the local remedies for the SEBs' ills as 'Band-Aids'.
No wonder central guarantees were sought, and are being granted, for the
first seven large, fast-track projects in which foreign companies are
involved.
While foreign operators fret about the remaining risks, such as construction
delays and cost overruns, nationalist politicians maintain that too much has
been given away.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (26): Brains at bargain wages - Software
skills attract world-wide interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past decade India has built up a solid reputation for software
programming and semiconductor design.
According to the National Association of Computer Software and Services
(Nasscom), the Indian software sector grew at a compound rate of almost 30
per cent between 1987 and 1992.
Last year, the industry generated Dollars 600m of revenues, 50 per cent more
than the previous year, of which Dollars 330m represented exports, mostly to
the US and Europe. Nasscom's 273 members, who include the Indian
subsidiaries of companies such as Microsoft as well as indigenous companies,
account for about 97 per cent of industry revenues. 'This year's revenues
will reach about Dollars 1bn and we estimate 50 per cent growth for the next
50 years,' says Mr Dewang Mehta, the executive director.
Several factors explain the success of the Indian software industry. Among
these India has a large pool of relatively low wage skilled people who speak
English and have been taught mathematics and science. The salary for a
qualified Indian graduate, although rising rapidly, is still only about a
tenth of that in the US. As a result, when labour shortages began to appear
in the mid 1980s many western high tech companies set up software and
semiconductor chip design operations in India, particularly around Bombay,
Bangalore and Delhi.
Others went 'body shopping' - contracting with Indian start-ups that could
supply cut-price programmers.
Among the industry pioneers TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) was started 26
years ago and won its first overseas contract in 1974. Today TCS employs
4,000 professionals (average age 26 1/2 ) of whom 1,700 to 1,800 are working
for foreign clients including 800 abroad.
'We think of ourselves as software engineers,' says Mr Faquir Kohli, deputy
chairman of TCS whose customers have included many foreign giants including
insurance companies Life and Prudential and US banking group JP Morgan.
Mr Saurabh Srivastava, managing director of International Informantics
Solutions (IIS), another Indian software consultancy, cites several reasons
for using a company like his. One is cost - using an Indian subcontractor
can cut costs by about 25 per cent for the same quality or better work.
According to Mr Srivastava, the Indian software industry is entering a new
phase. Having developed programming expertise and confidence, IIS and other
companies are beginning to invest in the research and development of their
own products. 'There are a lot of companies doing R&amp;D today,' he says.
Mr R Ramachandra, science editor of the Economic Times newspaper, estimates
that, despite tax an other incentives for industry, around 75 per cent of
Indian R&amp;D expenditure is undertaken by the government.
In part this has reflected India's strategic requirements. With access to
western technology restricted, India has developed indigenous expertise in
key areas including defence, space and nuclear power. These programmes have
had mixed success. For example, the space programme, conducted under the
auspices of the Indian Space Research Organisation, has suffered a number of
technical setbacks.
Meanwhile, the country's nuclear industry was branded a 'dangerous failure'
by western scientists earlier this year during an investigation by America's
CBS network and the country has been without an indigenous semiconductor
fabrication capacity since the semiconductor plant at Chandigar burned down
in 1989.
In other areas, India's attempts to protect and encourage domestic high
technology companies have come unstuck. In aerospace and defence, the
state-controlled companies which dominate industry have failed to make any
inroads into the commercial sector. In areas such as pharmaceuticals,
however, there have been successes.
The Indian pharmaceutical industry is well established and the government's
decision earlier this year to sign the Gatt agreement on intellectual
property rights is expected to stimulate further research and development.
In addition, several national research laboratories such as the National
Chemical laboratory in Pune have developed a high level of expertise in
process technology - for the petrochemical industry, for example - and are
acknowledged to be world-class institutions.
Historically, private sector R&amp;D spending in India has been fairly limited.
Small private sector businesses have relied on the state laboratories for
technology such as materials substitution and testing, while larger scale
manufacturers have been protected by trade barriers and often lacked the
finance and the confidence in future government industrial policy to
undertake R&amp;D.
Overall expenditure on research and development in India is reckoned to be
running at around 0.8 or 0.9 per cent of GDP - down from about 1 per cent
during the 1980s. The decline reflects the impact of the current
administration's economic liberalisation programme which includes
restricting state spending.
As a result many state-run research laboratories which have so far failed to
win foreign or private sector contracts are close to collapse. The
government hopes that eventually its more open economic, financial and trade
policy will encourage industry to invest more in R&amp;D and establish more
technology transfer joint ventures with foreign multinationals.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (23): Sleeping giant stirs - The rural
masses show their consumer power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kherala, in the state of Haryana, some 50km south of Delhi, fits the image
of the age-old village whose traditional values Mahatma Gandhi sought to
preserve. But take a closer look and you'll discover the modern age
tentatively knocking on many a front door.
Set well back from the main highway to the capital, the bulk of Kherala's
population of 4,000 live in squat huts made of crude cane and cattle dung.
But most of the huts have TVs, electrical kitchen gadgets and an assortment
of mass-marketed toiletries. Oxen plough the nearby fields, but tractors
spray the fertilisers and transport the labourers, and piped water is
gradually replacing the village well. Scooters and mopeds are also
disturbing the rural idyll, rivalling the ox as a status symbol.
India's villages, where 80 per cent of the population live, retain much of
their immemorial quality. But the agrarian reforms of the last two decades
together with the migration to the cities of many villagers has brought
about a significant rise in agrarian purchasing power and a change in
consumer patterns. Cultural change is also being hastened by the spread of
TV.
According to research undertaken in recent years by India's National Council
for Applied Economic Research (NCAER), the importance of rural markets for
manufacturerd consumer goods is increasing and will increase further as a
result of the government's liberalisation programme.
Although most of India's lowest income families live in the villages, they
are an important market for some specific consumer goods which are anything
but traditional.
The most recent extensive survey carried out in 1992-93 show that 75 per
cent of bicycles and portable radios, and 60 per cent of table fans, sewing
machines, and wrist watches, sold in India were bought in rural areas. Rural
markets also accounted for a 72 per cent share in national sales of washing
cake.
The NCAER survey found that the rural share of other consumer sales has been
rising in relation to sales in the cities. In a sample study over a four
year period between 1989-93, the percentage of black and white TVs bought in
rural India rose from 44 to 47 per cent; of colour TVs from 19 to 31 per
cent; cassette recorders from 42 to 49 per cent; video recorders from 5 to 8
per cent; toothpastes from 30 to 38 per cent; washing powders from 48 per
cent to 52 per cent; and electric bulbs from 30 to 32 per cent.
But perhaps the most revealing statistic, since it suggests the amount of
spare cash in farmers' pockets, is that while in 1960 the average rural
household spent 81 per cent of its income on food, today it spends less than
70 per cent.
During the 1980s, companies and advertisers devised their strategies for
rural markets on the assumption that consumer preferences in the average
Indian village would be not much different from urban centres. In recent
years a geater effort has been made to understand the particular cultural,
social, and economic conditions that exist within the villages.
Pradeep Kashyap, a marketing consultant, who has organised workshops on
rural markets for the Asian Centre for Organisation Research and Development
(ACORD), says: 'Having been trained in a westernised culture, we tend to
approach even the rural market with certain urban mindsets. That doesn't
always work. To effectively market a product, we have to get off our high
horses and understand rural ways.'
To illustrate the idiosyncracies of the rural mind, Indian advertisers like
to recall the following anecdote regarding sales of hair dye in the villages
of Gujarat. A few years ago it was discovered that sales of the dye had shot
up to three bottles per consumer a month. It was subsequently discovered
that far from being used for the villagers' hair, the dye had been used on
the local cattle. It was felt that the shinier the cow's coat, the better
the chance of getting a good price at the local market.
In Kherala, rural ways are exemplified by the family of Mr Lackhan Singh
Sarapanach, a 45 year-old farmer who has served for several years as the
elected head of the village body. His wife Subhebra recalls that when she
first came to the village as a teenage bride, women rarely ventured from
their huts, and spent their time either grinding corn or washing clothes.
Today the mill stone lies abandoned in the Sarpanach larder, and a machine
is used for the task. Subhebra cooks over an electric stove instead of
firewood. She still washes the clothes by hand. But her clothes are no
longer home spun, and she uses commercial washing powder.
Her daughter Neelan, 16, likes to buy make up and ready-made clothes in the
town market. Her ambition is to buy a car. Jaisingh, her 23 year-old
brother, wears jeans and gym shoes and likes to ride motor scooters. He
plans to leave for Saudi Arabia as a construction worker in the hoping of
earning enough money there to increase his family's limited supply of
electrical gadgetry.
And yet the Sarapanach family are neither spendthrift nor uncritical of
modern life. The family tailors its bigger purchases according to what it
can afford and is without a refigerator or a gas stove.
Subhebra is not convinced that the shampoo she now uses is superior to the
mixture of mud and tree extract with which she washed her hair as a young
girl. 'I notice that people's hair in the village is not as thick and strong
as it used to be,' she says. The shampoo is, however, affordable and saves
her time.
There are no Body Shops in Kherala. The local store reflects the modesty of
disposable incomes and the complex nature of consumer aspirations. There are
unmarked bags of rice and bottles of vegetable oil, indicating that on
staple foods at least the villager remains product loyal rather than brand
conscious.
On the shelves there are several different brands of washing soap,
toothpaste and combs prominently displayed while the only available brand of
bras are kept modestly in boxes. There are also a variety of biscuits and
two different brands of light bulbs. But the most popular confectionery
remains a local sweet made of sugar cane, herbs, and butter milk.
The Sarapanachs do much of their shopping in the town market, where there is
a wider range of products. However the head of the family insists: 'I don't
buy something simply because someone tells me I should buy it. It needs to
be worth it price wise and accessible. And what matters to me is not the
packaging but whether it really makes my life easier.'
Market research done on other villages in India suggests that consumption
patterns of rural consumers generally remain distinct from those of urban
consumers. While many villagers are earning their wages in the towns, caste
and religion continue to play a dominant role in their villages, insuring a
high degree of social conformity and respect for tradition. Status symbols
remain important, as do strong personal relationships.
These factors are likely to put an increasing onus on companies developing
marketing strategies which are sensitive to the peculiar needs of rural
communities. Already advertisers have had to accept that sexual innuendo and
images of boys and girls frolicking over a can of fruit juice jars with
village tradition. And companies find that using long-standing dealer
networks (often using extended families and internal village hierarchies)
can prove more useful than sending in outsiders.
This marketing will be watched closely by government officials. While
anxious to promote economic development in rural communities, officials
realise the need to protect more positive aspects of traditional life such
as artisan crafts.
Several non-government agencies are promoting traditional weaving and wood
working in some villages with an eye on exports. But the days when villagers
themselves buy what they make may have gone forever.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (24): Some things don't change - Gandhi's
social vision remains a dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In mid-October, as the initial panic over the plague outbreak receded, the
Sunday Times of India ran a signed commentary, calling on local leaders to
'convert themselves into unpaid sweepers'.
The article was an extract from the collected works of the Mahatma Gandhi,
India's founder.
Top city officials in Delhi were spending part of their weekend being
photographed following Gandhi's precept. It was a token gesture, and
enduring answers to India's public health problems remain elusive.
After significant progress to improve the social framework since
independence in 1947, concerns are growing that sanitation, nutrition and
literacy for its 900m people are slipping down the government's list of
priorities even as liberalisation offers the prospect of rapid economic
growth.
Health care provision from all public sources is estimated to account for
only 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, half its peak level. Some
states spend less than a dollar per head a year, and three quarters of rural
clinics are privately run.
Achievements on some fronts are diluted by a failure to provide matching
facilities in others. Some 78 per cent of rural dwellers have access to safe
water (although this may require a 2km return trip to collect) but,
according to Unicef, only 11 per cent have access to a latrine.
While the plague toll which alarmed the world reached only 55, someone in
India dies every minute of tuberculosis - the country has 40 per cent of the
world's cases - and up to 10,000 under-fives perish each day, largely of
pneumonia or of dehydration brought on by simple diarrhoea.
This is in spite of the halving of infant mortality rates since
independence. A mass immunisation programme launched in the 1980s achieved
80 per cent coverage. A few states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the
south have demographic profiles approaching those of developed countries,
and aid agencies working in India argue that this shows large-scale
programmes can have a durable effect.
But as well as old problems such as the plague, new ones surface. Some 1.6m
Indians are estimated to be HIV positive, and research presented at the
international conference on Aids in Yokohama, Japan this August showed that
from an initial detection in 1986 the prevalence of the virus had spread
across the country and beyond high-risk groups such as prostitutes and their
clients. With heterosexual sex the main means of transmission, about half
those infected are women.
Incidence of the virus is 'strongly linked with other problems resulting
from overpopulation, poverty, disease, illiteracy and gender bias,' says Dr
Sengupta Sushma of the All India Women's Conference.
Many Aids-associated illnesses go unidentified, let alone treated, and
Indian pharmaceutical companies are just starting to develop diagnostic kits
suitable for the country. The Bombay-based Lupin Laboratories expects to
have one in production by the end of the year which will not be affected by
heat, a common problem when such materials have to be distributed by road to
rural centres.
According to health workers, Aids education in schools is bedevilled by
social taboos, while getting this and other messages across to adults is
made harder by the fact that 48 per cent of the population remains
illiterate.
India's target of universal literacy by 2000 is looking increasingly
unattainable. Unicef's Ms Gillian Wilcox describes 1995 as the
'make-or-break year' where those starting school need to be retained for the
five years of primary education which will provide their reading and writing
skills. Dropout rates can commonly reach 40 or 50 per cent in the first
year.
Government curricula are being re-examined in an attempt to make what is
being taught seem less alien particularly to rural children, and
experimental projects in various parts of the country show what could be
achieved more widely if the public education system is freed from some of
its rigidities.
At Turki, just north of the Ganges in poverty-stricken rural Bihar, 560
children attend what has become known as India's first 'school for
shepherds.' Its 25 acres provides grazing for their families' livestock
while, in addition to Hindi and arithmetic, they learn animal husbandry,
basket weaving and sandal making.
Mr Sita Ram Rai, the head teacher, says: 'Our basic aim is to make them
literate, then give them training.' Unusually, they get a midday meal and
they get paid to attend - one rupee a day for the lowest-caste children,
less for those who are more privileged.
In the central state of Madhya Pradesh a local non-governmental organisation
called Eklavya has been granted rare permission to use workbooks of its own
devising in government schools to foster activity-based learning. The
European Union is backing a Rs7bn programme to improve primary education in
deprived districts there.
First-year classes can have up to 80 students, and although facilities are
poor, donors are reluctant to put much money into bricks and mortar. In
Turki, some learn their lessons under a banyan tree.
Apart from a lack of resources, two main problems hamper education in India
as nowhere else: child labour (embracing perhaps 40m who should be in
school) and the caste system.
The two are related. When a lower-caste family withdraws a child from school
in order to work alongside its parents in the fields, it may be for economic
reasons. But the parents may also take the decision conscious that their
offspring has been made to sit at the back, or outside, or given menial
tasks like lavatory cleaning seen as befitting its status.
The belief that such work should be done only by those castes, who are then
reviled for doing it, goes to the root of India's health and literacy
difficulties, as Gandhi recognised.
'Primary education of its children must be undoubtedly an important item in
the work of a municipality. But I have not a shadow of doubt that sanitation
occupies the foremost place in its programme ... I hold it to be impossible
to give a healthy education to unhealthy children,' he wrote, arguing that
'Untouchability has a great deal to answer for the insanitation of our
streets and our latrines.'
In half a century, not much has changed.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (22): Villagers switch to a better class of
smoke - Jump in sales of cigarettes at 3p a packet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jirat is a sleepy village some 50km from Calcutta. Siddique Ali, a farmer in
his 20s, likes a cigarette at the end of his day's work in the fields.
During the day, however, he smokes bidis, which contain lower grade tobacco.
He is one of many smokers all over India, the world's third largest tobacco
producer, who have partly switched to cigarettes from bidis. According to
ITC, which has 60 per cent of the Indian cigarette market, the number of
'dual smokers' is growing fast and there are also many giving up bidis
totally in favour of cigarettes.
Although nearly 125m Indian adult males smoke tobacco in one form or
another, only about 30m are cigarette smokers. Besides bidi and cigarette
smoking, tobacco smoking through a hookah is largely prevalent in India.
The immediate reason for the jump in cigarette sales in the semi-urban and
rural areas is that a packet of 10 micro cigarettes costs a mere Rs1.50
(3p). This follows the reduction in the excise duty on cigarettes of less
than 60mm length from Rs120 to Rs60 per 1,000 sticks in the current year's
federal budget.
A bidi stick at 10 paise is still five paise cheaper than a cigarette. But
industry officials think that villagers are turning increasingly cigarettes
because they regard them as 'more modern'. And at Rs1.50 for a pack of 10,
cigarettes are no longer too expensive.
By substantially lowering the duty on micro cigarettes, the federal
government has signalled that it would like cigarettes to replace bidis.
That is because the cheap micro cigarettes yield 12 times more revenue than
bidis which attract a duty of only Rs5 per 1,000 sticks. Since bidis are
mostly made in small, local workshops, the revenue collection is poor.
The cigarette manufacturers are obviously pleased to have found a market
segment which is growing fast. 'In the past six months, monthly production
of micro cigarettes has risen from 100m to nearly 500m sticks. The general
expectation is that production will rise to 1bn sticks a month within a year
and a half,' say industry officials.
The Indian cigarette market has shrunk from 85bn sticks a year to 80bn in
the last five years. However, in the current year there will be some growth
as the micro cigarettes are moving fast and that is almost entirely at the
expense of bidis.
But the market for bidis in India is huge. Though there are few statistics,
it is estimated that at least 12 times as many bidis are currently sold as
cigarettes.
'This offers a great opportunity to promoting the sales of micro cigarettes.
What we also find encouraging is that many first-time smokers in the rural
and semi-urban centres are starting with micro cigarettes and not bidis,'
said ITC .
The four major brands in the micro segment are Hero, Vijai, Commando and
Blue Bird, owned by ITC, VST, Godfrey Philips and Golden Tobacco,
respectively. They have around 80 per cent share of the micro cigarette
market.
Since the industry is mainly targeting the rural smokers who have a
different profile from the urban smokers, the cigarette manufacturers are
changing their marketing strategies.
All the manufacturers admit that the profit margin in micro cigarettes is
very thin. 'First, we have kept the price of the product low. Second, the
cost of distributing cigarettes in the rural areas is quite high.
Fortunately, the volume of sales is growing at an encouraging rate.'
Though cigarettes use only 20 per cent of the tobacco consumed in the
country, they account for nearly 90 per cent of the excise revenue generated
by all tobacco products. In fact, after petroleum, cigarettes are the second
largest contributor to the exchequer.
In the current year, cigarettes are expected to generate revenue of more
than Rs30.5bn for the government, compared with Rs27.43bn in 1993-94. Except
for the micro cigarettes, which are now attracting a much lower excise duty,
the levy on all other cigarettes has been raised by 12 per cent in the
1994-95 budget.
However, in the earlier two budgets, the government spared cigarettes, which
were already highly taxed, from any duty increase.
The annual average increase of 24 per cent in cigarette prices has also
forced the smokers to move away from the higher priced to lower priced
cigarettes.
The manufacturers argue that since they use better tobacco than that used in
bidis, a higher procurement of the commodity by them would raise the income
of the growers. The farmers would then have the incentive to produce better
tobacco. If the government agrees, then perhaps the duty on regular
cigarettes will be lowered in the next budget.
Very few Indian women smoke, unlike in China where about 6 per cent of the
adult women smoke cigarettes. The market for the premium king size
cigarettes in India is less than 1.5bn sticks a year. In this segment,
moreover, the sale of illegally imported cigarettes is double that of the
local brands such as India Kings and Classic.
Even though the top end of the market is small, RJ Reynolds and Philip
Morris are exploring the possibility of producing cigarettes in India.
Godfrey Philips already produces Rothmans locally.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (21): Sweet fruits of sufficiency - Farmers
adapt their fields to the export market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the shadow of the Himalayan foothills near the Punjab city of Chandigarh,
Mr Malvinder Singh, a civil construction engineer turned agriculture
entrepreneur, is putting his expertise in air-conditioned buildings to new
uses.
With the help of Dutch know-how and measuring equipment, as well as an
abundance of cheap and enthusiastic female labour (Punjabi women consider
themselves less religiously constrained than women in other parts of India),
Mr Malvinder has converted 26 acres of low yielding agricultural land into a
mushroom processing enterprise.
The plant, built at the relatively low cost of Rs235m, started up in August
and is expected to produce 30,000 kilos of button mushrooms a day within a
year. Mr Singh's Dutch agrofoods company hopes to tap a potentially
lucrative market both in Delhi and abroad.
Some 50km further south off the main road to Delhi, in the midst of tropical
countryside near the town of Zirakpur, Mr Gurdial Singh (no relation), a
retired government officer, has invested his savings in a smallholding. From
his rows of Dutch bulbs, he is reaping a rich harvest in gladiolis, a
high-value crop being exported to the Middle East and Europe.
Mushroom farming and horticulture are just two examples of the increasing
diverse use to which Indian agricultural land is being put - a diversity
that accounts for the agricultural sector becoming a target for both foreign
and domestic investment and an aggressive government backed export drive.
The post-independence green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s emphasised
land reform, mechanisation and the wide-scale use of fertilisers and
pesticides to increase the yield of traditional crops. The aim was to
achieve self-sufficiency, banishing the threat of famine forever.
Today in India a new green revolution is under way aimed at maximising the
use of agricultural surpluses. The aim is to ensure that India's vast and
growing population continues to feed itself while boosting foreign exchange
earnings.
The Ministry of Agriculture boasts a phenomenal growth of food grains output
as perhaps the most outstanding achievement of India's economic performance
since independence.
The production of food grains has gone up from 51 tons in 1950-51 to a
record high of 182 tons in 1993-94, resulting in a marked increase in per
capita availability.
Agrobusiness is at the cutting edge of the latest green revolution. Given
that India is coming close to the limit of extensive cultivation,
agrobusiness is providing a new means of increasing productivity and
generating employment.
Compared with other sectors of Indian industry, employment generation in
food processing industries is today the largest per unit of investment.
Agrobusiness currently accounts for 52 per cent of total industrial
investment, employs 19 per cent of industrial labour (1.5m) and contributes
13.5 per cent of total industrial output.
With 4.2m hectares of irrigated and fertile land in which cropping intensity
is 18 per cent, the Punjab region has become strident in promoting
agrobusiness industries. A government agency, the Punjab Agro Industrial
Corporation, is actively pushing for enterprises which can produce processed
foods from French fries and chips to tomato puree, ketchup and wines.
Mr Narinder Singh Barak, the corporation's director, believes traditional
entrepreneurial skills combined with good climatic conditions have turned
agrobusiness into the backbone of the local economy.
'Now is the time to shift from wheat production to high value agricultural
production which can ensure higher returns for our farmers and earn us much
needed foreign exchange. Agrobusiness has become our top priority,' he says.
Nationwide, India's food processing industries have attracted more than
Rs300bn of domestic and foreign investment in the last two years, more than
any other sector except energy.
Government figures show that the installed capacity of the fruit and
vegetables processing sector has risen 25 per cent in the past three years,
while production has grown 100 per cent in the period. Exports of processed
fruit and vegetables have increased from Rs17.2bn to Rs47.1bn in three
years, a rise of about 70 per cent.
Mr Dhara Bir Sadharvall, a director of India's Agricultural and Processed
Food Products Authority, is optimistic about the government's economic
programme. 'Liberalisation is proving very good in the agricultural sector.
Everybody and anybody is now free to export anything he likes,' he says.
He concedes, however, that exports potential is being held back by transport
and storage problems. It is estimated that over 20 per cent of India's
agricultural produce goes to waste because of a lack of adequate storage
facilities, inadequate refrigeration, and poor roads.
Glossy handouts from the authority aim to convince the world that Indian
products can compete in price and quality in Middle East export markets.
However, the claim was undermined this month when officials predicted that
their efforts would suffer a setback as a result of the plague scare.
India was forced to postpone its onion harvest in the western regions where
the plague outbreak was first identified. Subsequently exporters were faced
with a blanket suspension of all food trade with the Middle East, which
accounts for 70 per cent of India agricultural exports.
There is little evidence that plague-infected produce has been exported, but
a damaging climate of suspicion among potential customers has been created.
Because food products destined for export were dumped on the domestic
market, some farmers have suffered losses.
Of more concern to economists such as Mr Ridley Nelson, head of the World
Bank's agricultural unit in Delhi, is that the government's liberalisation
programme has not removed the plethora of regulations that still riddle the
agricultural sector domestically.
The World Bank is listened to carefully by the Indian government which is
anxious to obtain development aid funding. The bank is considering extending
Dollars 100m of credits to help agricultural improvements in the Uttar
Pradesh region.
The bank recently submitted to the government the result of an extensive
research into the workings of various laws which hamper efforts at improving
commerce and investment. These include the Essential Commodity Act which
provides central and state government officials with wide-ranging powers to
intervene in the production, supply and distribution of essential
commodities.
Under the Act the powers of officials extend to the issuing of licences to
producers and distributors, the fixing of prices, the regulation of
inter-state trade, and the prohibition of financial transactions deemed
detrimental to the public interest.
The Act was promulgated in 1955, at a time of wide-scale shortages in food
grains and black marketing and rampant hoarding and profiteering. Mr Nelson
believes that it has long outlived its relevance.
Another legacy from the past which Mr Nelson would like to see tackled is
the Land Ceiling Act which is based on the principle that 'he who works the
land owns it' and so restricts farms ownership to smallholdings.
Given India's population pressures, a blanket removal of the ceiling and the
restoration of larger estates would be potentially explosive. But Mr Nelson
shares the view of some Indian entrepreneurs that the government should
extend exemption categories to agroprocessing and horticulture.
Free market economists remain critical of the government's regime of
subsidies on financial and environmental grounds. The World Bank holds that
Indian farmers would be better served if resources were diverted from
subsidies to much-needed infrastructure improvement as well as the
introduction of modern techniques for less wasteful use of water supply.
As they have done for centuries, in 1994 India's farmers still hold their
breath prior to the monsoon and thank the gods if rainfall is abundant.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (20): The squalor of centuries -
Environmentalists face a Herculean task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years after the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal, Indian
environmentalists hope that the present plague will provide fresh impetus
for making India a cleaner as well as safer place to live in. But the sheer
population pressure looks like making such a task a formidable one.
It is summed up in the scene on the banks of the Ganges near the north
Indian town of Kampur, where religious devotees sit praying to the holy
waters, offering garlands of flowers and occasionally soaking themselves as
they have done for centuries.
Nearby, untreated chemical waste from local tanneries is being poured into
the river, together with raw sewage. Vultures and stray dogs take turns to
pick among the garbage that rises in a steep gradient from the shore.
Occasionally, among the debris, a half burnt body is washed up.
For centuries, the Ganges has been venerated as a symbol of Indian
civilisation and tradition as well as sustenance. The river's basin is home
to 37 per cent of the country's population and extensively cultivated. But
it has also become an example of the difficulties India faces in developing
an effective environmental policy that can be justified on cultural, social
and economic grounds.
In 1986, during the premiership of the late Rajiv Gandhi, the Ganges became
the focus of a much-trumpeted national clean-up campaign.
'Ganga (Hindi for Ganges) is a symbol of our spirituality, our tradition,
our tolerance and and our synthesis. But it is the most polluted river with
sewage and pollution from cities and industries thrown into it. From now we
shall put a stop to all this,' declared Mr Gandhi.
Eight years on, the nine-year Ganga Action Plan has almost lost its way.
Under the scheme some new sewage and chemical waste treatment plants have
been constructed along the Ganges, improving some local pollution levels.
But the scheme in areas such as Kampur has fallen foul of a mixture of
under-funding bureaucratic inertia, industrial malpractice and continuing
large-scale illiteracy of sectors of the population which, while immersed in
their ritualistic religious practices, remain ignorant of the environmental
hazards threatening them.
Mr Kamal Nath, India's environment minister, says: 'The Ganga Plan in Kampur
has failed.'
In a candid interview with the FT, the minister admitted that in
implementing the Ganga scheme, the government had found itself having to
tread carefully so as not to upset local industrial interests and religious
sensitivities. But just how typical to the rest of India is Kampur?
According to Mr Nath, India stands out among Third World countries in that
it has consciously 'integrated conservation into our development process'.
Today, as he did in a passionate speech to the UN conference on environment
and development in June 1992 in Rio, Mr Nath lays great emphasis on India's
panoply of legal and administrative instruments aimed at checking
environmental degradation.
Beginning with the Wildlife Protection Action 1972 and extending to the more
recent setting of an emission standard for vehicles, India's environmental
legislation aims to protect everything from the most remote wildlife reserve
in the Himalayas to the most threatened urban landscape, be it old Delhi or
Calcutta.
Nath, a self-confessed 'politician, not an environmentalist', has actively
been courting non government organisations and other environmental groups
and involving them in the programme of his ministry.
New legislation, together with a growing public awareness of environmental
issues among the middle classes, is the most positive fall-out of the
catastrophic gas leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal,
central India, in 1984 which left an estimated 3,000 killed and more than
50,000 seriously injured.
There are currently statutory requirements for all large and medium sized
industries to install treatment plants for effluent and air pollution
filters.
Mr Shekhar Singh, an environmentalist expert at the Indian Institute of
Public Administration, a non government agency, says that the implementation
of environmental law remains 'very weak', and that the present government is
less ideologically committed than its predecessors to environmental issues.
The IPA has monitored 22 officially designated wildlife protected areas
around India which are nonetheless being threatened because of government
backed investment decisions, mainly energy related.
Mr Singh also believes that sheer population pressure combined with the
government commitment for greater economic liberalisation will further
undermine events for controlling industrial pollution.
The view is shared by Mr Uday Shanker, a features editor of Down To Earth, a
science and environmental fortnightly whose circulation has been boosted as
a result of growing public awareness. 'Today in India there is no single new
investment that does not come under close environmental scrutiny. But a
government that has embarked on a policy of rapid economic development is
bound to compromise on the environment,' Shankar says.
The evidence - not just in Kampur but elsewhere in India - is that
environmental policy continues to be breached rather more than practised.
At the Shiram food and fertiliser industries chemical works on the outskirts
of Delhi, the effluent is so clean that it is regularly passed through a
fish tank.
But the city's river continues to suffer the smells and dirt of chemical
bleach from smaller units and the widespread untreated sewage from large
sectors of the population still lacking basic sanitation.
The popular tourist location of the Taj Mahal has been declared a green zone
with local metal workshops closed under court order.
But as Mr Nath admits, the large scale closure of workshops - accounting for
about one third of India's manufacturing output - is politically impossible
because it would simply add to the thousands of Indians already destitute.
That, however, does not excuse many companies in India who, having installed
pollution control equipment, deliberately leave them switched off to save
costs knowing that during, the rare visits by government inspectors, the
inspectors can be bought off.
Perhaps the most problematic area remains that of religion. When I asked an
employee from a local tannery from Kampur why he was submerging himself in
the black water spewed out by his factory, he replied: 'Mother Ganga will
protect me.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (19): Where bureaucrats thrive - Bihar's
poverty is the worst in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bihar's riches are underground - coal, bauxite, copper, mica - and in its
fertile soil. But its poverty is just about everywhere. Aside from the
privileged mining and industrial workers who occupy neat rows of company
housing, the only significant number who can live in any comfort are the
bureaucrats in Patna, the state capital. Their swollen ranks and often amply
lined pockets attest to an administration which is certainly corrupt and
arguably bankrupt.
Doctors tell of going unpaid for months on end, until they can find a civil
servant prepared to authorise the release of the funds - for a
consideration.
Billions of rupees in central government grants are unspent every year
because Patna cannot find the matching funds these require.
In the latest financial year the planned provision of some Rs19bn, already
trimmed from Rs22bn in 1993-94, was slashed to Rs7.5bn for this reason.
Such disbursements from Delhi as do come through are frequently diverted to
fund current spending - primarily on the salaries of Bihar bureaucrats who
in many cases earn more than their central government counterparts. If the
money makes it to the upliftment projects for which it is intended, it may
first have spent a while in state coffers aiding cash flow.
For many on the streets of Patna - and the streets are home to many - cash
flow means a few rupees garnered from a passing motorist. More than 40 per
cent of the populace live below the poverty line, compared with the less
than 30 per cent average for all India.
And there is no sign that anything will improve, except perhaps in the
southern half of the state where the mining and industrial activities are
concentrated. A deal in September between the central and state governments
provided for the establishment of an autonomous council which will
administer much of the affairs of Jharkhand, the southern region.
The agreement was the culmination of a struggle for self-determination waged
by tribal peoples in the region and which predated independence from
Britain. Many local businessmen, tired of seeing their taxes disappear north
to Patna for little evident return, had latterly lent their backing to the
cause.
Jharkhand generates some three quarters of Bihar state revenues yet receives
only a quarter of spending on local services. And those are the official
figures: many in the private sector say that Patna's financial vortex has in
recent years left the south only about a tenth of state outlays.
Although the agreement to set up the council will not immediately free
Jharkhand from Patna, it is widely seen as a precursor either to full
statehood or to incorporation as a union territory responsible directly to
Delhi.
In the meantime, Bihar will be able to nominate only 10 per cent of the
membership of an otherwise elected council which will enjoy administrative
control over 40 government departments including agriculture, education and
health, raise its own local taxes, and receive other revenues from the
centre without diversion through Patna.
The state government maintains that the accord merely formalises the
existing treatment of Jharkhand's 40m people and will not impact on its
budget. 'Whatever we were getting, we will be getting,' says a Bihar
official.
Local economists doubt that. 'The condition of Bihar will be very much
worse,' says Mr Shaibal Gupta of the Asian Development Research Institute, a
Patna-based consultancy, who believes the state is 'slowly being written off
from the central scheme of things'.
It is less than clear why Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, Bihar chief minister,
should have signed up to a deal which goes substantially beyond an appointed
development council for the region which he had previously accepted. The
central authorities are thought to have warned him that funds could be cut
off unless he acquiesced.
But the breakthrough comes ahead of state elections due in Bihar early next
year, one of a batch of such polls in coming months which India's ruling
Congress party is treating as a key test of public support. Mr Yadav's
minority Janata Dal administration ousted Congress in Bihar last time round
in March 1990, and will be looking to consolidate its hold by lessening its
unpopularity in the south.
It and Congress will both seek to present themselves in Jharkhand as the
author of the agreement.
Mr Yadav came to power on a social justice platform promising to promote the
interests of the lower castes, of which he is a member, and minorities such
as the Moslems. To the extent that this has been achieved, it has largely
involved the creation of public sector jobs reserved for the so-called
backward and scheduled castes. The state payroll has risen by tens of
thousands since he assumed office.
While his concerns have been to the exclusion of any focus on investment-led
development, Mr Yadav cannot be blamed for all Bihar's ills. At the
beginning of the 1980s state output was on a par with that of neighbouring
West Bengal, but slipped back under a period of ineffectual Congress rule
while the state based around Calcutta began to prosper under an increasingly
investor-friendly Marxist administration.
Business can be done in Bihar, with a fight. After a court case, a batch of
new taxes on industry were overturned, though investment in several sectors
such as refining of edible oils has moved across state borders because of
better fiscal regimes elsewhere. Mr Shilendra Sinha, joint managing director
of Kalyanpur Cements, an associate of the Swiss Holderbank group, says: 'It
is difficult, but there is less competition.'
Kalyanpur this year built a cement plant in Bihar to replace an older
facility. It could do so because it is better positioned than most on the
state power grid, where interruptions in supply are legion. Businessmen
regard the Bihar State Electricity Board as among the least efficient in
India.
The largest power users will benefit from a central government relaxation in
private generation. Tata Iron and Steel Company (Tisco), part of the
country's biggest industrial group, has just won permission to build a 250MW
plant for use at its mill in Jamshedpur, south Bihar.
Mr Kishore Singh, Tisco's Patna representative and president of the local
Confederation of Indian Industry branch, says there is 'no doubt about the
potential' of Bihar, with its mineral wealth in the south and fertile soil
along the Ganges to the north.
But agriculture remains hampered by feudal landlords. Reinforced by the
caste system and the law of the gun which prevails in a number of areas,
they dictate what their tenant will grow and how he votes.
Land reform has not ranked among the achievements of chief minister Yadav,
who comes from a caste of cowherds. While his record in the towns seems no
better, Congress before him could also claim little in either urban or rural
progress.

studies garment export tactics

To sharpen their competitive edggarment exporters are increasingly seeking
collaborations with their foreign customers. The advantages accrue to both
sides. Customers who are confronted with a shrinking manufacturing base in
their country find India a low cost sourcing point. The Indian exporter gets
an assured buyer on a long term basis and much-needed technical assistance.
Examples abound: Gruppo La Perla and Mafatlal Industries, a Bombay based
textile company, have recently invested Rs135m in a modern garment factory
near Delhi. The factory is equipped with imported machines and its
production is being supervised by Italian technicians. Most of the fabric is
supplied by Mafatlal.
The garments are made exclusively for export and will be sold overseas under
La Perla's label.
In another Rs300m venture, Mafatlal is taking technical help from the German
company Schiesser to make premium quality knitted clothes. Schiesser has
agreed to buy back half of the total production.
These collaborations highlight the current concerns of the textile exports
industry. It faces the prospect of a free market since the quota system of
the existing Multi-Fibre Arrangement is to be phased out over a 10 year
period once Gatt comes into being. (Under bilateral agreements, most Western
countries impose annual quotas on certain textile items from India).
The government has warned exporters that the absence of quota restrictions
will not necessarily lead to higher export sales. Exporters will have easier
access to markets, but equally importing countries will have the freedom to
shop around. Unless Indian exporters can match their competitors on price
and quality, they could lose out.
Textiles and garments account for 26 per cent of the country's total
exports. The industry has been consistently surpassing targets in the last
three years. Export sales in the year to March 1994 were Dollars 8bn,
reflecting a 21 per cent growth over the previous year.
The ministry of textiles is confident that the Dollars 9bn target for the
current year will be achieved. Official figures show that exports in the
first quarter up to June 1994 have increased by 19 per cent over the same
period last year. Yet exporters are worried that this year's performance may
not be as spectacular as in the previous years. Garment exports in the first
quarter were Dollars 890m, about Dollars 70m more than in the same period
last year.
But according to Mr Arvind Pradhan, director of the Apparel Export Promotion
Council (AEPC), exporters do not have as many orders in hand as they used
to. At a recent buyer-seller conference in Europe organised by the AEPC,
'the response was poor', says Mr Pradhan. The AEPC has also organised trade
delegations to countries which are potential markets, such as Latin America;
it is urging exporters to look for new niches and non-quota items like
industrial garments and infant wear.
But quotas, particularly for the US which is a big customer, have not yet
been fully utilised. Exporters say that increased raw material costs,
chiefly yarn and fabric, have made their prices uncompetitive in the
American market. In August, a declaration by the US Consumer Products Safety
Commission that Indian-made chiffon skirts were inflammable led to
consignments being recalled and a ban on imports.
The government has taken steps to boost exports. For example, importing
textile machinery, both new and second hand, no longer requires a licence
and import duties have been brought down to 25 per cent. Exporters are being
asked to step up value addition. Though budget garments and grey fabrics
drive volumes, they are more price sensitive. In this segment, India's big
competitors are China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Exporters say that the measures taken by the government are not enough. They
would like local supplies of processed fabrics to be of consistent quality
and the freedom to import fabrics required against export commitments.
Some manufacturers have begun to take advantage of the new rules and are
investing in new technology. Large composite mills have brought in second
hand machinery from Europe and Japan. 'Improving quality by upgrading
technology is the only way to survive and grow,' says Mr Kamlesh Kapadia,
Mafatlal's vice president, exports. Joint ventures with foreign textile
companies, he adds, will contribute to improving the product mix.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (18): Bare-footed boot-makers - Jimmy Burns
probes conditions in the booming light industry sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a flourishing equity market in Bombay, and a rash of high-tech
companies in Bangalore. Foreign trade missions and multinationals are
knocking on government doors. So much for the new India.
But visit the tanneries of Kanpur, or the brass makers of Moradabad, and you
glimpse another India, where small is not so much beautiful as rather ugly.
Notwithstanding a good export performance, people in these places -
including young children - work in conditions which the developed world
banished from the factory floor decades ago.
Investment in technology, training, and health and safety is kept to a
minimum. Instead the focus is on low wages payable to a seemingly endless
supply of unskilled destitute labour which still manages to churn out
'quality' hand-made goods to order.
The tanneries and the brass workshops belong to India's small scale
industrial sector which has for decades retained an important and privileged
status in the local economy.
Small scale industries employ 139m people, account for 35 per cent of total
manufacturing output, and some 34 per cent of total exports.
Since independence the sector has been highly protected largely for
socio-political reasons. It has become a kind of informal welfare agency
capable of providing jobs to the country's massive population, but providing
little incentive for investment in new production techniques or a safer
working environment.
Now, however, the sector is facing a fresh challenge. As the Indian
government opens up the country to foreign investment and gradually
deregulates the economy, small scale industries are being given the
opportunity to prosper, but in a potentially much more competitive
environment.
As Mr A Arunachalam, the minister for state for industry, put it recently:
'There are immense opportunities for small scale industries in global
markets ..but they will have to upgrade technologies and the quality of
their products, and formulate strategies to that end.'
The scale of the challenge facing India's small scale industries was
underlined recently by research jointly undertaken by the National Council
of Applied Economic Research and the German Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung.
The research, one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken of the
sector, found that over the last four decades the small scale sector had
both grown and diversified considerably, made a significant contribution to
employment generation and exports, and to a large extent managed to meet the
consumer demand of the Indian masses even if the products sold on the home
market were generally of poor quality. The sector produces a range of more
than 7,000 products, a large number of which are consumer items.
The overall conclusion, however, was that the sector remained structurally
weak and highly dependent on Government help and protection. The report
noted: 'The sector is beset with several problems, such as sub-optimal scale
of operations, sickness and morbidity, technological obsolescence and poor
market image. A bandwagon approach leads to overcrowding in the same lines
of production. Consequently, there is intense inter se competition, lower
capacity utilisation and compromise on quality and standards to make way for
price cutting. The small scale sector has not been encouraged to grow
vertically and face competition.'
The following were among the findings of the research carried out among a
sample of 657 small scale companies located in various parts of India:
Low level technology: 56.62 per cent of companies had a manual manufacturing
process; 36.66 per cent were semi-automated; while only 4.72 per cent were
fully automated. Most companies said they could not afford testing
facilities, while 83 per cent of respondents said they did not perceive the
non-availability of trained staff to be a problem.
Limited institutional finance: Inadequacy of credit together with excessive
and cumbersome bureaucratic procedures in the way of obtaining it was
identified as a major problem by many of companies surveyed. It was pointed
that one of the major impediments in getting adequate finance was the lack
of trained banking staff which in turn led to a mistaken assessment of the
companies' requirements.
Poor infrastructure: Companies faced problems of obtaining industrial space,
as well as inadequate supplies of power and water. Other weak areas
identified were transport, warehousing and effluent disposal.
Some of the problems identified in this wide ranging research are only too
evident in towns such as Kanpur and Moradabad, where whole communities have
grown up around local small scale industries with mixed benefits in social
and economic terms.
In Kampur, one of the more 'successful' small scale companies is Sultan
Tanneries. Sales last year at Rs300m were 15 per cent up on the previous
year, with 45 per cent of manufactured 'tanned' leather products exported.
Senior executive Mehmood Alam resists the suggestion that his company is a
sweat shop. His are the best tanners in the world, working for a tenth or
more of what they would be paid in Europe or the US. (His investment in
machinery has been limited and will only be significantly increased if and
when this comparative wage advantage is lost.)
The tanners do, however, walk around bare footed and without protective
clothing in an unfiltered atmosphere heavy with toxic fumes and liquids.
None of them wears the safety leather boots which they are tanning and which
are exported to the UK for use on the factory floor of British chemical
companies.
Mr Alam insists that as one of the bigger companies in Kanpur he cannot
afford to play 'hide and seek' with government health inspectors and
pollution controllers. But when I visited the factory young boys were
working on the production line and the pollution control equipment was
switched off.
Success and squalor coexist too in Moradabad, a town whose brassware exports
were valued at Rs6.5bn last year, a 30 per cent increase over the previous
three years.
One of the oldest and most successful companies, C L Gupta &amp; Sons
(established 1889), boasts an ability to respond quickly to customer
specifications on anything from a candle stick to a bed. The company's
quality hand crafted brass products made in India are increasingly seen in
US design shops and European antique sales. They are made by workers,
including children, earning Rs25 - Rs35 a day and lacking the face and body
protection which is compulsory under western health and safety standards.
In Moradabad, a UN sponsored training centre run by government officials is
trying to bring about an improvement in the quality of metal finished
products.
And yet, in a typical Indian paradox, Moradabad brass makers complain that
their export efforts are hampered by constant power shortages and bad
transport communications with New Delhi.
What the government has promised so far is less bureaucracy and better
managed credit facilities. It is also opening up local industry to foreign
investment by liberalising, among other things, its policy of product
reservation whereby selected products can only be manufactured by small
scale Indian companies (although multinationals are not yet allowed full
access to the much coveted icecream market). The hope is that investment
will improve productivity without harming jobs.
It remains to be seen when and how a new breed of entrepreneur can emerge
from the sweat shops of Kanpur and Moradabad.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (16): Silk, coffee and silicon chips - The
southern state of Karnataka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Karnataka's chief minister, Mr M. Veerappa Moily, boasts that the south
Indian state has 'substituted the red carpet for red tape' in its dealings
with potential new investors. New foreign investments, he says, are handled
by a single agency and cleared within 30 days.
Judged by the number of Western high-tech companies which have operations in
Bangalore, Karnataka's capital, Mr Moily's aggressively pro-business
administration is succeeding, in this area at least.
Over the past decade Bangalore has reinforced its claim to be India's
Silicon Valley. Among the multinationals which have established operations
in the leafy Bangalore environs are 3M, AT &amp; T, Digital Equipment, L M
Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Motorola, Sanyo, Siemens, and Texas
Instruments. Some are wholly owned subsidiaries, others joint ventures with
Indian partners.
India's eighth largest state in terms of both land area and population,
Karnataka generates about Rs23bn of annual revenues from electronics and is
responsible for about a fifth of India's total electronics output. A tenth
of its 47m population lives in Bangalore, a city known for its pleasant
climate and friendly people.
Karnataka was one of the first states in India to industrialise and
pioneered hydro-electric power in South-east Asia with the building of the
Sivasamudram project in 1902. Ironically, although electric power was one of
the catalysts for the early industrialisation of the state, today a shortage
of power is one of the main constraints on economic growth.
The big surge in industrialisation came in the 1940s and 1950s when the
Indian government decided to base several big public sector companies in
Bangalore including Bharat Electronics and Bharat Earth Movers, Hindustan
Aeronautics, Hindustan Machine Tools and Indian Telephones Industries.
These companies have played an important role in the state and have provided
a strong magnet for ancillary companies, drawing in small-scale industries
which could work as sub-contractors to the big industries.
Today, Karnataka's main industries include electronics, computer
engineering, computer software and services, telecommunications,
aeronautics, machine tools, watch-making, electrical engineering, aluminium,
steel, cement, sugar, food processing, textiles and mining.
Other factors which have contributed to Karnataka's industrial growth have
included an abundance of natural mineral resources including high grade iron
ore, manganese and gold, a well developed network of research and research
establishments, a large pool of engineers and a high literacy rate of 56 per
cent compared with a national average of 52 per cent.
Bangalore, which is 3,000 feet above sea level, also benefits from a
particularly pleasant climate and relatively light rainfall. It is green
with parks and tree-lined roads - quite unlike other big industrial or
business centres, such as Bombay. It has become a popular city with young
educated Indians who frequent Bangalore's many western-style bars, cafes and
boutiques.
There is therefore a large pool of talent which foreign companies in the
electronics and computer software sectors in particular are keen to tap. The
Indian Institute of Science, the Indian Space Research Institute, National
Aeronautic Laboratory and the Central Machine Tool Institute are all to be
found in Bangalore together with a large number of engineering colleges,
training centres and universities.
Bangalore in particular has become known as an important source of software
engineering talent since the mid 1980s when many US technology companies
realised that demand was far outstripping the supply in the US.
Although wage rates are rising rapidly, foreign business leaders say it is
still possible to hire graduate engineers for between Dollars 1,000 to
Dollars 2,000 a month, a fraction of the cost of similarly qualified
employees in the US.
As a result many US, European and Asian information technology and
telecommunications companies have established computer services operations
in the state, mostly to service their internal software or chip design
requirements. Foreign investors say they are attracted by the state's
relatively good record in terms of labour relations, and usually harmonious
community relations as well as the Karnataka government's positive attitude
towards investors.
'Karnataka has been a magnet for foreign investment,' says Mr J C Lynn, the
state's chief secretary. Among companies which have recently chosen to site
their Indian headquarters in Bangalore are Brooke Bond, Lipton and
Britannia.
Under Mr Moily, whose tenure in office began in late 1992 after his
predecessor was ousted because of alleged corruption, the state has drawn up
a new development plan.
As part of its industrial policy the state established the first 'electronic
city' near Bangalore in the early 1980s and is developing two more
electronic cities at Mysore and Dharwad. But despite this focus on
electronics, Karnataka has also made considerable efforts to diversify its
industrial and agricultural base. At Mangalore, Karnataka's main port, a
large oil refinery has been built and is now being expanded. Similarly there
are plans to expand steel and cement production elsewhere in the state.
Irrigation schemes in the northern part of the state have allowed sugar-cane
and rice to be grown in some areas, and the state is rich in teak, rosewood
and sandalwood, particularly from Mysore, Karnataka's beautiful and historic
second city. Karnataka accounts for nearly half of India's silk production
and 80 per cent of the nation's coffee production. Sericulture employs about
200,000 people in the state and generates annual revenues of about Rs2.8bn
including RS1.6bn of foreign exchange earnings.
In industry, however, the rapid growth and development have brought new
problems - in particular, shortages of power, water and transportation.
Bangalore's airport has been brought up to international standards and there
are tentative plans to alleviate the city's traffic problems by setting up a
15 mile elevated mass transport system.
However, the top priority is to meet industry's appetite for electrical
power which already outstrips supply. As a result many companies install
their own generators. Mr Lynn, however, insists that the state can expand
its power capacity.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (15): Room for everybody - Steel makers are
now less terrified of imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fear that lower duties on imported steel would harm domestic steel
producers has proved unfounded.
The duties are being steadily reduced as part of the federal government's
trade reforms programme.
According to Mr J M Bhasin, director of the government-owned Rashtriya Ispat
which owns a 3m tonne shore-based steel plant at Vizag, steel imports in the
current year will exceed 1.5m tonnes, compared with 1.01m in the year to
March 1994.
Mr Bhasin explained, however, that imports are rising because of the growth
in Indian domestic demand for steel. Since this is also benefiting the home
producers, the latter are no longer worried by imports.
With almost three years of recession at an end, Indian steel production,
according to the steel ministry, is likely to go up to 17.84m tonnes in the
current year from 15.13m tonnes in 1993-94 when there was a marginal fall in
output.
Besides some high grades of steel which are not produced locally, India
imports billets to be converted into finished products.
The Indian steel producers know that import duties on steel will be further
reduced from the present average of 50 per cent. According to Mr J Mehra,
chairman of Rashtriya Ispat, 'the Indian manufacturers can meet the
challenge of a lower import duty regime'. In a reference to CIS countries,
he added: 'we must guard ourselves against the dumping of steel by countries
which have excess capacity and which need foreign exchange badly.'
Following forceful representations by local producers, the government has
simplified procedures for filing petitions against dumping. However, Mr B
Muthuraman, vice president of Tata Iron &amp; Steel, is concerned about the
import of a substantial quantity of seconds at heavily discounted prices.
'This is particularly going to hurt the local producers of hot rolled coils
and electrical sheet,' he says.
The removal of all controls has seen Indian iron and steel export rising
sharply from 910,000 tonnes in 1992-93 to 2.22m tonnes in 1993-94 worth
Rs17.64bn (Pounds 353m).
Imports include not only low value items such as sponge iron and pig iron,
but its steel export basket now includes cold rolled and galvanised sheet
and coils. The recession had forced Indian manufacturers to the export
market.
'True, we went for export in a big way because of the recession at home. It
will not do the industry any good if it is to export only when there is a
demand shortfall within the country. The experience of the last two years
should lead the industry to adopt the strategy to export about 20 per cent
of its production,' said Mr Muthuraman.
The world trade in steel is about 125m tonnes and it should not be difficult
for India to have a share of about 3 per cent of it, according to Mr Bhasin.
While India is principally targeting China, a major importer of steel, and
south and south-east Asian countries, industry officials think that there is
scope for export of steel to the US, Europe and Japan. Mr Santosh Mohan Dev,
steel minister, is trying to convince the government that 'suitable
incentives should be given to steel export'.
Nearly 4.7m tonnes of finished steel capacity, involving an investment of
Rs84bn, is in various stages of implementation. Most of the new projects
will be exporting a good portion of their output.
The export capability of the Steel Authority of India which owns four
integrated steel plants will improve considerably as it completes the Rs70bn
modernisation programme. The same will happen with Tata Iron &amp; Steel, which
is investing heavily in modernisation and capacity expansion.
India's biggest steel biggest exporter is the three-year old Rashtriya Ispat
plant, incorporating the latest technology. Industry officials point out
that as a result of the deregulation of steel in July 1991 and the removal
of controls on price and distribution of the metal in January 1992, the
steel sector is inviting new investment.
The induction of the state of the art steel making technology in the country
has become easier with the government allowing up to 51 per cent foreign
equity investment in steel projects.
According to the steel ministry, the government has so far given approval
for foreign equity investment of over Rs8.60bn in various projects. Although
India is rich in iron ore and coal, the two principal inputs for making
steel, the per capita consumption of steel here is less than 25 kilos a
year, compared with the world average of 136 kilos.
But industry officials expect that in the next five years, the demand for
long products, used mainly in construction work, will grow at 6 per cent a
year and that flat products, used by the automobile, white goods and
engineering industries will rise by 10 per cent.
The government predicts that by 2002 the demand for steel will be about 31m
tonnes a year. The country's nominal steel-making capacity is about 27m
tonnes. But of the 7.5m tonne capacity in the mini steel sector, half is
sick.
Mr Mehra said, 'if we have to satisfy a demand for 31m tonnes by 2002, then
we must start planning for the creation of an additional capacity of at
least 8m tonnes of steel now. Steel in India is considered a safe
investment. It should not be difficult to mobilise resources to fund the
creation of new steel-making capacity.'
The initiative for the new capacity creation has to come from the private
sector since the government has decided not to build any new steel plant.

amount taken out may not exceed the amount taken in.
All money must be exchanged through authorised banks
and money-changers. Foreign exchange receipts should
be retained.

valid for 120 days to tourists. The visa is valid for
entering India within six months of the date of issue.
Business travellers should apply through their companies
for a  multi-entry business visa, which is normally given
readily with a validity of one year but with a maximum stay
of 120 days.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (13): Receipts valued at Dollars 10bn -
Martin Brice describes a new way to buy shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's growing attractiveness to international investors is shown by the
dramatic increase over the last two years in the purchase of shares in
Indian companies through the medium of Global Depositary Receipts.
These documents, issued by depositary banks, are used to facilitate purchase
of shares in the issuer's home market. Since the first Indian GDR was issued
in 1992, the total value has risen to Dollars 10bn. About Dollars 4bn of
this is based on the shares of 50 Indian companies. Some Dollars 2.1bn of
Indian GDRs have been issued this year alone.
Mr David Gibbons, head of India research at James Capel said: 'India has
streaked ahead of China. Using GDRs it has moved with astonishing rapidity
and if that continues India will have a huge advantage.'
Mr Ian Hannam, director of Jardine Fleming, the invest- ment bank, says:
'The great thing about corporate India is that the shackles are now coming
off. You have the potential of huge growth with a proper regulatory
framework to work within.'
GDRs were pioneered in 1990 by the US Citibank, but today much of the GDRs
business is sourced from London-based investment banks and 90 depositary
receipts are traded via SEAQ International and listed on the Luxembourg
stock exchange. In August, the London Stock Exchange changed its rules to
allow GDRs to be listed there.
GDRs and the shares they represent are traded indep- endently, which often
means they fetch a lower or higher price than the shares in the home market.
The GDRs are easier to trade and settlement is simpler than dealing in
shares on the local market.
According to Mr Hannam, India has many attractions over other emerging
markets, particularly the existence of a middle class as big as the
population of the US. It also had a recognised legal and accounting
framework for the ownership of assets and the use of the English language.'
Mr Tristan Clube, director of Edinburgh-based Martin Currie Investment
Management, which runs the Dollars 270m India Opportunities investment fund,
agrees: 'We are seeing for the first time the spending power of the vast
middle class.'
This middle class is growing at 12 per cent a year, says Mr Jeff Chowdhry, a
director of BZW Investment Management, which runs the BZW India Fund. 'This
is creating incredible demand for domest- ically-produced goods. This
consumer demand is being unshackled by liberalisation.'
The liberalisation process was irreversible, he added, predicting that the
earnings of Indian companies would grow by 35 per cent each year for the
next two years.
Expectation of high returns has prompted many inter- national investors to
buy GDRs issued by Indian companies, but these are by their nature
restricted to big companies with a market capitalisation of more than about
Dollars 300m. Mr Chowdhry said: 'The value in India and the thing that makes
it most attractive is not large capitalisation companies, it is medium-sized
companies.'
Shares in big companies were selling on a price/earnings ratio of about 30
times, whereas medium-sized companies sold on a profits/earnings ratio of 15
times, making them much cheaper as investments.
International investors can also gain access to Indian equities by buying
into investment funds. Mr Clube of Martin Currie points to the growth in
interest in Indian equities by referring to the increase in the number of
funds. When his India Opp- ortunities fund was launched last year there were
a handful of similar funds. Now there were about 22.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (12): It's almost a love affair - Wall
Street shows an unbroken confidence in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American investors' ardour for India has held up remarkably well, even
though their love affair with emerging stock markets has cooled noticeably
this year because of the volatile performance of equities in many developing
countries.
While the impressive gains of the Bombay market in 1994 has played a great
part in sustaining US enthusiasm, Wall Street shows an underlying confidence
in India's long-term economic and political future. It reflects the
expectation that India's economy will enjoy steady growth over the next
decade, and that the government's policy of liberalising the economy and
financial markets will remain on course.
US investors participate in the Indian equity market mostly via the
specialist country or regional emerging market funds managed by the big
banks, securities houses and fund groups. There are also two closed-end
funds listed on the New York Stock Exchange - the India Growth Fund and the
India Fund.
There are no accurate figures on the extent of US portfolio investment in
India, but Mr Derek Hargreaves, an economist with Morgan Guaranty in New
York, estimates that of the approximately Dollars 5bn that foreign portfolio
investors are expected to put into the Indian market this year, 'a very
substantial proportion' will have come from the US. Although the rate of
inflows has dropped from its peak late last year of between Dollars 600m and
Dollars 700m a month to around Dollars 450m today, the total is impressive
considering that foreign inflows were negligible until a few years ago.
Foreign money has been moving into India in increasingly large amounts ever
since the government began to open up the domestic markets to outside
capital three years ago as part of its policy of liberalising the country's
once almost entirely closed economy.
Ms Joyce Cornell, a fund manager at the Boston-based investment group
Scudder (which has about Dollars 4bn invested in emerging equity markets)
says of the changes in India: 'Roughly three years ago they began to open up
to the rest of the world, and started to reduce their regulatory regime,
which had all but strangled the economy. That reversal, and the change in
policy to reduce regulation, reduce tariffs, and open up to world markets
has been a big plus.'
Mr Vinod Sethi of Morgan Stanley neatly encapsulates Wall Street's view of
India's liberalisation policy: 'Here is a country that after 45 years is
doing the right things.' Mr Sethi manages about Dollars 2bn of the US bank's
Dollars 7bn emerging markets equity portfolio, with investments in 170
Indian stocks, including leading companies such as the housing development
corporation HESE, the truck manufacturer Telco, and BHEL, the power
equipment manufacturer which went public in a quasi-privatisation earlier
this year.
Privatisations such as BHEL have played an important role in luring US funds
to India, and there are more in the pipeline. Mr Kishor Chaukar, who heads
an asset management joint venture set up earlier this year by India's ICI
Securities and the US bank Morgan Guaranty, says the Indian government is
currently preparing a sixth round of disinvestment in industries such as
steel, oil, and telecommunications. 'Every three to six months the
government is pushing a good bit of equity into the stock market,' he says.
The main attraction for US investors, however, is still the expectation of
healthy economic and corporate earnings growth. The US broking house
Oppenheimer, which manages the NYSE-listed India Fund, forecasts that
corporate earnings will grow by 35 per cent in the current fiscal year. Most
economists expect India's economy to grow at a rate of 6 to 8 per cent over
the next five to 10 years.
As Mr Sethi points out, there is considerable upside potential in Indian
stocks because there is so much room for the private sector to grow. 'The
private sector represents about 14 per cent of GNP, and is growing at twice
the overall GNP rate. So for every incremental GNP increase, the corporate
sector is doing twice as better.'
Investors also have the chance to benefit in the expansion of an already
vast consumer sector, says Mr Sethi. 'India also has a middle class of 250m
people today - as big as all of the US. This middle class is likely to
double in size over the next 10 to 15 years .. Stock market players make
money on the rate of change, and the rate of change in India is so high.'
Investing in India, however, is not without its risks. The stock market
scandal of 1992, which pricked a speculative bubble and interrupted a bull
market, left some ugly scars, and the quality of securities regulation
remains a worry for overseas investors.
There are also concerns that the poor state of the country's
telecommunications, energy and transport infrastructure will slow the
economy's growth. The stock market infrastructure is another source of
worry, says Mr Sethi of Morgan Stanley. 'Here is a capital market used to
retail investing, but its composition is moving toward institutional
investing, and the custody infrastructure is grossly underdeveloped.'
Political risk is another factor for US investors to consider. Yet, although
India has seen several of its most prominent democratic leaders
assassinated, has endured a series of violent clashes between different
ethnic and religious groups, and lives with permanent military tensions on
its border with Pakistan, US investors are surprisingly sanguine about the
political risks inherent in investing in the country. 'It is a much more
homogeneous society than we realise from outside,' says Ms Cornell of
Scudder. 'There are ethnic tensions, but there are in the US too. They are
not likely to shake the system to its roots.'
However, Ms Cornell does worry about whether liberalisation is proceeding
too slowly. 'They've done the easy stuff, but they've got the hard stuff
ahead of them. There is a lot of overmanning, and the laws make it difficult
to lay people off, so there are big inefficiencies .. The pace of change is
very ponderous.'
Yet, Mr Terry Mills, who runs JP Morgan's Indian corporate finance unit in
London, says that the slow progress of liberalisation is not necessarily a
negative. 'India has been criticised for not changing fast enough. My view
is that there may be some benefits to not changing too fast - it's giving
the economy and the social environment time to adapt .. It also makes it
easier to control inflation.'
Too slow or not, the majority of US institutions seem confident that the
changes in India are irreversible. 'They've gone beyond the point of no
return,' says Ms Cornell. Also, the economy appears set on a path of
sustained growth. Over the long term, that spells plenty of opportunities
for overseas investors. As Mr Sethi of Morgan Stanley puts it: 'You will
have some broken dreams in the emerging markets universe as some countries
don't live up to expectations. But this thing (in India) is for real.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (11): Here comes the real competition -
Foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign bankers have arrived.
Bombay's business district is buzzing with tales of the six-figure dollar
salaries being paid by some Wall Street investment banks, luxury hotel
suites booked for six months at a time and soaring office rental costs in
the Nariman Point business district.
In India's financial capital, merchant banks from around the globe are vying
for a share of the fees and underwriting opportunities generated by the
Indian government's liberalisation programme and the opening up of the
economy.
Many Wall Street and London investment banks have already established a
presence in India, often through formal, or informal, links with their
emerging Indian counterparts.
Foreign fund managers and stockbrokers are chasing the business generated by
the growing number of registered foreign institutional investors and are
busy establishing operations in Bombay to service their new clients. Among
those which have won regulatory approval to handle foreign portfolio
investments in Indian stocks are Kleinwort Benson, Credit Lyonnais
Securities and Australian-owned Marlin Partners.
Other stockbrokers who have established a presence in India include James
Capel, the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation subsidiary, Nomura
Securities from Japan and Smith New Court which is negotiating to acquire a
majority stake in an unidentified Bombay-based firm.
Jardine Fleming, which also has an Indian domestic merchant banking licence,
has rapidly expanded its operations in Bombay since they were set up in
April 1992 and now employs 100 people including 24 analysts. Mr Mark
Bullough, managing director, is bullish on the prospects. 'We believe that
international investors in emerging markets are still dramatically
underweighted and we believe the size of the market, both domestic and
international, is going to grow very rapidly in part because the private
sector is raising new money onshore and offshore, in part due to
privatisations.'
Meanwhile the foreign commercial banks are also targeting the
sub-continent's increasingly sophisticated corporate customers and the
rapidly growing middle class with its appetite for credit cards, automated
teller machines and western-style personal banking.
By encouraging foreign banks to establish or expand their Indian operations
 -and by licensing new private banks with up to 20 per cent foreign equity -
the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India are gambling that the
increased competition will kick-start a long overdue modernisation of
India's antiquated and inefficient state-controlled banking and financial
sectors.
The authorities believe that foreign commercial and investment banks, with
their international experience and wide usage of information technology,
will help broaden the range of services for corporate and retail bank
customers and accelerate the introduction of new technology into the Indian
public banking sector.
The former British colonial banks, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, and
Grindlays Bank - now ANZ Grindlays - together with Citibank of the US have
had a long-standing presence in India and were allowed to remain under
foreign control when the domestic banks were nationalised, although their
growth was severely restricted. Nevertheless they were able to provide a
broader and better range of services than most domestic banks and carved out
a niche at the top end of the market making healthy profits thanks in part
to India's highly regulated interest rate structure which guaranteed large
spreads.
More recently interest rate deregulation - introduced as part of the
financial sector reforms - has reduced those margins and forced the foreign
banks to turn to new areas such as providing custodian services to foreign
institutional investors, credit cards for domestic retail consumers and
treasury management services and sophisticated derivative products for their
corporate customers.
'Since deregulation, margins have come down but compared with international
levels they are still above the norm,' says Mr Ravish Chopra, HSBC's deputy
chief executive in India.
Meanwhile, competition is increasing. Since November 1991, the government
has approved requests from eight foreign banks, including Germany's Dresdner
Bank and Chase Manhattan of the US, to open maiden branches while permitting
branch expansion by existing foreign banks on a case-by-case basis - most
existing foreign banks have been given permission to open one or two new
branches.
Last month, National Westminster bank became the first foreign financial
institution to announce that it was taking advantage of the new private
sector bank ownership rules to acquire a 20 per cent stake in HDFC Bank, a
commercial bank being set up by the Housing Development Finance Corporation.
Most of the newcomers will target the wholesale and corporate banking areas
since they lack the branch network needed to support an assault on the
Indian retail sector. But this constraint does not apply to some of the more
well established banks which are now actively expanding their branch and
retail banking operations.
For example, Standard Chartered has recently announced plans to restructure
its existing 24 branches and add new branches in six key cities. Citibank,
which has had operations in India since 1902, is also targeting the retail
sector, although its limited branch network of six branches in four cities
means it has had to find other ways to tap the market. It was the first bank
in India to introduce car-loans and the first to introduce credit cards in
1990 when it acquired Diners Club. Since then it has added Visa and
Mastercharge.
HSBC added a new branch in Bangalore in 1992 and now has 23 branches in
seven cities. 'We would like to expand further,' says Mr Chopra who notes,
however, that the Reserve Bank of India is proceeding cautiously. 'Licenses
are being given out in ones and twos,' he says.
Many believe the process has been slowed by the 1992 Bombay securities
scandal which implicated a number of foreign banks. In the wake of the scam
the Reserve Bank has imposed fines of Rs1.47bn including Rs1.24bn against
foreign banks, prompting some foreign bankers to complain privately that
they were made scapegoats in the affair and that their fines are
disproportionately large. Mr D R Mehta, deputy governor of the RBI, rejects
this suggestion and insists that once in India the foreign banks receive
equal treatment with their domestic counterparts.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (9): Embarrassment of riches - The capital
market is feeling the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas investors are finding ingenious ways to tap the buoyant Indian
capital market. The growth of dedicated mutual funds in New York and London
this year caused India's stock markets to groan under the weight of large
capital flows.
More than 200 foreign institutions bought stocks worth Dollars 2.56bn over
the year to last September, boosting India's foreign exchange reserves to
more than Dollars 18bn.
However, the overworked custodial services rang alarm bells, saying they
were unable to handle the massive inflows.
Cumbersome share transfer procedures brought the delivery mechanism to a
virtual halt. The authorities had to devise a modus vivendi of 'jumbo'
certificates to cover the bulk share transfers and reduce the FIIs' paper
work.
To avoid the hassles, overseas investors negotiated their stock purchases
directly with companies through so-called 'preferential allotments'. The
Securities Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, intervened and set
a five-year freeze on such transactions, stirring a hornet's nest.
Mr SS Nadkarni, SEBI chairman, justified the freeze, saying 'it was an
effort at establishing a level playing field'.
The justification for the freeze was that companies offered discounts to the
market price that were not available to other investors. That made the
preferential allotments less attractive to overseas investors. 'Any
investment with a freeze is not a saleable product. FIIs want an
unencumbered exit route,' said Mr NJ Jhaveri, chairman of I-Sec, a JP
Morgan-ICICI merchant bank.
The new route for the overseas investors and mutual funds is India paper
floated by the corporate sector on the international market. That
eliminated, albeit temporarily, the hassles in accessing the local stock
markets. Some half a dozen India-dedicated mutual funds mobilised Dollars
l03bn in the first quarter this year, Morgan Stanley accounting for half of
it.
The Euro-issue route would be the mainstay for overseas investors as the
Indian authorities grappled with structural reforms at the stock markets and
created new institutions to handle the capital flows.
The exit of overseas investors was seen as a blessing: pressures eased and
there was less chance of the stock market overheating.
The BSE 30-share index is hovering around 4400 after hitting a peak of 4500
on August 31.
The launch of the National Stock Exchange in Bombay exacerbated tensions
between the NSE and the Bombay Stock Exchange, India's largest. Opposition
to reforms at BSE is subdued and the authorities are to computerise trading
and settlement procedures.
Acknowledging the slippages, Mr N. Shankar, BSE general manager, said that
the computerisation would be completed in four stages by the end of next
year. But the automated NSE has fallen short of expectations. Against a
target of Rs10bn of trades a day, the debt instruments traded in the first
four months were less than Rs300m a day.
There is not enough business for the 95 brokers. But the NSE's strong point
is transparency, which makes it attractive to institutional investors. If
the BSE modernises quickly, competition between the two exchanges should
sharpen, benefiting the investors. A decision on admitting the corporate
members at the BSE would be hastened.
Local brokerages, which are partnerships with unlimited liability, resisted
the entry of corporate members with limited liability into their exclusive
club. The entry of corporates would pave the way for foreign brokerages.
In the meantime, Jardine Fleming and Australian-owned Marlin Partners, who
have set up shop in Bombay, have started making purchases with the help of
local brokers. India opened its doors to nine foreign brokers 15 months ago.
The State Bank of India and ICICI are establishing custodial facilities,
which should be ready in about a year. The scenario for investment banks has
changed. Most merchant banks have set up shop in India.
There is friction between local and overseas merchant banks as they consider
the ideal ideal structure for overseas merchant banks.
The joint venture between Peregrine of Hong Kong and ITC Classic, a
subsidiary of ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries, floundered on the
issue of management control. It was an equal joint venture and ITC Classic
was not ready to part with the key one percentage point equity.
Salomon Brothers quietly told its Indian partner, Ind-Global Financial
Services, that it would open a branch in Bombay next April. The tenuous
relationship between Merrill Lynch and DSP Financial Services is continuing.
Capital market modernisation should gather speed next year as competition
softens resistance.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (8): Writing is on the wall for controllers
 -The highly regulated financial system is being drastically overhauled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's financial system is being transformed. The highly regulated system
dominated by state-controlled institutions is being pushed aside to make way
for what policy makers hope will be a modern, efficient system based on
market mechanisms.
Some significant reforms have taken place in monetary policy where there has
been a marked shift from direct instruments of control, such as the
prescription of reserve requirements for banks, administered interest rates
and credit controls, towards indirect instruments such as the freeing of
interest rates and the use of open market operations.
The restrictions placed on commercial banks over their applications of funds
have been eased and both the cash reserve requirement and the statutory
liquidity ratio, which lay down the proportion of incremental deposits which
must be held as cash deposits or eligible government securities with the
reserve bank, are being reduced.
At the same time, the priority sector lending requirements and credit norms
imposed on the banks have been relaxed, while controls on interest rates
have been curbed. On October 17, most of the remaining controls on bank
lending rates - except those over small loans - were scrapped to promote
cheaper credit, greater liberalisation in financial markets and more
competition in the banking industry.
Perhaps even more important, the government and the reserve bank have signed
an agreement to phase out ad hoc treasury bills, on which the government
paid a fixed interest rate of 4.6 per cent.
Along with open market auctions, new government money market and debt
instruments now include 91-day and 364-day treasury bills, longer dated five
and 10-year securities and of zero coupon bonds. In addition, a system of
primary dealers is planned to encourage the growth of the secondary
government securities market.
The authorities have also unveiled a comprehensive programme to strengthen
the state-owned banks and increase competition. New prudential norms have
been prescribed and commercial banks have been told they must meet the Basle
Accord minimum 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement by 1996.
To assist the process, the Word Bank is working on a new Dollars 600m loan
for nine selected public banks which will provide an incentive for
recapitalisation as well as general development. Three of the banks have
already reached the 8 per cent target, but the other six would share a
Dollars 300m recapitalisation loan. Another Dollars 100m would be earmarked
for technical assistance and the final Dollars 200m tranche would provide a
backstop facility for export finance.
After the Rs40bn Bombay securities scandal in 1992 which implicated a number
of domestic and foreign banks, Mr DR Mehta, Reserve Bank deputy governor,
says the central bank has 'totally revamped its regulation and supervision
system', splitting the two functions and creating an autonomous Board for
Financial Supervision.
The government has cut its stake in two large medium-term lending
institutions to below 50 per cent and has approved private ownership up to
49 per cent for other state-owned banks as part of their recapitalisation.
Nevertheless, banking regulators accept that the weakest public banks may
need more assistance.
In order to increase competition, 10 new private sector banks have been
approved and eight foreign banks have been given permission to open maiden
branches in India.
But the government's critics still say the reforms do not go far enough.
They argue that, so long as commercial banking is dominated by
state-controlled institutions, real competition will be missing.
Similar concerns are expressed about the insurance sector, which is
controlled by two state-owned organisations, the Life Insurance Corporation
of India and the General Insurance Corporation. A report on the sector was
delivered by the Malhotra committee early this year but is still 'under
government consideration'. Given the size of the two insurers, Mr Tarun Das,
director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, claims that 'the
only way competition will come is with privatisation'.
In contrast, reform of the capital markets is well advanced. Companies have
a wider range of financing options now and can tap the international debt
and equity markets through Euro issues or global depositary receipts. The
Controller of Capital Issues was abolished in 1992, allowing companies more
flexibility in pricing new issues, subject to the guidelines of the
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), whose powers have been
enhanced.
From the investor's perspective the launch of new private sector mutual
funds last year provided another investment vehicle. So far 22 private
sector funds have been approved, of which seven are trading alongside funds
offered by the Unit Trust of India and public sector banks and institutions.
In the wake of the Bombay securities scandal, Sebi has tried to move quickly
to estabLish itself as a regulator over the equity markets, determined to
improve disclosure requirements and increase transparency and investor
protection.
The need for a more transparent market has been highlighted by the inflow of
funds from registered Foreign Institutional Investors, who have been allowed
to buy shares directly since late 1992. Since then 224 FIIs have registered
with Sebi and have bought Dollars 2.7bn of Indian equities.
But this sudden influx of foreign funds, together with the steady stream of
new issues, has thrown a spotlight on the archaic paper-based trading,
settlements and stock transfer system which can cause delays of up to six
months between payment and the formal registration of share ownership.
To alleviate these problems, Sebi has made regulatory changes, permitting
the use of 'jumbo' transfer deeds and share certificates and encouraging the
expansion of custodial services for foreign investors. It admits that the
long-term solution is to move to paperless electronic trading.
In Bombay the stock exchange's 628 members are investing Dollars 25m to
install an electronic trading system which Mr Bhagirat Merchant, president
of the exchange, claims will be running by the start of next year. But fully
automated paperless trading is probably some years away.
Other changes could take longer. The Bombay exchange recently agreed to
admit corporate members but so far its individual and partnership members
have shown little interest in taking advantage of this. To date the exchange
has just 10 corporate members.
The exchange says it will eventually admit foreign members, but Mr Merchant
admits there is no timetable. 'I cannot throw my members to the wolves.'
Like most policy makers and regulators, he emphasises that India does not
like rapid change.
While most industrialists and financiers believe the reforms enacted so far
are irreversible, they fear that the liberalisation programme could stall,
leaving the Indian markets in an unstable limbo.
These concerns are brushed aside by Mr Shanker Acharya, an economic adviser
in the Ministry of Finance. He denies that the programme is losing momentum.
Financial reform, he says, is a process which takes several years,
particularly when institutional inertia has to be overcome.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (6): Mr Rao bounces back - Stefan Wagstyl
follows the Prime Minister's changing fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to believe that just over a year ago Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister, came close to losing his job when he narrowly survived a
parliamentary vote of no confidence. Today he seems so secure that the
political drama of last July has become a distant memory.
As Mr Rao is fond of saying: 'People don't ask about the stability of my
government any more.' Once regarded by the ruling Congress (I) party as a
stopgap leader, who took over from Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Mr Rao has
completed more than three years in office - more than any other prime
minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. He looks set to lead his party in
the general election, due to be held by mid-1996 - and beyond.
Political calm has settled upon Delhi after nearly a decade of turmoil,
which began with the assassination of Mrs Gandhi in 1984 and included the
unrest in the Punjab, the start of the Kashmir insurgency, Rajiv Gandhi's
assassination and four changes of government.
Mr Rao's first two years in office were plagued with difficulties - notably
the challenge of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, whose
supporters destroyed the Ayodhya mosque in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992
and unleashed violence across northern India.
The 1992 Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal was a serious
embarrassment, not least for the prime minister who was accused of receiving
cash in a suitcase from Mr Harshad Mehta, one of the stockbrokers involved
in the affair. Last year's terrorist bombs in Bombay called into question
the government's handling of crime and of relations with Pakistan, which
many Indian blame for the attacks.
But since last summer, Mr Rao's stock has been rising almost continuously.
He has not so much destroyed the obstacles in his way as slipped around
them, repeatedly dodging challengers rather than taking them on. This has
worked particularly well with the BJP, which dared him to take on the wrath
of militant Hindus. Critics urged Mr Rao to confront them with a strong
defence of modern secularism. Afraid to aggravate deep-rooted sentiments, Mr
Rao preferred to lie low. Time, at least for now, has proved him right.
Mr Rao's approach leaves nagging doubts that some issues will come back to
haunt him or his successors. For example, while the wave of Hindu militancy
has waned, the Ayodhya mosque still stands in ruins and next to it is
perched the makeshift Hindu temple hastily erected by the mosque's
destroyers. Mr Rao has promised a new mosque and a proper Hindu temple.
However, he has not said when or how either will be built. For the moment
public interest in Ayodhya has faded, but it remains ripe for future
political exploitation by radicals who feel they can gain from inflaming
Hindu-Moslem passions.
Mr Rao was earlier this month also keeping his distance from another bloody
argument which erupted in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. The
trouble stems from last year's state election victory of an alliance of low
caste parties - the Bahujan Samaj Party, representing untouchables and their
supporters, and the Samajwadi Party, representing the slightly less
disadvantaged or other backward castes (OBCs).
Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the OBC chief minister, almost immediately began to
implement long-standing rules under which up to 49 per cent of government
jobs are reserved for lower castes. This infuriated the upper castes, who
have traditionally dominated Uttar Pradesh.
Matters came to a head this summer in the hills in the north of the state,
where 74 per cent of the population is upper caste and where there have been
long-standing demands for a separate state. Upper caste demonstrators became
embroiled in fights with the mainly low caste police, resulting in at least
10 deaths and scores of injuries. Mr Mulayam Singh has been accused of
turning a blind eye to police violence - but Mr Rao has refused to remove
him.
Mr Rao fears to act because dismissing a low caste leader would anger low
caste Indians everywhere - and alienate them from Congress. Particularly in
the south, where the low castes form up to 74 per cent of the population, as
in Tamil Nadu, low caste votes are crucial. With state elections due in four
states next month and six early next year, Mr Rao needs to be careful
especially because Congress is in a precarious position in two southern
states - Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
Mr Rao may well be right to tread softly when dealing with the caste,
religious, and regional divides which criss-cross India. There have long
been conflicts between the different groups struggling for power and they
will survive long into the future. India has learnt to live with the
tensions, even when, as in the conflicts between Hindus and Moslems, they
explode into bloody violence.
However, Mr Rao's brand of masterly inactivity has not proved a universal
answer to India's difficulties. For example, in Jammu and Kashmir, the
northern state where Moslem insurgents are battling with the security
forces, a lack of political initiatives from Delhi has brought Moslem
moderates close to despair - and exposed India to international criticism.
Less well-publicised but also bloody is the fighting between the authorities
and separatists in the north-east. These conflicts are unlikely to be
settled by military action alone.
The softly-softly approach has also contributed to a lack of clarity about
economic policy. Congress is not a party wholly committed to economic
liberalisation. It has espoused the cause somewhat reluctantly and has
persisted with a fond regard for state-owned industry.
Mr Rao tries to balance the two trends by pursuing what he calls the middle
way. It has worked so far in achieving a modest restructuring of the
economy. But a more direct approach may be needed if the government is to
tackle the remaining obstacles to economic modernisation, including the
vested interests of the civil service, trade unions, and state-owned
enterprises. Also, Mr Rao is coming under pressure to act more decisively
about growing corruption, not least bribery linked to industries attracting
foreign investment, notably power and telecommunications.
Finally, there is the need for revitalising the Congress party itself. In
its early Nehru days, Congress lived off the euphoria of independence and
nation-building. Later it derived energy from socialism. But since the
deaths of Nehru and Mrs Gandhi, it has failed to develop a coherent
rhetoric, capable of inspiring Indians across the country. So it is left
with doing deals with an increasing number of regional parties and balancing
interest-groups - a game that Mr Rao plays so well. The trouble is that the
more Congress relies on these manoeuvres, the less freedom of action it will
have as a national party. The government could become a hostage to electoral
pacts. That would be a loss for the prime minister and for Congress. It
would also be a loss for India.
Mr Rao, a thoughtful leader with a strong sense of history, is aware of the
long as well as the short-term considerations of politics. It would be a
pity if he allowed dealing with the latter to prevent him from ever acting
on the former.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (7): Scourge of the mighty / Profile of TN
Seshan, chief election commissioner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One man in India has repeatedly challenged Mr PV Narasimha Rao and got away
with it - Mr TN Seshan, the pugnacious chief election commissioner.
An upper-caste Brahmin with legendary faith in his own abilities, Mr Seshan
has transformed a sinecure into the most controversial post in public life.
As he says himself: 'I am the ninth CEC (since independence). My
predecessors saw themselves largely as a limb of the government. I do not.'
Mr Seshan has turned a little-known institution, concerned largely with the
minutiae of election practice, into a scourge of the country's politicians
by interpreting his mandate in the broadest possible way. Mr Manmohan Singh,
the finance minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, and Mr
Dinesh Singh, the foreign minister, have all been targets for Mr Seshan's
wrath.
Mr Seshan sees his mission as cleansing public life of corruption and
political arrogance. To his supporters, he is a hero; to his many enemies, a
self-centred bully. As an aide once said of him: 'He's a bull who carries
his own china shop with him.'
Whatever his reputation in New Delhi, Mr Seshan has struck a chord with many
ordinary Indians angry at the spread of political corruption. His public
meetings attract large crowds and he has launched a national 'voter
awareness' campaign through non-government organisations.
Mr Seshan, who is 61, is a career civil servant who rose to be chief cabinet
secretary in the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi's government. Mr Chandra Shekhar, who
was briefly prime minister in 1990-91, appointed Mr Seshan as chief election
commissioner - a decision he later said was a mistake.
As Mr Seshan explains, with some relish, the chief commissioner is appointed
for six years and can only be removed prematurely by death, voluntary
resignation or impeachment. So, when Mr Narasimha Rao became prime minister
in 1991 he was stuck with Mr Seshan.
Attempts to clip his wings have so far failed. Last year, the government
appointed two senior bureaucrats to 'assist' Mr Seshan, turning the
commission into a three-man board. But Mr Seshan challenged the move in the
Supreme Court, winning an interim order upholding his sole authority. His
two colleagues sit in offices one floor above his in a government block in
Delhi; he knows them well from his civil service days but now he does not
speak to them nor they to him.
This year, Mr Narasimha Rao sanctioned an abortive effort to pass two
constitutional amendments through Parliament to turn the commission into a
multi-member body. The government withdrew the bills at the last moment when
it became clear it would not win the necessary two-thirds majority. Even
though dislike of Mr Seshan runs across party lines, the opposition parties
decided their interests were better served if he stayed in office to plague
Mr Rao.
Mr Seshan has not escaped scot-free from attack. This summer, the Supreme
Court criticised him for over-reacting to alleged electoral malpractice in
the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the chief minister had been
caught using an official aircraft during a local election campaign. Mr
Seshan's decision was to postpone the polls by four months. The Supreme
Court said this was far too long.
Mr Seshan's attack on Mr Manmohan Singh centred on the alleged abuse of
rules for residential qualifications for electoral candidates. Under Indian
law, members of both houses of Parliament are required to be resident in the
state they represent. Mr Singh, a former civil servant, was drafted into the
ruling Congress(I) party when he became finance minister and was given a
seat in the remote north-eastern state of Assam. He gave as his address the
Assam chief minister's house. Mr Seshan threatened to cancel the election
but his effort got bogged down in the courts and he seems to have lost
interest in pursuing the finance minister.
Mr Dinesh Singh survived a similar challenge by producing a ration card and
evidence of property ownership in the state which he represents, even though
he does not live in it. Mr Pranab Mukherjee was not so lucky. He was out of
Parliament when he was appointed commerce minister and intended to contest a
vacant seat. But when Mr Seshan objected to the choice of chief electoral
officer, Mr Mukherjee had to resign, though he later returned to the
government after winning an election elsewhere.
These individual attacks pale in comparison with the campaign Mr Seshan has
waged since early last year to have all India's voters issued with photo
identity cards. The government initially scoffed at such a breath-takingly
ambitious plan. But Mr Seshan has stuck to his guns. He insists that the
cards must be issued before a deadline of December 1994, or elections will
not be valid. Since six of the 10 state elections being held in the next few
months come after December, the issue is very urgent. Mr Seshan says: 'I
gave them plenty of time. They didn't believe me.'
Mr Seshan says electoral abuses are increasing, including bribing voters,
manipulating election expenses, stealing ballot boxes, intimidation and
violence. But he argues these practices are still a long way from
undermining Indian democracy. The Indian general election, with its 550m
voters, 4m officials, 1.5m police and 800,000 polling booths, remains 'one
of the wonders of the world'. That, he believes, is why it worth defending.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (4): Changing 'mind-sets' / Interview with
Manmohan Singh, finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you assess the current state of the Indian economy?
MANMOHAN SINGH: The short-term indicators all point to an economy in good
shape. The economic growth rate for the year to next March should be 5 to
5.5 per cent. Inflation should be no more than about 7-8 per cent, probably
less. The balance of payments is on the whole well managed. We will end the
year I think with the current account nearly in balance and with foreign
exchange reserves as high as the equivalent of seven to eight months of
imports.
The fact that we have comfortable levels of reserves gives us added degrees
of manoeuvrability in managing our economy. Industrial production, which was
stag- nant, is rising by 7-8 per cent. A fiscal situation which had gone out
of hand last year is at long last coming under control with revenues roughly
on target. So on the whole the overall economic situation looks reasonably
good.
Is the current high level of the rupee harming export growth?
In the short-run at least, we can live with a stable exchange rate without
hurting the country's export efforts, particularly as in the last four years
the rupee has undergone a very sizeable (downward) adjustment. This year, we
expect a growth rate of about 12-15 per cent in dollar terms. That's not an
unreasonable or unsatisfactory target.
Do you agree with the view that the pace of reform has slowed?
No, I do not. We have a set agenda . . . we have a medium- term plan for
deregulation . . . I think in most areas what we announced as our medium-
term intentions we have fulfilled, perhaps not by 100 per cent but certainly
by 70-75 per cent.
What is the position with the reform of insurance?
We have a paper ready and it has gone to the cabinet .. Ultimately it will
require legislation which will have to be passed by parliament. I have
always said I am in favour of opening up the insurance industry of making
our industry more compet- itive. We need, I think, an industry which is
capable of mobilising long-term capital on a much larger scale and of
financing the investment needs of our economy, partic- ularly
infrastructure.
India is selling stakes of up to 49 per cent in state-owned enterprises.
Would it not be better to engage in full-scale privatisation?
Theoretically, that's certainly a possibility. But we are in politics. And,
as I've often said, we don't have a con-sensus in our government to go
beyond the 49 per cent level. Cert-ainly, if we were willing to offer an
enterprise wholesale to private inves-tors, probably we would get a better
deal. But since we don't have a consensus in favour of that sort of thing,
we have to live with what we have.
Even so, the fact that up to 49 per cent of their equity will be available
to the public means that enterprises will be under pressure to earn a
reasonable rate of return. They will be questioned by their shareholders.
All this will introduce market pressure into the thinking and the
functioning of public enterprises even though 51 per cent of equity will
remain with the government. Also, we have opened up all sectors of the
economy to the private sector and therefore over a period of time the mix of
the private and the public sector would tilt in favour of the private
sector.
Investors in power generation are being offered government
counter-guarantees to guarantee that State Electricity Boards will pay their
bills? Is this a satisfactory arrangement?
I have not been very happy about the counter-guarantees but I do recognise
that in a situation in which foreign investors are not familiar with the
working of our power system the fear of the unknown is something to be
reckoned with. Therefore I have gone along with my colleagues that at least
in the first few projects these
counter-guarantees may enable a lot more interest to be created in the power
sector. But all of us in the government are agreed that counter- guarantees
cannot become a permanent feature. We must explore other ways in which we
can attract private investment.
Doesn't that come down to a genuine reform of the loss-making State
Electricity Boards?
Yes, I think we must do a genuine reform of the SEBs. We cannot run our
state electricity boards as organisations which do not earn a reasonable
rate of return. Most states do recognise this. I hope that after the
forthcoming elections in the states there will be positive movement towards
structural reforms.
What is the position with reform in the financial sector, including banking?
We are trying to create a more competitive environment for banks. We have
deregulated. We have abolished the minimum lending rate. We have only a
maximum deposit rate. We have laid down prudential norms. Institutional
change is not a one-year or two-year process. In many ways, people tend to
forget that changing the function of the economy is not merely introducing
legislative changes. What we are talking about is a change of the mind-set.
Today the mind-sets are changing in banking ...The public sector banks will
have to compete with new private banks and will have to survive by earning
their bread by the sweat of their brow.
Will there be an acceleration of reforms after the next general election,
especially in politically-controversial areas such as the public sector and
labour?
I am not laying down a timetable but that we urgently need reform in the
public sector is beyond doubt. Similarly, we need to reform the labour
market to reduce rigidities which in my view militate against the growth of
employment.
What is the likely state of the Indian economy in five years' time?
I think the Indian economy should be much more dynamic, much more open, much
more efficient, much more productive, and much more socially just. An
economy in which employment levels will expand faster than ever before. An
economy in which we will pay a lot more attention to meeting the basic needs
of our people particularly in areas such as health, education and
environmental protection. An economy in which the manoeuvrability which we
would get out of accelerated growth would be utilised to create credible
social safety nets to protect the more vulnerable sections of our society.
Can India by then reach the rates of growth achieved by successful east
Asian economies?
I really don't know. But it's my hope and it is my firm conviction that
India needs a growth rate of 7-8 per cent to solve the problems of poverty.
It is a challenge for our country's economic and political management to get
there. It is feasible. In the past two important constraints on India's
development have been the limited food supply and limited foreign exchange.
I think neither of these constraints applies any more and therefore I feel
that even without raising the investment rate we should be able to up the
economic growth rate by at least 1 per cent over the level of the 1980s.
In the past, because of all the controls, a large part of capital was locked
up in inventories. Now people don't need to lock up capital. With some
improvement in efficiency we should be able to raise the growth rate by a
further 2 percentage points. In the 1980s, the growth rate was 5.5 per cent.
Raising it to 7-7.5 per cent is certainly a feasible proposition in the more
liberal environment in which India is now operating.
But won't India need more reforms?
Of course. I'm not saying that we have reached the end of reforms. What we
need is a flexible mechanism for responding with speed and agility to
changing economic conditions.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (5): From macro to micro - Harvard economist
leads call for change of tack - Stefan Wagstyl explains the significance of
the Porter Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Almost everyone in India can tell a story about the country's economic
inefficiencies. Faulty telephone lines, flight delays and power cuts are
part of daily life for most middle-class Indians. They complain and propose
solutions, but rarely does anyone attempt to analyse these problems in a
systematic way.
Economists, both Indian and foreign, have concentrated their attention on
the country's macro-economic performance, and have spent less time looking
at the nuts and bolts of industry and commerce.
The Confederation of Indian Industry, the employers' organisation, has tried
to restore the balance by sponsoring a three-year study which focuses on the
competitive position of Indian companies. The study, which was completed
last month, was carried out by Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business
School, an international authority on competitiveness, and his associates,
Professor Pankaj Ghemawat and Mr U. Srinvasa Rangan.
The authors' message is that, having achieved macro-economic stability
following the 1991 balance-of-payments crisis, India should now concentrate
on micro-economic reforms to promote internal and external competitiveness.
They call on the government to remove barriers to free markets, to private
state-owned industries, to permit employers to cut redundant labour and
concentrate public spending on the greatest needs, namely education and
poverty-alleviation.
Mr Porter, who delivered his conclusions in a lecture to businessmen last
month, urges India to focus on income growth and not indulge in arguments
over income distribution which are no more than 'struggles to split chapatis
(Indian breads) which result in shrinking them'.
The study calls on the government to act quickly saying that India now has a
window of opportunity, with the favourable impressions generated overseas by
the post-1991 reforms. 'We need another burst of reforms, a collection of
things that add up to something significant as was the case with the
decisions taken in 1991.'
Mr Porter has run into criticism from government officials and some
businessmen who have retorted that there is nothing new in his
prescriptions. Mr Porter was the first to admit that many of his specific
proposals have already been discussed in India. But his message carries
weight because it is supported by an unusual amount of analysis and
comparative data drawn from India and from its leading economic rivals,
including China, Indonesia and South Korea.
Mr Porter's main recommendations are:
Improve the environment in which companies compete. Like other economists he
urges India to invest in infrastructure - unlike most of them, he puts as
much, if not more, emphasis on improving the efficiency of existing
infrastructure as on building new capacity. For example, he says India's
power shortages could be solved simply by raising generation and
distribution efficiency, including cutting theft and corruption.
Raise education standards. Mr Porter says that despite pockets of
excellence, India's education levels are poor. 'You can't have a productive
economy if most of the people in a factory can't read and write.' The
globalisation of markets and the spread of technology mean that India cannot
rely on cheap labour for international competitive advantage because the
value of unskilled labour is falling. India should invest in skilled
manpower and the application of high technology to all industries. 'There
are no low-tech industries. There are only low-tech ways of competing,' Mr
Porter says, contrasting India's primitive shoemaking industry with Italy's
advanced one.
Promote competitiveness. As well as exposing Indian companies to
international competition by reducing trade barriers, the government must
promote internal rivalry between Indian companies. It must break monopolies,
including state-owned ones, and cartels, encourage inter-regional trade and
specialisation and use government procurement policies to promote quality
rather than quantity of production. The government should also act to end
unnecessary secrecy, which blocks the free exchange of information. 'India
is unique in difficulty in accessing information.'
Mr Porter argues that foreign companies have a role in importing capital and
technology. But they should not be done at the cost of reducing competition.
He questions whether the government has been wise in extending
counter-guarantees to private groups which are planning to invest in power
generation.
He says it is 'axiomatically wrong' to guarantee returns in a free economy.
He also doubts whether it was correct last year for Coca-Cola, the US drinks
company, to have been permitted to buy Parle Exports, India's biggest
producer.
The study also has some tough advice for Indian companies:
Stop being opportunistic. Too few Indian companies have strategic plans, say
the authors, and prefer to grasp at business chances as they appear. Without
long-term planning they cannot hope to compete internationally.
Focus the business. Companies are over-diversified and over-extended through
vertical and horizontal integration. Instead of trying to do everything they
should concentrate on the business segments where they have the greatest
competitive advantage.
Formulate clear plans for exports. Export markets need long-term commitment
in production and marketing. Foreign alliances should not be ends in
themselves but designed to achieve specific targets.
The authors believe, based on the experience of other countries, that it is
crucial for India to develop clusters of competitive industries, on the
lines of Italy's shoe industry, where there are strong links between shoe
manufacturers, machinery makers and design studios. The successful diamond
polishing industry, for example, should progress from processing small
stones to large ones and diversify into jewellery

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (3): Fast start, still trailing - Alexander
Nicoll studies India's form in Asia's investment race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Each day in India now brings news of foreign and Indian companies discussing
joint venture agreements. After three years of economic reform, foreign
direct investment shows signs of acquiring momentum.
According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, actual direct investment in India is expected to rise to
Dollars 2bn in 1995 from Dollars 577m in 1993. This would be a big increase,
especially considering that in 1991 the figure was virtually zero.
The upsurge of foreign interest in India is encouraging for the government.
But the amounts of money are still dwarfed by those pouring into its rapidly
growing Asian neighbours.
While New Delhi approved Dollars 3bn or so of potential investments last
year, the Chinese authorities approved Dollars 26bn. Even in the
Philippines, which is seeking to increase its attractiveness to investors
after several years as the laggard of south-east Asia, the Board of
Investment approved projects worth Dollars 8.6bn in the first half of 1994
alone.
There are several obvious reasons for India's lag. Its economic reform
programme began only three years ago, when new foreign investment was
virtually at a standstill. Investment in China also began slowly after Deng
Xiaoping began his reforms at the end of 1978, and has since seen several
stuttering periods until it reached the extraordinary pace of the past few
years.
Many foreign companies were wary of India, which had had a habit of
nationalising or expelling them since independence in 1947, and had
subjected the hardy few that persisted to mind-boggling bureaucracy.
A more immediate concern was that economic reform was only undertaken as a
result of a financial crisis which reduced foreign currency reserves
virtually to zero in 1991. Inevitably, it took some time for the government
of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to convince the outside world that it was serious
about its change of direction and for the new policies to show through in
economic performance.
Even now, budget deficit targets are routinely exceeded and both exports and
industrial output have failed to gather strong momentum. However, the
government will have taken heart from the strong confidence in India's
economic prospects expressed from all sides at this month's annual
International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Madrid.
Once persuaded that India is a promising venue for investment, companies
take time to explore their market and to find the right partners in a
country whose size alone offers vast opportunities to those who make the
right choices.
Those who venture in find that, in most industries, the red tape surrounding
approvals of foreign investment has substantially diminished. Bureaucracy,
however, has hardly disappeared, especially at the state level.
Professor Michael Porter, a Harvard management expert who has conducted a
detailed study of India's competitiveness, noted in September that India now
has the 'benefit of the doubt, as China or Brazil did 10 years ago. But this
is fragile and can shift.' He urged a new burst of micro-economic
liberalisation to sharpen India's edge.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK stockbroker, also compared India with China
and said in a recent report: 'Our economic analysis concludes that India
represents the better-safe-than-sorry emerging market, or perhaps the
investment tortoise against China's hare.'
India is perceived to have some advantages over China. These include:
A well-developed private sector providing plenty of potential partners as
well as business culture and management experience. China's
communist-turned-capitalist leadership has had to try to re-create all these
after stifling the entrepreneurial spirit for a generation.
A legal system modelled on that of England, assuring investors of rights of
ownership and legal redress. China's lack of an effective legal system is
seen as one of its biggest disadvantages.
A financial system and stock market which, although in need of more reform,
are far more advanced than China's.
India's steady economic growth rate is seen by some as offering a safer ride
than China's roller-coaster switches between inflation-producing booms and
periods of austerity.
Moreover, some of India's handicaps are precisely the same as those of China
or of other Asian dynamos in the earlier stages of their development: lack
of infrastructure; intractable labour problems; poor quality of industrial
products engendered by excessive protection of the economy through high
tariffs and other barriers.
Competition is now being enhanced by progressive reductions in tariffs, and
the government is beginning to tackle the need for more power and better
roads and telecommunications.
However, the recurrence of bubonic and pneumonic plague in September
highlighted India's lack of attention to more basic infrastructure:
sanitation, clean water, refuse collection and public health. At the same
time, the government's handling of some infrastructure contracts has aroused
concern about increasing corruption.
India is not alone in liberalising its economy in slow stages. South Korea
and Taiwan ensure that the process is tightly controlled. South-east Asian
countries, although generally more open to investment, can be impenetrable
and difficult to do business in.
But, inevitably, there are hiccoughs. The government's inept handling of an
international share issue planned by Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the international
telephone monopoly which was intended to be the first public sector company
to issue equity internationally, has raised doubts about its willingness to
adapt to the markets' faster pace.
More broadly, there are signs of growing satisfaction within the government
that it has already done enough for the time being to reform the economy. A
rise in foreign exchange reserves has reduced the need for aid from
international financing institutions and has thus also reduced the urgency
to follow their advice on restructuring sectors of the economy.
Asia's fastest growing countries, meanwhile, have wasted little time on
self-congratulation. China and Indonesia are huge borrowers from the World
Bank and Asian Development Bank. The World Bank is very closely involved in
the re-shaping of China's economy.
Indian reform is thus likely to continue to be slow and erratic. This means
that foreign investors need a long time horizon. Rare will be the company
turning a quick profit on its investment in India - but this is equally true
of investment almost all other Asian countries.
Serious investors are prepared to accept this. Mr Arnold G. Langbo, chairman
of Kellogg, the US cereal group, interviewed about its investment in India
by the Business Standard newspaper, said: 'Some markets take five years,
some take 10, but it really doesn't matter to us. We think in terms of 10 to
20 years to grow the markets so that 20 years from now we're going to have a
huge business here.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (2): The gamble paid off - The economy is
responding to treatment

<TEXT>
For the moment, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, seems to have
gambled successfully. When he delivered this year's budget in February, he
said he was taking a calculated risk in slightly relaxing controls on public
spending in order to promote growth.
All the indications are that his calculation were right - with India
enjoying the biggest surge in industrial output since Mr Singh and Mr PV
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched their economic reforms three
years ago.
But this success could prove short-lived unless the government presses ahead
with more measures to free the Indian economy from the dead weight of 40
years of socialist-inspired central planning. Partial reforms have already
created a widespread sense of excitement, in India and abroad, about the
opportunities for business. The government's reform-minded critics say
further reforms are needed if this excitement is to generate sufficient
growth for India to achieve industrial take-off - a sustained increase in
its long-term economic growth rate.
Mr Narasimha Rao argues that it is important not to rush reform. In a large
democracy like India, broad-based consensus must precede significant change.
He also says that India must balance the pursuit of liberalisation with a
proper respect for its past achievements, including the tradition of
state-owned industrial enterprise.
His critics say the prime minister lacks a sense of urgency. They claim that
India, already behind important international rivals such as China and
Indonesia in economic development, is wasting valuable time. The
International Monetary Fund, in its annual report published on the eve of
this month's IMF-World Bank meeting in Madrid, urged India to accelerate
reforms.
In the light of India's recent economic performance it is easy to understand
why the government is relaxed. Seven good monsoons in a row have provided a
solid underpinning to living standards of most Indians, especially the 70
per cent who still live on the land.
Thanks to liberalisation, which has included the abolition of most controls
on domestic investment combined with the easing of curbs on trade and
foreign investment, foreign trade and investment are expanding. Exports,
which the government sees as an engine of growth, rose 20 per cent in the
year to March 1994 and have risen 10.6 per cent in the first five months of
the 1994-95 year. Imports, after three years of stagnation, are also growing
due mainly to imports of machinery and equipment - a sign of increasing
confidence in industry.
Industrial output, which was also slack in the early years of reform due to
cuts in government spending, is now picking up - buoyed by private demand,
just as reformers hoped. In June, the latest month for which figures are
available, it rose 8.6 per cent, the biggest increase since 1991. Inflation,
running at about 9 per cent a year for wholesale prices, is higher than the
government would like but has fallen from over 11 per cent in recent months.
As Mr Shankar Acharya, the government's chief economic adviser, says: 'The
economy is performing well.'
Foreign companies have been sufficiently impressed with the way India has
dragged itself out of the 1991 balance-of-payments crisis to take advantage
of the relaxation of investment curbs and invest in India. The inflow of
direct investment has soared from Dollars 150m in 1991-92 to Dollars 620m
last year and should climb further this year because several large private
projects to build power stations with the help of foreign partners are close
to starting construction work.
Even more dramatic has been the increase in foreign portfolio investment
from Dollars 158m in 1991-92 to Dollars 4.1bn last year, including
investment in Indian markets and in the overseas issues of Indian companies.
The inflow has helped take foreign exchange reserves to over Dollars 19bn,
compared to just Dollars 1.6bn in 1991.
Taking account of the optimism of domestic and foreign companies, the
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, in its annual report made its most
positive forecast in recent years. It predicts national output will rise by
about 5 per cent in 1994-95, up from 3.8 per cent last year. Agricultural
production is set to expand 3 per cent and industrial output by 7 per cent,
fuelled by a 10 per cent rise in private investment. Domestic demand,
especially in cars, motorcycles, scooters, refrigerators and consumer
electronics, is so strong that exporters have been diverting supplies from
the overseas markets to the domestic - to the annoyance of the commerce
ministry which is trying to promote exports.
Mr Manmohan Singh believes the economy is on track to grow at 6-7 per cent
in the late 1990s. This may be so, but it will almost certainly require
further significant reforms to achieve the target. Mr Tarun Das, director
general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, says: 'We need to go
further and faster with reform if we are to achieve industrial take-off.'
While the economy has picked up impressively in the past year, the growth
rate is still less than the average of 5.5 per cent a year achieved in the
pre-reform 1980s and well short of India's international rivals.
It is not as if the government did nothing in the past year to advance
reform. Important recent moves have been an overhaul of the tax system,
including the rationalisation of indirect taxes; reductions in import duties
from a maximum of 85 per cent to 65 per cent; the partial liberalisation of
the heavily-controlled pharmaceuticals industry and the opening of the
telecommunications industry to private enterprise, including foreign groups.
There have also been significant changes in financial markets, notably the
licensing of 10 new privately-owned banks, the first time in more than 20
years, and of new foreign banks. Some foreign exchange controls have been
lifted, allowing India to accede to Article 8 of the IMF, an important
bench-mark of the financial globalisation. Only last month, the central bank
deregulated bank lending rates. Mr Shankar Acharya says: 'It is a fact that
some people feel reform has slowed .. But these achievements are still
important.'
Next on the public agenda is reform of the insurance industry, in which the
government is considering a report which recommends ending the state
monopoly. Mr Manmohan Singh is also committed to further cuts in import
duties in next year's budget and is considering lifting the virtual ban on
imports of consumer goods.
However, advocates of faster reform argue that this agenda fails to address
crucial issues, some of which are discussed in detail elsewhere in this
survey. First, public spending remains high. After cuts in the first years
of reform, public borrowing soared last year, taking the fiscal deficit to
7.3 per cent of GDP. It is falling in 1994-95, thanks to strong tax
revenues. However, the burden of interest payments is rising - from 39 per
cent of revenues in 1990-91 to 53 per cent in 1993-94, according to the
reserve bank. This squeezes the funds available for development, health and
education. Without better health and education, the great majority of
Indians cannot hope to participate in a modern economy.
Next, while many bureaucratic controls on the economy have been scrapped,
the officials' desire to retain influence has not. Also, India needs to
improve the efficiency of state-controlled industries. The government has
sold minority stakes in public enterprises but shies away from full-scale
privatisation.
The government has also postponed possible reforms of labour laws that limit
employers' rights to dismiss workers. While private employers often find
ways around these, through voluntary retirement schemes, public enterprises
have little incentive to shed labour.
More needs to be done to encourage private investment in infrastructure,
including power, telecommunications and transport, all virtually state
monopolies which have suffered from years of under-investment.
Finally, while ministers have liberalised the capital markets, they are
reluctant to relax control of the banking industry. The state-owned banks,
which dominate the market, are being allowed to raise private equity, but
the government will retain a majority stake and stifle genuine competition.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (1): Reasons for pride and for caution - The
pace of reform is winning international acclaim. But there are urgent social
reasons why India cannot rest on its laurels

<TEXT>
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has much to celebrate in the
results of the economic liberalisation he launched three years ago. But he
needs to carry out further radical reforms if the party is to live up to
expectations.
Seven good monsoons in succession have brought prosperity to many farmers.
Industrial output is growing faster than at any time since reforms began.
Promises of foreign investment are pouring in and the stock market is
trading near its all-time high. If the economy continues to perform
strongly, Mr Rao will be well placed for the next general election, due by
mid-1996.
Yet, India is still some way from achieving economic take-off. As Mr Amit
Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce
and Industry, says: 'There's an incredible amount of energy in Indian
industry now. There's an expectation of growth. But it will take time to
fructify.'
Mr Manmohan Singh believes the economy can achieve a growth rate of 7 per
cent a year in the late 1990s. But it has not got there yet - for the
current year the government expects the economy to grow 5 per cent, less
than the 5.5 per cent achieved in the pre-reform 1980s and well short of the
growth rates of India's leading international rivals in the developing
world. As the International Monetary Fund, in its annual report published on
the eve of last month's IMF-World Bank meeting in Madrid, said: 'Reforms
will need to be accelerated in order to sustain robust growth and allow
India to share in the prosperity and rapid development enjoyed by a growing
number of countries in east and southeast Asia.'
The IMF and other advocates of reform praise India for the changes made
already - including cuts in import barriers, reductions in public spending
and easing of controls on private business activity. But these reforms
cannot transform India without digging deeper into the heart of the
pre-reform economy by cutting the bloated state-owned enterprises, the
over-manned bureaucracy, and the coils of patronage and corruption which
surround the government. Without such reforms, India cannot enjoy the gains
in efficiency which it needs to compete in world markets. It would also find
it difficult to raise the funds for those services which the government
plans to enhance - including education, health care, population control and
infrastructure.
Mr Rao argues that a large democracy like India cannot rush reform. He wants
to take time to develop a consensus and pursue an approach he calls 'the
middle way' in which the development of a free market economy is balanced
with a proper regard for the economic role of the state.
The prime minister's critics say India cannot afford delays if it is to
catch up with fast-moving international rivals such as China and Indonesia.
The country also has little time to waste in improving the miserable living
standards of most of its 900m people, especially the 250m living below the
government's own poverty line. The recent outbreak of plague, which claimed
more than 50 lives and spread panic around the world, showed that India's
rapidly-growing cities are in crying need of better water supplies, sewers,
waste disposal services and medical care. With the population still growing
at over 2 per cent annually, there are nearly 20m extra people to provide
for every year.
There is a political dimension to the argument as Mr Manmohan Singh himself
points out. He said in a recent speech that without faster growth India
would be condemned to divisive rows about sharing out the economic pie. In a
crowded country, laced with divisions of caste, religion and language, such
rows can quickly become very bloody. The current tensions in the large
northern state of Uttar Pradesh are a case in point. A chief minister, who
took power in the name of the lower castes last autumn, is busy enforcing
government job quotas of up to 49 per cent for the lower castes. Upper caste
Hindus are responding with angry demonstrations which have led to the loss
of about 20 lives.
Since taking office in 1991, Mr Rao has succeeded in containing such
tensions, notably the Hindu-Moslem arguments which culminated in the
destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992 by Hindu fanatics and
widespread violence. He resisted pressure to confront the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition party. Instead, he patiently
waited for the storms to subside.
The strategy has worked - up to a point. When voters went to the polls in
four northern states last autumn, the BJP suffered a significant setback.
Its charismatic leader, Mr LK Advani, and his colleagues are now struggling
to regain the momentum and unity they created around the Ayodhya issue.
Their efforts to launch a credible national challenge to the ruling Congress
(I) party have floundered.
In the meantime, the wily Mr Rao has reinforced his own position. Since
stepping in as a stop-gap for the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Mr Rao
has beaten intra-party challenges to his leadership. Early this year, he
extended his grip on Parliament by winning over splinter groups to turn a
government minority into a majority. While he has done little to create
lasting peace in the troubled northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, where
Moslem insurgents are fighting the security forces, the prime minister has
at least contained the domestic and international political fall-out of the
conflict. Barring electoral disaster in the 10 state elections to be held
later this year and early next, Mr Rao now seems certain to lead Congress
into the next general election.
Yet for all his political skill, Mr Rao has yet to generate genuine popular
enthusiasm, either for himself or for his party. Disenchantment with the BJP
has not fuelled any surge of support for Congress. The big winner in last
year's state election was the alliance of lower caste parties in Uttar
Pradesh. Caste-based and regional parties are also likely to perform well in
the forthcoming polls.
Congress has in the past proved adept at winning support from local parties
in national elections - and will probably carry on with this form of
horse-trading. But that forces Mr Rao and his colleagues to concentrate on
ways of dividing the pie - an unsatisfactory strategy, as Mr Manmohan Singh
warned.
Fortunately, the economy is performing well enough to give Mr Rao room for
manoeuvre as he prepares for the state and general elections. Richer farmers
are enjoying record incomes. Industry, which suffered in the first two years
of reform from cuts in public spending, has redirected its sales to exports
and the private sector. Companies are queueing up to invest in
infrastructure following decisions to open power, telecommunications and
transport to private investment. Businessmen are optimistic about their
prospects, for the first time in three years. 'We have faith in India's
future,' says Mr Anil Ambani, managing director of Reliance Industries, the
country's largest group.
Foreign companies are also showing growing interest in India. Foreign direct
investment nearly doubled last year to Dollars 620m and portfolio investment
jumped from negligible levels to Dollars 4.1bn. Exports soared 20 per cent
last year. As Mr John Bossidy, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Allied Signal, the US engineering combine, said during a visit to India last
month: 'It's important to step up our presence in India now. The potential
for continued economic growth is staggering.'
For many groups, investment in India means little more than establishing a
toehold in a country from which they have been virtually absent, kept out by
decades of protectionism. But a few are starting to commit substantial sums
to India, notably companies planning to invest in power and in
telecommunications. General Electric and Enron, the energy group, of the US,
National Power, the UK generating company, and the Hindujas, the
London-based expatriate Indian business family, are among those planning
power stations. Potential investors in telecommunications include US West
and Motorola of the US.
The inflow of foreign investment has buoyed India's foreign exchange
reserves to a record level of Dollars 19bn, up from Dollars 1bn during the
1991 balance-of-payments crisis. The reserves have created something of a
headache for Mr Manmohan Singh by contributing to a rise in inflation, now
running at about 9 per cent a year. This is squeezing the incomes of the
poor and undermining the competitiveness of India's exports.
However, large reserves have also brought considerable benefits by creating
a cushion against future economic shocks, such as a drought. It has also
given India more confidence on the international stage. Mr Manmohan Singh,
who acted as the unofficial spokesman for the developing world at
September's IMF-World Bank annual meeting, would have cut a less impressive
figure if India's gold was still lying in pawn in as it was in 1991.
But these impressive gains may still be wasted if the government does not
press ahead with further economic restructuring. Ministers have carried out
some important changes this year - notably ending the state's monopoly of
telecommunications services, relaxing some foreign exchange controls, and
most recently liberalising bank lending rates. They also have other plans on
their immediate agenda such as liberalising insurance.
But more fundamental reforms have been postponed, including genuine
privatisation and reviewing over-protective labour laws which give the
government a veto over all large-scale redundancies. After toying with these
ideas for a while, Mr Narasimha Rao has this year set them firmly aside.
The key problem lies in dealing with the state-owned industries which
consume about half the nation's industrial capital but produce only a
quarter of its output. Unless these are made efficient, it is hard for
private industry to compete in world markets. But in order to make them
efficient, the government must shed labour. It will not because it says it
is concerned about creating unemployment. However, the unemployed could be
given redundancy payments, as is happening to a limited extent in private
industry.
The experience of other countries shows that properly-controlled
privatisation mostly leads to productivity gains which benefit the whole
economy.
Mr Narasimha Rao has permitted the sale of shares in state-owned businesses
but insists on retaining 51 per cent for the government so that politicians
keep their influence and patronage.
Also, while bureaucratic controls have often been removed, the bureaucrats
have not and fight to retain influence. Rules for private investors' entry
into power and telecommunications, for example, have been left vague, giving
civil servants plenty of discretion, so creating scope for untransparent
decision-making and corruption.
Although the government has trimmed public spending it is struggling to keep
public borrowings under control because of the rising burden of interest
payments on accumulated debt. As Mr Manmohan Singh has said, this burden can
only be substantially cut through raising money by privatisation. In the
meantime there is a ferocious squeeze on the funds available for health,
education and rural development.
The last point is crucial to building a modern economy. Ill-fed,
poorly-housed and semi-literate people will find it hard to participate in
industrialisation. If they do not participate, they will remain stuck in the
medieval hinterland of 20th century India.
India's elite is aware of these challenges and of the possible responses.
But it lacks a real sense of urgency. It deserves credit for what has been
achieved in the past few years but it should not forget how much more
remains to be done.

FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar rerating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A re-evaluation of the dollar's potential by one of the big integrated
securities houses prompted downgrades and subsequent price weakness in
leading earners of US currency.
SG Warburg was said to have moved its end-of-year forecast by around 10
cents to Dollars 1.65 against sterling and its 1995 estimate to Dollars
1.70. Among stocks to be downgraded by the house sector specialists was
Cable and Wireless: the forecast for profits for the year to March 1995 came
down by Pounds 70m to Pounds 1.13bn and the following year's estimate by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.2bn. The shares fell 8 to 399p in spite of the
encouraging reports that the company was anticipating a joint venture with
AT&amp;T, the US giant.
BAT Industries shed 2 to 432p despite a buy recommendation from Williams De
Broe, Glaxo dropped 12 to 596p and Zeneca fell 10 to 856p.
A follow on from heavy selling in New York saw the share prices of oil
majors BP and Shell ignore comforting fundamental news. The combined
weakness in the stocks was responsible for knocking 6 points off the FT-SE
100 Index.
The falls of 11 1/2 to 416p, ex-dividend, in BP and 9 1/2 to 711p in Shell
came in spite of news that the Department of Trade and Industry had granted
the two companies permission to start work on the potentially lucrative
Foinaven oilfield, west of Shetland and Orkney. The field is expected to
produce oil in less than 3 1/2 years from discovery, compared with an
average of 9 1/2 years for North Sea finds.
Interim results at the top end of analysts' estimates saw airports group BAA
weaken 24 1/2 to 492 1/2 p as profit-takers moved in following a sell
indication from BZW. The stock, which has been a very strong performer over
the past year, was heavily marked down at the outset, with 5.8m traded by
the close.
BZW's advice to clients was that BAA had moved into 'expensive territory'.
Over the past year the shares have run some 15 per cent ahead of the market
as a whole and outperformed by 5 per cent over the past month.
Ahead of today's second-quarter results, British Airways also lost ground,
dipping 5 to 357p. The stock was not helped by the threat of strike action
at Deutsche BA, the airline's 49 per cent owned German domestic carrier.
News of the sale of its food ingredients business left drinks group Allied
Domecq 7 lower at 591p, with some analysts slightly disappointed with the
Pounds 265m disposal price. Allied has two other disposals in hand, notably
its tea operations, which are said to have an asking price of Pounds 300m
and to have attracted Nestle among potential buyers.
Lonrho continued to gain ground. Up 14 on Friday following the announced
departure of joint chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland, the stock added 4 at 148
1/2 p. Turnover, at 10m shares, was again heavy.
Hotels and leisure group Forte slithered below the 227p price at which 78m
shares were placed on Friday, losing 7 at 226 1/2 p in turnover of 2m. A
sell note from BZW did most of the damage - the investment bank is unhappy
about a longer term potential financing squeeze at Forte. It predicts
slowing cash flow at a time when capital spending will be rising steeply.
Friday's Pounds 175m placing was undertaken to finance Forte's purchase of a
big stake in Meridien Hotels, a deal that BZW sees as a strong strategic
fit. There was talk, however, that the placing had not gone as smoothly as
UBS, the group's broker, would have liked.
Retail sector leader Marks and Spencer dipped slightly in modest volume
ahead of today's interim results, slipping 4 1/2 to 409 1/2 p with 2.8m
traded. Further solid profits progress is expected but most analytical
attention will be concentrated on the group's sales trends.
Some estimates for the growth of M&amp;S cash sales go as high as 8 per cent but
6 per cent is probably nearer the consensus. Anything under 5 per cent could
cast a deep cloud over the sector since M&amp;S is traditionally seen as the
industry bellwether.
Boots advanced 4 to 517p on talk of a buy recommendation from a leading
marketmaker.
Enthusiasm for the impending flotation of TeleWest, the UK's largest cable
company, prompted weakness in the rest of the telecommunications sector.
Investors were starting to liquidate assets in preparation and BT, the most
easily tradeable stock in the sector, shed 6 to 389p on 9.6m turnover.
Computer group Tadpole Technology climbed 20 to 423p after the company
announced sales details of a new portable personal computer.
Recently floated Filtronic Comtek gained 5 at 140p, a new high, as Fidelity
International declared a 5.9 per cent stake.
A block of 2.1m shares in Logica, representing around 3.4 per cent of the
software company, was placed in the market at 289p. Most of the shares were
sold on at 290p and the underlying stock finished a penny firmer at 296p.

Life assurance group Legal &amp; General slipped on news that the Texas
Department of Insurance was fining it Dollars 8.7m for mis-selling of
policies to pensioners.
The claim relates to Banner Life, L&amp;G's US subsidiary. Analysts said
Banner's involvement in Texas represented a tiny part of L&amp;G's overall
business, but they were concerned that the case could turn the US spotlight
on to a very sensitive area.
Mr Jonathan Sheehan of Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'It does not look
particularly material, but in the current climate where the life sector is
not in favour it does not help sentiment.' Legal shares receded 7 to 428p.

FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical forecast chopped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals group Courtaulds fell 19 to 440p as one leading broker chopped
full-year forecasts by around 12 per cent just two weeks before the
company's interim figures.
The move was carried out by UBS, and although the house chemicals analysts
were unavailable for comment, rivals said forecasts for the current year and
the following year had been reduced by Pounds 20m. The existing range of
predictions for this year was between Pounds 160m and Pounds 180m.
UBS had been a long term seller and was believed to have hardened its stance
in reaction to the rising price of commodity chemicals, of which Courtaulds
is a big buyer. Nevertheless there was some surprise at the timing of the
move as the company is currently in closed season and any view would need to
have been taken independently.

FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures tumbled steeply in weak trading volume, sliding to a
discount to the cash market as heavy selling built in the final hour of the
session, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,062 at the official 4.10pm close, a
decline of 55 points. The discount to cash equities was 4 points, with fair
value premium just under 10 points.
Once again there was very little activity, and after an initial mark-down
the December contract mostly drifted lower in thin trading volume. The day's
contracts totalled 8,091, against 11,659 last Friday.
James Capel and GNI were among a number of biggish sellers towards the
close, and from 3pm onwards there was heavy downward pressure on the cash
market.
With the December contract below 3,070 a number of important chart levels
have been broken.
Some traders have begun to fear that the market's next move will be down to
the 3,000 level.
Traded options turnover was thin at 21,113 lots, but up from the 18,500
traded on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE option turnover accounted for around
a third of volume at 8,700 contracts.
Guinness was the most active individual stock option, with 2,013 lots dealt,
followed by Lonrho (1,693 contracts) and HSBC (1,033).

FT  08 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities weakened by UK/US interest
rate fears - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A thoroughly depressed UK stock market succumbed to a worldwide mood of
negativity yesterday, as international investors looked ahead to the
possibility of a further rise in US interest rates within the next two
weeks.
London was additionally unsettled by the latest economic data released by
the authorities, in the form of industrial production and manufacturing for
September, both of which were much higher than had been expected, and were
interpreted by some dealers as accelerating the chances of another increase
in UK interest rates.
At the close of one of the dullest trading sessions for many months, the
FT-SE 100 Index looked to have given up the chase, at least in the short
term, to launch another determined assault on the 3,100 level, and ended
31.8, or one percentage point, down at 3,065.
But in a clear demonstration of the thinness of trading in the UK equity
market, the second line issues put up a much more resilient performance,
although they too closed well down on the day, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
finally 14.5, or half of one percentage point, lower at 3,520.1.
Turnover figures released by the Stock Exchange showed that activity in
non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounted for 252.7m shares, more than 63 per cent of
the total volume of business in London, which reached a paltry 398.8m, among
the lowest turnovers recorded this year.
The rationale behind the market's weakness was apparent before marketmakers
began to input their opening prices: Wall Street's near 39-point fall on
Friday, after a closer examination of that day's batch of economic news,
rekindled fears that inflation could begin to ignite in the US.
Those concerns, mixed in with fears that the congressional mid-term
elections in the US could see President Clinton's standing given a thumbs
down by the electorate, put increasing pressure on US Treasury bonds in
London throughout the day and saw Wall Street give ground. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average was more than 10 points lower as London closed.
Senior traders at a number of City broking houses expect the value of
customer business transacted in London yesterday to have fallen below the
Pounds 1bn mark, a worrying prospect for big integrated trading houses which
support large dealing teams.
The FT-SE 100 made a poor start to the day, opening more than 20 points
lower and meeting minor waves of selling pressure thereafter. What disturbed
dealers was an almost total absence of support for the leaders.
'There were few in the City expecting the market to hold up after Wall
Street's performance on Friday but, equally, there were not many
marketmakers expecting to see London down 1 per cent,' said one of the
leading marketmakers at a UK securities house. He added: 'There is a good
chance of the Fed tightening some time next week, and that will keep the
market tight for the rest of this week.' There was the merest hint in the
market that the Bundesbank could ease monetary policy following its
fortnightly meeting, scheduled for this Thursday, but most traders dismissed
the story as unlikely.
Regional electricity stocks, stimulated recently by the prospect of bumper
dividends and a windfall from the sell-off of the National Grid, provided
the FT-SE 100's best performer in Southern Electric. BAA, on the other hand,
suffered as the market shrugged off the excellent figures and concentrated
on the stock's outperformance in recent months.
There was considerable nervousness in British Airways ahead of this
morning's interim figures, while Kleinwort Benson was said to have been
responsible for weakness in property shares. Oils were upset by renewed
selling by US investors.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Chrysler down on Kerkorian
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended little changed yesterday following a lacklustre
trading session, as many market participants stayed on the sidelines
awaiting fresh economic news due later this week, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.35 up at 3,808.87, having spent
the entire day near to opening levels. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.79
at 463.07, but the American SE composite closed 2.50 lower at 450.41 and the
Nasdaq composite down 3.77 at 762.31. New York SE volume was 256.2m shares.
From the start, stocks moved unconvincingly within a narrow range on either
side of opening values as the market struggled to find a direction. Early
declines in bond prices did not help sentiment, but the losses were
shortlived, and it was clear by mid-morning that stocks were not going to
get much of a lead from bonds.
The lack of any upward momentum, meanwhile, was due to the lacklustre nature
of overall investor sentiment, which remained weak following Friday's
September employment report. Trading throughout the session was quiet, with
many investors clearly wary of committing funds to the market ahead of
today's crucial mid-term elections, and Thursday's key inflation data.
Chrysler fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 3/8 amid speculation that Mr Kirk
Kerkorian, the financier, might sell some of his 9.2 per cent shareholding.
Technology issues, which enjoyed some gains last week, were again in the
news after three groups, Apple Computer, IBM and Motorola, announced that
they had agreed on a new hardware reference platform for the PowerPC
microprocessor which should deliver a wider range of operating system and
application choices. IBM put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 71 7/8 and Apple,
traded on the Nasdaq market, firmed Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 40 3/4. Motorola
failed to hang on to its early gain and finished Dollars 2 down at Dollars
56 1/2
Snapple Beverage slipped Dollars  3/16 to Dollars 13 5/8 after documents
filed relating to the planned takeover of Snapple by Quaker Oats showed that
Snapple recently cut its internal earnings projections for the remainder of
the year.
Nike advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 after investment bank Goldman
Sachs raised its rating on the stock.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg mainly lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares closed generally lower after a slow day's trade dampened by weaker
world markets and a soft gold price.
The overall index fell 22 to 5,840, industrials 18 to 6,764 and golds 22 to
2,227. Traders remarked that industrials had undergone a correction after
solid gains late last week.
Both De Beers and Anglos ended R1.25 down at R98.25 and R242 respectively,
while Gencor shed 25 cents to R15.
Among golds, Vaal Reefs retreated R3 to R411, Kloof 75 cents to R70.25 and
Dries 50 cents to R65.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Nordic markets unnerved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion polls showing growing opposition to Swedish membership of the
European Union, ahead of Sunday's referendum, made for further uncertainty
in Nordic markets after last week's losses.
Stockholm was broadly lower as the latest poll showed opposition to EU
membership leading support by 42 per cent to 40 per cent. In addition, said
Mr Peter Tron at Unibank Securities, the outlook for higher US and UK
interest rates, and the fact that the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut German
rates on Thursday, was a further deterrent. Mr Tron said the markets were
still discounting a 'yes' vote and added that a 'no' vote could bring a 5 to
10 per cent fall in share prices.
The Affarsvarlden general index declined 16.7 or 1.2 per cent to 1,427.2,
but Ericsson 'B' showed some resistance to the downward trend, easing only
SKr1 to SKr431, tracking a firm performance by its ADRs in New York on
Friday.
Oslo, facing its own referendum on November 28, was transfixed by
developments in Sweden, and worries that the mood could spill over. The
All-share index fell 8.5 to 590.7.
Helsinki's Hex index shed 33.28 to 1,911.63 as EU opponents succeeded in
delaying the final parliamentary vote on membership until next week, after
Sweden's referendum. Copenhagen's Top-20 KFX index dipped 0.92 to 92.27,
dragged lower by the uncertain mood in its neighbouring markets.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul at record high as
Nikkei loses ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stock sales by corporate investors and arbitrageurs depressed share prices,
and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index finished 192.34 off at 19,619.22 after fluctuating between
19,755.15 and 19,593.92. Equities declined initially on arbitrage linked
selling, triggered by a fall in futures prices. Financial and corporate
investors followed suit.
Traders said worries over US financial markets and the currency market ahead
of the US elections depressed investor confidence. Volume was 183.9m shares,
against 202m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 14.39 to 1,555.41 and
the Nikkei 300 lost 2.84 at 284.41. Declines outnumbered rises by 797 to
183, with 194 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
1.45 at 1,273.39.
With announcements of interim corporate earnings reaching a peak over the
next few weeks, analysts expect to see an increase in activity prompted by
profit revisions for the whole business year. However, while investors have
reacted to negative earnings news, better than expected first-half results
have failed to move stock prices.
Nikko Securities reported that for some companies, upward revisions in
earnings had been discounted in stock prices, and even for companies
reporting unexpectedly firm earnings, the impact on the share price was
likely to be shortlived. Investors should select companies according to
their capital investment and research and development plans, the broker
said.
Overseas investors and domestic institutions sold steels, which had been
bought recently on hopes of strengthening global steel demand. Nippon Steel
eased Y1 to Y397 and NKK shed Y8 to Y289.
Heavy electrical shares lost ground on profit-taking: Mitsubishi Electric,
the day's most active issue, dipped Y6 to Y701 and Hitachi fell Y25 to Y974.
Office equipment maker Nakabayashi rose Y8 to Y978 on the pachinko, or
Japanese pinball, theme. Sailor Pen, a fountain pen maker listed on the
second section, jumped Y57 to Y936.
Nissan Motor dropped Y30 to Y794 after announcing last Friday that its
interim recurring losses totalled Y57.9bn. Other car companies were also
weak, with Suzuki Motor down Y30 to Y1,180.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y18,000 to Y897,000 on selling by
overseas and institutional investors. Japan Tobacco declined Y40,000 to
Y1.05m and Japan Telecom Y140,000 to Y3.42m.
In Osaka, the OSE average softened 152.31 to 21,810.00 in volume of 24.6m
shares.
Roundup
The outlook for US interest rates exerted a strong influence in parts of the
Pacific Rim region.
SEOUL, however, finished at a record high after its fourth consecutive day
of gains, although profit-taking cut back broadly based advances seen in
early trade.
The composite index, which peaked at 1,144.55, ended the session 7.98 up at
1,132.99.
The heavily capitalised electricity monopoly Kepco went limit up for its
second straight session on a technical rebound, combined with news that the
group has had talks with the government on raising electricity prices by 8
per cent next year. It appreciated Won1,300 to Won32,200.
HONG KONG was lower, with investors worried about an expected US interest
rate rise next week. The Hang Seng index closed 96.09 or 1.0 per cent down
at 9,434.31, off a late afternoon low of 9,414.34.
SINGAPORE declined under Wall Street's influence and there was also talk of
further margin calls being triggered after the local market failed to
sustain a technical rally seen late last week.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 20.84 to 2,331.66.
SYDNEY was lower in light volume as the market followed Wall Street. The All
Ordinaries index ended 20.5 or 1.0 per cent down at 1,979.2.
TAIPEI retreated in this year's smallest turnover on political uncertainty
ahead of the December 3 local government elections.
Brokers said confidence was so weak that even news of a 61.2 per cent surge
in the October trade surplus did not help sentiment.
The weighted index ended 52.19 lower at 6,320.02 in turnover that shrank to
TDollars 25.85bn from Saturday's TDollars 35.59bn.
Financials led the fall, with First Commercial Bank dipping TDollars 3 to
TDollars 165 and Hwa Nan Bank TDollars 2 to TDollars 194.
KUALA LUMPUR finished softer but off the day's lows in thin dealings
dominated by continued forced-selling by investors and liquidation by
institutions. The composite index lost 4.27 at 1,070.14 and volume,
estimated at 128m shares, was the lowest of the year.
MANILA saw profit-taking and a big drop in blue chip issues led by
Philippine National Bank, which pulled the market lower after the recent
rally. The composite index closed 48.64 down at 3,047.94 as PNB lost 25
pesos or 6.9 per cent at 340 pesos.
Petron fell 3.8 per cent to 25.50 pesos and Benpres Holding dropped 4 per
cent to 12.25 pesos, but Pryce Properties bucked the trend, jumping 9.2 per
cent to 1.90 pesos.
WELLINGTON was again led lower by a weak Telecom as foreign demand, which
had supported the stock, dried up. The NZSE-40 Capital index slipped 5.57 to
2,107.66 as Telecom fell 9 cents to NZDollars 5.38 after Friday's 19-cent
drop.
BOMBAY picked up from early lows after India's biggest private sector group,
Reliance Industries, announced that it was planning to merge with two of its
subsidiaries, Reliance Polyethylene and Reliance Polypropylene.
The BSE 30-share index finished 4.27 higher at 4,308.70, after touching a
low of 4,281.02. Reliance moved ahead Rs3.75 to Rs398.75.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Nordic bourse review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nordic bourses had the worst time in Europe's equity markets last week. This
follows periods of outperformance in October, since June 30 and over the
year to date, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices. Unibank
Securities notes that EU opinion polls in Sweden and in Norway have shown
continued rejection of membership, while the Finnish parliament has delayed
ratification of its own 'yes' referendum vote until after the Swedish poll
next Sunday.
Meanwhile, the painful wait for the next US interest rates increase meant a
sharp rise in yield spreads against German bunds, in Sweden and Norway in
particular. Sore spots in Finland included an attempt to block the EU 'yes'
vote by filibuster. In Denmark, there was bad corporate news from Burmeister
&amp; Wain which lost it two-thirds of its remaining equity capitalisation; a
10.7 per cent drop in EAC in spite of its sale of none-core assets for
considerable profits in the Far East; and weakness in the AP Moeller
shipping companies.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Big swings again in Italian
bank shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low volume featured in most bourses as the dollar moved into an uneasy calm
ahead of today's congressional elections in the US, and talk mounted of a
rise in US interest rates next week, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN saw renewed tensions among the government coalition partners as the
Comit index gave up 5.49 to 623.81. The banking sector, however, continued
to see frenetic activity. Ambroveneto finished L674 or 12.9 per cent down at
L4,558, off a day's low of L4,200 after the shareholder syndicate appeared
to have erected defences against the BCI takeover threat. BCI eased L31 to
L3,502.
Credito Romagnolo, object of a similar bid by Credito Italiano, appeared to
fall in sympathy, giving up L534 or 3.1 per cent to L16,428. Credito
Italiano was down L19 at L1,552.
Preferred shares of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura surged 19.7 per cent at
the opening, before edging back to finish L213 or 18.1 per cent ahead at
L1,483. The ordinary shares eased L13 to L2,887. All BNA shares were
suspended on Friday after newspaper reports, subsequently denied by the
bank, that it was considering transforming preferred shares into ordinary
shares. Yesterday, 864,000 preferred were traded compared with just 61,000
on Thursday.
FRANKFURT was preoccupied with the reunification tax surcharge, tax needs in
general and their effect on consumption prospects; this weighed on
retailers, and to a degree on carmakers as the Dax index fell 24.04 to
2,043.52 on the session, with little change after hours.
Turnover fell from DM5.6bn to only DM3.6bn. Among retailers, Karstadt and
Kaufhof both fell by more than 3 per cent on the session, dropping DM18.50
to DM586.50, and DM17.50 to DM482; the three big carmakers, BMW, Daimler and
Volkswagen, dropped by DM14.50 to DM767, DM17.80 to DM753.40, and DM10.80 to
DM436 respectively.
At James Capel, Mr Frank Jonuschat said that Karstadt had come in for
selling following relative strength against the sector, and in a German
context over the last four and twelve-week periods.
However, the integration of its Hertie acquisition was seen as a short term
brake on progress; worries over solidarity tax have been joined by the view
that wage negotiations this year are unlikely to produce any real gains in
consumption; and last summer, added Mr Jonuschat, was one of the worst for
retailers on record.
PARIS reflected the weakness on the bond markets, but turnover was thin at
just FFr2.5bn. The CAC-40 index ended off 25.58 or 1.3 per cent at 1,906.07,
with lossess accelerating as Wall Street opened lower.
Credit National, the corporate banking group, outperformed the market,
rising FFr34.60 or 9 per cent to FFr409.20 on speculation that it could be
vulnerable to a takeover bid. Earlier in the year the government said that
it would surrender its right to appoint the chairman, and its power of veto
over board decisions; an extraordinary shareholders meeting tomorrow should
decide on changes to the compnay structure.
Shares in the bank have fallen sharply this year, having opened on January 1
at FFr700.
ZURICH saw some late buying after futures firmed, and the SMI index overcame
early losses to finish 16.9 ahead at 2,557.9 in thin volume.
Activity remained focused mainly on Holderbank and financial issues.
Holderbank bearers added SFr16 to SFr1,036 in continued response to Friday's
strong 1994 profits forecast. Among other cyclicals, Elektrowatt added SFr8
to SFr353 and MotorColumbus gained SFr20 to SFr1,910.
UBS bearers picked up SFr19 to SFr1,159 after recent falls, with the bank
said to be a buyer. The registered closed SFr5 higher at SFr264.
AMSTERDAM's AEX index closed at a session low of 408.60, down 2.20. Ahold,
the retailer, went against the trend, rising Fl 1.20 to Fl 50.40 on reports
that its subsidiary, Schuitema, had seen a 20 per cent rise in nine-month
profits.
However, the big multinationals, Royal Dutch and Unilever, fell respectively
by Fl 2.90 and Fl 1.00 to Fl 189.40 and Fl 198.60. Some US selling was seen
ahead of both companies third quarter results due out later this week.
Profit-taking lay behind falls in Philips and KLM, which both came out with
good figures last week but fell yesterday by Fl 1.70 and 70 cents, to Fl
54.10 and Fl 47.20.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Second tier currencies make all the running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Second tier currencies made the running yesterday on the foreign exchanges,
with most of the main currencies rangebound, writes Philip Gawith.
Following last week's intervention by the US Federal Reserve, traders said
the market was taking a 'wait and see' attitude to the dollar ahead of the
November 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
It closed slightly weaker in London, from last Friday, at DM1.5172 from
DM1.5235, and at Y97.31 from Y97.8. In New York it ended at DM1.5170 and
Y97.345. Trade was generally very quiet, a fact partially substantiated by
Bank of Japan figures showing dollar/yen spot turnover in Tokyo yesterday as
the lowest, at Dollars 2.172bn, in 15 months.
Currencies in the news included the Swedish krona, which weakened on fears
of a vote against joining the European Union; the Portuguese escudo, which
broke through the Es102 level against the D-Mark; and the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, which both continued their recent appreciation.
The trade weighted sterling index was unchanged at 80.6. In Europe the
D-Mark closed slightly weaker against most currencies. Against the French
franc it finished at FFr3.427 from FFr3.431.
Last week's intervention by the Fed in support of the dollar has made
traders wary of selling it. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist
at UBS in London, commented: 'People are just waiting to see what happens
next with the Fed. They are not prepared to take a big punt.'
Speaking after a meeting in Basle of the G10 central bank governors
committee, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, chairman, and also president of the
Bundesbank, said intervention had been discussed. He said 'things were done
appropriately and it was seen positively' but gave no hint of what lay
ahead.
Mr Malcolm Barr, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said a measure of how
quiet trade had been was that the Dollars /DM trading range, in Europe, of
about 70 basis points was about half the average daily range of 120 to 130
basis points.
Mr Brian Marber, technical analyst, still maintained that the dollar's long
term trend is down. He noted that at its recent low against the D-Mark it
had only fallen 15.2 per cent, against the 24.4 to 29.9 per cent swings in
all five 'major moves' since December 1987.
The charts also have a potentially gloomy message for sterling. While not
calling a reversal, Mr Marber pointed out that between 1985 and March 1994
there were seven occasions when the pound rose for periods of 20 to 26 weeks
without any significant reaction intervening. From the March 1994 low to
last month's peak, 29 weeks elapsed, the longest run since 1985, during
which sterling gained nearly 18 cents.
After the seven previous multi-week advances, sterling lost an average of 59
per cent of its gains, on two occasions surrendering 100 per cent and more.
Were it to lose 59 per cent of the rise made since March, it would fall to
Dollars 1.5335.
The pound gained limited support from the unexpectedly strong UK output
figures. September industrial output rose by 1.1 per cent, for a
year-on-year gain of 6.6 per cent.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said there was still
some nervousness in sterling markets about a near-term rise in UK interest
rates. He added that the strong production figures had improved the prospect
of interest rates rising this year, though he still favoured early 1995 for
the next tightening.
The prospect of higher rates prompted a fall in short sterling, with the
December contract closing at 93.56, from 93.60. In the cash markets,
three-month LIBOR firmed to 6 3/16 per cent, from 6 1/16 per cent.
In its daily operations the Bank of England gave Pounds 490m assistance at
established rates, and Pounds 585m of late support, after forecasting a
Pounds 1.2bn shortage. Overnight money traded between 5 5/8 and 6 1/2 per
cent.
The Swedish krona continued to take its lead from EU opinion polls. A
weekend poll showing more opposition to, than support for, EU membership,
drove the krona as low as SKr4.8675 per D-Mark, before it rallied to end at
SKr4.843.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was firm, rising to Dollars 0.7539 from
Dollars 0.7484. Analysts said it was benefiting from the market perception
that the Reserve Bank had acted pre-emptively to combat inflation.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):
Exaggerated threat seen in eastern promise - The agricultural potential of
the former communist bloc may be overestimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most UK farmers have absorbed the European Union's common agricultural
policy reforms far more easily than they dared hope when the measures were
agreed in 1992. More than two years through the three-year programme they
find themselves making bigger margins, not the smaller profits they had been
led to expect.
There are a few exceptions, particularly among the producers of pigs, fruit
and vegetables - significantly, perhaps, all virtually unsupported by the
EU. For most of the rest, the first two years of reform have been good ones.
However, as those measures are concluded in the middle of next year, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement, assuming it is
universally ratified, is scheduled to come into effect. Key aspects
affecting EU agriculture are the reduction of internal support for the
industry by 20 per cent; a cut in export subsidies of 36 per cent and in
export volumes of 21 per cent - all to be phased in over six years.
EU officials have consistently claimed that these measures could be achieved
within those already taken in reforming the CAP; that the production control
afforded by acreage set-aside, combined with a forecast increase in internal
consumption of lower priced EU-produced raw materials for feeding to
livestock, would remove the need for further restrictive policies.
Britain's National Farmers' Union has never accepted this and has predicted
that crop yields would continue to increase across the EU, thereby negating
much of the effect of idling land. Moreover, the NFU, along with many farm
industry pundits, believes that further reform of the CAP, within the next
few years, is inevitable.
At grass roots level, however, this prospect is causing hardly a ripple.
Farmers have money in their pockets and a degree of complacency has set in.
'If we can come through CAP reform as easily as we have,' the thinking goes,
'we can handle anything else that happens.'
This attitude fails to recognise that much of the present prosperity can be
attributed to the devaluation of sterling two years ago which, because
guaranteed prices are set in European currency units, had the effect of most
sterling farm prices by about 20 per cent - an advantage not enjoyed across
the rest of the EU. The other reasons for UK farmers being better off than
expected at present have been kind weather, good yields and shortfalls in
the harvests of other countries.
One subject that does raise fears for the future, however, is the
enlargement of the EU. Not that which has already occurred, for the farmers
of Finland, Norway and Austria - as well as Sweden (if that country decides
to join) - are known to have been supported at significantly higher levels
than those in the existing EU and their produce will not, therefore,
undercut that in member states. It is the old communist bloc that causes
greatest concern and the fear that low-priced farm products from those
countries could be allowed unrestricted access to newly-unsupported western
European markets.
To most farmers the possible threat from eastern Europe remains something of
a mystery. That it is vast is well appreciated; that it may have enormous
agricultural potential is the fear. And recent reports of ways in which that
potential is already being unlocked by international entrepreneurs increases
the level of apprehension.
A German friend of mine, Christof graf Grote, who has interests in farms in
Norfolk, western Germany and the old East Germany, told a farming conference
last week how he and a partner had also taken a 12-year lease on a block of
land in Ukraine. The rent was half that for comparable land in the UK, he
said, 'and the potential is absolutely staggering'.
He told, too, how he was enjoying similar success in eastern Germany.
Indeed, he had already decided that the way to maximise his income from the
German land was to ship the grain he grew there direct from the farm to
mills in the UK.
All of which sounds intensely threatening to British farmers who lack the
business and linguistic skills necessary to operate internationally. But do
isolated instances like that, which rely almost entirely on western
management and capital, indicate that eastern European agriculture is an
imminent threat to that in western Europe? Having myself visited several of
the countries concerned in recent years, my assessment is that they do not
pose such a threat, at least for several years to come.
Moreover, a recent report by the NFU appears to support my view and,
incidentally, in spite of his personal successes, that of Christof graf
Grote. For although some areas in some of the countries in eastern Europe do
have unrealised potential, the majority have severe climatic disadvantages
compared to the UK and most of western Europe, suffering from long cold
winters and hot dry summers.
Even more significant are the cultural, capital and political problems,
which will take many years to resolve. Corruption is widespread, inertia is
endemic. It takes a brave man like Christof graf Grote to tackle them.
Meanwhile, the new democratic governments of many of the former communist
states are busy recreating small farm structures more appropriate for the
last century than for the next.
As always, there are exceptions that prove the rule. Labour-intensive crops
like cherries and soft fruit for processing are already coming into the EU
from some eastern European countries, undermining the prices and profits of
UK producers. Such trade will doubtless continue to be the subject of
lobbying by specialist producers.
For mainstream commodities like cereals, however, I cannot believe that
eastern Europe will pose a serious threat for 10 or perhaps 20 years.
Meanwhile, western European farmers will legitimately try to ensure that
when the former communist countries join the EU they do so on terms that are
fair to those of us already here and do not skew the agricultural production
base from west to east.

Farming in the European Union has become concentrated in far fewer hands
over the past decade and the trend is set to continue, according to the
European Commission.
The number of farms in the EU declined by 13.2 per cent between 1980 and
1990, says a report on the future for young farmers, to be presented to
agriculture ministers at the end of the year.
The decline was even more dramatic in individual member states, with Denmark
seeing a 34 per cent fall in farm numbers, Belgium 26 per cent and Ireland
24 per cent.
The amount of land in agricultural use in the EU remained stable at 115m
hectares, while average farm size increased by 11.2 per cent.
Mr Frank Leguen de Lacroix, a senior Commission official, said concentration
of farming would continue, given that 55 per cent of farmers were aged 55 or
over and many had no direct heir.
The trend would be particularly pronounced in Greece and southern Italy,
where farms had become fragmented and agriculture was not always the
farmer's main source of income.
'We need to rationalise if farms are to be economic propositions and if
farmers are to be able to apply the environmental constraints which are
being phased in,' he said. Mr Lacroix accepted that young farmers and
potential farmers were worried about their future, given the difficulty of
entering quota-capped sectors and the prospect of further changes to the
common agricultural policy.
But he said some fears were exaggerated.
'In the UK, there's a feeling that this (system of subsidies) can't last,
that it must end in 1996. But in other countries the pressure is such as to
keep the current system going. It's a fundamental issue of faith.'
The report, commissioned by ministers during the Greek presidency in May,
will highlight the extremes of farming across the EU. Average farm size in
Greece, for example, is 4ha, compared with 68ha in the UK.
Some 7.6m people were employed in agriculture and forestry in 1992. But
farming as a percentage of the workforce varied from 27 per cent in Greece
to 2.2 per cent in Britain.
Young farmers commonly started out in horticulture and the dairy sector.
Their level of indebtedness also varied enormously, from Ecu 1,807 in Spain
to Ecu 205,000 in Denmark.
'These figures. . . emphasise the differences of approach we may need to
take if we are to encourage young people to choose a career in farming,'
said Mr Leguen de Lacroix.
Citing examples of how member states aid new entrants, he said Denmark kept
29 per cent of its milk quota reserves for young producers, while France
trained young farmers and encouraged older producers to transfer tenancies
to young people outside their families.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Middle way urged for EU
agricultural policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farming without subsidies can lead to rural decline, a neglected countryside
and volatile incomes for farmers. It can also mean more opportunities for
new entrants, innovative marketing of produce and less bureaucracy.
Mr Graham McConnell, a New Zealander who recently took over as principal of
Harper Adams, a leading British agricultural college, believes European
agriculture should find a middle way between the extremes of hefty subsidies
and free markets.
Some 10 per cent of total farm income in Australia and 5 per cent in New
Zealand is derived from subsidies, compared with 38 per cent in the European
Union.
Mr McConnell, who taught farm management in Australia for 16 years before
moving to the UK, told a recent conference organised by the Country
Landowners' Association:
'An undeniable consequence of free market farming is frequent periods of low
profitability and consequential decline of rural communities and services.'
Farming at world prices means uncertainty is greater and farmers are less
willing and able to borrow to expand, said Mr McConnell. Some farms are
run-down, and farmers employ as few staff as possible, adopting a
conservative approach of 'low debt, low stocking rates and low risk.'
He added: 'Rural depopulation is a serious consequence of low farmer incomes
 .There are many semi-ghost towns with no industry and surrounded by an
impoverished farming community'.
On the other hand, volatile land and stock values in Australia and New
Zealand provided regular opportunities to buy at a discount. 'In both
countries, there are still opportunities for a keen young person. . . to go
farming in his own right. This is usually achieved by leasing land initially
or share milking.'
Mr McConnell said it was impossible to back one or other system completely,
especially in a European Union of 350m people, compared with Australia's 18m
and New Zealand's 3.5m. 'It is illogical to believe that the EU and Britain
must choose one or the other, with no middle ground.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian purchase to boost
Cominco zinc output by 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cominco of Canada, one of the world's leading producers of refined zinc,
will increase its total output by around 50 per cent with its purchase of
Peru's Cajamarquilla zinc refinery.
The Vancouver-based company, in association with the Marubeni Corporation of
Japan, bid Dollars 193m for the refinery at a public auction on Friday that
produced no rival offers. Cominco has 83 per cent of the consortium,
Marubeni - a holder of Peruvian secondary debt paper - the remainder.
According to Cominco's Mr Richard Mundie, the Cajamarquilla purchase 'will
permit highly attractive synergies' with the company's Canadian-Alaskan
operations. Customers in Asia will be served with zinc refined in Canada,
while Cajamarquilla - just 30 miles east of Lima's port of Callao - will
ship zinc to Europe. Cominco's Trail refinery in Vancouver at present
produces almost a tenth of the world's refined zinc.
Cominco's offer was Dollars 33m above the base price fixed for the sale of
Dollars 120m cash and Dollars 40m in secondary debt paper. Under highly
favourable conditions, apparently designed to encourage local bids for the
refinery, the bulk of the cash payment will be spread over the next fourteen
years.
There is also a Dollars 20m minimum investment commitment for upgrading and
expanding the refinery over the next four years. Mr Mundie expects that,
with 'marginal improvements', Cajamarquilla's production can be boosted from
its present 90,000 tonnes to around 140,000 tonnes of refined zinc a year.
Production costs in Peru, despite expensive energy, will not be
substantially different from those in Canada, company officials said.
Cominco recently set up a local office in Peru and has around a dozen people
working in exploration. It participated in the auction for the La Granja
copper deposits last February, which went to another Canadian company
Cambior. Cominco says it is also considering a bid for the Peruvian copper
deposits of Michiquillay, scheduled for sale shortly.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (14): Foreign
exposure pared down - Japan / Emiko Terazono examines investment strategies
in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Takahide Sakurai, head of the Japanese life insurers' association, is
frustrated by accusations that the industry is reluctant to invest abroad.
'The life insurance industry always seems to be blamed for the yen's
appreciation,' he says.
Japanese life insurers, the country's main institutional investors who have
suffered a sharp fall in unrealised profits on their stock holdings, remain
risk-averse in their investment strategies. Over the past few years, they
have been paring down their exposure to foreign investments, and have
allocated only a minimal amount to the domestic stock market.
The general understanding within the Tokyo financial community has been that
institutional investors have had a traditional role of recycling Japan's
current account surplus by buying foreign bonds and stocks. But the recent
rise in the yen has led to foreign exchange losses, and they have cut
investments in overseas financial markets, thus stopping the outflow of
capital from Japan.
During the 1980s, the life assurers increased investments in overseas
securities with high coupons, especially in US bonds. However, the industry
was hit by the subsequent rise in the yen which resulted in foreign exchange
losses of around Y4,600bn between 1985 and 1987, which was compensated by
the sales of life assurers' securities holdings.
Arguments over the life assurers' influence on the currency market aside,
statistics show that in spite of an overall increase in assets of Y3,400bn
during the first four months of the current business year, the insurers'
sold a net Y1,100bn in overseas securities. Only Y70bn were allocated to
domestic equities, Y4,400bn to Japanese bonds.
Mr Sakurai, also president of Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, admits that life
insurers remain bearish towards foreign investments. The amount of overseas
securities investments at Dai-Ichi has fallen to a third of the peak in the
late 1980s. For the industry as a whole, the outstanding balance of foreign
securities holdings declined 28 per cent from the peak in 1989 to Y14,047bn,
constituting 8.3 per cent of total assets, down from 15.3 per cent.
The risk-averse strategy at the insurers stems from the plunge in unrealised
profits on their stock holdings following the burst of the asset 'bubble'.
Although their unrealised gains on domestic equities recovered slightly in
the year to the end of March, 1994, thanks to a modest recovery in the Tokyo
stock market, the level is still substantially lower than the peak reached
in 1988. According to Credit Suisse in Tokyo, unrealised gains at the top 18
life assurers for the last business year totalled Y12,500bn, down 72 per
cent from 1988.
Without the gains on securities holdings, which have acted as a buffer
against losses on investments, the insurance companies remain reluctant to
take risks. 'In other words, the yen is unlikely to weaken unless the Tokyo
stock market rebounds,' says one fund manager.
However, some analysts believe that, under the right circumstances, Japanese
institutions could increase their investments in US bonds as was done in the
1980s.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo points out that in October and November last year
Japanese residents were net buyers of Dollars 20bn in foreign bonds. This
coincided with a widening of the yield difference in 10-year bonds and a
weakening of the yen. Hence they reason that wide differentials between
domestic and US interest rates, signs of stability in the US Treasury market
and a stable currency market could induce Japanese purchases of US bonds.
On the other hand, Ms Mami Yoda, analyst at Credit Suisse, says asset
allocation at Japanese life insurance companies will remain conservative.
'Lower risk assets, such as loans and domestic bonds will be the investment
choice for 70 to 80 per cent of the Y13,000bn to Y14,000bn of new money
expected in fiscal year 1994,' she says.
The introduction of an accounting rule which allows life assurers to carry
domestic bonds at the purchase price on their books is also expected to
stimulate bond investment. The new method frees the companies from declaring
unrealised losses on bond holdings and allows the assurers to focus on the
yields to maturity as a measure of their investment.
And, while interest towards emerging markets has prompted some investment in
south-east Asia, the overall proportion remains small. Institutions which
have lowered the foreign securities portion in their portfolios to around 5
per cent are likely to try to maintain such levels. 'Even if the insurers
invest in foreign securities, it will probably be in yen-denominated
eurobonds,' says Ms Yoda.
With financial deregulation increasing the competitiveness of the industry,
Japanese insurers will need to improve their fund management strategies,
which during the 1980s were dominated by the pursuit of high-yielding
investments. Following the burst of the 'bubble' economy, risk averse
products have been the core of investment strategies in 1990s.
The life insurers have lagged in implementing the concept of asset-liability
management, and only started to match assets and liabilities a few years
ago. Ms Yoda says a more flexible asset-liability management needs to be
implemented through the use of derivatives and tailored investment products.
Meanwhile, the companies need to make more objective investment decisions
rather than those based on business relationships. Insurance companies have
often been the core of cross shareholdings, buying shares to cement business
relationships or to help promote sales of insurance policies. These holdings
need to be reviewed.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (13): Capital flows
abroad continue - US / international equities still attract investors
</HEADLINE>

US investors seem to have passed the first test. Despite steadily rising
interest rates at home, the country's mutual and pension funds have
continued to channel capital into overseas equity markets through the first
three quarters of this year. International bond holdings have wobbled: but
the pessimists who predicted a quick reversal of capital flows as the US
interest rate cycle turned have been proved wrong.
The second test, though, could prove more challenging: what happens if the
dollar's long slide is reversed?
Figures for the first half of this year show that US investors have not lost
their appetite for international equities. US pension funds bought a net
Dollars 17bn of non-US shares in the first six months, compared with Dollars
35bn in all of 1993.
Mutual fund investors, meanwhile, had put a net Dollars 23bn into
international equity funds by the end of August, compared with Dollars 26bn
in 1993 as a whole (this does not include global funds, which, as the name
suggests, buy both US and non-US stocks). To be sure, the enthusiasm of
January has not been matched: in that month alone, international equity
funds attracted Dollars 6.3bn. However, the cash has continued to flow at a
steady rate.
It is not difficult to see what has drawn US investment abroad. In dollar
terms, the returns from investing in overseas markets have leapt ahead of
those available on US stocks. And with their domestic stock market still
bumping along close to its all-time high at the end of October, there seemed
little to change US investors' minds.
'Until the end of 1992, there were four consecutive years of
underperformance outside the US,' says Gavin Quill, vice-president of
marketing at Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, a US investment group. In 1993, when
US stocks returned around 5 per cent, investors in equity markets elsewhere
in the developed world saw double-digit gains: 23 per cent in Japan, 32 per
cent in Germany and 19 per cent in the UK.
Emerging markets did much better - in part thanks to the flow of US money.
Fully a half of all US international equity investment, or some Dollars
30bn, is estimated to have been directed into emerging markets last year.
Higher returns on international investment have continued to flow this year,
most notably in Japan (up around 30 per cent in dollar terms by the end of
October, twice the rise in local currency terms).
Investment returns from international bond funds, meanwhile, have slipped.
The volatility in European fixed income markets in particular has made US
investors wary, and the appetite for international bonds has waned. Between
them, pension and mutual fund investors put only Dollars 2bn into
international fixed income securities during the first six months of this
year. With bond markets falling, the overall value of their non-US bond
holdings dropped by Dollars 5bn, to Dollars 84bn.
There seem to be two messages from all of this. First, US investors'
holdings of foreign securities look more like a core part of their holdings
than they did even a year ago. From 6 per cent early in 1993, the proportion
of US mutual fund assets invested overseas has climbed to just under 10 per
cent.
A second message is that it would take a smaller proportionate adjustment by
US investors of their overseas holdings to have a bigger impact, potentially
adding to volatility in some markets. 'You may see pull-backs that have an
impact in certain thin markets for short periods of time,' says Mr Quill.
What happens, though, when the dollar changes direction? The greenback's
weakness has underpinned the steady international diversification of the
past decade. According to calculations by Goldman Sachs, since the end of
1984, when the dollar was riding high, Japanese stocks have only returned 76
per cent in yen terms. But in dollar terms, the return is 342 per cent -
compared to a 180 per cent return on US stocks in the same period.
While foreign investments have been doing well, it has been easy for the
pundits to maintain that a sea change has taken place in the attitude of US
investors: that they now accept the diversification argument that a wider
spread of investments leads to higher returns with lower risk.
Losses on foreign investments from a stronger dollar might change all that.
'When they're down 10 per cent, then we'll see how globally diverse people
really are,' says John Hickling, a manager of international funds at
Fidelity, the US's biggest mutual fund group. 'Over the short term, there is
a pretty good correlation between flows into and out of (foreign) funds and
the dollar.'
It is no coincidence that, at a time when US investors have been buying
foreign securities, their international counterparts have shown little
interest in US stocks. The same factors have been at work, only in reverse -
principally the devaluation of the dollar. Over the past six years,
foreigners have been net buyers of US stocks in three years and net sellers
in three.
In some ways, the investment losses for US investors implied by a stronger
dollar could be mitigated by the lift it could give to foreign markets. A
Japanese car maker competing with General Motors both in the US and around
the world, for instance, would benefit from a weaker yen.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (12): Pivotal issue
is pension plans - Europe / A look at the crucial question affecting
investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you believe the optimists, Europe could, in the long term, be on the
verge of an investment revolution. If you listen to the pessimists, though,
the short-term outlook suggests that investment liberalisation across the
European Union is still lagging behind many other parts of the world.
Either way, as European fund managers evaluate their long-term investment
strategies, few doubt that the crucial question that could shape capital and
equity markets in coming years will be the direction taken by Europe's
pension systems.
The issue has become increasingly controversial in recent months following
the collapse of the European pension funds directive. A pivotal aim of the
directive, first proposed by Sir Leon Brittan, the British commissioner,
back in 1989, was to create a more liberal investment structure in Europe's
pension system, in keeping with the principles of the single market.
Pension systems across the EU are a patchwork of different practices. The UK
and Ireland, for example, are dominated by funded pension systems. France's
pension structure, however, is based around a 'pay-as-you-go' system.
Meanwhile, Germany's system is dominated by a book reserve system, in which
the pensions liabilities are held on the balance sheet of sponsoring
companies.
These different systems have resulted in radically different investment
profiles. In the UK, which has relatively few controls over the degree of
portfolio diversification, domestic equities accounted for more than half of
the pension fund assets in 1993, while international equities represented
about a quarter of the assets, and domestic bonds forming less than a tenth.
But in most of the other European countries, the bulk of assets is directed
towards domestic bonds, with considerably lower net returns - albeit greater
security.
In Germany, for example, legislation stipulates that private pension funds
cannot hold more than 5 per cent of their assets in overseas equities. In
practice, in 1991 international assets represented less than 1 per cent of
German funds, with domestic bonds accounting for some 70 per cent.
Meanwhile, in France, the proportion of assets held in domestic bonds has
been steadily increasing, from 53 per cent in 1983 to 62 per cent in 1993,
while international investment in equities is non-existent.
The pension fund directive had the potential to radically change this
situation by forbidding member states from imposing low ceilings on both the
extent of overseas investment and investment in equities. Because UK fund
managers have greater expertise in equities and in cross-border investment,
they could have a competitive edge in winning mandates under the proposed EU
directive.
But though an outline agreement over this directive was in sight by the end
of last year, the stumbling block was the question of how far countries
could stipulate that pension schemes' overseas assets should be matched with
comparable levels of domestic liabilities.
The liberal 'three' of the UK, Ireland and Netherlands - who together
account for 93 per cent of overseas pension fund investment in the EU -
favoured little, or no restrictions.
Belgium appears to be joining the liberal wing and is preparing to abandon
the requirement that at least 15 per cent of assets be invested in domestic
government bonds.
But at the opposite end, there was little interest in encouraging pension
schemes to invest outside their home borders. Countries such as France
demanded a tougher 'currency matching' requirement of 80 per cent.
The European Commission sought to reach a compromise level of 60 per cent,
pointing out that this should be sufficient even in 'liberal' countries such
as Britain. (The Frank Russell group in London, for example, suggests that
the optimum level for international investment for a British scheme, for
example, will usually be between 30-50 per cent).
But, in practice, no agreement was reached, and this summer the directive
was scrapped. The Commission insists the initiative is not entirely dead,
and says it will still seek to pursue its aims for greater liberalisation by
other means. One of these may be taking countries to court to enforce the
Capital Liberalisation Directive and other provisions in the Maastricht
treaty which prohibit barriers to the freedom of movement of capital. But
the legal force of the Capital Liberalisation Directive remains uncertain,
since it includes a 'prudential requirements' provision which states that
liberalisation is only enforceable if there are adequate prudential
safeguards for investment across the entire EU.
The events are a blow to many British fund managers, who had been hoping for
a captive market for their business across Europe. But how far the demise of
directive alone has altered the longer-term development of European
investment remains unclear.
On the one hand, cynics point out that even if the directive had come into
force it would have been unlikely by itself to have forced much overnight
change in the conservative behaviour of continental European pension fund
managers, which leaves many of them favouring the security of bonds.
But, on the other hand, irrespective of the collapse of the directive, it
appears that many European countries are anyway gradually moving towards
pension reforms that may incorporate greater liberalisation and privately
funded bias.
The main reason for this is demographic pressures, as the rising numbers of
pensioners pose an ever greater burden on the working population. The
Federal Trust, a British think tank, for example, calculates that if the
current pension system is not altered, public expenditure on pensions over
the next 40 years will rise by more than 30 per cent in Belgium and the UK,
40 per cent in Germany and Italy and a staggering 70 per cent in France.
These trends are already forcing some shifts. This summer the French
parliament passed a bill allowing for the establishment of private pension
funds for the self-employed. Proposals are being considered for wider
reforms, though these are unlikely to receive serious consideration until
after the French presidential elections next year. And though few observers
expect any rapid switch out of domestic bonds into overseas investment, the
prospect is creeping on to the agenda.
'The question of investment into equities or bonds is a very big topic at
the moment,' says one fund manager in Paris.
In the longer term, if countries such as France or Germany do shift towards
an Anglo-Saxon model the potential impact would be staggering. Philip Davis,
an economist who has previously worked at the Bank of England, for example,
believes that if French pension funds were to reach the size of UK funds,
they would total Dollars 235bn.
The equivalent development in Germany would create Dollars 400bn worth of
assets, compared to the Dollars 355bn total capitalisation of the German
stock market.
A shift of this magnitude, Mr Davis concludes, could have a huge
significance on global markets. 'Heightened volatility and lower returns on
equity are among the potential consequences,' he says.
Meanwhile, in the short term many British investment institutions are
already edging into Europe. Andrew Dalton, vice-chairman of the UK Mercury
Asset Management group, for example, says that his group has recently
established a presence in Germany to work within the areas of German law
which allow them to offer their services, primarily to the corporate sector.
'The demand is coming in the market place for the product - it is clearly
something that must grow,' he says.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (11): Deregulation
the driving force - Real estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The turmoil in bond markets this year has spilled over into most
international property markets. While improved levels of economic activity
promise good investment returns from property, rising bond yields have taken
the shine off the early stages of recovery.
However, cross-border investment in property is often driven more by
financial deregulation than any cool assessment of market conditions. The
flows of Japanese, Swedish and German money into London over the past decade
were prompted by regulatory changes which gave the institutions a free hand.
The impact of deregulation is especially powerful when institutions are
already riding a wave of liquidity. Thus the deregulation of German
open-ended mutual funds coincided with a period of high net investment by
retail investors. Fund managers had the cash and the regulatory authority to
buy City of London office blocks. Even though London property prices are now
flat or falling - thanks to the drag of bond yields - the flow of overseas
money continues.
According to Jones Lang Wootton, institutional investors bought Pounds 1.8bn
of central London property during the first nine months of the year. UK
investors accounted for only 55 per cent of this turnover. Of the overseas
buyers, German open-ended funds were the most active.
A similar pattern is seen in continental European markets. There is strong
investment demand for German property, for example, much of it from
overseas. Since development activity was muted in most cities other than
Berlin and borrowing costs were falling through the year - at least in terms
of short-term interest rates - the German property market has shown strong
capital growth.
However, the pattern of supply and demand in individual cities can change
quickly. In Berlin, up to 1.5m sq m of office space will be built this year
and next. Since take-up by tenants was only 200,000 sq m in 1993, there is a
real threat of oversupply.
In France, domestic institutions have been concentrating their efforts on
the retail sector, partly driven by the need to diversify away from offices.
Overseas investors, mostly from Holland and the UK, have also concentrated
on shopping centres.
Schroders International Property fund, based in Amsterdam, recently acquired
its third French shopping centre, at Amiens in Picardy. Hammerson, the UK
company which recently sold its Australian assets, is also on the look-out
for shopping centres in France.
In the US, Atlanta and Washington DC have emerged as the most desirable
cities for overseas investors, according to the Association of Foreign
Investors in US Real Estate (Afire). Atlanta, which was the second most
popular destination for overseas investment in 1993, was ranked as the most
viable city for foreign real estate investment, followed by Washington, New
York, Phoenix, and Charlotte.
Afire also refutes claims that Japanese investors have been trying to
offload assets acquired in the 1980s.
'There have been rumours that the Japanese are trying to sell but no
evidence of it,' said James Fetgatter, chief executive of Afire, which
represents about half the foreign investment in US real estate. 'Japanese
investment has remained at the same level for the past four years.'
Most of the new foreign investment in US property is coming from Europe. An
Afire survey found 46 per cent of respondents planning to increase US
holdings, up 14 per cent from 1993.
Property advisers agree that even the most overbuilt cities such as Denver
and Boston are showing signs of recovery.
The lingering worry for the UK property market is that overseas investors
often seem more enthusiastic about the opportunities than their domestic
counterparts. UK pension funds' average weighting in property is now around
7 per cent, having fallen steadily from a peak of more than 20 per cent in
the mid-1970s.
According to second quarter figures from the Central Statistical Office (the
latest available) this trend continued. Life insurance companies were
enthusiastic buyers, investing a record Pounds 2bn in commercial property
during the three months Yet pension funds were net sellers, shedding a net
Pounds 246m-worth of property.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the weight of life insurance company money
waiting to come into commercial property started to diminish in late spring.
The property investment market was unusually quiet through September and
October, traditionally one of the most active periods for institutional
dealing.
Fund managers' caution is understandable. The property market went off the
boil over the summer against the background of rising bond yields. Rental
growth, which would help property detach from bonds, has been slower to show
through than many investors hoped.
The net effect has been falling capital values. The Investment Property
Databank Index for September showed a drop in capital values after 14 months
of upswing.
Just how long investors have to wait before rents start to rise is a moot
point. Some agents suggest rents on prime City offices have already started
to climb. Richard Ellis pointed to 8 per cent rental growth in the third
quarter of the year, with prime City rents rising from Pounds 30 per square
ft to around Pounds 32.50.
Unless there is a huge reversal of fortune in the final weeks of the year,
UK commercial property should still outperform both equities and gilts in
1994. A total return of around 14 per cent this year should be enough to
beat other financial assets.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (10): Tough going
for managers - Stock markets / Martin Dickson discusses prospects for global
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity fund managers have found 1994 tough going as global markets have
painfully adapted to a fundamental economic shift from a world of falling
interest rates to one of monetary tightening - or the threat of it - in many
western nations.
The big turning point in investor sentiment occurred last February when the
US Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy for the first time in five
years as a cyclical upswing in the American economy gathered strength.
The turn in the interest rate cycle sent US and European bond prices
tumbling, and the fixed income market's reversal was accentuated by a
liquidity squeeze on speculative traders and a sudden concern that the Fed
was doing too little, too late, to stop a resurgence of inflation.
US equities were inevitably dragged down by the rising trend of interest
rates, as were many principal European markets and some emerging markets -
and for much of the year stock markets have found it hard to escape the
volatile and bearish mood in the fixed income sector.
That said, the correction in the equity markets has been less severe than
that in bonds and a somewhat more stable atmosphere in the fixed income
sector around the middle of the year underpinned a brief, modest rally in
stocks.
The FT-Actuaries World Index stood roughly 7 per cent higher on the year in
dollar terms at the end of October, though that advance shrinks to a mere
1.6 per cent once Japan is excluded. Japan's stock market rally since the
start of the year is a mere 8.3 per cent in yen terms but totals 24 per cent
in dollar terms, thanks to the appreciation of the Japanese currency.
The main question now is the extent to which global equity markets can build
on this modest advance at a time when two powerful forces are pushing the
main western markets in opposite directions.
One is rising bond yields, which tend to have a depressing effect on share
prices, both because they make fixed income investments relatively more
attractive and because they push up corporations' funding costs.
The other is economic recovery - which is relatively mature in the US but is
just getting into its stride in continental Europe and is likely to produce
a strong burst of earnings growth over the next year or two.
An important factor in this tussle will be the future direction of bond
prices. While short-term interest rates seem set for a substantial
tightening, more bullish analysts argue that long-term bond yields are
already discounting far more inflation than is likely to materialise in the
main western economies in the near term.
They point out that inflation is currently very subdued on both sides of the
Atlantic and argue that it will remain modest, despite economic expansion,
thanks to factors such as increased productivity and increased global
competition. The implication is that long bond yields have reached a
plateau, allowing equity prices to rise as earnings increase or as bond
yields drop.
More bearish analysts argue that inflation will accelerate significantly
over the next year or two, due to central bank complacency in failing to
tighten monetary policy aggressively, and this will continue to exert upward
pressure on bond yields and hold back equities.
In particular, they argue that the economic recovery in the US - which tends
to set sentiment in other markets around the world - is now very mature, and
it cannot be long before an eventual slowdown in the growth of earnings is
reflected in stock prices.
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a correction of around
10 per cent in the two months following the Fed's February tightening and
since then has gradually gained ground, so that at the start of November it
stood just 70 points short of its all-time high of 3978.36, reached at the
end of January.
As for Europe, the FT-Actuaries World Index for the region showed a mere 3.2
per cent advance in dollar terms in 1994 up to the end of October, with the
British and French components slightly down and Germany slightly ahead. The
Nordic countries showed a 22.3 per cent advance. The Italian market was up
15 per cent, though that represented a sharp drop from the 40 per cent surge
it enjoyed early in the year during the national election campaign.
Many analysts think European equity markets as a whole should do well over
the next 12 months, with Germany particularly favoured, thanks to recovering
earnings and political stability in the wake of the Kohl government's
re-election last month.
Opinions are more sharply divided over Japan, where the equity market gained
strongly in the first half of the year as foreign investors anticipated
economic recovery. But since then the market has fallen back sharply -
despite analysts' forecasts of better earnings in 1995 - as domestic
investors have held back. One question is the extent to which the Japanese
financial system and industry still need to be restructured.
Emerging equity markets have also displayed a very mixed picture over the
past year. Many suffered sharp setbacks in the early months of the year in
the backwash from the Federal Reserve's February tightening and have spent
the succeeding months clawing back a substantial part of those losses.
Substantial outperformers include South Korea, where share prices rose some
30 per cent in local currency terms between the year's April low point and
mid-October, helped by a recovering economy and easing of tension with North
Korea; and Brazil, where the indices have soared on the back of the
government's successful attack on inflation and a national election outcome
liked by the financial markets.
Significant underperformers include Hong Kong, weighed down by concern over
local property prices, rising US interest rates and rising economic
difficulties in mainland China.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (7): Choppy
conditions likely to continue - Bonds / Conner Middelmann discusses the
effects of the bear market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN

<TEXT>
The year 1994 will not be easily forgotten by fixed-income fund managers.
It started out promisingly enough, at the height of a global bond rally
which had driven yields close to their historical lows. Expecting
bond-positive fundamentals to continue into 1994, the majority of fund
managers went into the new year holding long positions in most markets - an
error many spent the rest of the year scrambling to rectify.
'We haven't come out of this year in flying colours as an industry,' says
Peter Flynn, a director of the fixed income group at Fleming Investment
Management. 'Many fund managers were like rabbits caught in the headlights,'
he says. he added: 'The majority got it plain wrong: many thought Europe
would decouple from the US market and continue to outperform, but that
didn't happen.'
After the spectacular bull run in 1993, the market's fortunes turned
abruptly in early February when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates
for the first time in the current cycle, raising fears of inflation fuelled
by economic growth. Further pressure came from the failure of US-Japanese
trade talks, which undermined the dollar - contrary to widespread
expectations for a strengthening US currency. Both of these factors
triggered heavy selling by highly leveraged bond market operators, causing
prices to spiral lower.
'The mother of all bond rallies turned into the mother of all bear markets,'
sighs one portfolio manager.
In this environment, many investors fled to the sidelines, reducing their
exposure to a minimum. But while investor demand for bonds was shrinking,
supply was swelling through heavy debt issuance by governments around the
world. Moreover, huge amounts of supply which had been issued in 1993 and
placed in loose hands flooded back to haunt the market.
All this pushed bond yields - nominal and real - to dizzy heights, where, it
was hoped, they would eventually lure investors back into the market.
Although this appears to have begun in recent weeks, many investors remain
reluctant to launch a bold comeback. Indeed, many fund managers got their
fingers so badly burnt that they are likely to keep a very low profile
between now and the end of the year.
'As we get closer to year-end a lot of investors will just sit on their
hands,' says Paul Campayne, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.
'It's been a bad year for investors, and I think a lot of them will prefer
to stay out than take any more bets.'
JP Morgan's Global Government Bond Index, which many fund managers track as
their performance benchmark, has shed 4.1 per cent in the year to
mid-October, after rising by 14.5 per cent in 1993. The European index has
been even more volatile, dropping by 5 per cent so far this year after
gaining 20.6 per cent last year.
However, many fund managers appear even to have underperformed their
benchmarks: according to data compiled by Micropal, an independent data
provider, investors who put their money in UK unit trusts investing in gilts
and international bonds have lost an average 10.77 per cent (including
charges) in the year to October 17.
While there have been few success stories, there has been successful damage
control, especially by the lucky few who reduced their bond market exposure
early on.
'We felt everything had got hugely carried away last year and were very
nervous for a large part of 1993, so we scaled back our exposure during the
year - if anything, we came out too early,' says Gerard Wherity, director of
fixed interest at Abbey Life.
This year, Mr Wherity says he concentrated on core markets in Europe, US
Treasuries and Japan and avoided some of the more peripheral markets.
The higher-yielding peripheral markets, including Scandinavia and southern
Europe, were particularly badly hit during the sell-off. During the 1993
rally, they were boosted by yield-hungry investors seeking yield pick-ups
over the core markets which had already become very expensive. But after
sentiment turned they got hammered as investors refocused on these
countries' fiscal and political concerns.
Cash also proved a safe haven during the worst of the sell-off, says Mr
Wherity. 'At some points in the first half of the year we had more than 50
per cent in cash.' He says he started running down cash positions from
mid-year, bringing cash holdings down to around 14 per cent in mid-October -
the lowest it's been all year.
However, although he feels there is scope for a sizeable bounce, he says it
is hard to predict where the markets will go next. 'I have no faith in all
the economic arguments for a bond rally - that's all crystal ball-gazing. We
will simply wait and see how things develop and take it from there.'
In the next 18 months, as Europe's economies continue to grow, fears of
inflationary pressures will remain on the boil and interest rates are
expected to rise across Europe. This is likely to spell continued choppy
conditions for the bond markets, although some expect volatility to ease.
'This year saw the transition from falling to rising interest rates, and the
market was split among those who expected rates to ease further and those
expecting them to rise,' says Ian Donald, a fund manager at Lazard
Investors. 'Next year will see a much clearer trend as far as interest rate
expectations go - the question now is not whether rates will rise, but only
by how much,' he says, adding that he expects markets to be less volatile as
a result.
But how can bond fund managers, who are essentially bull-market
professionals, prosper in an environment where interest rates are rising?
Basically, they will have to refine the way they take bets on interest
rates. 'Once you see you're in a bear market, you have to get more creative
and sophisticated,' says Fleming's Mr Flynn.
This means that, rather than looking for markets where rates are falling
(which causes bond yields to fall and prices to rise), fund managers need to
identify markets where interest rates are changing. With the help of
sophisticated investment tools and strategies, they can take advantage of
these changes, no matter the direction in which rates are going. This may
include structured products, for instance bonds with embedded options,
sophisticated derivatives strategies, and active yield curve management -
both on spreads between different countries' yield curves and along one
particular curve.
Some of these strategies can be quite conservative, but while they may limit
the portfolio's upside, they certainly protect its downside - which will
endear fund managers to their clients at times when the going gets tough.
'If you get it right, it won't knock the lights out of your portfolio, but
will allow you to outperform incrementally,' says Mr Flynn.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (9): Speculators
ride high - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are commodities an appropriate antidote to the malaise in bond markets?
While fixed income prices have sagged for much of this year, many
commodities - in particular base metals such as aluminium and copper - have
surged. There has not been such interest in investment circles in everything
from oil to gold since the late 1980s.
Commodity prices, a harbinger of inflation, often move in the opposite
direction to bond and equity prices. According to a growing number of
investment advisers, that qualifies them as an asset class in their own
right, deserving of a place in pension funds' portfolios.
There is an alternative view. This holds that speculative investors - in
particular hedge funds - have done much to drive commodity prices higher.
According to this argument, the resurgence in commodities has been a
self-fulfilling prophecy, creating a bubble in prices which will burst once
the speculators withdraw.
The extent of the negative correlation between commodity and long-term US
bond prices is put by JP Morgan - one of several banks to launch commodities
indices recently - at 51 per cent (based on the performance of the
components of the bank's commodities index over the past 10 years). The
negative correlation with US stock prices over the same period was 36 per
cent, Morgan says.
There are a number of caveats. First, it is easier to construct an index to
prove a historical point: the direction of prices in the future may not
follow the same pattern.
Second, many commodities analysts maintain that prices this year have
already outstripped the levels justified by the growth of underlying demand
from end users.
Metals, both precious and base, may be the clearest case. They account for
only around 10 per cent of total world production of commodities by value
(agricultural commodities make up another 43 per cent, and energy the rest).
Yet metals comprise a far larger proportion of many commodity indices, and
remain the focus of much speculative interest. Unlike agricultural products,
the balance of supply and demand is not affected by extraneous factors such
as the weather, but is driven largely by industrial demand. As a result,
much of the buying by investors is thought to have been focused on copper
and aluminium, forcing up prices.
Robin Adams of Resource Strategies, a Pennsylvania-based company, argued
that only Dollars 340 of the Dollars 600 a tonne rise in aluminium prices
this year could be attributed to a growth in fundamental demand (the metal
has since risen further). It is interest from investors (otherwise known as
speculation) that explains the other Dollars 260 a tonne.
For those who do decide that commodities justify a small corner of their
portfolios, the investment landscape of 1994 looks very different from that
which existed the last time real assets were in vogue. There is a range of
new indices against which investment performance in commodities can be
tracked and a bagload of new instruments to buy - from warrants for retail
investors to structured notes whose returns are based on commodity prices.
Besides JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust have launched commodities
indices. All three have followed Goldman Sachs, which was among the first in
the field.
These indices are very different in their character and behaviour. Some
(Goldman) include agricultural products, but most do not. A second
difference lies in the method of calculation. An index which simply tracks
the prices of commodity futures carries with it the leverage that is
inherent in futures markets.
To overcome this, the Goldman and Morgan indices use a total return
methodology. These indices are made up of three components: the change in
commodity futures prices; the extra return (or cost) involved in rolling
over futures contracts when they expire; and the return from investing
additional collateral in Treasury bonds.
Not surprisingly, these total return indices have done better in recent
years, thanks to the long bull market in bonds. Since 1979, the commodity
component has generated an average annual rise in the Morgan index of 4.84
per cent. The 'roll return' has added an additional 1.22 per cent a year,
and the collateral return 8.7 per cent more.
This highlights the underlying concern of many investors with commodities -
and the reason why many will continue to stay away. Real assets, be they
bars of gold or downtown office buildings, have underperformed paper
investments over a prolonged period, short-time price jumps notwithstanding.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (8): Dollar's plight
hits investors - Currencies / Philip Gawith discusses the problems facing
fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In fund-manager folklore, 1994 is likely to be remembered as the year of the
great bond market massacre. For many, though, attempts to get a handle on
the currency markets, and the US dollar in particular, will have been
equally chastening.
On October 25, the dollar was touching a new post-second world war low
against the yen, of Y96.40, and a two-year low against the D-Mark of
DM1.4853. Back at the start of the year, though, it had stood at Y113 and
DM1.74, with most analysts and investors expecting further appreciation, on
the back of rising growth and interest rates in the US.
If the dollar's plight has been a source of painful grief to investors, it
has also been a persuasive reminder of the importance of currencies in
assessing returns on an investment decision. It is a trite observation that
the performance of an investment in an underlying asset, such as a stock or
a bond, can be either totally negated, or significantly augmented, by the
behaviour of the currency in which the investment is made.
This fact gives rise to the need to hedge exposure to currency risk. Or, for
braver spirits, to take the investment process a stage further by engaging
in currency overlay strategies. This allows the investor to create a
currency exposure which may be completely at odds with the underlying asset
exposure.
As an example, Philip Saunders, director of Guinness Flight, notes that in
their global fixed income fund, they have a 65 per cent European bond
weighting, but the currency exposure is about 50 per cent dollar, with a
further 15 per cent in the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, the
Singaporean dollar and the Malaysian ringgit. In terms of European
currencies, the weighting is primarily towards sterling and the lira.
Mr Saunders comments: 'We have these weightings primarily because we think
European bonds are cheap and we think the dollar is cheap.' At Guinness
Flight, the currency decision is not separated from the underlying asset
decision. An integrated approach is taken, in the belief that similar
considerations come into play when composing an international bond portfolio
and taking a view on a currency.
This is by no means the universal approach. Graham Cox, group economist at
Sun Life, notes: 'As a rule we separate the currency and the country. We
hedge the currency risk partially, sometimes wholly, if we have an
expectation of significant exchange rate risk. It has to be large, and for a
fundamental economic reason.'
Explaining the same approach at Legal and General, David Shaw, head of
strategy, comments: 'The economic fundamentals that drive currencies are not
the same set that drive the bond and equity markets.' The decisions are
taken 'separately but simultaneously'.
Reflecting the visceral aversion which those people managing trust monies
have to being branded speculators, Mr Shaw stresses that they have not
reached the point of taking bets purely on a currency. 'What we do is
currency management, and it is the currency management of an underlying
asset.'
Mr Cox says they avoid anything that could be construed as 'speculation'.
But the line between hedging for fundamental reasons, and speculation, is a
fine one.
Mr Cox's own example makes the point: 'The Fed is perceived to be weak, the
Bundesbank is seen to be strong. When you get a trend like that it is
justified to have a hedge on.'
Some fund managers are less shy about actively managing currency risk. Mike
Hart manages Foreign and Colonial's investment trust, the oldest such trust
in the world, with Pounds 1.6bn under management. He says they seek to take
advantage of currency movements by manoeuvring short-term loans. 'We try to
finance borrowings in what we hope will be the cheapest currency. We do it
on a fairly short-term basis, almost week by week. We are constantly rolling
over loans.'
Avinash Persaud, foreign exchange strategist at JP Morgan in London, notes
that currency overlay had its origins in the US. There it has been quite
common - though 1994 has been conspicuously different - to find the bond and
currency markets moving in opposite directions. The former is dominated by
domestic investors, while the dollar is more at the mercy of foreign
investors.
In Europe there has been less scope for currency overlay, as moves towards
economic convergence, albeit with various hiccups, have tended to see
currencies and bonds performing in tandem.
Two areas which have traditionally attracted less hedging, or overlay,
strategies, have been equities and emerging markets. In the case of
equities, the rationale for hedging less is that they are real assets,
supported by the same economic fundamentals which would support the
currency. In the case of bonds, by contrast, lower interest rates are
supportive, but theoretically bad for the currency.
As for emerging markets, there is virtually no currency hedging, owing to
the lack of availability in many markets. But there is a further reason, as
one fund manager comments: 'In nearly all the markets, we invest at a time
when the currency is sure to appreciate. If we are not confident of that
then we are not going to invest. The main economic factors that we are
looking for before we invest in a country are likely to lead to an
appreciation in the currency over a period of time.'
Clearly between equities and bonds, mature and developing markets, and
different institutions, currency exposure will be managed in a variety of
different ways. Just how differently, however, is a tantalising question.
For while there is copious evidence available about the underlying asset
exposure of different funds, no equivalent information exists about their
currency exposure.
The working assumption often made is that they are simply unhedged but,
increasingly, that is clearly not the case.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (6): Rush to find
new opportunities - Global custody / A look at facilities in emerging
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

While there has been considerable interest in investment in Russian
securities recently, there is a small problem.
In Russia, it seems, if a broker wishes to buy shares on behalf of a client,
he has to visit the company whose shares he wants to buy.
When he returns to his office, another problem emerges: where can the
securities be kept? International investors have little confidence in the
ability of domestic institutions to safeguard securities.
'You fly in airplanes to get the securities and then you fly them out
again,' explained Robert Binney, business executive at Chase Manhattan
Bank's global securities division.
Chase is considering applying to become the first global custodian to
operate in Russia, a move which is likely to facilitate investment there
significantly.
The tale of Russia's non-existent global custody business illustrates the
extent to which investment is dependent upon the availability of information
reporting, securities safekeeping and payment systems in different markets
and instruments.
Those who doubt the extent to which international investment is dependent
upon an efficient custodial network need only look at India where, earlier
this year, frenetic foreign investment ground to a halt as local custodians
collapsed under the weight of paper.
In January, the three custodians servicing the Indian market called a halt
to their servicing of new clients and set limits on trading volumes of
existing clients as they struggled to catch up with a backlog of paper
generated by the surge of more than Dollars 1bn in 1993.
There, a largely paper-based system designed for the needs of retail
investors who buy as few as 10 or 100 shares at a time sagged under the
weight of institutional investors wanting to buy in lots of 100,000 shares
per bargain.
The Indian government has introduced the 'jumbo' share certificate to meet
the needs of professionals, but the system is still creaking. John Lee,
partner at Lee Schwartz Associates (LSA), consultants specialising in
custody arrangements, says that his figures show that as of the third
quarter of 1994, three out of four of all trades in India failed to settle
on time.
'Any custodian or fund manager with any sense of fiduciary duty towards his
clients should tell them not to invest in India right now,' he said.
Without a doubt, fund managers say, the availability of efficient, safe,
cost-effective custody services are essential to the ability to conduct
foreign investment. Custodians have been well aware of this need and are
rushing to find new markets where investors have yet to make their mark.
'Overseas investment is a growth business,' Mr Binney said. There will be
more, not less business for global custodians. We are going to see further
geographic expansion in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
Africa as well as in places like Vietnam where US firms have been forbidden
to invest,' he predicted.
Broadly speaking, the custody business entails not only the traditional
'master trust' function of securities safekeeping, but also fund valuation
and performance measurement, foreign exchange dealing, cash management,
derivatives safekeeping and valuation, and, perhaps most significantly,
stock lending. It is this last core service which is proving the most
lucrative to custodians, particularly when the securities are loaned across
international borders. And in emerging markets where settlement delays are
most likely to arise, the demand for loaned securities is greatest.
This makes it likely that even though volumes in some emerging markets are
low relative to those in developed countries, the potential profits are
great.
'This business is really all about global asset servicing,' said Michael
Grass, head of Barclays' custody services in Europe and Africa. As investors
become more sophisticated, they are likely to make greater demands on their
custodians to deliver information and other services more quickly and
cheaply, he said.
Barclays, which has a significant presence in the UK market, is capitalising
on its presence in Africa, an emerging market where few other global banks
have any significant market share.
Consultants note that in many emerging markets, there are only one or two
principal providers of custody services and any investor who is not normally
a client of that custodial bank must enter into some sort of sub-custodial
arrangement. For instance, the Latin American market is dominated by
Citibank and by Bank of Boston while custodial services for Pacific Rim
markets are dominated by Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
Clients who are unhappy with the services of a monopoly provider have few
options to switch.
Meanwhile, Barclays' Mr Grass predicts, the requirement for investment in
information technology by custodians in each market is so great that instead
of competing with each other head-on, custodians are likely to form
alliances. 'They will say 'we'll provide one service in this country and you
provide another service and we will face the market together',' Mr Grass
said. Thus, institutional investors entering new markets are unlikely to
find that fierce competition will allow them to achieve services at
razor-thin margins as it has in the US and, increasingly, in the UK.
Another problem, custodians say, is that there is a very wide range of legal
arrangements between custodians and sub-custodians and between clients and
sub-custodians and there is a good deal of legal ambiguity about the
obligations of each.
Even worse, there are significant variations in the service that
sub-custodians provide for different clients, according to Richard Schwartz
of Lee Schwartz Associates. LSA, together with a US-based consultancy, GSCS,
produces performance indices for custodial and sub-custodial services in
important markets. Mr Schwartz notes that there are several factors which
could account for disparate performances among disparate client accounts,
including the ability of each client's counterparties to complete their own
paperwork on time.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Signs of a
growing acceptance - Derivatives / A younger generation is proving less
conservative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Incredulity can sometimes be the reaction when life insurance executives or
pension fund managers are asked about their use of derivatives - instruments
such as swaps, futures and options whose value is 'derived' from more
conventional financial assets.
'They are not real assets are they?' is how the chief executive of one of
the UK's leading life insurance companies puts it. Institutional fund
managers have been slower to accept the potential uses of derivative
instruments than the treasurers of large international companies, most of
whom actively use swaps and options to manage their exposure.
Fund managers have been inhibited in their use of derivatives for a number
of reasons:
Pension fund trustees can sometimes restrict the use of derivatives,
limiting managers in their use of options.
'They tend to take the view that they are happy to use futures for asset
allocation and options for hedging purposes - often they are keener to buy
rather than sell options,' says Trevor Robinson, former director of
derivatives at Fidelity International.
Fund managers can be put off the illiquidity in certain derivative
instruments. The majority prefer to build up their portfolios through
picking the shares of companies which they know rather than buying
index-based instruments which reflect the market as a whole.
In addition, most tend to measure their performance in relative rather than
absolute terms, being more worried about their performance relative to that
of rivals rather than the achievement of any absolute return. This adherence
to benchmarks has sometimes discouraged innovation.
Bad publicity linked to the corporate losses through the use of derivatives
this year has been one of the factors leading to a low take-up by retail
customers of derivative-linked funds. Fidelity International decided in
September to withdraw its futures and options funds from the market, for
example. Although a number of building societies and life companies have
successfully launched guaranteed funds, which use options as a principal
plank of their portfolio, fewer fund managers have launched pure derivatives
products.
Despite these factors there are signs that UK fund managers are gradually
overcoming instinctive caution and traditional conservatism about the use of
derivatives. Partially this reflects cultural factors, as a younger
generation of fund managers comes to prominence.
At the same time the industry's regulatory framework has been modified in a
number of ways, easing restrictions on the use of derivatives. The European
Union's third life directive was implemented in the UK earlier this summer,
radically redrawing the regulatory framework under which life insurance
companies operate.
Under the earlier regime rules governing valuation and measuring solvency
were highly restrictive and fund managers were virtually prohibited from
holding derivatives in unit-linked funds. The change has followed an
overhaul of rulers in the unit trust area in 1991 - which paved the way for
both futures and options and geared futures and options funds, as well as
allowing some limited use of derivatives (mainly for hedging purposes) in
standard securities funds. At the same time, the Inland Revenue clarified
its treatment of derivatives transactions by pension fund managers in 1992.
Two surveys published earlier this year indicated the scope for increased
activity. Buchanan Partners, the London-based quantitative investment
management firm, conducted a survey of 166 pension funds in January.
Buchanan found 57 per cent of the overall survey used some form of
derivatives, with funds in the range between Dollars 251m and Dollars 500m
more likely to use derivatives than any other smaller or larger group. One
third of derivatives users used performance as a reason or their use. A
similar portion used derivatives to reduce risk or volatility. About half
used derivatives to protect their investment portfolios, while four fifths
of users deployed derivatives to tactically allocate assets.
Many in the industry expect this use to grow, partially because derivatives
allow managers to allocate assets very cheaply. A fund manager wanting to
switch a part of his investment from UK to US equities would typically sell
UK equities and then over a period of time buy US stocks. Using derivatives
to conduct the same strategy fund managers would sell the futures contract
in the UK and buy the futures contract in the US, saving on transaction
costs.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, in a survey published in May this
year, discovered that half of a sample of 50 UK life companies used
derivatives for either portfolio management or product design. The larger
life offices, in particular, have long used derivatives for hedging and
asset allocation purposes and, more recently, to match FT-SE-linked
products.
Life companies also made some use of equity options and futures, with 40 per
cent of the companies in the survey - mainly with-profits offices and
mutuals - currently using equity options. 'This probably reflects the use of
call options to pre-invest cash flows and the need for such offices to
protect their equity portfolios against sharp falls in value,' said the
report.
Rupert Yardley, the author of a report, expects life companies to increase
their use of derivatives. Following regulatory changes in the summer four
out of every five companies said they intend to use the instruments in the
future.
A large majority of the companies believed there was a significant
opportunity to design new products and derivatives could be the key to
offering products with guarantees.
Competitive pressures within the life industry, including the wider
development of unit-linked products, could also act as a spur to push fund
managers to use derivatives.
Mr Robinson also expects the use of derivatives to increase, in spite of
Fidelity's recent decision. Fund managers are also likely to make more use
of options, either to hedge their exposures or to develop specific products.
He says fund managers should build up their positions slowly and advises
them to 'remember that they do not need to commit the entire fund to using
derivatives.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Latin America
leads the way - Emerging markets / Analysis of the fall and the recovery
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A classic case of volatility has marked the performance of the world's
emerging markets during 1994, after a period of phenomenal, if not reckless,
growth during 1993.
The story of the markets so far this year has, more than ever, been
intertwined with the movement of US interest rates. In common with financial
markets everywhere, they suffered a sell-off in February as the US Federal
Reserve took the investment community by surprise by lifting interest rates.
However, the recovery during the third quarter has been almost as fast as
the fall in the first quarter with many of the markets now at or, in some
cases, even above levels at the start of the year.
According to the International Finance Corporation's index of emerging
market indices, the revival has been led by Latin America, while Europe's
emerging markets - Poland and Turkey in particular - have dragged their feet
following explosive growth in 1993.
Turkey's case history stands as an example of the risks attached to
investment in these markets. After a rise of more than 200 per cent in
dollar terms during 1993 the country's financial markets came under a wave
of selling as its foreign debt rating was downgraded in mid-January and the
Turkish lira collapsed against the dollar. This was soon accompanied by a
rise in inflation - into triple digit figures for the first time in 14 years
 -hitting an annual rate of 117 per cent in May. The market made a partial
recovery during the summer, as the government introduced an austerity
package, but at the end of the third quarter the market was still down 45
per cent in dollar terms on the year to date, according to IFC data.
The role of US institutional investors has been crucial this year in
determining the direction of emerging markets. According to NatWest Markets
in London US funds have the pivotal role in terms of international financial
flows, with US pension funds estimated to have assets in the region of
Dollars 3,500bn while mutual fund assets stand at around Dollars 2,000bn.
During 1993 US funds invested overseas generally and in emerging markets in
particular at an unprecedented rate: NatWest estimates that net new cash
sent abroad from the US doubled in 1993 - to some Dollars 270bn - but was
drastically cut back in the first few months of this year.
Mark Mobius, of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, which has some Dollars 7bn
invested in this area, suggests that the prospects for the markets over the
next six months are generally good but have become 'more complex and
difficult to ascertain. While a number of markets have moved up
substantially and have recovered from the decline in the early part of the
year, many are overpriced. This, added to a great number of new issues
coming into the market at relatively high prices, could create problems of
excess liquidity in some of the markets'.
John Chew, of GT Management Asia based in Hong Kong, makes a distinction
between dollar block and non-dollar block emerging economies. Given the
unsettled state at the long end of US bonds, and the likelihood of further
rate rises there, he is negative on those countries closely tied to the US
dollar, which includes most of south-east Asia and much of Latin America. By
contrast, he is positive on, for instance, India, Pakistan, Korea and
Brazil.
He thinks Brazil - which is among the best performing of the world's
emerging markets so far this year - has a lot further to run following the
election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso as president in October, although, in
common with other analysts, he expects a sell-off during this quarter as
profits are taken and as negotiations on the budget get under way.
Latin America has certainly emerged as the favoured region for fund managers
in 1994. Barings Securities, which also compiles an index of emerging
markets, has the regional component up 20 per cent in dollar terms over the
year to date.
NatWest Markets estimates that 'the proportion of US funds heading into the
region rose to 77 per cent in the second quarter from 14.5 per cent in the
first three months of the year. A number of large Brady bond deals will
account for part of this abnormally large percentage, but the sheer scale of
the flows gives an indication of US investors' continued commitment to the
region'.
LatInvest, the Latin American securities house, notes that this year Latin
America has been perceived as a region to be a better hedge against rising
US interest rates than south-east Asia, partly based on the argument of its
greater dependence upon rising commodity prices.
However, they add, this has not been the only reason for the strong
performances seen in Peru and Chile, as well as Brazil, this year. 'The
markets are reflecting the benefits accruing to these countries of a
fundamental restructuring of the economy,' says LatInvest.
Of Peru, which has a market capitalisation of just Dollars 5bn compared to
Mexico's Dollars 200bn and Brazil's Dollars 100bn, James Capel's emerging
markets team, concurs, believing that the economy shows good growth
prospects helped by a revival in the mining sector which accounts for some 5
per cent of GDP.
Nevertheless, in common with Argentina, elections next year are likely to
act as a significant drag on performance in the short term.
Although the Asian region as a whole has been a laggard this year in terms
of performance, the third quarter saw a recovery from the low levels
experienced earlier in the year. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are favoured
among fund managers, based on economic strength and a more stable political
framework.
Of the three, India - with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 173bn -
has confirmed the promise for strong growth expressed by some fund managers
at the start of the year. This is illustrated by a 25 per cent gain in the
local index. Some analysts believe the index, currently at 4,300, could hit
5,000 by the year-end driven by improved company results and a good monsoon.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): Statistical
jungle needs standards - Benchmarks and performance measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid expansion of global investment management, covering a wide variety
of geographical markets, has highlighted the need to standardise performance
measurement.
In the past, performance measurement has too often been a statistical jungle
in which every management firm has claimed to have outperformed against some
sort of index or other benchmark over some period or other. Allegedly
'typical' portfolios have been presented as indicative of actual client
experience.
Industry-wide historical performance figures have been visibly flattered by
so-called 'survivor bias' as the records of poorly-performing discontinued
funds have been dropped from the databanks.
In the extreme cases, longer-term performance histories have been cobbled
together out of claimed records of different funds, often managed by
particular teams which may even have moved between different firms. These
stitched-together records are apparently known by measurement buffs as
'Frankenstein' figures.
Attempts are now being made at a clean-up. Last year, in the US, the
Association for Investment Management and Research published its performance
presentation standards. This move followed closely on the introduction of a
voluntary pension fund investment performance measurement code in the UK.
Now the European Analysts' Federation (Effas) has decided to set up a
permanent commission on performance measurement, headed by Dugald Eadie,
until recently the chairman of the World Markets Company (WM), one of the
two main performance measurement specialists based in the UK.
Effas felt that there was a need for a European initiative in this area. By
building on the work of the AIMR and the promoters of the UK code it might
be practical to develop global standards, without too much wasteful
duplication.
Mr Eadie is hoping to propose a working programme by early next year and,
perhaps ambitiously, to develop a set of global standards by the end of
1996. It could take much longer, because developing a global code will
require a struggle with basic cultural differences.
In the US, the problem has been seen as largely an ethical one, in that
portfolio management firms - typically quite small - operating in a
competitive environment will be tempted to manipulate performance data in
their commercial favour.
Hence the emphasis on presentation, because the provision of performance
data to consultants and prospective clients is a crucial element in the
marketing activities of US money management firms.
In other countries, however, competitive bidding for mandates is often less
of an issue, but reporting to existing clients and controlling risks may be
more so. On the technical side, questions about the treatment of income,
taxation and currencies are also bound to loom quite large.
According to Mr Eadie, who is moving his own job from measurement at WM to a
marketing responsibility at the London fund managers Henderson
Administration, measurement standards are driven by the marketing process in
each country. 'The issue hasn't even arisen in Japan because there is no
competitive market for fund management there,' he says.
In the global arena the development of relevant securities market indices is
particularly important for performance measurement. Indices are required as
benchmarks against which managers can compare their achievements. However,
the global markets represent a constantly moving target.
For example, the growth of the emerging markets has prompted the committee
which controls the FT-Actuaries World Index to expand the 24-country index
series to include Brazil and Thailand. But this introduction has been
delayed for a month until the beginning of November because of the
difficulties faced by managers running global index funds in making their
initial investments in Brazil.
Similar difficulties can arise in bonds. Salomon Bros and JP Morgan, which
both produce widely-followed World Government Bond Indices, upset certain
fund managers two years ago when they introduced Italian bonds to their
indices.
Not all investors considered that Italian government paper was of true
investment quality, a doubt which was mollified by the 1993 bond bull market
but which has recently once again resurfaced as Italian bond yields have
headed back towards 12 per cent.
The problem of over-dominant indices is an increasing source of concern to
fund managers. The indices were designed to measure portfolios, but too
often it now works the other way around, with the managers slavishly chained
to the indices.
The global equity indices do, however, offer flexibility, being constructed
on a building block basis, so that different subsidiary indices can be
easily extracted. The Morgan Stanley Capital International series is the
longest-established and is especially widely followed in the US.
The capitalisation weights in these indices cause constant problems,
however, especially in the case of Japan, which at one stage in the late
1980s represented more than 40 per cent of the FT-A World Index and still
accounts for some 30 per cent. Thus the World ex US Index has an exposure of
45 per cent to Japan, representing a dangerous concentration of risk.
Some global funds have dabbled with GDP weights, in an attempt to reflect
basic economic realities rather than financial valuations, which can be
distorted.
Another option is to use equal weights, although this may be difficult in
practice to the smallest markets where liquidity is restricted and dealing
is difficult.
Still another approach, seen particularly in the UK among pension funds, is
to adopt a peer group benchmark. According to WM, the overseas equity
portfolios of UK pension funds currently have a 23 per cent weighting in
Japan, much lighter than the World ex UK capitalisation weighting of 33 per
cent.
In practice most UK fund managers assess their risks against the performance
of other similar funds rather than against the World Index. According to WM,
the overseas equity portfolios of UK pension funds outperformed the FT-A
World Index by 14 per cent in 1993 (but with Japan relatively firm they will
have substantially underperformed it so far in 1994).
Was this 14 per cent excess return a good performance, or did it reflect
extravagant risk-taking? This is the kind of tricky conceptual challenge
that global performance measurement has to help answer.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (1): Flexibility the
rule in volatile markets / Analysis of the testing conditions faced by
investors after the interest rate rise in February imposed by the US Federal
Reserve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY, Investment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last winter it seemed that everybody was setting up hedge funds. In rising
markets the willingness to leverage aggressive positions through the future
markets can pay off spectacularly. But, since February, conditions have been
much more testing, and quite a few hedge funds have come to grief.
The deterioration of investment conditions in 1994 might seem odd given that
the global economy has improved considerably - at any rate, outside Japan.
But strong economic growth - which globally has probably reached 3 1/2 per
cent, and may go higher next year - generates a rising interest rate trend
which is an old enemy of the securities markets.
In fact, most of the weakness has been in the supposedly less volatile bond
markets. At the extreme, the US Treasury benchmark 30-year long bond has
lost about 20 per cent of its value this year as the yield has jumped from
6.3 to a peak of more than 8 per cent. In contrast, in equities the
FT-Actuaries World Index has actually climbed about 6 per cent when measured
in dollars, although Japanese investors see it rather differently, because
the World ex Japan index in yen has declined by 13 per cent.
Equity market movements have presented something of a mirror image of the
1993 pattern. Whereas last year the two biggest markets, the US and Japan,
which account respectively for about 33 and 28 per cent of global
capitalisation, were the most sluggish, and were shown a clean pair of heels
by many European and third world markets, in 1994 Tokyo and Wall Street have
held up comparatively well.
Where are these global investment shifts decided? According to
Technimetrics, which compiles institutional investor databases, Tokyo had
the biggest concentration of equity holdings at the end of 1993, at Dollars
1,160bn, but London moved into second place with Dollars 681bn, surpassing
New York's Dollars 657bn. Switzerland, adding together the different centres
such as Zurich and Geneva, was roughly of the same size.
Of course, these figures largely reflect domestic holdings. Rankings on the
basis of foreign equities only are different, with Tokyo and New York
dropping back, but London and Switzerland emerging as crucial players.
The year's turning point came quite early, with the quarter-point dollar
interest rate rise imposed on February 4 by the US Federal Reserve. Although
the increase was expected it triggered a spectacular crash in bond markets
worldwide. Stock markets have been struggling to avoid contagion, not always
with success.
The scale of the crash in bonds has raised serious questions about the
structure and stability of the global securities markets. At the top of the
boom last winter bonds were taking what has proved to be an excessively
optimistic view of future interest rates and inflation; in other words, they
were affected by a speculative bubble.
That the market fell is, with hindsight, not surprising; but why was there
such a sharp tumble? The common theory is that the rise in short-term
interest rates, with the threat of more to come, panicked hedge funds and
bank proprietary traders into unwinding leveraged positions, which were
being financed through short-term borrowings at 3 per cent on the scale of
possibly hundreds of billions of dollars.
For instance, Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, has
estimated that US banks may this summer and autumn have started offloading
Dollars 200bn of bonds into a weak market, to make room for a revival in
bank lending to the private sector.
A slightly different theory has been put forward by William Sterling, of
Merrill Lynch, who argues that non-Japanese investors borrowed some Dollars
120bn in Japanese yen at only 2 per cent in the second half of 1993, mainly
to finance securities market positions. The sudden shock faced by these
speculators was not the widely- anticipated rise in dollar interest rates
but the unexpected fall in the exchange rate of the dollar, which had been
forecast to be a strong currency in 1994.
Other explanations have been put forward relating to distortions within the
mortgage-backed securities markets which led to a sharp bond sell-off once
short-term rates turned. Certainly the mortgage-backed securities market has
been a great disaster area of 1994, and Kidder Peabody, one of its leading
promoters, has suffered dismemberment and sale by its parent General
Electric.
The fact that such different arguments can be advanced (and there may be
truth in all of them) shows how poorly documented the flows between global
securities markets are at present. The lifting of capital controls by many
countries over the past few years has encouraged cross-border flows but the
monitoring is poor. Now the rapid development of derivative markets is
speeding up the movements of capital and is encouraging speculation which
appears to be sometimes destabilising. But there is only patchy information
about what is going on.
However, the global strategy team at Baring Securities led by Michael Howell
has painstakingly built up the picture of global equity flows. They have
uncovered an extraordinary if erratic growth in cross-border investment,
rising from an average of about Dollars 30bn a year in the late 1980s to a
peak Dollars 188bn last year. The main influence behind this growth has been
a jump in US outflows from negligible levels until 1988 to Dollars 43bn in
1991 and Dollars 85bn last year.
A significant international diversification campaign by US pension plans is
the main explanation - although there has been rapid expansion in overseas
specialist mutual funds too. Greenwich Associates, the US pension
consultants, found in a survey of pension plan sponsors that the average
fund had doubled its exposure to overseas assets to 8 per cent in the three
years up to the end of 1993, and, moreover, that the proportion was expected
to hit 12 per cent by the end of 1996.
Emerging markets have proved a strong attraction for investors in the US and
elsewhere in the developed world. Third world economies are often growing
very strongly - at 5 to 7 per cent a year, at least twice as fast as the
developed countries.
International investors owned emerging market equities worth Dollars 200bn
at the end of last year, according to Baring Securities, amounting to about
15 per cent of their total cross-border holdings. In less favourable
conditions the flow of Dollars 61bn to emerging markets last year will not
be repeated in 1994, but the total could still approach Dollars 50bn.
Bond investors, however, are in a much less active mood. Japanese investors
have suffered such serious currency losses over the past few years that they
are refusing to recycle liquidity generated by the Japanese balance of
payments surplus into overseas bond markets, as they were much happier to do
in the late 1980s.
Bond investors in general have retreated to their lairs. For instance,
whereas foreigners bought a third of the net issuance of UK government bonds
in 1993, this year the overseas buyers have melted away.
The result has been a sharp rise in government bond yields around the world
and increasing talk of a global capital shortage, because developed country
governments are still borrowing enormously, while the flows being diverted
into the emerging markets are becoming highly significant.
For hedge funds that got these movements wrong the consequences have been
dire. For instance, the Dorje and Vaja funds run out of London by David
Weill (but based offshore) have halved in value from Dollars 1.2bn this year
and are being wound down. Last spring the group of US hedge funds run by
David Askin collapsed, victims of the debacle in mortgage-backed securities.
On the other hand, the large movements in various markets have in theory
offered considerable opportunities to those who have got it right with
focused strategies, for instance by leveraging positions in coffee or
metals, or chasing hot emerging markets such as Brazil. But it has been easy
to get things wrong, too, especially the dollar exchange rate, which has
proved an expensive trap for many a dollar bull this year. Global investment
managers have had to display enormous flexibility in adjusting to the
different market climates in 1994. But they can derive some modest
satisfaction from the fact that the politicians are starting to complain
about the power of international money, notably in imposing ever-higher
interest rates in government bond markets.
Money talks, and the global money managers are making their views known.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): Funds pour into
equities - Globalisation
</HEADLINE>

   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is any trend which has characterised the fund management industry
in the past year, it is the extent to which investors of many nations are
prepared to invest money abroad.
'There are five major pension markets in the world,' said David Salisbury,
chief executive of Schroder Capital Management International. 'They are
Japan, the US, the UK, Canada and Australia. Perhaps with the exception of
Japan, all are seeing an increase in international investment.'
Personal investors buying mutual funds have also shown great enthusiasm for
faraway markets. European investors have long been international in their
approach, but the past two or three years have seen an unprecedented wave of
buying by US investors of international specialist mutual funds, often with
an emerging markets bias.
All of these investment flows are heavily tilted in favour of equities, a
trend which is having a profound effect on the business flowing through
stock exchanges around the world.
'One of the single most important trends for the UK securities industry is
the willingness of US fund managers to invest abroad,' said Alan Yarrow,
managing director at Kleinwort Benson Securities.
According to InterSec Research Corp, a US-based investment consulting firm,
US pension funds sharply increased their international holdings to 7.4 per
cent of all assets by the end of 1993, up from 4.7 per cent the year before.
Overall, the value of US pension assets invested outside the country rose 69
per cent to Dollars 260bn by the end of 1993 and a further Dollars 22bn was
invested abroad in the first half of 1994.
The biggest beneficiaries of this trend may well be UK-based fund managers
who have been investing up to 25 per cent of the average UK balanced pension
fund portfolio in foreign equities. US fund managers have been slow to
develop the expertise to meet the newfound interest of schemes based there.
According to InterSec, at the start of 1993, out of 15,000 US fund managers,
only 200 had any significant expertise in international investment.
Significantly, 80 per cent of the outflow in the first half of this year has
been into equities, a switch from the initial US diversification abroad
which led fund managers largely into bonds.
Meanwhile, the flow of foreign money into the London markets, the worldwide
centre for international share trading, is having a profound effect on the
way intermediaries do business. Earlier this year, the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, issued a discussion
paper asking whether there is a need for a greater level of pre- and
post-trade transparency. In particular, the SIB asked whether rules allowing
delays in publication of large blocks of shares were fair to investors. In
the US, rules require immediate post-trade transparency and American
investors have become accustomed to this.
US securities firms are said to have been among the prime supporters for the
discussion document, and even the London firms which have traditionally
dominated the market say that changes are inevitable.
'We have US clients who tell us they do not want us to book their trade in
London when they are buying French shares. They want it booked in Paris so
they can see that we are not doing them in.'
Also, the penchant of US investors to move large blocks of shares in a
single deal has been one of the forces spurring the European bourses to
reform their own systems to make block trading easier and cheaper. London
has dominated international share trading - data from Lee Schwartz
Associates, a consulting firm, show that about a quarter of all the world's
equity trades are booked in London, compared with about 20 per cent in New
York - partly because of the facility for block trading on the London Stock
Exchange's SEAQ International system.
Meanwhile, the explosion in cross-border investment has opened opportunities
for fund managers. In particular, a handful of UK fund managers, notably a
few Scottish houses, have made great strides in selling their international
investment expertise in the US.
'I heard a story about a Scottish fund manager who made a presentation to a
US pension fund while wearing a kilt,' recalled one pension consultant. 'He
got the mandate.' Several managers such as Edinburgh-based Ivory and Sime,
Baillie Gifford and Martin Currie all report significant US pensions
business.
However, InterSec notes, US fund managers are closing the expertise gap
quickly.
'Because of information technology, it is no longer necessary for a US-based
fund manager to have offices all over the world,' said Alexe Nowakowski,
associate consultant at InterSec.
The growing demand for an international fund management capacity has posed
an interesting question for fund managers: is it better to make worldwide
investment choices from a central office in London, or should one develop a
network of research offices in key markets?
At PDFM, the London fund management arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, the
centrist view is taken. 'We've made a very strong case for the one-office
route,' an official explained. 'We believe there is merit in having a single
culture, a single philosophy.' Multiple centres can lead to conflicts
between fund managers about the merits of specific markets or stocks, he
said.
Kenneth Inglis, chairman of Fleming Investment Management, the fund
management arm of Robert Fleming Group, says his firm has a similar
philosophy. 'If you are running a balanced fund around the world, you like
to be able to take the pulse of all markets,' he said. If a manager decides
to reduce exposure in one market in favour of another, it could be difficult
if there is a local office resisting a diminution of their asset allocation.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lower ahead of quarterly
refunding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>

US Treasury prices drifted lower in light trading yesterday as Friday's
bearish jobs report and impending supply pressures unsettled market
sentiment.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 92
19/32 , yielding 8.159 per cent. The short end of the market was also
weaker, with the two-year note off  1/32 at 99 21/32 , yielding 7.046 per
cent.
Trading opened in lacklustre fashion, with many participants on the
sidelines ahead of today's first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding
round and Thursday's producer prices data. The mood of the market remained
sombre, as dealers and investors continued to mull over Friday's October
employment report.
The report, although seemingly positive at first when the growth in non-farm
payrolls came in lower than expected, subsequently proved bearish for bonds
because the data included some warning signs on inflation which analysts
said only increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise
interest rates at the meeting of its open market committee on November 15.
The expectations of another policy tightening, which pushed long yields to
new 3 1/2 -year highs last week, depressed prices further yesterday, when
bonds were also undermined by concern about the impending arrival of new
supply.
Today, the Treasury will sell Dollars 17bn in three-year notes, followed by
Dollars 12bn of two-year notes tomorrow, and analysts questioned whether
there would be sufficient demand from investors in the week before the Fed
is likely to put up interest rates.
European government bond markets were once again depressed by weaker US
Treasuries, leaving prices to drift lower in sluggish dealings.
The spectre of fresh supply further weighed on markets as traders wondered
where new bonds would be placed in the absence of investor demand.
The biggest supply burden comes in the US, where the Treasury is due to
auction Dollars 29bn in the next two days.
Germany is set to sell an estimated DM10bn of 10-year bonds today and
tomorrow; Japan is expected to auction around Y300bn of 20-year bonds today;
France is due to issue five and 10-year Ecu bonds tomorrow; the Dutch
finance ministry plans to tap the 30-year sector on Thursday; and the Bank
of England last Friday announced the sale of two Pounds 250m tranches of
conventional gilts and two Pounds 100m tranches of index-linked stock.
'Placing supply in these markets is not easy, and it's one factor keeping
them subdued,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital
Markets.
UK gilts slipped by about  1/2 point, depressed by weakness in other markets
and continued uncertainty on the UK interest rate horizon.
Interest-rate jitters were revived by the latest UK industrial production
numbers, showing a bigger than forecast 1.1 per cent rise in September.
While the market did not react sharply to the data, they did fuel talk that
the Bank of England may tighten monetary policy sooner than expected.
The December long gilt future fell by  15/32 to 100 3/4.
German bunds lost their intra-day gains to end the session about  1/4 point
lower, pressured by weaker US Treasuries and some futures sales ahead of
today's 10-year bund auction.
The December bund future on Liffe fell by 0.32 to 89.07.
In Sweden, yields jumped again on renewed worries that Sunday's referendum
on European Union membership may result in a 'no' vote after a poll showed
42 per cent of voters opposing membership, 40 per cent favouring it and 17
per cent undecided.
The 11-year benchmark bond yield rose 22 basis points to 11.67 per cent  -
off its intra-day peak of 11.80 per cent - and the 10-year spread over bunds
widened to around 401 basis points from 363 basis points on Friday.
In this environment, the auction of five and 11-year bonds was sluggish,
enabling the government to sell only SKr5.2bn of the SKr7.5bn offered.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: UK utility loan terms under
fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Terms on a forthcoming syndicated loan for East Midlands Electricity, the UK
power utility, is attracting fierce criticism from syndicate managers.
They say pricing of 15 basis points over Libor on the Pounds 350m loan,
which is being arranged by Chemical Bank, is too low and for this reason it
is not yet finalised after three weeks.
'This may be a deal too far,' said one member of a syndicated loans team at
an investment bank in London.
Supply of new loans has outstripped demand this year, driving down pricing
as banks, hungry for assets, have turned aggressively to the syndicated
loans market while borrowers remain wary of large debts.
The interest rate on a syndicated loan is usually set at a margin over
Libor, the benchmark interest rate for the market. Over the past year, the
spread on a syndicated loan to a typical European corporate borrower, with a
Single A credit rating, has dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20
to 22 basis points and may fall still further.
However, although Chemical Bank would not comment on a deal still in
syndication, it is believed in the market that a Pounds 500m loan for
National Power being arranged by Chemical at a margin of 17 basis points has
been oversubscribed.
One syndicate manager said: 'Although East Midlands is a good UK name, 15
basis points over does not reward you sufficiently. Chemical is pushing the
market further than it wants to go. But although we have reached the bottom,
I don't think prices will start to go up.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Bonds: World Bank launches long-awaited Y200bn
global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank yesterday launched its long-awaited global yen deal, a Y200bn
issue of 10-year bonds with an offer spread of 9 to 11 basis points over
Japanese government bonds.
However, syndicate managers said the offering, due to be priced today, was
destined almost entirely for Japanese investors and would excite little US
and European interest.
Merrill Lynch, Nikko Europe and Nomura International are lead managing the
issue, the World Bank's first global yen offering since June 1993.
'Nobody outside Japan is currently buying yen-denominated issues,' said one
syndicate manager. 'The distribution of this bond will be almost entirely
into Japan.'
However, a source close to the deal reported firm European demand, in
particular from UK investment funds, and central banks, with many investors
switching out of existing global yen bonds, such as the World Bank 5 1/4 per
cent 2002 and World Bank 4 1/2 per cent 2003.
'This bond offers a pick-up in yield of 2 to 4 basis points, which is
attractive to investors,' he said.
He added: 'This deal is attracting more European interest than standard
euroyen issues have done this year.' He expects only about 60 per cent of
the bonds to be sold to Japanese investors.
In the dollar sector, Bank South Australia launched a Dollars 250m issue of
five-year floating-rate notes offering 35 basis points over three-month
Libor.
JP Morgan, the lead manager, said there is continuing demand for
floating-rate dollar assets, especially in the higher yielding sectors such
as the Australian dollar market.
The lead reported broad support for the offering from institutional and
retail investors in Asia and Europe, especially the UK.
At the shorter end of the dollar sector, the Council of Europe Resettlement
Fund launched a Dollars 150m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 14
basis points over US Treasuries.
The Fund has an annual short-term borrowing requirement of approximately
Ecu1.1bn and an annual long-term funding programme - which is used for loans
to member countries - for this year of about Ecu650m, most of which is
already completed, a Fund official said. In 1993, the long-term borrowing
requirement was Ecu1.1bn.
The Fund tapped the two-year area of the sterling sector in October. It last
came to the dollar market in May with a similar two-year deal.
Lead manager BZW reported firm demand for the bonds from European retail and
institutional investors.
Syndicate managers said that the offering was fairly priced and offered good
value.
One syndicate manager said: 'The two-year dollar sector has been hit hard by
the speculation about a rise in US interest rates and is therefore now
unlikely to fall much further.'
Also in the two-year dollar sector, Union Bank of Switzerland launched a
Dollars 150m offering of bonds priced to yield 5 basis points over US
government bonds.

European benchmark

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Komercn Banka, the second biggest bank in the Czech Republic in asset terms,
is to raise Dollars 65m in the international syndicated loan market at a
margin of 65 basis points over Libor, the narrowest spread yet for an
eastern European borrower.
Last month another Czech bank, Ceskoslovenska Obchodn Banka (CSOB), the
Czech and Slovak trade bank, set a new benchmark for such borrowers by
raising Dollars 75m in a five-year loan at 70bp over Libor. CSOB had set the
issue at Dollars 50m but strong demand pushed subscriptions to Dollars 120m
before being scaled back.
Sumitomo Bank, arranger and agent for Komercn Banka, said fees for the
five-year loan would range from 25bp to 30bp. Sumitomo also arranged the
CSOB loan. Full details of the new issue will be announced in London this
morning.
The terms of the loan are likely to set another benchmark for Czech
borrowers. It will be closely watched by other banks and corporates seeking
to raise funds abroad, according to bankers in Prague.
Several issues are being considered and the reaction to such a narrow spread
for the Komercn Banka loan among prospective lenders will determine if
margins fall further.
Komercn Banka said it would use the funds raised by the loan to provide
export financing to customers.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minolta returns to black on
sales increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cost-cutting measures and increased sales helped Minolta, the Japanese maker
of cameras and office machinery, return to the black in the first half of
the year.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
were Y542m (Dollars 5.5m), a turnround from the Y1.1bn loss a year ago. Net
profit was Y386m, compared with a net loss of Y1.5bn previously.
The improvement came on the back of a 4 per cent rise in sales to Y92.7bn,
from Y89.2bn, which was achieved in spite of sluggish capital spending in
Japan and the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar.
However, Minolta was unable to make a profit at the operating level,
although it trimmed operating losses to Y1bn from a previous Y2.3bn. The
company passed its interim dividend and does not expect to pay a dividend at
the year-end.
Minolta said that cost-cutting measures, such as the increased
standardisation of parts and greater overseas procurement, had helped it
improve results in the first half.
The company, which exports 75 per cent of its products, expects to increase
procurement of parts from lower cost overseas markets to 12 per cent in
value terms in the current year, compared with 4 per cent last year.
In its office machinery division, the inclusion of sales of assets related
to its planetarium business, which has been sold to a subsidiary, helped
boost revenues by 6 per cent.
Minolta expects sales of its new models to gather pace in the second half,
particularly in the US where demand has been strong. As a result, the
company has revised upwards its full-year sales forecast to Y191bn compared
with an earlier prediction of Y189bn, although its forecasts for recurring
profits and net profits are unchanged at Y1bn and Y600m, respectively.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: UAC Nigeria begins a new chapter
 -Unilever is severing all ties with the company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's private sector and UAC, its flagship company, have reached a
watershed with the decision by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products
group, to end its 70-year involvement in the company, a relationship which
came to symbolise stable, long-term investment in Nigeria
The offer to buy Unilever's remaining shares in UAC Nigeria is likely to be
fully subscribed by local investors when it closes later this month, brokers
in Lagos believe.
Nigerians are apparently eager to invest in the company, the country's
largest manufacturing, packaging and distribution conglomerate with the most
prized property portfolio in Lagos, in spite of its chequered history and
the uncertainties of life without Unilever.
UAC Nigeria's origins pre-date the formation of the country. Its forebear,
the Royal Niger Company, was the region's trading pioneer in the late 19th
century. It carved out a near monopoly of trading palm oil and other local
raw materials in exchange for European goods. As the operation grew, Lord
Leverhulme, the founder of the British side of Unilever, was so keen to
acquire it that he paid cash for the company without seeing any accounts.
The business became the largest part of Unilever's United Africa Company,
and after independence in 1960 UAC Nigeria dominated the private sector and
retained powerful influence in government circles. Through one civil war,
more than half a dozen military coups, and the boom-and-bust cycles of the
dominant oil industry, UAC Nigeria has epitomised stability and sound
investment.
This year's disinvestment also closes a long chapter in Unilever's history.
At its peak in 1975, UAC International, the parent of UAC Nigeria and a
mixture of other businesses extending from Africa to the UK, contributed
about one-third of Unilever's group profits. That has shrunk to about 0.5
per cent as Unilever has focused on its core consumer products.
The roots of the disinvestment are two fold - political and corporate - and
stretch back two decades. Under pressure from the Lagos government to keep
UAC Nigeria in Nigerian hands, Unilever had cut its stake to 40 per cent in
the 1970s with the rest held by Nigerian private and institutional
investors.
About three years ago, UAC Nigeria's management suggested to Unilever that
they should go their separate ways. Finally, last December, Unilever agreed
to sever all links by transferring some assets from UAC Nigeria to a new
local Unilever holding company, and to sell its remaining 20 per cent in the
company, valued at around Dollars 46m at the official exchange rate.
Unilever also decided in the 1980s to concentrate worldwide on four
businesses: personal products, food and drink, detergents and specialty
chemicals.
Of UAC Nigeria's 11 divisions, only toiletries fits the current Unilever
profile. Unilever is transfering that and the proceeds from the share sale
to Unilever Nigeria, its new 100 per cent owned holding company. In
addition, UAC Nigeria's Caterpillar distributor will become a joint venture
with Unilever called Tractor and Equipment.
Unilever and Mr Bassey Ndiokho, UAC's chairman, stress that the divestment
decision was mutually agreed and conceived before trading conditions became
more difficult last year.
Mr Ndiokho admits, however, that excessive bureaucracy and the government's
foreign exchange controls have made it difficult for legitimate businesses
to import necessary materials and equipment and to export profitably.
The effects of the military regime's fiscal indiscipline and the political
instability of the past 12 months have been felt throughout the economy. In
1993 at least six working weeks were lost to political disturbances, while
inflation approaching 100 per cent a year and a sharp devaluation of the
naira eroded domestic demand and put pressure on profits.
After-tax profits last year were N432.3m (Dollars 19.65m), an increase in
naira terms of 29 per cent from 1992 but below the rates of inflation and
devaluation.
The situation is worsening. This year's first-half profits were 17 per cent
below forecast, although higher than a year earlier, and the second half
began badly with the political strikes which brought the economy near to a
standstill in July and August. The naira has been devalued on the parallel
market by 40 per cent in the last six weeks.
Nevertheless, demand among Nigerian investors for the UAC offer is high. The
two issuing houses in Lagos, First City Merchant Bank and Investment Banking
Trust Company, have placed all the shares with sub-underwriters who expect
to have sold nearly all the stock when the offer closes.
Mr Ndiokho, who took over as UAC chairman last year when Mr Ernest Shonekan
became head of the interim national government, is confident that the
Nigerian directors can recapitalise, expand and run the business
successfully after Unilever divests.
Initially, most investments will be in property development but in the long
term UAC wants to attract foreign technical expertise in timber, textiles
and packaging. The company is also looking at expansion in seed production,
wood exports and the oil services industry.
The International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank, is to produce
a strategic study and recommend international partners in new ventures.
Unilever says it will maintain its commitment to Nigeria through its new
holding company and a 40 per cent stake in Lever Brothers Nigeria, which
makes detergents, margarines and personal products.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Raymond Chow, one of the founders of the Hong Kong film industry, will
take part of his movie empire public this week when he offers 125m shares in
Golden Harvest Entertainment (Holdings).
The stock is priced at HKDollars 1.93 a share, which gives a prospective
price/earnings ratio of 10.39 times, on a fully diluted basis. The issue
will raise HKDollars 241.25m (USDollars 31.3m) gross and HKDollars 225m
after expenses. The issue is managed by Wardley Corporate Finance and
PruAsia DBS.
In the year to the end of June the company had profits after tax of
HKDollars 69.2m, on turnover of HKDollars 361.7m. Directors forecast profits
of at least HKDollars 90m in the current year.
Golden Harvest Entertainment will own Mr Chow's cinemas, distribution
businesses and film processing business. His film production business, his
biggest asset, has been kept private.
The company is one of the main distributors of Chinese-and English-language
films in Hong Kong, with a 27 per cent and 38 per cent market share,
respectively. The company is also an important distributor of films in
Singapore and Malaysia, and in Thailand it operates two multiplex cinemas.
The company said HKDollars 70m of the capital raised would be used to repay
bank debt. The remainder would be used to expand its cinemas in Hong Kong
and south-east Asia.

The sale, which takes effect in April and is subject to government approval,
will take Highlands' stake in the project to almost 72 per cent. The
Japanese OMRD consortium owns the remainder.
News of the deal comes just days after Mr Norm Fussell, Highlands chairman,
said that the group was increasingly confident that a mine could be
devel-oped at Nena within four years, and announced that exploration
expenditure was being stepped up.

<TEXT>
Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility, has
announced pre-tax profits for the year ending August 31 1994 of MDollars
1.98bn (USDollars 772m), a 7 per cent rise on the previous year's figure,
writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. About 25 per cent of Tenaga Nasional
was floated in 1990 and the group now ranks as the biggest company on the
Kuala Lumpur stock market. Group turnover for the year rose 12 per cent to
MDollars 5.63bn.
Tenaga said the main reason for the rise in earnings had been the continuing
strong growth in electricity demand.
Malaysia's economy is forecast to expand by 8.5 per cent this year, the
seventh consecutive year in which growth has exceeded 8 per cent.
Electricity sales rose by 14 per cent in the year to August and are forecast
to grow by 12.7 per cent in 1995.
A final dividend of Malaysian 7 cents was approved, making 12 cents for the
year.
As part of a long term plan to increase Malaysia's power output, the
government has so far granted licences to five independent power producers
(IPPs) on a build, operate, transfer basis. The IPPs are expected to account
for about 40 per cent of total power generation by 1998.

recorded a 1994 net first-half profit of FFr254m (Dollars 48.58m) on
turnover which rose 6.5 per cent to FFr7.5bn, the company said, Reuter
reports from Paris.
It added that it expected net profit for the full year to exceed 1993's
FFr585m.
The company described the first-half result as 'promising'.
Seita added that first-half sales could not be compared with those of 1993
because it was the first time it had given six-month consolidated figures.
But it estimated that sales growth for the year will be higher than 6.5 per
cent.
Operating profit for the first half of 1994 totalled FFr467.7m, which
amounted to 87 per cent of the operating profit for all of 1993.
The government announced last month that it planned to privatise Seita,
which owns all France's cigarette factories and controls the distribution of
all other brands, but did not say when the sale would take place. Financial
analysts have valued the company at between FFr7bn and FFr8bn.

Email, the Australian white goods and building products company, yesterday
announced a 35.8 per cent increase in interim profits, for the six months to
end-September, to ADollars 45.5m (USDollars 34m).
The advance was scored on sales up by 26.2 per cent at ADollars 1.05bn.
Email said that the figures had benefited from an additional three months of
trading for the Dorf, Lockwood, Whitco and formed metal businesses which it
acquired in July 1993, and six months trading under full ownership of Email
Westinghouse.
However, at the earnings per share level, the increase was only slightly
smaller, with the fully-diluted figure rising to 17.4 cents from 13.1 cents.
All four main operating groups posted higher profits and sales, although the
large appliance division bore non-recurring costs of around ADollars 7m
related to the launch of new products and the rationalisation of
refrig-eration manufacturing operations.
The company also issued a bullish forecast for the second half. It said that
demand in all areas was up on the previous year, and it was 'confident of
exceeding the 1993-94 very strong second half result, based on the
expectation that the present market conditions continue'.

China Light and Power, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Kowloon and
the New Territories of Hong Kong, yesterday reported an 18.4 per cent rise
in net profits to HKDollars 4.2bn (Dollars 543m) for theyear to September 30
from HKDollars 3.5bn the previous year, broadly in line with market
expectations.
However, operating profit slumped 24 per cent to HKDollars 3.1bn from
HKDollars 4.1bn. The group saw HKDollars 586m from non-mainstream
operations, of which at least HKDollars 186m accrued from property sales.
Taken on a per share basis, earnings rose at the same rate to HKDollars 2.11
from HKDollars 1.78. The directors are recommending a dividend payment of 37
cents, up from 35 cents in the previous year.
Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to HKDollars 15.4bn. Sales to Hong Kong have been
hit by the relocation of manufacturing companies across the border in China.
The manufacturing sector accounted for 20 per cent of CLP's revenues in
1993, down from around 35 per cent in the 1980s, and analysts expect the
contribution to diminish further.
Next year, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, CLP plans to pay out
three interim dividends of 30 cents a share each, with the final pay-out
depending on the year's results.

Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries has reported a rise in after-tax
income to R114.9m (Dollars 32.66m) for the six months to September, a 16 per
cent rise on last year's earnings of R99.2m for the same period.
Turnover at the South African company, owned by SA Breweries, rose 17 per
cent to R1.82bn from R1.58bn, but operating profit rose only 8 per cent to
R185.8m from R172.5m.
Net financing costs dropped to R10.7m from R14.9m reflecting lower
borrowings, which stood at R295.1m compared with R303m a year ago. However,
this was up on the year-end figure of R218.5m, largely as a result of higher
short-term borrowings to meet seasonal capital needs.
The company's best performing division was international arm Belron, which
continued to show good results in Europe and saw particularly rapid growth
in Australia and the US. Central African operations also performed
creditably, and the company is currently expanding its Zimbabwean operations
through a ZDollars 130m rights issue.
However, domestic sales were less robust as Glass South Africa was hurt by
the motor industry strike, which stopped sales to original equipment
manufacturers.
PG Bison, which makes boards and laminates for the furniture industry, also
had a weak first quarter, but since then the group reports that sales have
been excellent.
PGSI has also said that PG Bison will embark on R600m plant expansion to
increase capacity ahead of anticipated demand from the furniture market and
building industry.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Brierley lifts NZ media stake to
29%, ends offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brierley Investments, the New Zealand hotels and investments group,
yesterday said it had acquired a 29 per cent stake in Wilson &amp; Horton and
was therefore withdrawing its offer to buy shares in the publishing company.
The Horton family, meanwhile, which until last Friday was the controlling
shareholder in New Zealand's biggest newspaper, said it was 'shell-shocked'
by Brierley's raid, in which it bought shares at NZDollars 9.50 each.
The Horton and Wilson families have controlled the publisher since 1863. The
company owns the country's biggest daily, the Auckland-based New Zealand
Herald, provincial and weekly papers, magazines and a printing business.
In a lightning raid on Thursday Brierley gained 20 per cent from
institutions, then bought a further 5 per cent, before offering the same
terms to smaller investors. It completed its purchases yesterday.
Mr Michael Horton, the publisher's managing director, had advised
shareholders not to sell, as he was 'quite frankly appalled' by the Brierley
move. He said that a previous move by Brierley into the media business had
been a blow to the industry, reducing the number of large New Zealand
publishing groups from three to two.
Brierley controlled New Zealand Newspapers during the 1980s, but had been
forced to break it up following the 1987 market crash.
Mr Horton's son Matthew, a journalist in Australia who has been acting as
family spokesman, said Brierley was seeking two board seats.
Wilson &amp; Horton shares closed unchanged yesterday at NZDollars 9.50, while
Brierley slipped 1 cent, to NZDollars 1.27.

<TEXT>
Canadian Pacific, the transport, resource, hotels and property group,
registered a third-quarter profit due to record results from its oil and gas
subsidiary.
Group net profit was CDollars 87.6m (USDollars 64.5m), or 25 cents a share,
against a loss of CDollars 15.1m, or 5 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
flat at CDollars 1.78bn against CDollars 1.6bn.
Operating income was CDollars 279m, up 14 per cent. PanCanadian Petroleum
contributed CDollars 129m, a jump of 84 per cent. Rail operations were hit
by a long strike at the Soo Line unit in the US, which was suspended at the
end of August, though Canadian traffic was higher. CP Rail contributed
CDollars 5.5m, down from CDollars 26.5m.
Shipping, coalmining and hotels all increased their contributions.
Nine months' net profit jumped to CDollars 306.9m from CDollars 105.8m, on
revenues of CDollars 5.2bn against CDollars 4.6bn.
In the nine months, shipping expanded container operations and improved its
rates, while operating costs declined. Property was helped by higher office
occupancies, with a stronger tourist season and the lower Canadian dollar
contributing to the hotels division.
Laidlaw, the waste management group in which Canadian Pacific has an 18.8
per cent stake, contributed CDollars 6.6m against a loss of CDollars 87m.
However, losses increased to CDollars 88.7m from CDollars 53m at Unitel, the
telecommunications unit.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, said CP's fourth-quarter results should
continue the improvement.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: AlliedSignal back on a growth
tack - Chairman Larry Bossidy has set precise targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might have guessed that Mr Larry Bossidy, chairman and chief executive
of the diversified US manufacturer AlliedSignal, is an ex-General Electric
man. The gospel of GE is ever-increasing productivity: Mr Bossidy has a
productivity target of 6 per cent a year stretching into infinity. So far at
least, he looks on target.
When Mr Bossidy arrived at AlliedSignal in 1991, his first task was to
confront a business which, in some parts, was shrinking alarmingly. A large
part of the company is in aerospace, and a large part of that business is in
defence. In this year's third quarter, however, the aerospace division
increased its sales for the first time in more than three years. For Mr
Bossidy, this is an important symbol of a return to growth for the company
overall.
Granted, the growth was tiny - under 1 per cent - and was wholly due to
acquisitions. Granted, too, Mr Bossidy expects the military side - about 28
per cent of the division's sales - to continue shrinking. Civil aerospace,
too, is a tough business these days: but here at least, he is confident that
things can only get better.
'Worldwide deliveries of aircraft look like being down 26 per cent this
year. Next year we expect them to be down around 5 per cent. They should
start to recover in 1996, though not dramatically. Flying hours and
take-offs and landings are still growing at around 3 per cent a year, so you
know the business is going to come back. The question is when.'
The projections sound curiously precise, but Mr Bossidy is a precise man.
When he took over in 1991, he set himself financial targets for 1994: an
improvement in operating margins from 5 per cent to 9 per cent, and a return
of equity of 18 per cent against 10.5 per cent. Nine months into the year,
margins are running at 9.2 per cent, while return on capital is 20 per cent.
In response to this, he is raising the targets. Margins next year will be 10
per cent, he says, and 12 per cent by 1997. Similarly, productivity - which
he defines as sales without price increases divided by costs without
inflation - will carry on rising by 6 per cent (this year so far it has gone
up 5.9 per cent). 'It's an infinite target,' he says. 'You just have to keep
re-inventing ways of getting it.'
He expects sales this year to be up 8 per cent in real terms, having been
flat from his arrival until last year. Here, too, he has raised the bar. 'I
said last year we would try to sustain revenue growth of 8 per cent, with 4
per cent generated internally and the rest from acquisitions. We now think
we can do 5-6 per cent internally, so we'll do 8 per cent plus for the next
three years.'
This year's third quarter, he says, was particularly reassuring, with sales
up a nominal 11 per cent - the first double-digit increase in 6 1/2 years.
'So with costs in good shape, and with volume continuing to grow, we ought
to see a period of nice income growth.'
The obvious question arises of how far this recovery is cyclical and thus
unsustainable. Everything is cyclical, he says; but in the company's largest
single division, which makes car and truck components, he argues for greater
stability. The US auto industry is greatly helped by the weakness of the
dollar, but US auto manufacturers are also running their businesses better
than they used to. As for the cycle, he says, 'as US autos weaken, Europe
should strengthen, and we're roughly equal in both'.
One reason for the company's strength in Europe is an active acquisition
programme. This is an important part of Mr Bossidy's strategy; since his
arrival AlliedSignal has made 11 acquisitions, which next year will
contribute sales of Dollars 1bn - perhaps 7 per cent of the total.
In addition to acquisitions, he points to two more sources of future growth:
new products, such as innovative forms of radar, and globalisation, above
all in China, India and Mexico. Provided that strategy works, he is happy to
stick to the existing businesses of aerospace, automotive and materials. 'If
we can get the growth I think we can in those three sectors, we'll stay
there. Failing that, we'd consider a fourth area. That's a low priority
right now.'

seeds unit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Empresas La Moderna (ELM), a Mexican tobacco and agriculture business, has
agreed to buy the Asgrow Seed Company, a subsidiary of Upjohn, the US
healthcare and chemicals business, for Dollars 300m.
The deal is expected to be concluded at end-December, subject to regulatory
approval.
Asgrow is one of the world's five leading agricultural seed companies, with
revenues last year of about Dollars 300m, of which about half came from the
US and the remainder from Europe, Asia and Latin America. It researches,
develops and markets 1,000 varieties and 31 species of seeds for the
processor and fresh market produce business.
ELM's acquisition is part of a strategy to diversify from its core tobacco
business into agriculture. Last year it took 51 per cent of Agricola Batiz,
an exporter of fruits and vegetables to the US.
Mr Alfonso Romo, chairman of ELM, said that the transaction 'fits perfectly
with our vision to establish a strong agriculture and biotechnology
business'.
He said the combination of ELM's marketing skills and Asgrow's research and
development abilities would give ELM a unique position in a market in which
Asian and Latin American countries would become increasingly important.
Mr Ley Smith, chief executive of Upjohn, said 'because of changes in our
industry, Upjohn needs to focus on its core pharmaceutical business'.
Asgrow's purchase price represents about 10 per cent of ELM's stock market
capitalisation, and its annual sales about 20 per cent of ELM's total. ELM
is an affiliate of Grupo Pulsar, a conglomerate controlled by Mr Romo.

Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group, has been selected by an alliance of
small US wireless operators to provide long-distance telecoms services to
knit together their proposed networks.
C&amp;W's US subsidiary is already an established long-distance US operator, and
the contract does not require heavy investment.
However, C&amp;W said that if the wireless operators - all small and
medium-sized concerns - succeeded in gaining licences for new 'personal
communications services' (PCS) networks, the resulting business could be
worth 'several hundred millions of dollars a year' to C&amp;W within five years.
The PCS licences are due to be auctioned next year by the Federal
Communications Commission, the US regulatory authority. The FCC has reserved
a proportion of the licences for smaller operators.
AT&amp;T, the US operator and equipment supplier, will supply network equipment
for the alliance.
C&amp;W's US subsidiary had a turnover of Dollars 560m last year.

May Department Stores, the biggest US department store group, yesterday
opened the quarterly results season for US retailers by reporting a modest
4.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the three months to October.
Net income rose from Dollars 133m to Dollars 139m, but May said the latest
figure would have been Dollars 145m had it not been for its share of the
cost of settling a lawsuit filed against the company and its investment bank
by certain bondholders in 1992.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, including the litigation charge, rose from
49 cents to 51 cents.
May operates 309 department stores and 4,062 Payless ShoeSource stores in
the US.
Revenues at stores open for more than a year rose by 4.4 per cent in the
department store group but fell by 2.6 per cent in the Payless ShoeSource
group.
This sluggishness in store-for-store sales growth was offset by May's
aggressive store-opening programme.
During the quarter the group opened 10 new department stores, making a total
of 11 in the year-to-date, and also ended the quarter with 193 more Payless
ShoeSource stores, for a total of 283 year-to-date.
As a result, total department store revenues rose by 7 per cent to Dollars
2.33bn and Payless ShoeSource revenues rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 540m,
producing an overall 6 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 2.87bn.

CLAL of France

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engelhard Corporation, the New York-listed company which is 30 per
cent-owned by Minorco, the overseas arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group
of South Africa, has signed a letter of intent to put most of its precious
metals fabricating operations into a joint venture with CLAL of France.
CLAL, quoted in Paris, is part of Mr Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere's Fimalac
financial-industrial group.
The 50-50 joint venture, to be based in France, would have annual revenues
of about USDollars 1bn, derived equally from the partners, and employ 2,600,
about 1,750 from CLAL. It would combine Engelhard's strengths in platinum
group metal fabricated products with those of CLAL in gold and silver
products.
CLAL claims market leadership in France, Spain, Scandinavia and the
Netherlands while Engelhard has a strong position in the UK, Italy, the US
and east Asia.
Although there is almost no overlap between the two, there is scope for
rationalisation, Engelhard said.
The deal is not expected to be completed for some months.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Founders of Southern Peru Copper
plan IPO

<TEXT>
Two of the US founders of Southern Peru Copper Corporation (SPCC), one of
the world's biggest integrated copper producers, are to sell their shares
through an international public offering, taking advantage of high metal
prices and interest in emerging markets.
Some 28 per cent of SPCC will be on offer and the company will apply for a
listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
Non-voting, employee shares in SPCC are quoted on the Lima exchange and at
present give the group a market value of about USDollars 1.3bn.
Selling their SPCC shares are Cerro Trading, a Marmon Group subsidiary,
which owns 20.7 per cent, and Newmont Gold, with 10.7 per cent.
SPCC has no plans to offer any shares and will receive no proceeds from the
offering, through US and international syndicates led by CS First Boston and
SG Warburg.
The other founding shareholders in SPCC are US copper producers Asarco, with
52.3 per cent, and Phelps Dodge, which has 16.3 per cent.
SPCC operates two mines and a smelter in the south of Peru. Last year it
produced 307,000 short tons of copper, 3.3m troy ounces of silver and 6.3m
lbs of molybdenum.
The company is three years into a five-year, Dollars 300m investment
programme aimed at increased output and correcting environmental problems.
In June it acquired the nearby Ilo copper refinery, sold as part of Peru's
privatisation programme, for Dollars 68.9m.
A consortium comprising Cominco, the Canadian metals producer, and Japan's
Marubeni has won a bidding contest for the Cajamarquilla zinc refinery on
the outskirts of Lima, Peru, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Cominco, which will have an 83 per cent stake in the refinery, said that the
purchase price is about USDollars 108m, part of which will be paid in
instalments over 14 years.
About a dozen other groups expressed interest.
Cajamarquilla has an annual capacity of about 100,000 tonnes. Cominco has
indicated that it plans to expand the capacity to 140,000 tonnes, which is
about half the size of its flagship complex at Trail, British Columbia.
In addition to an improving political and economic climate, Cominco said
that it was attracted by Peru's active mining industry and 'strong'
geological potential.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: USG wins court ruling on
asbestos claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USG, the US manufacturer of building materials which is fighting a large
number of asbestos-related claims, has won a legal victory which could have
implications for the liability of insurers in asbestos cases, writes Richard
Waters in New York.
The decision, in the Illinois appeals court, upheld USG's contention that it
should be able to claim against insurance policies on a property from the
date that asbestos was first installed, not just from the date it was
discovered.
This so-called 'continuous trigger' test means the company can claim under
insurance policies issued between the late 1940s and 1984.
If applied to all outstanding property damage claims against the company
over asbestos, the decision could make available up to Dollars 600m of
insurance cover, USG said.
Eleven insurers are affected directly by the verdict, including Lloyd's of
London. A lawyer for Lloyd's said the decision would be appealed to the
Illinois supreme court.
While numerous asbestos-related property damage cases in the US are working
their way through the courts, personal injury claims arising from asbestos
were all covered by a global settlement reached earlier this year.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Danske to take control of
Baltica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Den Danske Bank, the leading Danish commercial bank, is to acquire a
controlling interest in Baltica, Denmark's largest insurance company.
The deal will make Danske a significant force in the country's life
assurance and personal accident insurance business.
Danske intends to sell off the parts of Baltica, including commercial and
industrial insurance, which do not fit in with the bank's strategy, said Mr
Knud Sorensen, Danske chief executive.
The move will cost Danske about DKr2.55bn (Dollars 426m), but no share issue
is planned, added Mr Sorensen.
Danske, which already held 32.3 per cent of Baltica's shares, will obtain
control through two agreements.
It has exercised an option to buy a 23 per cent stake in Baltica held by
Gefion, formerly known as Baltica Holding, for DKr1.7bn. This takes the
bank's holding to 55.5 per cent of the capital and 76.9 per cent of the
voting rights.
The bank also entered an option agreement with Denmark's second-ranking
insurance company, Codan, controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, to acquire
Codan's 10.4 per cent stake in Baltica for about DKr850m.
This would take Danske's holding in Baltica to 65.9 per cent of the capital
and 91.2 per cent of the voting rights.
The agreements give Danske control of Baltica's life assurance company,
Danica, which before it was sold to Baltica for DKr4bn in a privatisation
sale in 1990 was known as Statsanstalten.
Danica has a 23 per cent share of the domestic life assurance market.
Together with the bank's Danske Life, Danske will control up to 30 per cent
of the Danish market.
Danica, however, is not permitted to pay a dividend for 25 years from the
date of the privatisation sale. This follows a Supreme Court ruling in
November last year which stated that Danica's profits were the property of
pre-privatisation policyholders.
The ruling has made it impossible for Danske to carry out a sale of the
entire Baltica group. This was its plan when it gained effective control
over Baltica in 1992-93 after it had put up the money to prevent Baltica
Holding (as it was then called) from going bankrupt.
Baltica's share of the domestic personal accident insurance market is about
16 per cent, according to Mr Hans Ejvind Hansen, Baltica chief executive.
Danske owns a personal accident insurance company, Phoenix, jointly with
Codan.
The bank will acquire the entire capital of Phoenix, which has only a small
market share.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ina chief denies Treasury
influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chairman of Ina, the recently privatised Italian insurer, yesterday
dismissed claims by his predecessor that the company was still under the
influence of the Treasury, its majority shareholder.
Mr Sergio Siglienti, the new chairman, said there were no government
representatives on the new 13-man board, elected yesterday, which showed the
company was ready for the second phase of privatisation, due to take place
next year.
Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the outgoing chairman, claimed the Treasury, which has a
52.75 per cent stake in Ina, 'still determined the attitudes and choices' of
the company. Mr Pallesi's name was omitted from the Treasury's list of 10
nominees to the board.
Yesterday's shareholder meeting was the first in Italy to use a new voting
system, which reserves three boardroom seats for directors nominated by
minority shareholders. But small investors claimed the new system had not
lived up to expectations of shareholder democracy.
The seats were filled by nominees of Imigest, a fund manager with a 0.5 per
cent stake in Ina. They are Mr Giampietro Nattino, deputy chairman of the
Italian association of securities houses, Mr Jean Claude Damerval, managing
director of Axa of France, and Mr Anthony Louis Brend, former chief
executive of Commercial Union.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Viag to focus on core business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viag, the German conglomerate with interests ranging from energy to drink
cans, is to shift to a period of consolidation under a new chairman,
according to Mr Jochen Holzer, supervisory board chief.
Mr Alfred Pfeiffer is to step down next August, two years before the end of
his contract, and hand control to Mr Georg Obermaier, finance director, the
company said yesterday.
Embellishing the announcement with bullish forecasts of a marked increase in
profits this year and a continuation of the trend in 1995, Mr Pfeiffer said
his previous forecasts of a 35 per cent rise in operating earnings this year
would be exceeded by a wide margin.
According to Mr Holzer, the boardroom change was based exclusively on Mr
Pfeiffer's personal decision to step down. He would join the supervisory
board and continue to be represented on other important group bodies.
A replacement finance director has yet to be found.
Main elements in the group's new policy would be strong internal growth and
a focus on core businesses, such as energy, chemicals, packaging and
logistics. Supplementary businesses - including telecommunications, which
might be built up to a mainstream operation - would be open for possible
partnerships, Mr Holzer said.
Disposals to tidy the group's portfolio could not be ruled out, although
there were no concrete plans, he added.
The consolidation follows a long period of acquisitions which ended in March
this year in a complex deal under which Viag took over Bayernwerk, the
Bavarian state energy utility, and moved its headquarters from Dusseldorf to
Munich.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle over the succession to Mr Guy Dejouany, president of Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, intensified yesterday. Mr Jacques Calvet, the head of
Peugeot who is a member of the Generale des Eaux board, reaffirmed his
opposition to Mr Dejouany's plan to put a 37-year-old outsider at the top of
the French communications and utility group.
It became evident that Mr Calvet has support from some of the group's 12
outside directors in his objection to the plan by Mr Dejouany, 73, to anoint
Mr Jean-Marie Messier, the managing partner of Lazard Freres, the merchant
bank, as his dauphin and eventual successor.
Mr Calvet held a long meeting with Mr Dejouany on the succession yesterday.
Neither Generale des Eaux nor Peugeot would comment on the outcome. But
Generale des Eaux said negotiations with Mr Messier were advanced and would
be put to the full board this month.
Mr Calvet's spokeswoman at Peugeot reiterated her president's feeling that
'a young man of 37 with no industrial experience could not, however
brilliant, move directly to the top of a group such as Generale des Eaux
with 200,000 employees, without first serving some kind of apprenticeship to
learn the business'.
Mr Messier was the official in charge of privatisation when Mr Edouard
Balladur was finance minister in 1986-88, and he is considered by many as a
Balladur man, as is Mr Ambroise Roux, vice-president on the Generale des
Eaux board.
The Cob, the French bourse watchdog, yesterday said it had fined Mr Jacques
Fournier, a former board member of Lyonnaise des Eaux, the construction and
utilities group, FFr40,000 (Dollars 7,812) for abuse of privileged
information in trading the company's shares. Mr Fournier said he would
appeal.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siemens in multimedia alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the German electrical and electronics manufacturer, has formed an
alliance with Scientific Atlanta and Sun Microsystems, both of the US, to
develop and market systems for the emerging multimedia market.
The plan is to develop a design, or architecture, for multimedia networks
which will be accepted as the industry standard.
The alliance intends to market the system to cable operators and telephone
companies, initially in the US.
Multimedia has become an important focus for electronics groups over the
past year. It implies the delivery of information to the home or office in
digital form over fibre-optic cable or telephone lines and in interactive
fashion.
Customers will be able to send messages and commands to the system making
possible, for example, home shopping, home banking and video-on-demand.
The Siemens alliance is one of a number of groups developing multimedia
architectures in the hope of establishing its version as the industry
standard.
Among those involved in separate multimedia trials are American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, British Telecommunications and Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software house.
Siemens is an expert in telecommunications switching and has developed the
basic multimedia software, IMMXpress.
Scientific Atlanta has experience of cable television systems while Sun
Microsystems, a workstation manufacturer, is an expert in open, or industry
standard, operating software and is heavily involved in the worldwide
Internet computer network.
Scientific Atlanta has developed the 'set-top boxes' - controllers which
receive and translate the digital signals - for a multimedia trial planned
by Time Warner to take place in Orlando, Florida, this year.

shares
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto) fell sharply yesterday
following the Italian bank's announcement at the weekend that its largest
shareholders would block a proposed bid from Banca Commerciale Italiana.
Ambroveneto shares slipped to L4,558 - down L674 on the day - compared with
the L7,000 price which BCI said it planned to offer when it announced its
intentions less than a week ago.
BCI has yet to comment on the latest developments and is unlikely to do so
before its self-imposed November 15 deadline for launching a formal offer.
However, Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, all but declared
victory on Saturday, when he confirmed that the bank's biggest shareholders
had agreed to renew and reinforce their shareholder pact.
Credit Agricole of France and Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of
the Italian banking group San Paolo di Torino - each of which owns 15 per
cent of Ambroveneto - are poised to buy the 13.52 per cent stake offered by
a group of small banks from the Veneto region.
Together with other pact members, the deal will secure at least 57 per cent
of Ambroveneto.
BCI hoped to buy the stake itself, as the basis for its own bid, and CA and
Crediop are thought to have matched BCI's offer.
BCI announced its approach to Ambroveneto only a week after its rival,
Credito Italiano, unveiled plans for a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) bid to gain
control of Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo.

FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Heavy loss in US pushes
Trygg-Hansa into the red - Swedish insurer posts SKr813m deficit at nine
months
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, plunged to an operating loss of SKr813m
(Dollars 110m) in the first nine months of the year from a SKr1.1bn
operating profit in the same period last year. It was hit by heavy losses
incurred by Home Holdings, the US insurer in which Trygg holds a 35.3 per
cent stake.
A fall in premiums to SKr5.37bn from SKr5.95bn, mainly due to Trygg's
withdrawal from reinsurance, and a rise in claims led to a loss of SKr125m
in the group's core property and casualty insurance business, compared with
a profit last time of SKr565m.
Trygg incurred a gross loss of SKr520m due to the sinking of the Baltic
ferry Estonia, which sank with the loss of 900 lives in September, but after
reinsurance the net loss was limited to SKr62m.
The operating result was dragged into the red by Trygg's SKr646m share in
Home's operating losses, and a SKr735m share in losses on Home's bond
portfolio.
Trygg said Home planned to strengthen its capital base by Dollars 250m by
debt and/or equity issues. In addition, Trygg would convert loans to Home of
Dollars 170m entirely or in part to shareholder's equity.
Trygg's so-called total result, which includes the full impact of the
group's investment performance, also tumbled to a loss of SKr1.76bn from a
profit of SKr2.03bn due to unrealised losses in the group's bond portfolio.
Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, announced that DnB
Forsikring, the group's new insurance unit will be established with capital
of NKr300m (Dollars 45m), writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
DnB yesterday submitted an application to the finance ministry for a
concession for the unit, which is scheduled to begin operations during the
second half of next year.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GEC and BAe talks led to 'standstill'
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC and British Aerospace negotiated a two-year agreement in July 1993
barring either company making a hostile bid for the other, as part of
friendly discussions on a merger of all of their defence interests.
The 'standstill' agreement does not expire until July 1995, and contains
clauses forbidding either company from talking about the deal.
In the competition between the two companies to buy VSEL, the shipbuilder,
GEC asked the takeover panel, which governs City deals, to force BAe to
disclose the existence of the standstill agreement. It is understood GEC
wanted the pact made public because it felt that it has a material impact on
the value of the shares BAe is offering VSEL shareholders.
The panel considered submissions from GEC and BAe and declined to act.
Unless such agreements have a direct financial impact on either company, the
panel is reluctant to force disclosure. There is not thought to be a
requirement to disclose the information under Stock Exchange rules either.
Both companies made confidential financial information available to each
other in 1993, including management reports and long-range profits
projections. BAe insisted that in return for providing the share-price
sensitive data GEC should accept a standstill.
BAe refused to confirm or deny the existence of the agreement yesterday. 'We
have many contracts with GEC all of which were freely entered into by both
sides,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director. 'However, we do
not comment on any specific contracts.' GEC also declined to comment.
The standstill agreement is apparently considered to be legally binding by
both sides, and firmly prevents a hostile bid by GEC for BAe until the
middle of next year.
'Unless Lord Weinstock (GEC managing director) is prepared to make a bid and
defy the BAe board to waive the standstill in shareholders' interests, he
cannot move,' said one financier close to the deals.
GEC has made no secret of its interest in merging BAe's defence operations
with GEC-Marconi, the company's defence arm. However, Lord Weinstock's
well-known caution means that he is reluctant to act without complete
information.
Since BAe had had well-known financial difficulties in 1991-1992, GEC was
keen to gain as much information as possible on BAe.

Kenwood Appliances, the household appliances producer, yesterday accompanied
its interim results with a rights issue to fund the Pounds 22m acquisition
of an Italian manufacturer.
The 1-for-4 rights issue, priced at 310p, is expected to raise a net Pounds
27.3m. This will finance the acquisition of Ariete, a Florence-based
producer and distributor of household appliances, as well as funding product
development. Kenwood's share price fell 14p to 360p yesterday,
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said: 'Ariete has a complementary range of
products and an established position in the Italian market. The
opportunities for growth in international markets with Ariete's existing
product range and new ranges under development will be substantial.'
Ariete's main products include coffee-making machines and steam irons. Some
Kenwood products will be branded under the Ariete name in Italy, as Kenwood
hopes to exploit Ariete's distribution network in the Mediterranean area.
In 1993 Ariete reported pre-tax profits of L6.6bn (Pounds 2.6m) on turnover
of L57.4bn. Sales increased 34 per cent in the nine months to September 30.
Kenwood has agreed to pay L46bn in cash and an additional L3bn based on
Ariete's pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. The owners, who are
mainly private shareholders, have also retained the right to a dividend for
the year.
The deal, which is subject to a maximum of L70.6bn, is conditional on
approval from the Italian anti-trust authority. Completion is expected by
December 7.
Ariete is the latest in a series of acquisitions which fit into Kenwood's
strategy of international expansion.
In October last year the group paid Pounds 4m for Precision Engineering,
including its Waymaster subsidiary which manufactures water filters and
kitchen scales. Two years ago, it spent Pounds 3.9m on Tricom, the Hong Kong
company which produces small kitchen appliances in southern China.
Waymaster's contribution helped to lift Kenwood's pre-tax profits 12 per
cent to Pounds 6.01m (Pounds 5.35m) during the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 55m), despite lower
like-for-like sales in the UK.
Interest costs increased from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 646,000. Gearing,
which rose from 19 to 46 per cent at the half-year stage, is expected to
fall to 25 per cent by the end of the year, ignoring the Ariete acquisition.
Earnings per share rose to 11.3p (9.6p) and the board proposed an interim
dividend of 3.25p (3p).
The company floated in June 1992 with a placing price of 285p.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Henderson improves 22% but pensions side
slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson Administration, the fund management group, increased pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent to Pounds 11.2m for the six months to September 30,
compared with Pounds 9.2m last time.
Funds under management and administration increased from Pounds 12.2bn to
Pounds 13.7bn. Inflow of net new funds was Pounds 401m in the six-month
period and Pounds 981m over the year.
The strongest growth areas were retail funds, particularly investment trusts
and peps, and international funds, which rose from Pounds 984m at March 31
to Pounds 1.4bn. Funds under administration - mainly retail funds managed in
Luxembourg for banks to market under their own names - grew from Pounds
1.4bn to Pounds 1.6bn over the six months.
Pension funds under management slipped from Pounds 5.1bn at end-September
1993 to Pounds 4.7bn 12 months on.
Mr Ben Wrey, chairman, said: 'Reversing the flow of funds from our pension
fund company is among our highest priorities.' Part of the strategy for this
is the appointment of Mr Dugald Eagie as managing director of Henderson
Pension Fund Management.
Further expansion of the international division is planned, with another
office, probably in south-east Asia, likely to open within a few months. Mr
Jeremy Edwards, managing director, added that the group was not ruling out
further acquisitions after the Touche Remnant takeover.
The interim dividend is 13.5p (12.5p), payable from earnings of 36.37p
(28.23p). 'Barring unforeseen circumstances' last year's final of 31.5p will
at least be maintained.

p.
Select also announced the acquisition of recruitment businesses based in
Greece through a new 51 per cent-owned subsidiary, for Pounds 53,000 plus
the issue of new shares to the vendors, giving them a 49 per cent interest.
It has also established a joint venture in South Africa trading as 'Only the
Best', for which it has subscribed Pounds 70,000 as convertible loan notes.

Shares of Stratagem Group yesterday jumped 7p to 174p after the revamped
manufacturing, distribution and services company turned in full-year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.12m.
The outcome, for the 12 months to August 31, compared with profits of Pounds
1.2m last time and was achieved on turnover ahead to Pounds 80.4m (Pounds

'We said that we would turn round last year's acquisition and these figures
show that we deliver on our promises,' said Mr Bernard Kerrison, chairman.
The recommended final dividend is raised to 3.5p, making 5p (4.75p) for the
year, covered 2.5 times by earnings of 12.7p (9.5p) per share.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G US subsidiary faces Dollars 8.75m fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banner Life, a US subsidiary of Legal &amp; General, is facing the prospect of
an Dollars 8.75m (Pounds 5.33m) fine and payment of compensation to
investors as a result of action taken by the Texas Department of Insurance.
This could also lead to the revocation of the insurer's licence to do
business in Texas.
Banner Life denies that there has been any significant mis-selling of its
policies and is planning to contest the action.
The US regulator's concern has focused on the sale of 'universal life'
policies to people over the age of 65.
These are term assurance - or protection only - policies where a lump sum
premium is paid and a sum at least 2.5 times that amount is paid when the
investor dies.
The regulator says that hundreds of customers wrongly thought they were
buying a savings investment plan.
Banner Life admits mis-selling has taken place in a few instances, but says
it has already paid compensation in the cases identified so far.
The next stage of the process is a formal hearing at the Texas Office of
Administrative Hearings: a decision is not expected for six months or so.
There have been several actions at state level against the sales practices
of insurers. The recommended fine is a record for Texas.
L&amp;G said that universal life policies represented only about 5 per cent of
Banner Life's business in terms of premium income.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Prowting moves ahead sharply to
Pounds 4.42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Prowting, the housebuilder, increased eightfold in the
six months to August 31, reflecting an acquisition and growth in
part-exchange sales.
In its first interim figures since the Pounds 22.6m purchase of Galliford
Homes in September last year, Prowting reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.42m (Pounds 519,000).
Turnover increased to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 15.6m) as sales rose from 165 to
511 units, of which Galliford contributed 267.
Part-exchange now accounts for about 50 per cent of sales, compared with 40
per cent last year, with most second-hand homes selling within 12 weeks.
The average selling price rose slightly from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 86,000,
but the company forecasts little or no price inflation this year.
'The housing market still remains fragile,' said Mr Terry Roydon, chief
executive. 'None of us wishes to return to a boom-and-bust economy, but
nevertheless I trust that interest rates will not increase further in the
short term.'
Operating margins rose from 10 to 13 per cent, despite building costs
increasing by between 1 and 2 per cent.
Net borrowings at the interim stage stood at Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 20.1m),
for gearing of 35 per cent. Prowting expects this to rise to as much as 50
per cent as it continues to purchase land.
The company currently has 5,800 plots with planning permission, equivalent
to five years' building.
Earnings per share rose from 0.3p to 3.6p. The interim dividend is 1.9p
(1.7p). Mr Roydon said the intention was to return progressively to the
historic dividend of 5p.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Executives not deterred by flotation
failures this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the well-publicised failure of 1994 flotations such as
Aerostructures Hamble and McDonnell Information Systems, some 96 per cent of
key executives in other companies recently floated say that, given the
opportunity, they would repeat the exercise.
However, the same MORI survey - commissioned by Eversheds, the law firm -
revealed that feelings on the value of the different advisers varied widely.
Only 56 per cent rated their merchant banks as 'good' or 'very good' value
for money. This compared with 72 per cent for their accountants and 81 per
cent for their lawyers.
In terms of service, 75 per cent were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with
their merchant banks, 88 per cent with their accountants and 93 per cent
with their lawyers.
The survey found that in 51 per cent of cases the total costs of flotation
exceeded expectations, though companies which agreed fixed fees with their
advisers in advance fared better. In 81 per cent of cases where costs did
not exceed expectations, this was because they had been fixed in advance.
Over the 18 months of the survey's span, 94 per cent of flotations have
proved a 'commercial success', in that they realised 'at least as much
capital as anticipated by the company in question'.
Of the 140-odd companies floated between February 1992 and March 1994, 82
managing directors, chief executives, finance directors and comp-any
secretaries were interviewed.

The lack of an exceptional disposal loss of Pounds 223,000 and lower

26 weeks to October 1 with Pounds 243,000 pre-tax, against a Pounds 31,000
deficit last time and full year losses of Pounds 4.83m.
Operating profits at Joplings, the north-east of England department stores,
edged ahead to Pounds 764,000 (Pounds 753,000) but Normans, the south-west
supermarket chain, fell to Pounds 958,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Losses at the
Perfume Shop were steady at Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 202,000).
Turnover was Pounds 72.3m (Pounds 80.3m). The interest charge was Pounds
815,000 (Pounds 887,000). Earnings per share were 0.18p (losses 0.15p). The
interim dividend is passed; there was a 0.2p payment last time. Shareholders
are being asked to approve a reduction in the share premium account to allow
the resumption of dividends.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Raglan Properties, the development and investment company, announced an
increase in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 89,000 to Pounds 3.07m,
reflecting an expansion in its portfolio and a pick-up in the property
sector.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 advanced to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds
4.9m). Earnings per share jumped to 2.71p (0.3p).
Raglan has undergone a transformation over the past 20 months, including a
share consolidation, financial restructuring and new management.
In September, the company had its second rights issue in nine months in
which it raised about Pounds 21.6m after costs, in a 3-for-4 issue which was
to acquire Letinvest, now Raglan Estates.
Gross rental income was Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 304,000) and the profit on sale
of investment properties was Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 184,000). The figures
included the purchase of Letinvest from September 20.
A final dividend, the first since 1989, is planned for this year.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Woodchester Invs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Woodchester Investments and Credit Lyonnais, the French banking group which
has a 53 per cent stake in the Dublin-based leasing and banking concern, are
reorganising their joint continental European leasing operations.
Woodchester is exchanging its 30 per cent holding in Credit Lyonnais Leasing
Europe for the Credit Lyonnais Group's 80 per cent holding in Slibail
Portuguesa - Companhia de Locacao Financeira and 100 per cent shareholding
in Credit Lyonnais Finans Danmark, together with a cash payment to
Woodchester by Credit Lyonnais of FFr96.2m (Pounds 11.4m). Both companies
are controlled by CLLE.
Woodchester is also selling its remaining 30 per cent holding in Woodchester
Trade Finance to Credit Lyonnais for Pounds 1m, equivalent to Woodchester's
share of its net assets at September 30. The move is in line with
Woodchester's aim of withdrawing from non-core activities.
Woodchester is proposing to adopt a twin share scheme, to enable the payment
of a dividend with a lower tax credit to be made. This will help cut its
advance corporation tax liability significantly.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ABF held back by fall in investment income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in investment income depressed profits at Associated British
Foods, the milling, baking, and sugar group which was restructured earlier
this year in order to improve tax planning at the Weston family trusts that
control the company.
Pre-tax profits for the 52 weeks to September 17 fell to Pounds 324m,
against Pounds 338m for the 53 weeks to September 18 1993.
Fluctuating bond and gilt prices knocked the returns on investments of about
Pounds 700m down from 11.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent, yielding income of just
Pounds 21m compared with Pounds 83m last time.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, described the 1993 returns on the gilt portfolio
as 'exceptional', while the low point in the market had been reached at the
end of the group's latest financial year.
Turnover of Pounds 4.48bn was slightly ahead of the previous Pounds 4.39bn,
but was effectively flat given that the 1993 figures covered 53 weeks.
Mr Weston said the markets for bread and sugar were still 'pretty tough  -
go in any supermarket and they will be on sale below cost'. Nevertheless the
group lifted operating profits from Pounds 273m to Pounds 306m.
It was defending its market position by continually improving efficiency and
introducing new products with better margins, he said.
UK manufacturing increased profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 222m.
Rationalisation costs were Pounds 3m lower at Pounds 13m. At British Sugar
profits advanced to Pounds 167m on a lower harvest.
After allowing for dividend payments last month, net cash was Pounds 610m at
the year-end, up Pounds 109m. Capital expenditure remained steady at Pounds
200m.
In addition to the investment income the pre-tax figure included Pounds 4m
from property disposals (unchanged from the previous year) and Pounds 23m
(Pounds 12m) from the group's investment in Berisford International.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 30m. The tax charge was
reduced by Pounds 35m, reflecting reassessment of previous Berisford losses.
The group paid Pounds 63m (Pounds 104m).
Consequently earnings per share were sharply ahead at 56.7p, compared with
50.7p last time.
A final dividend of 7.5p (6.5p) is proposed, giving a total for the year of
16p (15p).
COMMENT
After the feast in the bond market last year it was only to be expected that
famine would follow. While 1.5 per cent can only be described as an
appalling return, better times are likely to reappear this year. The
operating profits were better than expected, reflecting the continued drive
to control costs. This is necessary given the supermarkets' propensity to
offer discounts on white loaves. There should be some benefits from the
acquisition of Bibby's agricultural feeds operation last April, and the
group continues to churn out the cash. Even with an upturn in investment
income, earnings this year will be lower as the tax charge returns to
normal. The City is expecting about 51p a share, giving a prospective
multiple of 11 - nothing to get excited about.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques in takeover talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Control Techniques jumped 83p to 468p yesterday after the
Powys-based electronic drives group announced that it was in takeover talks
with Emerson Electric of the US.
Emerson already holds 29.4 per cent of Control, but undertook not to
increase its stake under a 1991 standstill agreement. That agreement expired
at the start of June.
Control said that it was in discussions with Emerson 'which may or may not
lead to an offer for the ordinary shares in Control Techniques not already
owned by Emerson'.
The relationship between the two companies dates back to 1991 when Control
acquired 80 per cent of ICD Drives, a New York subsidiary of Emerson, in
exchange for 7.6m Control shares. ICD Drives was later renamed CT Drives.
Emerson's shareholding in Control was subsequently increased to about its
current level through a tender offer at 320p for 3.8m shares.
Under the terms of the original agreement, Control has acquired Emerson's
remaining 20 per cent stake in CT Drives for Dollars 7.9m (Pounds 4.8m).

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enhancing stock performance - Peter John
considers the increasing popularity of lending shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK may have one of the world's most sophisticated stock markets but when
it comes to stock lending, it behaves like an emerging market with all the
barriers and opportunities that implies.
Now, however, stock lending is coming in from the cold and bankers consider
it has great potential.
Traditionally dogged by regulations and middlemen, it recently received a
fillip from the change to rolling settlement. And many fund managers hope
the chancellor of the exchequer will shortly liberate gilts lending to
provide a real impetus for change.
Stock lending is the lending of shares or bonds to meet the temporary needs
of other parties, typically dealers, who need securities to support their
trading.
Mr Roy Zimmerhansl, one of Nomura's global securities analysts, said: 'It is
a bit like a shopping trolley. If you decide to do your grocery shopping for
the next three months you could buy all the food. But without a trolley you
can't get it home. It oils the wheels of every part of equity business.'
Although there is a transfer of title, the lender retains the benefits of
ownership such as dividends and is secured with collateral and paid a fee.
Institutions which invest for the long term can squeeze an extra drop out of
their port-folios.
Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisers index funds, which are heavily
involved in stock lending, have often outperformed world markets, excluding
the US, with the help of this technique.
The UK, however, is hampered by a frisson of nervousness that goes back to
the Robert Maxwell debacle. Maxwell, the erstwhile media baron, had a habit
of borrowing stock from one part of his empire to prop up loans in another.
The exposure of his malpractices brought the concept into disrepute.
A more important limiting factor is the heavy regulatory system which the
Inland Revenue originally imposed to plug possible tax loopholes.
Only approved marketmakers can borrow stock and then only if they are
already dealing in that stock. If they want to borrow UK equities they have
to go through an approved money broker, who takes a cut.
In addition the collateral in the UK is only 102 per cent of the value of
the stock while internationally it is 105 per cent, giving the lender more
of a cushion.
Finally, convention has it that collateral is only represented by
certificates of deposit or short-term Talisman certificates, which are made
up of a basket of stocks.
Fund managers complain that because you do not know what makes up the basket
of stocks you could lend out quality stock and get questionable collateral.
In theory it would have been possible in 1990 to have lent ICI and received
Polly Peck as collateral, just before it collapsed.
Internationally, collateral is agreed between the two parties.
'In terms of UK and international lending we focus our activities on
international stocks because the security is better and the rates higher,'
said Mr Michael Robarts, director of Fleming Investment Management.
However, the UK picture is changing rapidly. Some estimate that stock
lending turnover has risen by 30 per cent over the past year. Previously the
returns were so small and the cost and workload involved so great that four
or five leading UK institutions withdrew from the activity.
The change is partly the result of the stock market's move, earlier this
year, to 10-day rolling settlement from two and three week dealing accounts.
The need for marketmakers to balance their books every day, rather than at
the end of the account, has caused demand for borrowed stock to rise.
The big change the market is awaiting is the ability to carry out gilt
repurchase agreements which many believe could be sanctioned in the
forthcoming Budget. At present, gilt repos are held between the Bank of
England and the clearing banks, who by law have to balance their books every
day.
It is suggested that traders may be able to repurchase from each other with
the probability that the need to go through money brokers would disappear.
Once money brokers become unnecessary for repos, the same would be true for
stock lending. The fees they charge would disappear, the margins for the
lenders would increase and investors in UK equities would be able to exploit
a technique that helps them maximise the value of their portfolios.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Growth in exports behind rise at Elliott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in B Elliott yesterday rose 10p to 99p as increasing exports to North
America and east Asia helped the electrical and mechanical engineer lift
interim pre-tax profits by 55 per cent to Pounds 1.94m, against Pounds
1.26m.
Export-driven growth in the specialist engineering and electrical and
electronic systems divisions contributed to an 18 per cent increase in
turnover to Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 40.7m) in the six months to Septem-ber 30.
Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 4.06p (3.28p). Interim dividends are
restored at 1p, equal to the previous year's total.
Mr Michael Frye, chief executive, said the results demonstrated the
'complete restructuring of the company from a machine tool manufacturer to
greater focus on specialist technology'.
Sales in the specialist engineering and electrical divisions both grew by
about 30 per cent.
On the other hand, sales in the process technology division, which
manufactures machine tools, declined by 11 per cent to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds
11m), owing to low demand in the UK and contractual problems, commented Mr
Frye.
During the period the company made four small acquisitions, worth Pounds 2m
in total, which it has bolted on to existing operations. Mr Frye said the
strong balance sheet allowed for further acquisitions.
Net borrowings stood at Pounds 9.9m at September 30, pushing gearing up
slightly to 83 per cent.
The net cash balance was Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Frye said that with further opportunities for growth overseas and an
improvement in the UK market, the company expected continued organic growth.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Beckenham suspended for second time in a
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted heating and ventilation engineer, yesterday
requested that its shares be suspended.
It is the second time in less than a year that dealings in Beckenham's
shares have been halted.
The latest move comes after a comprehensive restructuring of the group. Last
year, losses on contracts forced it into a capital reconstruction
pro-gramme, which included a placing and rights issue and the sale of
subsidiaries.
However, it continued to report losses, with an interim pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 2.6m in the period to April 30, compared with a Pounds 186,000 loss
12 months previously. Turnover fell from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13m.
Neither the company nor Townsley &amp; Co, the housebroker, would comment on the
suspension. Mr Peter Long, chairman, hopes to make an announcement today.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Lex Service sets up new division to tackle
EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the UK's biggest vehicle distribution and leasing group, is
forming an international division with the intention of breaking into the
car dealer networks of continental Europe. The move is a potentially
significant one for the development of vehicle retailing in the EU.
Continental car markets, including France and Germany, are much more
fragmented than in the UK. Most dealerships are privately owned and large
public groups, such as Lex, are virtually unknown. Most represent tempting
targets for UK groups seeking to replicate their multi-franchise dealer
chains on the Continent.
Lex has nearly 130 UK car and commercial vehicle dealerships, representing
more than 30 manufacturers. It sold 64,000 new and 30,000 used vehicles last
year and accounts for about 3 per cent of the UK new car market. Its annual
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 101.5m.
It and other large distribution companies, such as Inchcape, maintain that
they are able to make the economies of scale and heavy investments in dealer
facilities needed to strip the inefficiencies out of car retailing.
Mr David Beck, managing director of Lex's retail group, is to become
managing director of Lex Automotive International. He oversaw Lex's entry
into vehicle retailing in North America with the takeover of Campbell
Automotive, a chain of California dealers, in 1989.
Lex already has two small leasing ventures in France, covering cars and fork
lift trucks.
'However, we are now in a situation where we can look at continental
opportunities, both dealerships and importerships, systematically.' Lex
said.
The announcement of the European venture comes about a month after the
European Commission's decision to allow Europe's car makers and dealers to
keep their privileged system of exclusively franchised dealer networks for
another 10 years.
However, the amended terms of this 'block exemption' from normal EU
competition rules should make it easier for dealer groups with enough
financial resources to set up multi-franchise networks on the Continent.
As part of Lex's management changes, Mr Jon Walden, a main board director,
will replace Mr Beck as managing director of Lex Retail Group, which manages
the car dealerships. Mr Walden is managing director of Lex Vehicle Leasing
and chairman of Hyundai(UK).

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil makes Pounds 8m buy in security
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil yesterday announced its first investment in security services since
the Pounds 75.7m acquisition of Securiguard in mid-1993.
It is to pay a maximum of Pounds 8m for Granada Group's security operations
held by Sterling Granada Contract Services.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said: 'We are saying through this
acquisition that we are happy with our position in the UK security services
sector, and that we want to expand it further.'
Sterling Granada had turnover of Pounds 20m last year, but was barely
profitable. However, Rentokil is confident that its performance will be
rapidly improved, through the reduction of management overlap with
Securiguard.
Securiguard has proven a successful acquisition, and remains on target to
achieve double digit profit margins within 2 years of its purchase. Mr
Thompson said he intends to develop the company into a 'major player' within
the UK, and analysts expect further acquisitions both in the UK and US.
Sterling Granada will have net assets at completion of Pounds 1m. Its
traffic and secure storage businesses are to be retained by Granada.

Five Oaks Investments, the property group, swung from an Pounds 851,000 loss
to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.28m during the year to June 30.
As a result, earnings per share were 2.54p (1.83p losses) and the
recommended final dividend of 0.3p makes a total of 0.5p (nil) for the year.
Rental income grew 20 per cent to Pounds 4.2m, with the current annualised
figure running at Pounds 5.2m.
The balance sheet was strengthened through a share placing and open offer,
which increased the capital base by Pounds 12.2m. Also, a large part of the
short-term debt was converted into a Pounds 15m 25-year secured debenture.
Gearing fell from 106 per cent to 44 per cent at the year end.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Allied Domecq in Pounds 265m sale - Food
ingredients disposal represents 'another significant step' in strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Domecq, the UK food and drinks group that has decided to concentrate
on spirits and retailing, yesterday sold its food ingredients businesses for
a total of Pounds 265m.
Kerry, the Irish food group, has agreed to pay Dollars 402m (Pounds 248m)
cash for DCA Food Industries, Allied's US food ingredients subsidiary, and
Margetts Foods of the UK.
Separately Allied has agreed the sale of a DCA joint venture interest, not
in the US, to a third party for Dollars 25m.
Mr Tony Hales, Allied chief executive, said the sales represented 'another
significant step' in the group's strategy.
'We are pleased to have found a committed buyer for DCA in Kerry,' he added.
New York-based DCA makes ingredients such as food coatings for the
industrial, food service and supermarket segments of the market. Margetts
makes jams and processes fruit for yoghurt, ice-cream and bakery products.
The businesses had annual revenues of Dollars 333m and operating profits of
Dollars 31.8m for the year to last February. Analysts suggested that Allied
had got a good price, at well over Dollars 1 per dollar of sales.
Kerry, which yesterday described its purchase as 'a major strategic
acquisition', is to finance the deal through a combination of bank
borrowings and a placement. Yesterday it placed 7.8m ordinary shares at 335p
apiece with institutional investors, raising IPounds 26m (Pounds 25.6m).
Borrowings will more than double to IPounds 360m, giving gearing of well
over 100 per cent. The group aims to cut this to less than 90 per cent by
the end of next year.
The deal has been backed by Kerry Co-operative, which owns 52 per cent of
the group, and is expected to be completed next month. It will lift the
annual sales of the group's food ingredients businesses to about Dollars
1bn, accounting for more than half total turnover.
Allied Domecq changed its name from Allied-Lyons after paying Pounds 739m
last March for control of Pedro Domecq Group, the Spanish drinks producer.
Domecq is best known in the UK for sherry brands such as La Ina, but 50 per
cent of its profits last year came from Mexico, where it owns Presidente,
the largest-selling brandy in the world.
The group's extensive food and beverage businesses, with a total turnover
last year of about Pounds 1bn, were put up for sale in the summer. Among
prospective buyers for DCA were Dalgety and Grand Metropolitan in the UK and
Heinz in the US. The Tetley tea and European bakery businesses remain on the
market.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, beat SG Warburg of the UK to advise
Allied on the disposal of the food ingredients businesses. Warburg continues
to advise Allied on the sale of the beverages and bakeries units.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wellington Underwrite listing hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A delay by Lloyd's of London in approving fresh rules on corporate
investment in the insurance market has caused a last minute headache for a
new underwriting company planning a listing.
Wellington Underwriting, which intends to invest in seven Lloyd's syndicates
run by the Wellington managing agency, is due to complete arrangements this
week for placing 30m shares at 100p.
It faces a scramble to finalise the details after Lloyd's regulatory board
failed last Friday to approve proposals allowing existing corporate vehicles
to invest in others. The issue will be considered by Lloyd's council
tomorrow.
Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of the Wellington agency, said the amount
that would be affected by the proposed changes was 'not critical', but the
hitch has made the timetable for Wellington's placing tight. Commitment
letters are due to be returned to Greig Middleton, its broker, on the same
day as Lloyd's council meets.
Impact day is set for this Friday with dealings expected to start on
November 17.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Shake-up continues at New London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reorganisation of New London, the oil industry services company,
continues with the announcement of a disposal, acquisition and results
showing reduced losses from continuing businesses.
The company is selling Well Solutions, its Texas-based energy industry
services supplier, for Dollars 16m (Pounds 9.7m) in cash and Dollars 1.5m in
convertible loan stock. Mr Paul Kesterton, chief executive, said the
proceeds would be used to buy International Tool &amp; Supply for an initial sum
of Dollars 5.75m in cash and the issue of 20m new shares.
ITS operates a variety of international businesses serving the energy
industry, from distribution and procurement to designing and manufacturing
steam generators, and supplying products for the containment of oil spills.
The acquisition agreement included further payments in cash and shares,
contingent on ITS meeting certain profit targets.
New London also announced interim pre-tax profits of Dollars 685,000,
against a loss of Dollars 1.38m last time. Profits were helped by an Dollars
845,000 gain on the termination of discontinued operations. Sales fell from
Dollars 58.4m to Dollars 12.2m due to the sale of International Drilling
Fluids last year. Excluding IDF, sales rose from Dollars 11.8m.
Earnings per share were 0.6 cents (1.2 cents losses). There is no dividend.
The shares were suspended at 4p pending shareholder approval of the disposal
and acquisition on November 29. Dealings are expected to resume on December
1.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Gartmore in venture to build US presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore, the UK fund manager, has formed a joint venture with NationsBank,
America's third biggest bank, which will allow it to sell international fund
management expertise to US retail and pension fund investors.
Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman of Gartmore, said the venture will give
Gartmore distribution outlets to build a US presence.
NationsBank is the US's second largest bank distributor of mutual funds and
Gartmore hopes to capture some of the fast growing market for individuals
who choose their own pension fund manager, he said. The venture will also
target the US 'defined benefit' market which pays pensions to individuals
based on their final salary and the US mutual fund market.
'To make any inroads into this market you need strong branding and strong
retail distribution,' Mr Myners said.
Under the agreement, no cash will change hands immediately. However, if the
total assets of the venture top Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) within five years,
NationsBank has an option to acquire 10 per cent of Gartmore, in newly
issued shares, at 200p per share.
Mr Myners said that while the venture will make little contribution to
earnings in the short term, it should provide significant growth in the
long-term.
The venture will control the Dollars 540m managed by NationsBank Panmure
Investment Management, the fund management arm of stockbrokers Panmure
Gordon, also owned by NationsBank. Also, if clients agree, it will capture
the Dollars 230m in assets under management at Gartmore's existing US
operation, which will be absorbed into it.
Analysts said the move is important for NationsBank which has been less
successful than other big US regional banking groups at developing and
selling its investment products.
Another joint venture, with stockbroker Dean Witter, will be unwound next
week after just 16 months. NationsSecurities has been the subject of
lawsuits from customers, who claim that it failed to make clear that its
investment products were not covered by the federal bank insurance fund.

FT  08 NOV 94 / IBM agrees hardware standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines, Apple Computer and Motorola yesterday
confirmed details of an agreement to develop a common standard specification
for personal computers.
Based on PowerPC microprocessor chips, their goal is to establish a new PC
standard, challenging the domination of Microsoft's Windows and Intel's
microprocessors which are used in about 85 per cent of PCs sold.
Industry analysts said, however, that the move may be 'too little, too late'
because while the PowerPC partners have established a hardware standard,
they have failed to agree on an operating system software standard.
Instead, the companies said they would build computers that adhere to a new
'hardware reference platform' specification that will run a broad range of
software.
The standard PowerPC design will support several operating systems including
Apple's Macintosh software, IBM's OS/2 and AIX (a variety of UNIX) and
Microsoft's Windows NT, the companies said. Novell and Sun Microsystems will
also develop versions of their operating systems for the new PowerPC
standard.
The PowerPC alliance, formed three years ago, has so far been thwarted in
its efforts to unseat Intel and Microsoft by a lack of support from software
companies, which have put most of their resources into developing
application programs for Intel-Microsoft standard PCs.
By establishing a PowerPC hardware standard, the companies hope to broaden
the market, drawing software support and encouraging other computer
companies to build compliant products.
However, the market for software for PowerPC computers will remain
fragmented among the various operating systems, analysts pointed out.
Computers based on the new PowerPC hardware standard will not reach the
market until 1996. In the meantime, Apple, IBM, Motorola and other computer
companies that have been developing PowerPC-based PCs will have to redesign
their products.
Mr Michael Spindler, Apple president and chief executive, said that the new
hardware standard will enable Apple to broaden its sales.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Passenger increase fuels BAA rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 7 per cent increase in airline passengers helped fuel a Pounds 28m rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 265m, at privatised airports group BAA during the
six months ended September.
Its shares fell 24 1/2 p to 492 1/2 p, although the figures were in line
with expectations, and BAA remained positive on the outlook for passenger
growth and retail spending.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 201m as the group continued its three-year
investment programme estimated at Pounds 1.4bn. Net debt rose to Pounds 790m
(Pounds 739m), while gearing remained less than 30 per cent.
The company said the recent collapse of a tunnel at Heathrow - part of a
Pounds 300m project to develop a high-speed rail link to central London -
was unlikely to have a meaningful financial impact as the tunnel was four
months ahead of schedule.
Group turnover rose 5.3 per cent to Pounds 660m (Pounds 627m). Revenue from
traffic and airport charges increased by Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 278.4m. It
was held back by its regulatory price formula, which reduced prices by 4 per
cent below the Retail Price Index.
For the next two years, however, the formula shifts in BAA's favour, with
potential increases of 1 per cent below RPI. In addition, a combination of
economic recovery and aggressive competition for passengers within the
airline industry should ensure further growth.
The company benefited from continued delays in the opening of the Channel
tunnel, which is expected to absorb around 3 per cent of BAA's passengers,
or around 2.6m passengers, once it is fully operational.
Retail revenue rose from Pounds 250.1m to Pounds 273.2m, with average
passenger spending 7.8 per cent more than a year earlier. The figures were
hit by the effects of construction at Terminals 1 and 2 at Heathrow, but
sales should recover strongly once the disruption ceases, over the next two
years.
Property income rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 80m (Pounds 73m), because of
rent from Compass Point.
The company has kept tight control on costs, with a 5.3 per cent increase in
passengers per employee, versus a 5.7 per cent increase in staff costs per
employee.
BAA reported mixed fortunes from its overseas operations. Its Pittsburgh
operations have performed well, but it recently turned down a similar
contract in Philadelphia, 'because it was not profitable enough'.
The company has offices in Hong Kong and Australia to look at investment
opportunities, and Sir John Egan, chief executive, said any meaningful
investment outside the UK would be funded through equity.
The company announced an interim dividend of 3.75p (3.375p), up 11 per cent
while earnings per share rose to 19.2p (17.1p).

FT  08 NOV 94 / TeleWest looks to US model forgrowth hopes: Optimism ahead
of planned flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the largest UK cable operator, yesterday pushed ahead with its
flotation plans with a pathfinder prospectus suggesting a total value for
the company of between Pounds 1.61bn and Pounds 1.86bn.
An offer price per ordinary share, which will be between 165p and 190p, will
be announced on November 22 and TeleWest is scheduled on November 30 to
become the first cable company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The aim is to raise between Pounds 330m and Pounds 380m in new money with
the sale of 216m ordinary shares in London and the Nasdaq market in New York
representing 26 per cent of the enlarged issued ordinary share capital - 22
per cent on a fully diluted basis.
Mr Alan Michels, chief executive of TeleWest, a joint venture between TCI of
Denver, the largest US cable operator and US West, the regional telephone
company, said: 'We believe that cable is a major growth area, that the UK
offers a most attractive regulatory regime for cable, and that TeleWest is
exceptionally well positioned in the UK cable market.'
There is already informal investor interest in as much as three quarters of
the offering at the midway price. Such interest suggests a change in
perceptions about UK cable and in particular about a company that still has
to spend another Pounds 1bn to complete its networks and which is unlikely
to be profitable before 1998 at the earliest.
The main reasons for the increasingly positive sentiment include:
The growing importance of cable's dual revenue streams from television
channels and telephone services. Ordinary cable television subscriptions
stand at around 800,000 with hopes for nearly 1m by the end of the year. By
October 1, 570,656 telephone lines were installed, compared with 244,946 a
year ago.
Growth in the stock price - 48 per cent since August 1 - of the first three
UK cable companies to be quoted on Nasdaq: Bell Cablemedia, Comcast UK and
International CableTel.
Excitement over superhighways of the future. US cable operators say that in
the US they talk about the superhighway but in the UK it is being built - by
the cable companies. Cable offers a clear route into video on demand and
interactive services if the consumer interest is there.
The hope is that the UK will eventually follow the US pattern on cable. In
the US cable first reached 10 per cent of homes, slowly crept up to 25 per
cent before taking off to attain 60 per cent penetration on the back of an
expansion of programme choice. 'We would expect and we believe the same
thing will happen here,' said Mr Michels.
In the UK however cable penetration - the ratio between homes which can
subscribe to those that actually do - has remained at around 21 per cent for
some years although the actual number of subscribers continues to rise as
more cable networks are built. Unlike the early days of cable in the US,
cable in the UK must develop alongside a mature video market and more than
2.5m installed satellite dishes.
TeleWest owns and operates 16 cable franchises while affiliated companies
own a further seven. The franchises account for 3.6m homes and 235,000
businesses. TeleWest has a 100 per cent equity interest in a total of 2.8m
homes - aggregating the minority interests - and 180,000 equity businesses.
By the end of September TeleWest had around 188,000 equity cable
subscribers, 125,000 residential telephone lines and 17,000 equity business
lines. In the 12 months to the end of September, revenues were Pounds 63m, a
fivefold increase since the financial year ending December 1991.
Mr Michels wants to increase average penetration by 2 percentage points to
23 per cent by the end of this year and by a further 2 percentage points by
the end of next year. To achieve this, TeleWest will support an
industry-wide advertising campaign on the merits of cable, sell cable more
extensively through high street outlets as well as door-to-door marketing,
and try to negotiate more flexible terms from cable's largest programme
supplier, British Sky Broadcasting (a venture in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a significant stake), which is in turn likely to come
to the market by the end of the year.
One analyst suggested yesterday that talk of TeleWest being worth 10 times
operating cashflow sounded 'a bit rich'.
'I would like just a little more comfort that the management is flexible
enough to cope with whatever competition arises,' he said, adding that
TeleWest would probably rank high in an emerging cable sector on the London
Stock Exchange.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Citibank enters UK retail market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Citibank, the US money centre bank, is entering retail banking in Britain
for the first time. The bank expects to open six branches by the end of 1995
in an effort to build a global branch banking network.
The bank has opened its first retail branch in the Strand in London and
expects to open a further three in London. This follows the opening of three
'model' branches in Paris last year.
Citibank executives said yesterday that it might eventually establish a
large network by acquiring a building society. But for at least three years,
it would only offer a niche service for professionals who travel widely.
It will offer 24-hour telephone banking, and sophisticated automated
terminals which can be used in the US for stockbroking. Customers are
required to keep at least Pounds 2,000 in a current account to avoid fees.
The bank has about 500 branches in Europe, including 301 branches in
Germany, 96 branches in Spain and 62 branches in Belgium. It bought the
former Kundenkreditbank (KKB) in Germany in 1974, changing the name three
years ago.
Mr Victor Menezes, executive vice-president in charge of consumer banking in
the US and Europe, said the bank was 'not planning a mass market assault',
in Britain but would aim at the 'large international population' in the
south-east.
It wanted to establish a niche presence first, and might then reconsider an
expansion into the broader UK retail market.
Citibank is aiming to attract 'tens of thousands' of UK customers. But, Mr
Menezes said that the main aim was to establish a link in its global network
of branches, which includes 117 in the Asia Pacific.
Citibank already has a Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) residential mortgage
portfolio in the UK, making loans through intermediaries. In the early
1970s, it closed a small network of 'money shops' which had offered personal
and consumer loans.
The bank's retail franchise in emerging markets is highly regarded by
analysts. According to the bank, its Dollars 10.9bn of revenue from consumer
businesses last year outstrips the Dollars 8.5bn of Disney, and the Dollars
7.4bn of McDonald's.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Bow doors faulty on 33% of ferries using UK ports:
Government to increase safety checks on vessels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to increase checks on roll-on roll-off ferries after one
in three of the vessels operating from British ports was found to have
faulty bow doors.
Thirty-five of the 107 ferries inspected had minor defects when the
Department of Transport's marine safety agency carried out the checks after
the sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic in September with the loss of
900 lives.
The faults included leaky rubber seals and fractures to brackets and
fittings on the bow doors. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said
yesterday that all the vessels tested were watertight and fundamentally
sound.
However, one vessel, the Winston Churchill, a Danish-flagged ferry plying
between Newcastle and Esbjerg, was temporarily detained for repairs to its
stern door.
The findings come just before the start of passenger shuttle services
through the Channel tunnel that are expected to take a large share of the
ferries' cross-Channel business.
Ships flying the UK flag had a higher incidence of defects than the
foreign-flagged vessels. Of the 58 UK-flagged vessels, 36 per cent needed
repairs, compared with 28 per cent of the 49 foreign-flagged ships.
Dr Mawhinney said he was surprised that faults had been found with as many
as 35 ferries. He was in Dover watching tests on the inner bow doors of the
Pride of Calais, a six-year-old vessel operated by P&amp;O European ferries.
Water from a high-pressure hose failed to penetrate the door seals.
Dr Mawhinney said the marine safety agency had been asked to increase the
number of unscheduled inspections and to write to all ferry operators to
remind them of the need to pay attention 'to even the smallest safety
detail, so as to maintain safety standards at the highest levels'.
The agency is also to carry out computer studies on the effect of water
penetrating bow doors and whether internal bulkheads, urged by the Royal
Institution of Naval Architects and others, would make any difference. The
government would order a redesign of ferries only if there was strong
evidence that bulkheads would provide a safety benefit.
UK ferries are surveyed once every 12 months by agency inspectors when the
passenger ship safety certificate is renewed. Unscheduled inspections are
carried out at least twice a year.
Since the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 with the loss of
193 lives, teams of surveyors also travel incognito on ferries operating
from UK ports to observe them at work.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Norwich Union set to reduce workforce by 2,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, has announced plans to shed
up to 2,000 jobs - a fifth of its workforce - within the next five years.
Mr Allan Bridgewater, chief executive, said the job cuts were needed because
the group had to achieve productivity gains of 40 per cent to 50 per cent
over the next 3 to 5 years to remain competitive.
The job losses will include compulsory redundancies, although Norwich Union
said it hoped the majority would be voluntary departures. About 450 staff
are on short-term contracts, and the group loses about 600 staff a year
through natural wastage.
Norwich Union is not alone among insurers in planning job cuts; in both
general and life insurance business companies are facing increasingly tough
competition.
The higher cost of meeting regulatory standards at a time of generally flat
life insurance and pensions sales is also putting pressure on margins.
In September, for example, Legal &amp; General said it had already cut its sales
agents - who are self-employed and paid by commission - from 2,300 at the
start of the year to about 1,800. It expects this figure to fall to about
1,000 by the end of next year.
The contraction in the financial services industry was also underlined last
week in the annual report from the life industry's regulator. It showed that
the number of sales agents acting directly for life companies stood below
94,000 at the end of June, while in July 1991 it had totalled more than
twice that.
Yesterday's Norwich Union announcement is likely to hit the city of Norwich
particularly hard, as more than half of the group's staff work there.
It is not yet clear how the cuts will be spread across the group's general
insurance business - which employs 3,800 people - and its life and pensions
operation, which employs 4,500.
Some retrenchment on the life and pensions side was signalled in July, when
Norwich Union announced that the number of its branch offices was to be
almost halved, from 25 to 13.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Brussels drops plans to lessen tax burden on multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday dropped proposals designed to reduce the
tax burden on European companies with subsidiaries in more than one EU
country.
The draft directive, aimed at ending double taxation on cross-border
operations between parent companies and subsidiaries in other EU nations,
was abandoned after a four-year deadlock.
Mrs Christian Scrivener, commissioner responsible for taxation, told a
meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels that she was withdrawing the
proposals because of the staunch opposition of certain countries, notably
Portugal but also Belgium and Greece, which feared a significant loss of
revenue.
Furthermore, some EU states believe there is no need for common legislation
on the issue because of an existing network of bilateral agreements.
The failure of member states to agree on the issue represents a blow to the
single European market and will irritate European multinationals.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary-general of Unice, the European business
federation, said the proposal would have allowed companies to reorganise
themselves and operate on a 'truly pan-European basis' by avoiding double
taxation on interest and royalties payments between companies that were part
of the same group.
Trans-European enterprises currently pay tax at source for payments between
parent companies and subsidiaries.
Fears of a cut in revenue are especially evident in member states that are
net importers of technology and capital, such as Portugal and Greece.
The lack of progress also represents a setback for German ambitions to make
tax a priority of its six-month presidency of the European Union.
In less than two months, Germany will hand over the chair to the French, and
in that time it is unlikely that significant advances will be made on two
other key taxation matters: an EU-wide system for taxing savings -
withholding tax - and the introduction of a definitive system of VAT.
Yesterday, EU ministers discussed the continuing difficulties associated
with EU-wide withholding tax, which has been consistently opposed by the UK
and Luxembourg.
Germany, which suffers considerably from capital flight, wants EU countries
to agree on a minimum withholding tax to prevent people moving their savings
to other countries and thus avoid paying tax.
Levels of tax currently vary between the member states. Luxembourg, for
example, does not levy taxes on savings held by non-residents in the
country. It fears that an EU-wide tax would benefit other tax havens of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development such as Switzerland
and Monaco.

FT  08 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gartmore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pension fund managers are more international in outlook than their peers
in other countries, as shown by the relatively high weighting they give to
non-domestic assets in their investment portfolios. But UK fund managers
suffer from parochialism insofar as the money they manage originates
overwhelmingly from the UK. The fiercely competitive UK market looks
increasingly ex-growth.
Gartmore's joint venture with NationsBank of the US is a smart answer to the
strategic challenge. It involves minimal initial outlay by either party and
is unlikely to make a contribution to Gartmore's earnings before 1996.
Nevertheless the deal promises to insulate Gartmore from further stagnation
in the UK. At the same time, it gives the UK group access to the US market,
where the share of pension fund money invested outside the US is set to rise
from 3.0 per cent to 11.5 per cent over the decade to 1998. Alone, Gartmore
could have hoped to have gained a modest share of this business. The
alliance with NationsBank brings together the US bank's distribution muscle
with Gartmore's investment expertise. As a result the joint venture's target
of managing Dollars 5bn of US money within five years looks attainable.
If so, the impact on Gartmore's profits will be substantial - and the 10 per
cent of Gartmore sold to NationsBank a price worth paying. The move will put
pressure on other UK fund managers to find partnerships.

FT  08 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Refurbishing airport terminals may bring long-term benefits, but as BAA
admitted yesterday such improvements have a short-term price. Growth in
retail spending per passenger in the first six months of the current
financial year was limited to just 1.8 per cent compared with the first half
of last year because shopping facilities were being rebuilt. Brokers who
already knew that passenger numbers had climbed 7 per cent had expected to
upgrade their profits forecasts. The disappointing spending figures prompted
a fall of nearly 5 per cent in the share price.
Nevertheless, BAA is certain to benefit from the growth in civil aviation.
The channel tunnel may have some impact on passenger volumes next year, but
in the worst case damage should be limited to the equivalent of six months
growth. Meanwhile, spending per passenger should rise once the terminal
improvements are completed. At Heathrow terminals three and four, where work
is completed, retail income per passenger has improved 21 per cent and 83
per cent respectively.
With operating costs firmly under control, up just 3.5 per cent year on
year, BAA is well managed. But with a price earnings ratio for the current
year of 19, its shares trade at a 30 per cent premium. Given that earnings
grew 12 per cent in the first half, such a premium may look expensive
compared with other premium rated groups such as Reuter. But what BAA lacks
in growth, it makes up in predictability. With its monopoly position and
increasingly lenient regulatory regime, there is little to knock the group
off its steady upward path.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a No vote in Sunday's EU-membership referendum has come as a
nasty shock to Sweden's markets. Increasing confidence in the government's
determination to tackle its budget deficit made Sweden the best performing
government bond market in October. But in the past few days the spread
between German and Swedish 10-year bonds has widened by almost 100 basis
points as a series of polls have pointed to a No vote.
Sentiment was not helped by last week's deficit reduction package which
leaves a good deal to do, even if one believes all the assumptions. Since
one of these is a big reduction in interest rates by the end of next year,
the bond market was not impressed. Nor are floating voters persuaded by the
government's warning that a No vote will require sterner measures.
Though Swedish business has campaigned for a Yes vote, it is unclear how
great the cost of non-membership would be on its highly international
leading companies. A No vote would hit the krona, if only on the expectation
that inward investment would dry up, which would further enhance the
competitiveness of Swedish manufacturing. But the currency risk will
discourage international investors. Swedish shares are not particularly
cheap anyway. Buyers of bonds also risk further losses with a No vote not
yet fully discounted. The yield spread against bunds is still narrower than
for Italy, whose public finances are in scarcely worse shape than Sweden's.

FT  08 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Churning TeleWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as TeleWest is trying to enthuse investors about its impending Pounds
1.6bn-Pounds 1.9bn flotation, an astonishingly high proportion of its
customers are switching off. The churn rate - the number of cable television
customers who disconnected as a proportion of Tele-West's total customer
base - was 48.5 per cent during the year to end-September. Some of this is
because of a give-away promotion during the spring: nearly 90 per cent of
those who took the free offer cancelled their subscriptions when the bills
started rolling in.
The high churn rate raises questions about TeleWest's indicative valuation.
Implicit in the valuation is the assumption that the level of take-up for
cable television will jump from 21 per cent to 47 per cent. But if customers
are so quick to switch off, one wonders whether TeleWest can achieve such
penetration.
Another question is whether the implicit 'terminal value' - how much
TeleWest will be worth in 10 years - is reasonable. Kleinwort Benson, joint
global co-ordinator, calculates the terminal value at 10 times operating
cash flow. When depreciation, interest and tax are taken into account, the
more conventional earnings multiple is something over 20, which looks pricey
for what should then be a fairly mature business.
There is, of course, a positive side to the TeleWest story: its revenue from
telephone services is booming; further potential is provided by multimedia
services which are only a twinkle in its eye; and other UK cable operators
recently floated in the US have performed well. But, with TeleWest not due
to report a profit until 1998, the risks of investing look high.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Bosnia Serbs may ease peace plan stance, UN official says
</HEADLINE>

Bosnian Serbs may soften their opposition to international peace proposals
as a result of their military reverses over the past two weeks, the top UN
official in former Yugoslavia said yesterday.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese diplomat who heads the UN's 40,000-strong
mission there, said the Serbs would probably respond to the present
offensive with a counterattack, but then a military balance would be
reached.
British officials said they were doubtful as to whether the present upsurge
in fighting might lead to a positive result. They urged all parties to
abandon the idea of a military solution to the Bosnian conflict.
In a further sign of international disunity, British officials disclosed
that they and their French counterparts had launched a discreet diplomatic
campaign to dissuade other members of the UN Security Council from voting
with the US to authorise arms supplies to Bosnia.
Mr Akashi said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, might step back
from his outright rejection of the international peace plan drawn up by a
contact group consisting of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
'With the change of situation, they may become more amenable to talking with
the contact group,' Mr Akashi said of the Bosnian Serbs.
In Bosnia, a Serb commander threatened to seize back all the heavy weapons
that his army has placed under UN supervision and deploy them against the
Moslem-led government army if attacks around Sarajevo continue.
UN ground forces are too lightly armed to prevent the Serbs from retaking
the equipment. However, such violations of the total exclusion zone around
Sarajevo might prompt air strikes by Nato forces.
Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces continued their offensive, pouring artillery
fire on to Serb positions near Donji Vakuf, a strategic town in central
Bosnia, yesterday.
Bosnian government forces are also trying to take Trnovo, a ruined but
strategically important town, which, if it falls, could provide a link
between Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bonsia.
Mr Akashi was speaking in Geneva, where he conferred with Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, and UN commanders in former Yugoslavia
about the future of the organisation's hard-pressed peacekeeping effort.
UN officials have complained that the contact group, which is supposed to be
working for a settlement in Bosnia, is failing in its role as a mediator and
leaving the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia increasingly exposed.

Britain's bookies must be quaking in their boots. Robin Chater, a
45-year-old number-cruncher who runs Wantage-based Racing Sciences, believes
he can spot likely winners in National Hunt races by subjecting the
offspring of 30 sires to advanced statistical analysis. If punters had
followed his recommendations, he claims they could easily have outperformed
the stock market over the past year.
Chater, whose unlikely form includes editing the National Child Care
directory, stumbled on his discovery when he was analysing his first love -
trotting races. When bookmakers started not to show up at those races he
sensed that he was on to a winner and decided to widen his field.
He picked National Hunt rather than flat racing because his theories worked
better. Among his many finds is one stallion whose progeny produces a return
of over 100 per cent on right-handed tracks but loses a bundle on left-hand
tracks. Punters wanting to test Chater's form should call him on 01235

The Department of the Environment was struck with a severe dose of
time-travel indigestion yesterday. At 11.45 the central office of
information electronically informed the nation's newsrooms that John Gummer,
environment secretary, had given the go-ahead for two new community forests
in Cleveland and Nottinghamshire. The announcement, the CoI helpfully added,
had been made at the Association of County Councils' annual conference in
Leicester.
Three hours later - after Gummer's speech - a worried delegate asked about
forestry, a subject he had not mentioned. He coyly answered that he hoped to
make some announcements 'in the near future'.

<TEXT>
Proof positive that there is such a thing as a free lunch. That's what
voters got on Sunday when they turned out for a presidential election and
constitutional referendum in Tajikistan, the central Asian country at war
since its inception in 1991.
Tajikistan has 2.64m registered voters, who had to choose between Tajik
president Emomali Rakhmonov and challenger Abdulmalik Abdulladjanov. About
20,000 people have already died in the civil war. Now there's a food
shortage as well as a guerrilla war.
Free rice pilaff was served as an enticement for people to vote.
Abdulladjanov - currently Tajikistan's ambassador to Russia - must have
hoped that as a former minister of bread, he was in with a chance.
Instead, the voters appear to have endorsed the pilaff prince; Rakhmonov was
declared the winner with 80 per cent of the vote.

You have to travel far these days to see a proper celebration of the 1917

The newspaper Hanoi Moi declared the revolution 'the most glorious event of
the 20th century', while party ideologist Vu Huu Ngoan wrote in another
paper, Nhan Dan, that 'we have to build a clean, strong, well-organised
party . . . the failure of perestroika in the Soviet Union reminds us that a
socialist-oriented society must have renovation'.
In Moscow, pro-communists were banned from Red Square. Instead, a group of

Observer is starting a campaign to discover which UK hotel charges the most
to make a five-minute telephone call. The award - a broken handset from a
1960s public telephone, or a bottle of malt, winning nominee to choose -
will go to the biggest proved rip-off posted or faxed in by Christmas.
Top of the list so far is the spanking new Hilton National hotel in Swindon.
A colleague was recently charged Pounds 42.50 for a 30-minute Sunday night
call to Dublin. British Telecom's weekend rate at five pence per unit -
roughly 15 seconds - would have cost about Pounds 6, and Mercury somewhat
less.
But Swindle's - sorry, Swindon's - Hilton charges 30p per unit for the first
10 units, and 25p thereafter. The hotel's general manager Ashley Myers
thought this wasn't too bad, since he understood the Manchester Airport
Hilton to charge 36p per unit. Much the same as it's better to be eaten by
lions than tigers . . .

FT  08 NOV 94 / Harmony under the bonnet: Volkswagen is about to reach
agreement with the Czech government over the future of Skoda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace is about to be declared between Volkswagen and the Czech government
ending 14 months of wrangling over the future of Skoda, the Czech carmaker.
Volkswagen, Europe's largest car-maker, has scaled back the ambitious plans
to modernise Skoda that initially helped it beat Renault of France to win
the Czech government's approval for the takeover in 1991.
The revised plans should guarantee the future of the Czech carmaker, while
allowing the German company to introduce production arrangements more
radical than anything it has so far attempted at its plants in Germany.
The new harmony between Skoda's shareholders was on show two weeks ago when
Czech ministers and government officials gathered with the company's top
management on Prague's Charles bridge to christen the Felicia, the first new
Skoda to be launched since VW took over management control in early 1991.
President Vaclav Havel took a private test drive.
Last year, Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's management board chairman, had stunned
his partners in Prague, by pulling out of a prestige DM1.4bn (Pounds 570m)
project finance facility for Skoda. Negotiated over many months with the
International Finance Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, the loan was abandoned only hours before it was due to be
signed in London.
VW's withdrawal, made without prior warning to the Czech government, sent
shockwaves through Prague and soured a relationship that had begun with high
hopes.
It has taken a long time to rebuild trust, but lawyers for the two sides are
putting the final touches this month to crucial amendments to the original
Skoda acquisition contract.
A new appendix to the agreement is aimed at stilling Czech government fears
about the level of Volkswagen's commitment to Skoda, the showpiece of the
Czech privatisation programme, fears that had led to rumours that Prague
might drop VW and seek a new partner.
Due to be signed in the next couple of weeks, the new agreement will finally
clear the way for VW to boost its shareholding in Skoda by the end of
December from the 31 per cent acquired in 1991 to a majority 50.5 per cent.
VW will inject an additional DM350m of new equity into Skoda and make a
further DM40m payment to the Czech government. Its stake will rise to 70 per
cent by the end of 1995 in return for a total investment of DM1.4bn -
DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda and DM200m paid to the Czech
government.
Prague has had much to come to terms with in the revised deal:
The capital investment planned for Skoda until the end of the decade has
been cut to about DM3.7bn from the original estimate of DM9.5bn.
The target of a doubling of production capacity to 390,000 cars a year has
been reduced to less than 350,000.
A costly new engine plant has been dropped from the programme.
VW argues, however, that the revision of its plans for Skoda will enable the
Czech carmaker to avoid the costly disasters that have beset Seat, the
group's Spanish subsidiary, pushed to the edge of financial collapse last
year by the combination of recession and the over-ambitious investments
agreed in the late 1980s.
In 1990, VW had just begun a 10-year, Pta607bn (Pounds 3.4bn) investment
programme at Seat, and presented its spending on the Spanish operation to
the Czech government as a model for Skoda.
Today it is clear that the Spanish model was flawed. Huge losses at Seat
last year helped to pull the whole of the VW group deep into the red.
Instead of a model, Seat is now cited by VW as a warning of the perils of
profligate over-investment.
'We always mentioned how successful Seat was. We organised many trips to
Spain to show the Czechs the brand-new plant, how well-equipped it was with
a lot of automation. Today we know that labour rates are very low in the
Czech Republic.
It is much more effective not to automate all the processes,' says Mr
Volkhard Kohler, the Skoda vice-chairman brought in by VW in 1991.
Volkswagen is hardly the same company today as the one that planned the
development of Seat and then announced a string of visionary projects for
eastern Europe in 1990 and 1991 as the borders of the eastern bloc suddenly
opened to the west.
It plunged into record losses of DM1.94bn in 1993. Virtually its entire top
management has been replaced. It is undergoing a corporate revolution, as it
seeks to escape from the unenviable position as Europe's high-cost car
producer.
The robust regime initiated by Mr Piech at the beginning of 1993 set out to
cut costs to the bone. The gospel now is lean production, lean engineering
and lean investment. The Skoda project has been subjected by Mr Piech to the
same ruthless review as the rest of the group's operations, with little
regard to the sensitivities of his partners.
'Too high investment can kill our company,' warns Mr Kohler.
'In 1990 all views were too optimistic,' he adds. 'There were buoyant
markets in the east, today we know there is no purchasing power. When the
Iron Curtain came down there were ideas that you could speed up development,
but today it is clear that that cannot happen.'
Volkswagen is pushing ahead, however, with the development of a second Skoda
car range to be launched in late 1996, which is aimed at increasing Skoda
sales worldwide above 300,000 a year by the late 1990s from less than
200,000 this year.
It will maintain and further develop the existing 1.3 litre Skoda engine
family - now regarded as one of the company's biggest cost advantages - and
is looking to develop a version for use elsewhere in other group cars,
possibly at Seat.
It is building a new paint plant at the main Skoda facility at Mlada
Boleslav with a capacity for processing 1,300 cars a day or 307,000 cars a
year based on three-shift, round the clock working. It is also building an
assembly plant for the second range, a large family car to be based on the
chassis platform of the next generation VW Golf.
The initial capacity for the new car will be for 70,000 a year, but this
could be increased later to 140,000 a year, if there is sufficient demand,
says Mr Gerald Weber, Skoda's engineering director. 'We have to be careful.
We have the lesson of Seat, where the investment was too much. We have to
avoid that.'
The guiding principle for VW as it has revised its plans for the Czech
Republic has been to ensure that Skoda does not forfeit its cost advantages.
According to Mr Piech 'the 'low-cost' argument is of particular significance
due to the fact that the vehicles of the Skoda marque compete in the
extremely competitive segment of the low-cost family car. In this segment
the battle for the customer is fought decisively on prices.'
Mr Piech argues that the 'image disadvantage' of Skoda - in the UK it is the
butt of endless jokes - coupled with a low level of familiarity elsewhere in
west Europe, as well as an aggressive price battle in world car markets,
'will put the brakes on a swifter and profitable growth of the marque'.
The labour cost advantage for Skoda in the Czech Republic is enormous with
total labour costs at around one tenth of the level in Germany, but Mr
Kohler accepts that this advantage will gradually be eroded.
'We have to streamline our production processes to be able to offer cars at
a very low price. Wages will go up in the Czech Republic. We must find
production processes that work to our advantage in the future, and that
means the integration of our suppliers.'
The development of a more efficient Czech automotive component industry was
a key element in the original VW acquisition of Skoda, and its renewed
commitment to this programme will be included in the new agreement with the
Czech government.
Since VW moved into Skoda nearly four years ago, around 40 joint venture
components operations have been established, which already supply 44 per
cent of Skoda's purchases of materials. A further 6.5 per cent of purchases
come from greenfield site operations.
Around 80 per cent of Skoda's total purchases are made in the Czech Republic
and Slovakia and more than half of total purchases are already coming from
suppliers with access to western technology.
VW is now seeking to break new ground at Skoda by establishing supplier
operations directly inside the car plant, moving a step ahead even of the
Japanese model of having suppliers grouped in close proximity to the plant.
Three suppliers - Lucas, Johnson Controls and Pelzer - are already working
inside the Skoda plant producing rear axles, seats and carpets. Mr Kohler
says the number will soon rise to 10 to include items such as bumpers,
dashboards, instruments and exhaust systems.
'Labour costs will rise over time, so we must have a lean structure from the
outset.' The company claims that productivity has improved by 37 per cent in
the last three years.
Despite the labour cost advantage, the Skoda workforce is already falling,
from more than 17,000 last year to under 16,000 in 1995. The Cuban,
Vietnamese and prisoner workers of the Communist era are long gone, and
Skoda has also cut the number of Polish workers to 140 from 700 earlier this
year.
It also plans to transfer some workers from its own payroll to its
suppliers'. Unlike in Germany, where car workers' wages are significantly
higher than rates paid at components suppliers, there is little difference
in the Czech Republic. It is therefore easier to transfer workers and create
a flexibility that Mr Kohler hopes will be a crucial source of future
competitiveness.
While VW has been tightening its manufacturing and product development plans
for Skoda, it has been buffeted by dramatic fluctuations in the fortunes of
Skoda's main markets, which have forced the Czech carmaker to scour the
world for new outlets.
In 1991 Skoda sold 29,600 cars in Yugoslavia; this year sales to that area
have fallen to around 6,000. Sales in Poland have plunged from 38,000 in
1991 to 3,800 in the face of heavy import duties. In Turkey, they have
fallen from 22,000 last year to close to 4,000 in 1994.
According to Mr Detlev Schmidt, Skoda sales director, the sales potential of
90,000 a year in these three markets from 1991 to 1993 has fallen to around
14,000 this year.
'Skoda must succeed in opening new markets and finding new opportunities,
because there is such vulnerability in central and eastern Europe. It is
nothing to do with product weakness or price but with local market
conditions.'
Sales are rising in west Europe, with registrations up by 10.6 per cent in
the first nine months of this year. Skoda is also breaking into new markets
from Syria to Egypt, Jordan, Venezuela, China and North Korea. The number of
markets in which Skoda cars are sold will have been raised from 20 in 1991
to 57 by the end of the year, and around 36 additional markets are under
study.
However, it has had to start virtually from scratch in creating a
western-style sales and marketing network, having inherited state-selling
organisations of limited commercial skills in 1991.
'It was a delivery and allocation mentality. The factory just produced and
was surprised when someone came and said it must meet customer expectations.
It said the car is there, that's the colour, the customer can take it or
leave it,' says Mr Schmidt.
Skoda has ambitious plans for the expansion of its worldwide sales and
distribution network. The number of dealerships worldwide had already been
raised from 1,522 at the end of 1991 to 2,100 by the end of 1993, and this
is set to reach 2,500 by the end of this year and 4,000 by the end of the
decade.
Helped by the launch of the Felicia range, which has just been unveiled as
the successor to the Favorit and which will go on sale in the Czech Republic
next month, Skoda sales are forecast to rise to 205,000 in 1995 including
sales of 76,000 in west Europe and 67,000 in the domestic Czech market.
In line with the hairshirt mentality now ruling Volkswagen these forecasts
along with the latest strategic plan for Skoda are much more modest than the
euphoric earlier versions. But VW is still working hard to explain to its
Czech partners that even this agreement must be open to change as market
conditions evolve.
'Our people saw the (original) contract as a state plan,' says Mr Ludvik
Kalma, Skoda chairman. 'When we speak of five-year plans, people think that
that is a dogma for five years, but now when one plan is made, we start
working on the next.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Joint ventures between electronics companies are proliferating almost as
fast as the varieties of services and equipment they sell. What is going on?
Yesterday Siemens of Germany announced that it was teaming up with the
US-based Scientific Atlanta and Sun Microsystems to develop and market
technology for distributing telephone and information services. The US
telecommunications industry is also humming with talk that AT&amp;T and the UK's
Cable &amp; Wireless will try together to create a national US network for
mobile telephony.
Meanwhile, in a further round of the uneasy three-year partnership between
IBM and Apple Computer, the two companies yesterday at last announced plans
together with Motorola for a common computer design.
The impetus for such partnerships comes from the communications and
computing revolution and the explosion in the range of services offered to
households and businesses. This has been made possible by telecommunications
deregulation in many industrialised countries. But it is also driven by
technological change: the increase in the carrying capacity of channels, and
the emergence of new computer chips able to process much greater volumes of
data.
In this maelstrom, companies are battling to get their products established
as the standard with consumers and with designers of peripheral equipment.
The key to making money in the high-volume segments of electronics has
always been the ownership of intellectual property, whether the design of
hardware or software, when that configuration is adopted as the industry
standard.
Equipment standards
In Siemens' case, it hopes that its US partnerships will set the standard
for the equipment now being bought by cable operators and telephone
companies to deliver the new multi-media services.
The mooted link-up between AT&amp;T and C&amp;W has its eye on the new federal
licences to be allocated by the Federal Communications Commission for
'personal communications services' such as mobile telephony. Such a
partnership would be able to build a network offering a common brand image
and 'seamless' communications from region to region out of what would
otherwise be hundreds of small firms operating with different equipment.
Such hopes are clearly better pursued through joint ventures than through
takeovers, even where regulation permits. Speed is essential in securing
competitive advantage in such conditions, and the products concerned are
often only part of a company's range, hardly warranting a full corporate
merger. But such joint ventures need not be anti-competitive. They may
instead prove the only way through which an existing industry standard can
be challenged and bettered.
Industry dominance
Such is the case with the alliance between IBM, Apple and Motorola, formed
to reinvent the personal computer and to overthrow the industry dominance of
Intel and Microsoft. The three have had every incentive to make the
relationship work: the window for attacking Intel-Microsoft is wider than it
has been for years, as the Intel chip design faces more competition, and the
next version of Windows will not be launched until well into 1995.
But competitive breakthrough has proved elusive so far. Even if the trio
develops compatible hardware, it has not yet produced common software which
would let programmes run on computers designed by either IBM or Apple.
The reasons for the tensions shed light on the difficulties of many such
alliances in electronics. IBM and Apple have each believed that it has the
better ideas, both on hardware and software; each has been unwilling to
surrender independent research and development, let alone marketing. It is
an uncomfortable portrait of a marriage in which rivalry has triumphed over
common interest.
They may regret it. The opportunities available in electronics worldwide to
secure a competitive lead are unlikely to recur for years. Those companies
that form well-judged partnerships, and have the cultural flexibility to
enable them to succeed, are likely to prove the winners.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A Budget for employment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster is awash with proposals to reform the tax and benefit system
with a view to fostering employment. Owing, in part, to the separation of
the two policy areas, tax reforms aimed at raising work incentives in the
1980s tended to neglect the large disincentives to work faced by those at
the threshold of the tax and benefit systems. The second unified Budget
provides Mr Clarke with an opportunity to start redressing the balance.
By common consent, the welfare state is in need of fundamental reform.
Reforms of the tax and benefit system have not kept pace with changes in the
labour market. Approximately a tenth of the population is now dependent on
means-tested state benefits, twice as many as in 1979. In the past, economic
recovery would have lowered this figure considerably. But fewer of the
unemployed are being offered the full-time, relatively secure jobs for which
the benefit system was created. As a consequence, the relationship between
levels of welfare dependency and the economic cycle shows signs of breaking
down.
Some of the changes in the structure of employment may have been encouraged
by the tax and benefit system itself. The National Insurance system, for
example, probably explains some of the rise in the numbers working very few
hours. By and large, however, evidence of similar trends in other countries
indicates that it is the welfare state that must bend to labour market
change, not the other way round.
Reforms proposed
There is no shortage of reform proposals for the Chancellor to choose from.
The Labour Party's Social Justice Commission, the Trades Union Congress and
the Confederation of British Industry have all recently outlined what they
would like him to do in this area. Mr Clarke could usefully draw ideas from
all three, but the visionary sweep of such proposals should not distract his
attention from relatively modest reforms, which would still lessen the
system's worst flaws.
The Chancellor should focus his energy and resources on two groups whose
difficulties in the labour market are currently most acute: families with
children and the long-term unemployed. Family Credit was introduced to
eliminate the possibility that taking work would leave anyone with children
worse off. In practice, however, child care and other up-front costs
associated with taking a job, coupled with the withdrawal of housing and
other benefits, ensure that this kind of 'unemployment trap' is still a
problem for unemployed people with children.
The new childcare costs 'disregard' within family credit, announced in the
last Budget, will go part of the way to improving the situation. But further
help is needed to ensure that people can bridge the gap between leaving
income support and beginning to receive family credit. At present, around a
third of family credit claimants receive 'fast-track' approval for their
application.
Guaranteed income
The Chancellor should make a commitment that no-one will experience any loss
of income - however short-term - by taking a job. The best way to achieve
this would be to institute a guaranteed 1-2 week overlapping payment of
income support after a person starts work. This would have the added
advantage of helping to meet one-off expenses related to going back to work.
The biggest obstacle to taking a job for the long-term unemployed is not the
structure of the benefit system, but rather employer preferences. Mr Clarke
should lower national insurance contributions for companies employing the
long-term unemployed. If necessary, a well-tailored scheme could be funded
by raising the upper earnings limit on National Insurance, which already
causes an unjustifiable dip in marginal income tax rates before people reach
the higher rate band of income tax.
Mr Clarke is fortunate in having an opportunity to combine the politically
fashionable with the worthwhile. Yet whatever aspect of the problem Mr
Clarke decides to tackle, one rule must be obeyed. Nothing impairs the
efficient functioning of the benefit and tax system more than its
administrative complexity. Job centres and benefit offices are graveyards
for wheezes born of past ministerial publicity-seeking. Mr Clarke must not
add to the list.

FT  08 NOV 94 / The competency count
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several competent ministers serve in Mr John Major's cabinet. One or two
would be classed in any administration as, shall we say, not bad. We should
acknowledge these hidden pearls. Better that than focus yet again on
dispiriting accounts of internal squabbles in the Conservative party, or
zoom in once more on tales of malfeasance.
From time to time those of us whose task it is to hurl brickbats and squashy
tomatoes at the administration should take a breather, contemplate the half
of the glass that is full, consider the parts of the egg that are good,
temper outrage with a sense of proportion, savour the unfamiliar experience
of recognising that a surprising number of departments of state are properly
managed.
Two such are the Foreign Office and the Treasury. The weight added to Mr
Major's team by the presence within it of Mr Douglas Hurd will be measured
by the loss felt when he departs. I am not about to predict the foreign
secretary's resignation, either imminently or, as is widely supposed, next
July. Others have made such a forecast in the midst of each of the last four
summers. Let us take him to be there until we learn otherwise. We are
well-served while he is in place.
This is not to say that Mr Hurd is without flaw. I do not agree with every
detail of his policies, least of all in Bosnia, but then I do not have
responsibility for soldiers' lives. Again, he and the chancellor have
initialled the prime minister's intra-party concordat on the European Union.
This sticking-plaster agreement owes more to fear of Tory Eurosceptics than
it does to adherence to heart-of-Europe principles. Thus it may be said that
Mr Hurd has contributed more gravitas than strategic vision to the
government's handling of European affairs. Yet, warts and all, the foreign
secretary is an undoubted asset.
So is the chancellor. Mr Kenneth Clarke has had the humility, and the sense,
to place monetary policy under the watchful eye of the governor of the Bank
of England. By publishing the minutes of their meetings he has given Mr
Eddie George the quasi-independent power to move interest rates. It is now
virtually impossible for the prime minister to override advice given by the
chancellor and the governor in combination.
As to fiscal policy, Mr Clarke's control over public spending is tighter
than was Mr Major's when the latter was chancellor, while Mr Clarke's taxes
are even higher than were Mr Norman Lamont's. The Clarke strategy is more
likely than any other to restore public confidence in the Conservatives as
the party of 'sound money'. It just might put the chancellor in a position
to cut taxes before the next election; failing that he can announce
reductions that he proposes to phase in after the voting is over.
A perhaps more surprising candidate for our necessarily brief order-of-merit
list is Mr Peter Lilley. He is famous for being a right-winger, a
Eurosceptic who spoke foolishly about foreigners at the 1993 party
conference and a purveyor of embarrassingly bad verse. Yet Mr Lilley is a
remarkably successful departmental minister. He acknowledges that social
security, for which he is responsible, is here to stay and seeks merely to
ensure that its cost - some Pounds 85bn a year - does not grow more rapidly
than the national income. He has made a series of changes the more radical
of which will not take effect until well into the next century.
Thus invalidity benefit, the cost of which was growing rapidly, has been
replaced by the tightly-defined incapacity benefit, and statutory sick pay
by an obligation on employers. Pensions legislation due to be announced in
the Queen's speech next week will equalise the pensionable age for men and
women at 65, although the full effect will not be felt for a quarter of a
century. The new Job Seekers' allowance, an item in the same speech, moves
Britain a step further towards US-style workfare.
Whatever Labour may say about harshness, these measures are in the spirit of
the recent report of the left's social justice commission. No future
government is likely to reverse them. Mr Lilley's calculation is that little
will be saved immediately, but that the social security budget will be
reduced by the equivalent of some Pounds 3bn in today's money by the year
2000 and four times that by 2050. The social security secretary does not
radiate pure sunshine. He has not discovered how to reprogram the troubled
child support agency. His promised legislation on rights for the disabled, a
substitute for a private bill the government infamously killed off, has yet
to appear. Yet his principal sins are of omission; what he has done has been
done well.
The same may be said of the new secretary for education, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, although she has not been long enough in the post for a proper
assessment to be made. Her task is to calm the teachers down, following six
turbulent years during which the reforms envisaged in the 1988 education act
have met with increasingly stiff resistance from the teaching unions.
She has made a good start. A former schools inspector and local education
committee chairman, Mrs Shephard is an engaging, down-to-earth minister who
deploys charm and sympathy with practised ease.
Everything she has said so far has been positive. She has accepted, in full,
Sir Ron Dearing's revision of the national curriculum, spoken of
'specialist' rather than 'selective' schools, cancelled her predecessor's
plans to bombard parents with government propaganda leaflets, set in train a
review of higher education, and demanded that children be taught the correct
use of written and spoken English.
I suspect that she is less than wholly enthusiastic about state schools
opting out from local authority control. Her barrage of common-sense is now
being trained on the National Union of Teachers, which has yet to call off
its obstruction of testing in schools.
Finally, note Sir Patrick Mayhew, a successful secretary for Northern
Ireland. His strategy was determined for him by others, notably Mr Major and
his Irish counterpart, but that does not detract from Sir Patrick's own
record. He was there when the shooting stopped. He has not botched his job.
He deserves the credit.
There is no space for the rest of the government. That is not to be taken as
an indictment of all of it. Perish the thought.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on innovative and performance related pay experiments in
BT ('Telecoms union supports pay test', October 26) may cause some confusion
among your readers in one key respect: I should make it clear that the
remuneration policy relates only to sales commission on top of a guaranteed
100 per cent of existing basic pay rates. There is therefore no substitution
of basic pay for any element of performance related pay in the trial you
refer to.
The National Communications Union and BT have worked extremely closely on
the development of this project in the Nottingham/Derby area which is
designed to improve operational efficiency with a comprehensive package of
measures involving attendance patterns, multi-skilling and remuneration.
We welcome an opportunity to clarify this as we work towards a successful
outcome of this exercise.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Twisting and turning: The fitful progress of Russian
economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government and its economic reform programme are swinging on a
rope: the fate of neither can be pronounced with certainty.
For the past year, Yeltsin administration policy has resembled a collection
of 'this way' signs pointing in all directions. It is not simply the
president who is to blame for this, as he thrashes this way and that seeking
stability and support. Also to blame are the senior state officials, who
oscillate between moves towards the market and concessions to those who fear
reform.
Coping with these two contradictory imperatives is the essence of Russian
governance, but it makes for a disjointed progress, always threatened with
reversal.
Yet much of this past year had been trumpeted as a success. The exit from
the Chernomyrdin cabinet in January of Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the two men most associated with reform, suggested something was
amiss. But Mr Chernomyrdin managed to hold to a policy that brought
inflation down from over 20 per cent a month at the beginning of the year to
4 per cent in August.
However, some Rbs13,000bn were pumped into the system over the summer to
allay the demands of the former state industries and agricultural lobbies.
This brought the inevitable rise in inflation, up to 15 per cent last month
(though now said to be falling). It also weakened the rouble. On 'Black
Tuesday' - October 11 - heavy selling drove the rouble down by more than 20
per cent, to Rbs4,000 to the dollar. It only recovered with central bank
intervention.
This appears to have shocked not just the markets and the population, but
also President Boris Yeltsin. A rift - denied, but evident - opened up
between him and his prime minister. The president ordered a commission of
Russia's security council, made up of intelligence chiefs and generals, to
look into the crash. Its conclusions have not been published but have been
leaked.
Not surprisingly, such a committee named guilty men. They included the head
of the central bank, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, and the acting minister of
finance, Mr Sergei Dubinin, both pushed into resignation by Mr Yeltsin. They
included Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister and minister for the
economy, who failed to 'co-ordinate' the work of the departments under his
nominal charge.
They included a group of large banks, including Most, Menatep, Inkombank,
Imperial, Alfa, International Moscow Bank and others, mostly in the top 20
of the new finance houses and all desperate for respectability. They were
charged, according to the daily Sevodnya, with 'profiteering' on the money
markets.
Last week, Mr Shokhin, the longest-serving cabinet member and a solid if not
radical reformer, felt a cold wind. The most senior minister blamed, he
learned that the nomination of the new finance minister - Mr Vladimir
Panskov - was being discussed without his participation. He went, on
Thursday, to Mr Chernomyrdin to demand a say. Mr Chernomyrdin said he did
not know Mr Panskov either.
On Friday, Mr Panskov was appointed. Mr Shokhin's resignation was accepted
by the president on Sunday.
This humiliation for Mr Shokhin was also a blow for Mr Chernomyrdin. Last
month, a conservative agriculture minister, Alexander Nazarchuk, was foisted
on the prime minister. He also lost a close ally in Mr Gerashchenko, the
central bank governor, and a respected colleague in Mr Dubinin, the acting
finance minister.
On Saturday, Mr Victor Ilyushin, the president's closest aide, said his boss
was 'seriously concerned over the work of the government', but denied a rift
between head of state and government.
The constitution underpins a strong presidency, and makes the government
dependent on its pleasure. Mr Chernomyrdin, unlike Mr Shokhin, has decided
to march on. But how much longer can his government survive this kind of
treatment?
That will depend on the progress of economic reform.
The cabinet's credibility and the future of reform are wholly intertwined.
Mr Chernomyrdin's government has committed itself to a rigorous budget,
which eschews the taking of any credits from the central bank. Instead, the
government will depend on the sale of Treasury Bills and on finance of up to
Dollars 16bn from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
This will give the IMF a much larger say than hitherto in the budget's
design. The target inflation rate - 1 per cent a month in a year's time  -
is already agreed. The size of the budget deficit is not. The IMF target is
6 per cent of GNP, the Russian government's 8 per cent. The rate at which
the rouble should be pegged to the dollar, if it can be stabilised, has
still to be decided. But these are tactical matters. The principles are
accepted.
But such austerity is bitterly opposed by the president's officials, led by
Mr Alexander Livshits, one of his economic advisers. Significantly the
deputy head of Mr Yeltsin's budget department, also opposed to the
government's budget proposals, was Mr Panskov, now at Finance.
Mr Panskov was quoted by the government press service as saying on Friday
that he supported the government's course. But, according to ministry
officials, he also said that 'much work remains to be done' on the budget.
Mr Panskov may have been signalling an intention to rethink the basic
strategy of the budget, as parliament continues to rage against it.
But reform, staggering on Friday, was walking tall again on Saturday, when
Mr Anatoly Chubais was named as a first deputy premier in charge of economy
and finance.
Mr Chubais is Mr Privatisation: a stubborn, clever man of only 39. Brought
into government by Mr Gaidar, he has in the past two years overseen the
largest and most rapid privatisation programme in the world. Of his reform
credentials there is no doubt. He said on Saturday that he - he, not Mr
Yeltsin - would soon be naming a new economics minister and a new
privatisation chief.
If there is an unambiguous sign from this mix of events, it is that Mr
Yeltsin, still able to pull the levers of state, is leaning heavily over Mr
Chernomyrdin's crucial budget, but is not yet prepared to squash it.
A 'softer' variant would starve the government of international financial
aid and leave it caught in the toils of high-to-hyper inflation.
Mr Yeltsin may be fretful, and even threatening, over the budget, but he has
yet to come up with a better idea.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opposition to PO privatisation is not
wilful misrepresentation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ERDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The editorial, 'Avoiding postal fudge' (November 3), was sufficiently
arrogant and ill-informed to merit comment.
The claim that opposition to postal privatisation is motivated mostly by
ignorance or wilful misrepresentation is the view from an ivory tower.
Actually, the public is afraid of seeing another service damaged in the same
way that health, education and transport have been, by a combination of
increased cost and decreased availability.
As regards misrepresentation, the government's case has certainly been well
aired, not least by your newspaper, but the views against privatisation have
hardly been reported at all.
More than half of all main post offices have already been quietly privatised
through franchising to retail outlets. In the process many people have lost
the benefits deriving from continuous employment. Their pension and pay has
been reduced. It is not at all clear that the European Union's Acquired
Rights Directive - known as TUPE, and which protects the terms and
conditions of public-sector employees whose contracts are transferred to the
private sector - have been observed in the process.
The closure of post offices in town high streets has had a detrimental
effect on the viability of remaining shops in much the same way that opening
superstores has.
Many post offices have been sited in superstores and other outlets not
easily accessible to pensioners. The advice offered to them has been to open
bank accounts, which some can neither afford nor understand.
The process of franchising is continuing today despite the resounding vote
of no confidence given to privatisation by the public through their elected
representatives.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK bankers right to worry about
directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER FINK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read Norma Cohen's article, 'Weighty tome sends
investment banks reeling' (November 2), on the effects of the EU's capital
adequacy directive and, in particular, bankers' fears that French and German
regulators will not enforce the rules as rigorously as do those in the UK.
An interesting comparison is the rigorous way the UK authorities have
brought the money-laundering directive into force and, in particular, its
application to solicitors, in contrast to other member states.
The principal aim of the money-laundering directive was to ensure that
'credit and financial institutions' introduced administrative procedures for
the purpose of identifying and preventing money laundering. Member states
were also required to extend the provisions of the directive to professions
and other businesses which engage in activities 'particularly likely' to be
used for money-laundering purposes.
The relevant UK legislation, the 1993 Money Laundering Regulations, came
into force in April this year. As well as applying to financial
institutions, the regulations cover professions such as solicitors, to the
extent that they can, on 'investment business' (as defined). Solicitors now
have to introduce and maintain time-consuming administrative procedures,
including obtaining identity evidence of new clients, training employees in
the law of and how to detect money-laundering and appointing a
'money-laundering officer'.
This is in contrast with the way the directive has been brought into force
in other member states. In some of them, no legislation has yet been
enacted. In other member states, including France and Germany, legislation
has been brought into force but it is nowhere near as rigorous as the UK
regulations. In neither of those countries is the legal profession subject
to the full rigours of the directive - in Germany only to the extent that
lawyers receive cash payments over a certain amount and in France not at
all.
I believe, therefore, that the bankers' fears could prove to be well
founded.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Project highlights dearth of start-up
finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WARREN S LISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Finance sought for driverless bus network' (November 2),
highlights the problem of the 'start-up gap' faced by many entrepreneurs
involved in large projects. Companies and banks are reluctant to face the
risks inherent in providing the often quite modest front-end finance needed
to validate and establish projects to a level that encourages them to
provide backing and then construction finance.
The response, 'I'll put in money if someone else will first', is all too
familiar to those seeking start-up finance.
Central government has shown a commendable change of emphasis in looking for
ways other than building yet more roads to reduce traffic congestion and
environmental pollution, and has shown a desire to encourage the private
sector to finance large infrastructure projects.
So far, central government funds have been fed in large chunks to just a
handful of city transit schemes - and good luck to them. However, the money
needed to bridge the start-up gaps facing many transit scheme promoters is
often very modest - less than 2 per cent of a project's total cost - but the
potential rewards are great.
Central government should should spread the limited resources more widely
and provide much lower levels of funding to many more projects. It is time
the government risked a little to gain a lot.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your travel writer, Kate Bevan, tells us in her article 'A sharp eye on
the clouds' (November 5/6) that Santa Barbara is 'blessed with a wonderful
beach'.
Our experience in July 1992 left my family rather less ecstatic. The beach
was dirty, the sea smelt of ammonia (perhaps as a result of the oil derricks
dotted across the horizon) and the only other sun-worshippers were a handful
of winos slumped under the trees. While my husband and son braved the
hazards for a short dip, my daughter and I were not prepared to take the
risk.

Sir, The photograph of Jacques Santer, the EC president, and his

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Passion from Cole - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That Stephanie Cole is a superb actress should be news to no-one. True,
there are moments during A Passionate Woman, Kay Mellor's new comedy, when
it surprises us that she is quite so good at bringing to life Betty
Derbyshire (nee Wilson). Betty, the menopausal Yorkshire wife of Donald and
doting mother of Mark, is so affected by the prospect of losing her only son
on his wedding day that she retires to the attic, where she is visited by
the ghost of Craze, her one true love. To make such a character funny is one
thing; to make her touching is something else. But Cole succeeds in both,
and she also prepares us, stroke by subtle stroke, for the Romantic heroism
which Betty finally attains.
After the attic, Betty takes to the roof; and then . . . Mellor has
constructed her play so deftly that we cannot guess what Betty will do.
Still, as the play does end, we may recall how far Mellor, in only two
hours, has brought Betty since the start - when she climbed up into the
attic and announced to us 'I've been to the new Asda.' What's more, it turns
out her chat about Asda was not irrelevant, for in Act Two she tells her
husband of the moment, in Asda, that she stopped her in her tracks - when
she saw her hand, unrecognisably aged, and yet recognisable because it bore
her wedding-ring.
This terrain has already been charted by Alan Ayckbourn. In A Woman in Mind,
Ayckbourn showed a middle-aged woman who similarly withdraws from her
household, moving not to the attic but to the garden. She too is haunted by
spectral figures. A Woman in Mind is a more daring playthan A Passionate
Woman, which at times is rather more light than its subject. Yet this does
not make Betty the less realBetty's pain in relinquishing her son - or
rather, in Act One, her refusal to consider the matter - is acute; and more
acute is the way she retreats to the one brief time in her life when she
discovered her passionate inner self.
Most acute of all is the way that Betty's mind keeps flickering between one
subject and another. Cole's timing is such that she can make us laugh at
lines that hardly seem funny in themselves, and can turn a more obviously
'funny' line ('I have to be careful with cheese, because it tends to put on
weight with me') into something cherishable.
Neil Morrissey (as son Mark), Alfred Lynch (as husband Donald), and James
Gaddas (as bien-aime Craze) all make fine contributions. Patrick Connellan's
two-sided house-top set is splendid. Ned Sherrin directs. The pacing, and
comic/poignant fluctuations of tone, are remarkably finely tuned. At two or
three moments (no more) I thought that a line had been wrongly weighted -
but in each case, I later discovered that the weighting of the line had in
fact prepared me for the way the play was to develop.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Encore for quartet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encores at string quartet concerts are not routine - they really mean the
audience wants them. On Saturday evening, the Vellinger String Quartet might
have chosen something a little less respectable and sober-minded than the
Adagio of Haydn's Opus 71 number two. Still, something restful was in order
after the storms of Elgar's Quartet.
The Vellinger was only formed in 1991 and in three years it has made a very
strong impression. It has recently released its first CD, which is entirely
of Elgar's music, and earlier this year won first prize at the London
International String Quartet Competition. It was well deserved, for among
the abundance of excellent British quartets at the moment, the Vellinger is
hardly bettered.
Its Wigmore programme on Saturday was an interesting choice - Bartok's Fifth
Quartet was followed by Schubert's A minor Quartet, then Elgar after the
interval. None of these works is really a rarity, yet none is exactly
popular either. The unusual feature was the order, with the biggest
challenge for the audience first and the easiest listen - though Schubert's
work is far from lightweight - in the middle.
Hans Keller used to be patronising about quartets written by composers who
were not string players, yet many of the great string quartets since
Schubert's are by composers who were primarily pianists. Nobody has been
more enterprising in the medium than Bartok, and his Fifth Quartet avoids
many of the obvious qualities an 'outsider' might settle on string
instruments in favour of sonorities which, however daring, even explosive,
strings alone can make. It is hard to imagine this almost tuneless though
hugely expressive work given with more sharply focused passion or attention
to colour. The Vellinger's ensemble and balance were immaculate, the rhythms
as tight as a steel spring.
Schubert's Quartet in A minor is pervaded by a mysteriously veiled sadness
which was enhanced by the Vellinger's precise restraint, though it was fiery
enough when appropriate in the middle of the second movement. The players
took the opening movement quite steadily, more mindful than is necessary,
perhaps, of the 'ma non troppo' that Schubert added after 'Allegro'.
The first violinist began the plaintive first theme almost without vibrato,
then warmed later on - a lovely touch, and typical of those players'
discriminating sense of detail. And unlike quite a few quartets, the
Vellinger boasts a marvellously energetic viola-player, who brings as much
attack and flexibility to his part as a violinist.
If Elgar's Quartet seemed rather disappointing, it was probably not the
fault of the players. There is a magical passage in the slow movement, when
three instruments wind down gently over a cello pedal before the restatement
of the theme; but the theme itself might have been penned by one of Elgar's
pale tors. Still, there was tremendous drive in the performance, as well as
tender affection for the music's moments of faded melancholy.

The 'Ooh isn't it ghastly show me more' school of journalism seems to be
steadily taking over BBC1. Today's Natural Neighbours is all about spiders
and why they frighten so many people. It is almost impossible to read the
description of the programme without hearing the voice of Vincent Price: 'As
night falls, spiders in and around the house start their predatory
wanderings ..' (8.30). You have to hand it to the people who run Channel 4's
culture series Without Walls: they really do attack sacred cows. Yet even
they have surely never taken aim at anything quite as sacrosanct as
tonight's target - Mother Theresa of Calcutta. In a programme produced by
Tariq Ali, journalist Christopher Hitchens argues that the supposed saint is
actually a demagogue and a servant of earthly powers (9.00). The second part
offers a dramatisation of the last days of rock singer Janis Joplin (9.30).
Like most half-way-competent British films these days, Peter's Friends was
over praised when released in 1992. It is a comedy of manners about six
friends who meet again 10 years after leaving university (10.00 C4).

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Furtive families and flurries of activity - William
Packer visits the Saatchi gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extraordinary mass of contemporary art that Charles Saatchi has acquired
over the past 20 years seems less a collection than an accumulation: for if
Mr Saatchi sees a show by an artist who interests him, from Andy Warhol to
Damien Hirst, he is inclined to buy the lot.
As we enter that astonishing warehouse space in Boundary Road, we know that
whoever the artists are, we are going to see them represented in
considerable strength. And if at times our expectations are all too
depressingly confirmed, the surprise at others may be both real and
rewarding. The present exhibition, of three British painters in mature
career, makes the case in point.
Paula Rego is the star of the show and commands the first, largest and most
daunting of the galleries. She carries this great space, so it seems,
effortlessly. This is no retrospective, for the collection has nothing even
of the early 1980s, when, from a more generalised imagery of fantastical and
monstrous figures, the work was shifting towards particular narratives with
characters no less monstrous, yet disconcertingly human. What we have are
those narratives as they have been fully and splendidly established since
the later 1980s, with their darkly ambiguous tales of remembered childhood
and adolescence, fraught with burgeoning sexuality, fearful, secret and
excited.
Little girls, Miss Rego reminds us, are not all sugar and spice and all
things nice. Not by chance has she emerged as one of the great modern
illustrators of fairy tales, gleefully unsqueamish in her reading of them.
The Old Woman thrashes bottoms with a will; heads come off; tails come off,
with a carving knife.
Hitherto, her actual painting has been more effective than precious, with a
dry, gouache-like use of acrylic paint on paper that sometimes appears
cruder and more uninflected than in fact it is. In her latest work, however,
represented here by a single large pastel, she has returned directly to the
model and to a method that is much richer and denser on the surface. These
are her Dog Women, to be shown at Marlborough Fine Art later in the month.
John Murphy, who fills the two farther galleries, is represented only by
work of the early 1980s and particularly by an extended suite of 12 panels
that purport to engage with the infinities of space. The black pigment that
supplies the field of heaven is laid on thick like butter, and then inlaid
with white dots that might or might not be constellations. They serve, as do
the specks of resin-dust in aquatint, paradoxically to intensify the optical
sensation of the black. But do they also carry the symbolic charge of the
image they adopt? The portentous clues engraved on their frames, 'The Empty
Night of Error', 'The Long Night of Anxiety', 'The Paradox of the Void' and
so on, suggest that Murphy, too, feels they do not.
Five large paintings by Avis Newman have the side gallery to themselves, and
again they date from the early 1980s. They are curious and at first
unprepossessing, pinned unstretched to the wall, and discursive and
wandering in the marks they carry - a flurry of activity here, some broader
sweeps there, and blots, splodges and accretions anywhere. Is there a hint
at an encompassing image, the profile of a reclining figure perhaps, or a
distant and vestigial landscape? Or are we looking down on a map, or the
earth from an aeroplane, or a battlefield? These flurries of activity could
well be skirmishes.
But it is for us to make of them what we will. These are paintings, like
Chinese landscapes or classical friezes, or the great mural schemes of the
Renaissance, that draw us into themselves by their detail, that the detail
may comprehend the whole. As we look, the roughness and informality fall
away for the illusions they are. The surfaces declare themselves in all
their abstract refinement, paint and mark and line so delicately and
exquisitely worked. Her work is the great surprise and pleasure of the show.
Paula Rego, John Murphy and Avis Newman: Saatchi Gallery, 98a Boundary Road
NW8, until February: Thursday to Saturday 12-6pm.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: The Ugly Man - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brad Fraser is currently as hot as pepperoni, with plays like Unidentified
Human Remains and Poor Superman creating a buzz with both critics and
audiences. This young Canadian writer deftly mixes at-the-edge scenarios
involving gay sex, nudity, violence and betrayal, with cool insouciant
dialogue and a dry wit. The Ugly Man, enjoying its London premiere at the
Battersea Arts Centre, is minor Fraser, but still well worth a detour down
Lavender Hill.
Fraser had the bright idea of taking his plot from one of the most gory of
Jacobean melodramas, Middleton's The Changeling, and then encouraging his
contemporary characters, who talk with the direct simplicity of comic strip
balloons, and inhabit scenes as short and pointed as those in an Australian
soap opera, to run riot.
The Co-Active Theatre Company has decided to locate the play in the equally
decadent society of the southern states, or rather the fantasy South of
Tennessee Williams, where every closet is crammed with skeletons and inside
every virgin is a desperate whore. The result is a theatrical Twin Peaks,
scary yet funny, grotesque yet childlike.
By some miracle the cast of CAT Factory deliver it straight, with not a
trace of a nudge or a wink. Martin McDougall as Leslie, who plays a
physically and mentally abused gay with a hair-lip, manages to speak the
line 'He's twice the man you'll ever be' with a quivering conviction that
touches the soul.
The 'man' concerned is the servant Forest, the scarred stranger, the Ugly
Man, whose murderous, rapacious, undeviating villainy is motivated not by
aimless violence but by revenge. This is the key role and Martin Malone
exactly captures the physical stillness hiding a barely controlled menace.
Forest is impelled towards evil; for Veronica, (Stephanie Prince), the young
virgin bride, evil is a drug. She quickly progresses from twisting her
doomed mother Sabina (Louise Plowright) round her finger, to manipulating
men: her naive fiance; her calculating lover; the besotted Forest, who will
kill for a kiss.
Such Grand Guignol needs a realistic setting. Director Michael D'Cruze has
located the action in Arizona for no obvious reason, but designer James
Hendy has come up with an impressive barn like set, dominated by a giant
wheel, handy for grinding out justice slow. The power of the production
tells in the little touches, like Veronica's white dress streaked scarlet,
unmentioned by the others, but shrieking testimony that she has sold her
soul to the Devil.
The climax cuts across the controlled playing - it is easier to accept a
body strewn stage when the characters are decked out as 16th century
Spaniards - but The Ugly Man does nothing to dispel the belief that Fraser
is one of the most exciting writers working in North America.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Sibelius' Shakespeare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1925, when he was 60, Sibelius composed some substantial scene-music for
The Tempest. It was one of his last scores before his legendary tight-lipped
silence, coming just after the Seventh Symphony and before Tapiola. You
might expect the autumnal quality of late Sibelius to be apt for
Shakespeare's last play, and so it is; but he interpreted his theatrical
brief rather modestly, never pretending to fill out a conspectus of the
whole piece. The metaphysical depths of The Tempest lie wholly in its
language, and Sibelius was not writing an opera.
At the Barbican on Saturday, Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony gave us
a glowing account of the complete music. Hard to resist the familiar sense
that native players (Sibelius was after all a Swedish Finn) can play such
stuff, folk-based as it mostly is, with a radiant simplicity that nobody
else can match] Richard Williams contrived to put everything properly in
context with a team of ten actors, headed by Alec McCowen's Prospero,
declaiming just enough of the play to let us know where we were from number
to number. Some 34 of them, all told - though the whole performance lasted
little more than 90 minutes.
It was good to hear, but one felt no great need to hear it all ever again.
Evidently the masque-side of The Tempest was to be emphasised; generous time
is allotted to the formal dances, entries and retreats, which are graciously
folksy. The actual masque-within-the-play, however, must have been trimmed:
we got only a splash of Iris's rainbow, a brightly urgent aria from Juno
(Susan Gritton) and two perfunctory dances.
Elsewhere, Sibelius exploited the simple theatrical possibilities of the
whole-tone scale, the augmented triad and the diminished-7th chord - none of
them new in 1925, but rediscovered here with uncomplicated enthusiasm. In
the solo songs for Ariel and Caliban (sometimes with chorus, and much more
ingeniously wrought) Monica Groop spun an opulent, penetrating line, and
Alan Opie displayed ripe comic character. Above all there were two
extraordinary numbers: the Overture, in which a monstrous, eerily oppressive
storm pre-echoes Tapiola with lashings of furious rain instead of a dry
blizzard, and a jaggedly eloquent paragraph or two of baffled anguish for
Prospero toward the end.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Arts: Odessa and Jansons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the world-class stature of the showcase orchestras of Moscow and
Leningrad, musical life in the former USSR was more-or-less a closed book to
western eyes and ears. Following the emancipation of the ex-Soviet
republics, the first visit to the UK of the Ukraine's Odessa Philharmonic
Orchestra, which reached the Barbican Centre in London on Friday, gave us a
taste of just how musical life was faring in one of the more far-flung
regions of the former Soviet empire.
If the recent history of the Odessa Philharmonic is typical, then provincial
orchestras face a difficult but by no means insurmountable challenge. Four
years ago its future appeared far from rosy, with regular defections of
members of the west, an acute shortage of musical instruments and dwindling
audiences. But since the appointment of the extrovert young American
conductor, Hobart Earle, as its music director four years ago, its fortunes
have changed rapidly and, whilst still beset with financial worries, morale
is increasing and its repertoire expanding (though not always in the right
direction, it seems, if the hollow rhetoric of Miroslav Skoryk's Carpathian
Concerto - a folksy-realist throwback to pre-glasnost days - is typical),
and the prospect of a new Dollars 30m concert hall is a not unrealisable
possibility.
Inevitably the orchestra's sound is less polished than that of its more
illustrious western counterparts. Ensemble is less than precisely
coordinated, balance between the various sections is often sacrificed to
sheer high spirits, and Earle's conducting is efficient rather than
illuminating. Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto (with Arnoldo Cohen a
solid, unimaginative soloist) was a mundane affair, lacking in poetry and
glitter and starved of the opulent string sound it needs. Ironically, it was
the standard Austro-German repertoire that found the orchestra at its best;
a Brahms Second Symphony of white-hot intensity, tensile strength and
unflagging sense of purpose.
The history of the Odessa Philharmonic shows just how easily we take our own
orchestras' expertise for granted, but there was nothing routine about the
London Philharmonic's concert at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday evening:
what seemed on paper standard early-20th-century fare - Debussy's Nocturnes,
Ravel's G major Piano Concerto and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring - became an
absorbing journey of renewal as its principal guest conductor Mariss Jansons
galvanised his players into a sense of occasion and rediscovery.
Jansons is an out-and-out romantic, but only occasionally, as in his rather
Tchaikovskian way with climaxes, did this jar with the cooler aesthetic of
the three works on offer. The Debussy was no vacuous, impressionistic haze
and the Rite became once again a frighteningly purgative experience,
celebratory and cathartic. The Ravel Concerto, too, often such a slight
work, took on real substance, not least because Pascal Roge (replacing
Krystian Zimerman) never allowed his wide experience of the work to lead him
into complacency: though a touch restricted in colour in the first movement
perhaps, he mesmerised in the slow movement, spinning out its extended
cantilena with a sense of wonder, both surprising and inevitable.

FT  08 NOV 94 / People: Green-Armytage's transition to textiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Rothschild's Jock Green-Armytage (right), 49, who is to take over as
chief executive of textile makers William Baird at the start of next year,
is one of those merchant bankers who has always fancied running a proper
business but has had some difficulty making a permanent transition from City
life.
Canadian-born Green-Armytage describes his new job as 'an irresistible
challenge'. He takes over from Donald Parr, 64, who has been Baird's chief
executive since 1976 and will remain on the board as non-executive chairman.
Green-Armytage has been a director for a couple of years and first got to
know the textile industry when he was helping bring some of Rothschild's
textile clients to the stock market in the 1970s.
Although Baird has never cut its dividend, has survived the recession better
than many textile companies, and has no gearing, there has been a feeling in
the City that there was a need for some 'fresh blood' at the top.
The company suffers from low margins on its Pounds 500m turnover and a lot
of top management time has been involved in trying to dispose of the group's
non-core Darchem engineering and contracting activities.
Donald Parr says his company has gone outside for his replacement because
the textile industry was 'not a tremendous pool to fish in'.
Green-Armytage joined Rothschild's corporate finance department in 1970 and
left in 1981 to be managing director of Guthrie Corporation, an
international industrial holding company which had been bought by the
Malaysian government. He increased its profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds
22m and led Guthrie back to the UK stock market in 1986.
However, Guthrie was soon swallowed by BBA Group and Green-Armytage did not
have quite the same impact in his next job - helping sort out Kelt Energy,
the highly indebted energy producer.
In little more than a year he had quit and returned to Rothschild where he
has been helping reorganise the management of the asset management area.

The Institute of Taxation, which has grown rapidly in recent years and now
has 10,000 members, has appointed Robert Dommett 48, as its first ever
secretary-general.
Dommett, who was chief executive of the Surrey Building Society which merged
with Northern Rock in 1993, takes on the new upgraded post after the
retirement of Ronald Ison, secretary, next February.
The IoT appointment comes at a time when the institute is seeking a higher
profile and has become increasingly critical of the quality and quantity of
new tax law and the efficiency of its implementation.
Dommett, who rose through the ranks of the Chartered Building Society to
become deputy chief executive, is a fellow of the institute of bankers and
the chartered institute of secretaries and administrators. He will be taking
up his new role at a time when leading members of the IoT, which deals with
all aspects of direct and indirect taxation, are repeating calls for the
government to simplify the entire UK tax system.
Dommett would appear to have the stamina necessary for such a task. His
hobby is marathon running; he has so far completed 11 - six in London alone
and three in New York.

The popular science fiction author Stanislaw Lem wrote a short comic story
about an intergalactic pirate who is obsessed with adding to his store of
information. Pirate Pugg kidnaps space travellers and forces them to tell
him everything they know. He is finally defeated by a contraption that spews
out all kinds of detailed but unimportant information such as how many sizes
of bedroom slippers are available on the continent of Cob.
Pirate Pugg is unable to tear himself away from the growing mountain of
information in case he comes across the answer to the 'Ultimate Mystery of
Being'.
Sometimes when I'm roaming the Internet, I feel like Pirate Pugg. There is
an incredible amount of information available through the Internet but
finding something useful is a frustrating experience.
The Internet allows you to access information on tens of millions of
computers worldwide, and brings the prospect of a global repository of
knowledge, mostly free. Users, or surfers as they like to be called, can
access huge amounts of information. There are hundreds of millions of
plain-text articles accessible on a huge variety of topics.
Newsletters and magazines of various kinds are proliferating on the Internet
since it is the cheapest way to publish. There are no printing costs, and
almost no mailing costs. The beauty of digital technology is that the
digital text can be duplicated virtually for nothing.
While putting information out on to the Internet is easy, the problem is
finding the right piece of information when you need it. And here is where
we need new technologies to help us sift huge amounts of information.
Strictly speaking, we should not call it information until we have processed
it ourselves. Until it informs us about something we were looking for.
Everything on the Internet should be considered as data of one kind or
another - it becomes information when we have turned that data into a useful
form.
But finding a specific piece of data can be a mammoth chore. Formulating a
vaguely phrased search can return an enormous amount of leads. Such searches
are normally based on the presence of specific key words in millions of
documents.
Sending out a more detailed search request narrows the choices but here is
where the problem lies. Often, a narrow search will non find a relevant and
possibly more useful document because it does not contain the keywords or
contains them in a low number.
What is needed are specific tools that can carry out searches with a certain
amount of artificial intelligence - an approach that takes into account the
less focused aspects of conducting searches. Such tools are the key to
unlocking the potential of the Internet.
While many Internet enthusiasts champion the egalitarian culture of the
Internet, where many people throw information into a collective repository
without concern for payment, there is as yet little evidence to show how
useful it is to have access to this huge pool of information.
For example, when Gutenberg invented the printing press, it helped generate
an information explosion since books could be produced more quickly and more
cheaply than ever before.
This resulted in the flowering of the Renaissance and the rediscovery of
ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic texts that led to establishing modern
science and accelerated the move away from feudal societies.
Will the Internet and future information superhighways result in a similar
impact on society? Or are we already in information overload and unable to
effectively process the information we have access to?
My suspicion is that the latter is true. Many of us seek and hoard
information like Lem's Pirate Pugg but we are often unable to fully make use
of it in a meaningful way.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Technology: The future is crystal clear - Growing
international competition to capture a share of the LCD market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When an earthquake hits Sharp's liquid crystal display plant at Tenri in
Japan, its manufacturing operations automatically shut down. Otherwise, this
stark, pristine factory - where the automatic guided vehicles are more
evident than people and the air is a million times cleaner than the outside
world - works round the clock, turning out 120,000 displays a month.
The plant is one of the most sophisticated in the liquid crystal display
industry, which is becoming larger and more innovative each year. The thin
profile, light weight and moderate power consumption of LCDs make them a
vital component in everything from laptop computers to control-panel
displays in jet aircraft.
Growing demand for LCD screens is creating intense international competition
for a share of the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.3bn) world market. At present,
Japanese manufacturers, led by Sharp - which claims a 45 per cent market
share - have a virtual monopoly of the market.
Japan's dominance of this technology has spurred the US government into
taking one of its boldest industrial policy initiatives for many years. In
April, the Clinton administration announced a plan to provide about Dollars
700m for the development and manufacture of flat panel displays in an
attempt to wrest market share away from the Japanese producers.
The Japanese manufacturers, however, are spending heavily in an attempt to
preserve their lead. Sharp, for instance, is spending Y120bn (Pounds 759m)
on LCD plant and equipment in the three years to 1995; it is building the
world's largest LCD plant in Taki-cho, between Osaka and Nagoya at a cost of
Y53bn.
The company's involvement in the LCD market goes back to the early 1970s.
That was a few years after the discovery by RCA, the US broadcasting
company, that liquid crystals - substances that behave optically as a
crystal and mechanically as a liquid - could be made to realign so they
transmitted light when subjected to an electric charge.
The finding was quickly exploited in cheap watches and calculators. But the
poor quality of the early LCDs, which had weak contrast and a narrow viewing
angle, made them unsuitable for displays larger than a watch face.
Over time, LCDs went through a number of enhancements. A sharper contrast
was produced, for example, by the introduction of supertwisted nematic LCDs.
Another important breakthrough came when passive-matrix LCDs were superseded
by active-matrix LCDs, in which individual transistors turn each element in
the display on and off. The full colour and high contrast of these displays
allowed them to be incorporated in miniature colour televisions.
Sharp's position in the flat panel display market was reinforced in 1986,
when it decided to redouble its research efforts in LCDs. The sharp increase
in the value of the yen in 1986 convinced the company it had to shift more
of its products from labour-intensive to knowledge-intensive products. Haruo
Tsuji, the newly-appointed president, was looking for another mainstay
besides semiconductors. 'We decided to devote particular efforts to LCDs,'
he says. 'I felt keenly there was a need for a successor to cathode ray
tubes.'
Sharp and its rivals have put immense effort into trying to increase the
size of the displays. In 1988, it presented the first display that measured
14 in across the diagonal. It has recently created a new record by producing
a prototype of a 21 in screen.
Building large displays poses formidable problems. A display is made up of
hundreds of thousands of individual pixels, or dots, each of which must be
controlled by a tiny transistor. The importance of avoiding even a single
flawed pixel requires extraordinary precision on the part of manufacturers,
even by the exacting standards of the electronics industry.
As screens become larger, manufacturers also face greater problems in
fabricating the thin film transistors uniformly, distributing the liquid
crystal material evenly and resolving timing problems in the signals.
Research is continuing into producing higher quality images, thinner
profiles and lower power consumption of the displays. At the same time, the
manufacturers are trying to improve manufacturing yields and reduce costs.
A potential threat for manufacturers is that competition will drive down
prices. Competition is intensifying, particularly as Korean manufacturers,
such as Samsung, Hyundai and Lucky Goldstar, move into the market.
But Tsuji believes that demand for LCDs is growing at a pace sufficient to
outstrip supply. His judgment is backed by Koichiro Chiwata, electronics
analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, who believes that supply and demand
for LCDs will remain tight enough for Sharp's LCD business to 'do well for
at least the next five years'.
At present, two-thirds of the LCD market is used for notebook computers; the
second most important application is for display screens in Pachinko
parlours, amusement arcades where a Japanese version of pinball is played.
But other uses such as wall-mounted television, video projectors, navigation
systems, portable game machines and personal information tools, are expected
to expand the market.
Sharp is devoting particular research effort to developing new products that
include LCD screens. One example is the Viewcam, a camcorder with an LCD
monitor instead of a traditional viewfinder, which it introduced in 1992.
Although most LCD-based products currently make use of the 'shutter
function' of liquid crystals, new applications could stem from their other
properties, such as their ability to react to light and to store
information. These qualities have already been put to use in the development
of a pen-based word processor, which senses the movement of a pen on the
screen.
Sharp believes the market will grow to Dollars 20bn by the end of the
century. 'I consider the field of LCD is really immense and extensive,' says
Tsuji.
Another possible threat to Sharp's dominant position in the market is that
LCDs will be superseded by another technology. The technical difficulty of
building large LCD displays at an acceptable price has prompted some
companies to work on other technologies. For example, plasma displays, in
which images are created from gas-filled tubes, are considered to be a
leading contender in the race to create a market for flat, wall-mounted
television screens.
A number of technologists are backing ferroelectric displays, a form of LCD
technology that does not require transistors to switch the liquid crystal
cells, as a cost-effective approach to building large display screens.
Electroluminescent displays, which depend on an electron exciting a phosphor
in a thin film, are also receiving close attention.
A number of international companies are devoting particular attention to
field emission displays, which resemble an array of tiny cathode ray tubes.
Although it is still relatively immature technology, its backers believe it
could score over LCDs because it would be relatively cheap to produce.
Sharp, too, is working on the next generation of display technologies. But
for the present, it believes the supremacy of LCDs is assured. 'In five,
seven, 10 years from now, LCD will be the main type of product (in flat
panel displays),' says Atsushi Asada, senior executive vice-president.
Sharp's continued lead in LCDs cannot be guaranteed, but its strong
performance in the sector has stood it in good stead at a time when Japanese
manufacturers are suffering the effects of the high yen and consumers' jaded
appetite for electronic gadgets.
Sharp acknowledges it cannot be complacent. The rise in the value of the yen
costs Y3bn in profit for every point gained against the dollar. According to
Taizo Katsura, senior executive vice-president, it is crucial the company
continues to develop high-value components. 'As a manufacturer we cannot be
competitive by depending on the assembly side,' he says.
It will also need to maintain its edge in research. Technological innovation
is crucial if the company is to devise the next generation of products that
will open up new markets, says Tsuji. 'We have to develop key technologies.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Turk granted more time in Germany -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Turkish national living in Germany was entitled to an extension of a
temporary residence permit, because it would enable her to take up a job
offer, the European Court of Justice has ruled.
Mrs Eroglu, a Turkish student, arrived in Germany in 1980 to follow a
business administration course. Her father had been living and working quite
lawfully in Germany since 1976. In 1987, she completed the course
successfully and began to study for a doctorate. During these years, she had
been granted temporary residence permits all limited to one year and marked
valid only for the purposes of study.
In 1989, she was granted a conditional residence authorisation allowing her
to carry out specific work for a specified company. This authorisation was
given until 1992 and was varied in 1991 to allow her to work for another
company. She also had the necessary work permits.
In 1992, she applied for an extension of her residence permit to allow her
to continue working for her last employer. Her application and subsequent
appeal were turned down. She then brought proceedings before the Karlsruhe
Administrative Court. In the meantime, she had been offered a job by her
first employer. In court, Mrs Eroglu claimed she had the right of residence
in Germany by virtue of two provisions contained in a decision made pursuant
to the Association Agreement between the then EEC and Turkey.
The first provision of the decision gave a Turkish worker, duly registered
as belonging to the labour force of a member state, the right to the renewal
of a work permit after one year's employment with that employer.
The second provision allowed children of Turkish workers who had completed a
course of vocational training in the relevant member state to respond to any
offer of employment there, irrespective of how long they had been resident
there, provided that one of their parents had been legally employed in that
member state for at least three years.
The German court held that although the refusal to renew the residence
permit was lawful under German law, the position was not clear with regard
to EC law. It referred the issue to the ECJ.
The ECJ held as a general point that the relevant decision within which this
provision was contained did not encroach on the power of member states to
regulate both the entry into their territory of Turkish nationals and the
conditions of their first employment. Rather, insofar as the first provision
was concerned, it made provision exclusively for Turkish workers already
registered as belonging to the EU labour force. The Court said the aim of
the first provision was solely to ensure continuity of employment with the
same employer after an initial period of one year.
In the present case, Mrs Eroglu had changed employers but was seeking a work
permit extension to allow her to work for her first employer. The Court said
the relevant provision did not entitle a person in such a position to the
renewal of a work permit.
As to the second provision, the Court stated that the right to residence was
essential to access to, and pursuit of, any paid employment, whether for the
same employer in connection with renewal of a work permit, or for another
employer. It was clear therefore that the right conferred on a person by the
second provision implied the recognition of a right of residence for that
person.
The German government's argument that the right under the second provision
was subject to conditions concerning the grounds on which a right to enter
and to stay in a member state was granted, was not upheld by the Court. The
fact that the right was not given with a view to reuniting a family, but
rather, was for the purposes of study, did not therefore deprive the child
of a Turkish worker from enjoying the rights conferred by the provision in
question.
The Court said therefore that a Turkish national who satisfied the
conditions in the second provision could rely on that provision to obtain a
residence permit extension.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Goodbyes are still golden - Investor
value is not always reflected in directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 18 months since Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive,
wrote to the chairmen of FTSE-100 companies informing them that in future he
was 'minded' to vote against three-year rolling contracts for directors,
life for Britain's bosses seems to have changed little.
His concern was not that executives were receiving excessive rewards for
doing a good job, but that long rolling contracts were allowing executives
to walk away with huge pay-offs often when they had failed to come up to
scratch.
As head of the UK's largest pension fund, which owns 1.5 per cent of the
stock market by value, his views ought to carry some weight in British
boardrooms, and indeed, some progress has been made.
Mr Ross Goobey says three-year rolling contracts are now in a minority in
FTSE-100 companies. But wider recent research by Bacon Woodrow suggests they
are not yet a thing of the past. Bacon Woodrow found that of 954 directors
questioned, 39 per cent were on rolling contracts of three years or more.
The large pay-offs which result from these three-year rolling contracts  -
which at any time are assumed to have three years to run before expiry -
also show no signs of abating. In the year to June, so-called 'golden
goodbyes' topped Pounds 20m. The Pounds 4m paid to four former Tiphook
directors and the Pounds 2.02m package for Mr Peter Davis, former
co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publisher, are recent
examples.
These pay-offs add to public concern about executive pay in general, which
although rising at the lowest rate of increase for five years, is still
outstripping the level of wage rises for the workforce as a whole.
According to a study published last week by the Monks partnership, an
independent remuneration adviser, the highest paid directors in British
companies with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 400m, received median
increases of 9 per cent last year, three times that of the workforce. The
study also showed that the number of UK companies that pay their highest
earning executive more than Pounds 1m has doubled over the past 12 months to
16. Only executives in Germany, Italy and the US are ahead of the UK's top
earners in cash terms.
Head of the list of top earners was Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct
Line, Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance subsidiary, with a total
remuneration package worth Pounds 18.4m, way ahead of Mr Bob Bauman, former
SmithKline Beecham chief executive on Pounds 1.89m.
An increasing percentage of these huge remuneration packages is made up of
performance-related bonus payments. According to the Monks' study, bonus
payments account for an average 18 per cent of total remuneration and
contribute 15 per cent to the remuneration of the best paid directors.
But research by Datastream suggests there are some large disparities between
pay rises for executives and returns for shareholders.
This is backed up by a recently published study by American pay expert
Professor Graef Crystal. Prof Crystal compared total remuneration packages
of the top directors of the FTSE-100 companies with the total return to
shareholders of their companies and concluded many British bosses are
'overpaid'.
Great emphasis was placed by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance
on the role of the company 'remuneration committee' in curbing excesses in
boardroom pay. Composed of non-executive directors, remuneration committees,
whose role is to set remuneration for companies' executives, were seen as
the vehicle to ensure a better match between executive pay and shareholder
value.
Most UK public companies now have them, but there is growing acceptance that
they are still not functioning as they should. A follow-up to Cadbury is
promised for 1995, but many lawyers believe action is needed now.
Ms Denise Kingsmill, a specialist employment lawyer who counts Mr Peter Wood
of Direct Line, Cyril Stein, former Ladbroke chief, and George Walker,
former head of Brent Walker, among her clients, says a 'Cadbury 2'
concentrating on the role and powers of remuneration committees is overdue.
The big question mark over remuneration committees is their independence,
she says. They are made up of non-executives, but non-executives who tend to
be executives elsewhere, and as such they have an interest in keeping the
general level of executive salaries up.
Ms Kingsmill also believes it is time for a wider look at the role of
non-executives, and in particular at the way they are appointed. In spite of
placement companies, such as Proned, being a 'chum of the chairman' remains
the main route to a non-executive appointment.
Part of the reason many non-executives do not perform as shareholders would
hope, is because they are not properly remunerated, she believes. 'You don't
want a situation where they are paid so much that their independence is
compromised by their financial dependence on the company. But they must be
properly remunerated,' she says.
But how much is enough? The average is Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000 for about
10 days work a year. But that is neither enough money nor enough time, says
Ms Kingsmill. There are papers to read before meetings and good
non-executives need to get to know the business and stay abreast of
developments.
These responsibilities require proper remuneration, but non-executives
should not get pension arrangements or share options. They should, however,
be encouraged to buy shares to cement their relationship with the business.
There is also a need to widen the range of non-executives, she says. Most
companies only have one non-executive from an alternative background and if
they can double up by making the alternative a woman, so much the better.
Cadbury 2 could clarify the role of remuneration committees and
non-executives, but what criteria should remuneration committees follow in
setting executive pay to ensure a better match between remuneration and
shareholder value?
At the moment there is too much emphasis on what executives are paid rather
than how and why, Ms Kingsmill says. They need to distinguish between
come-to-work pay, set by the market place, performance-related pay, received
if goals are met, and profit-related pay. 'If you get the balance right,
you're on your way to ensuring directors don't get remunerated in
circumstances where the company is not giving shareholder value,' she says.
Ms Kingsmill says companies want to attract the best so they have to give
directors a certain level of pay and security. But this can be achieved
without long, rolling contracts. She wants an initial three-year fixed-term
contract, providing security and time for an executive to set objectives and
act on them, and then a one-year rolling contract. A one-year rolling
contract allows an executive time to find another job, she says, and
companies will not enrage shareholders by paying out huge sums.
But even if a Cadbury 2 clarifies the role of non-executives in curbing
excessive pay, getting companies to act on it is another matter. Golden
goodbyes look set to be with us for some time yet.

and into the hands of labour. For us the core of management is precisely the
art of mobilising and pulling together the intellectual resources of all
employees in the service of the firm.
 -Konosuke Matsushita, late founder of the Japanese electronics company, in
1982.
A high-tech building that houses 70 product designers stands in a corner of
Leyland Trucks' Lancashire assembly complex in the north-west of England.
To Masaaki Imai, who has been introducing Japanese manufacturing techniques
outside Japan for more than two decades, the location of these designers is
a sign of real progress.
'Normally designers in the west think they are geniuses,' says Imai,
president of the Kaizen Institute, a European consultancy. 'They want to
have nothing to do with shop floor even though they are serving the shop
floor.'
To test how far Leyland Trucks has changed, the Financial Times asked Imai,
author of a book on Kaizen, or continuous improvement, to cast an eye over
Leyland Trucks.
A short step away from the designers' building, Imai examines the clearly
delineated passage alongside the production line. There are almost no
obstacles preventing free flow of workers and fork lift trucks. 'I'm
impressed by the housekeeping,' he says. 'Anything not in the right place
suggests systems are not there.'
Turning to a stack of components beside the line, Imai is more critical.
'You could cut work in progress to one half and see what opportunities it
throws up.'
Leyland Trucks has had a chequered history, emerging in 1993 as a management
buy-out from the receivers of Leyland Daf. Once a sizeable force in truck
manufacture, lack of investment in new products and increased competition
from Continental manufacturers cut Leyland Trucks' share of Europe's 5-15
tonne market to only 7.5 per cent.
But over the past five years Leyland Trucks has been introducing what it
calls 'lean enterprise', based on lean production methods that have spread
from companies such as Toyota and encompass total quality management, total
productive maintenance and just in time.
The management believes it has overturned the rigid hierarchies of
traditional mass production techniques that have dominated more than 90
years of truck manufacture at Leyland. In its place, lean enterprise has
involved the workforce in a quest for quality to a degree that would have
been unimagineable a decade ago.
Suppliers and even organisations such as the Lancashire Police Force tour
the plant each week to view what Leyland Trucks says is a striking
transformation.
The arrival at Leyland is both impressive and inauspicious. Following heavy
investment at the start of the 1980s, Leyland Trucks has one of the most
modern facilities in Europe. But it is big. A factory that can manufacture
18,000 trucks a year on single-shift working is producing only 8,500
vehicles. Lean production theory says dead space will be filled with
unnecessary inventory or will lead to movement of parts and people that adds
no value.
Imai believes the same production could be achieved in half the space, a
change that would force a reduction in inventory beside the production line
and a reassessment of relations with suppliers.
John Oliver, Leyland Trucks managing director, accepts the point. He is
trying to find contract assembly work for one of the two production lines.
If unsuccessful, however, he may close part of the plant.
Even with this expansive factory set-up, Oliver says the impact of lean
engineering has been dramatic. Leyland Trucks first stepped on to the
treadmill of a continuous improvement in 1989 with a programme of training
and production process changes that cost Pounds 100,000. Within two years
Oliver says the company measured savings of Pounds 10m  - repeatable each
year. Some came from reducing head count. But much of it was the result of
lower inventory and improved quality.
'That was a 24 per cent reduction in annual operating costs and it took our
break even from 11,500 trucks a year to 5,000,' says Oliver. But this
approach came only after a decade in which Leyland Trucks tried more
traditional ways to crank up quality. First there was investment in new
plant in the early 1980s, followed by introduction of Material Resources
Planning (MRP II). But after three years of a total quality programme
starting in 1985, quality and productivity improvements plateaued.
'We were stagnating,' says Oliver. 'There was resistance in the organisation
to more change - the people were exhausted. On top of that the market was
turning down.
'We had thought the Japanese success was because of high technology and the
people working very hard,' he says. 'But Matsushita was saying what mattered
was not a physical manifestation of commitment but the intellectual
resources of all the employees. We were asking these people to hang up their
brains when they came in to work.'
The company set about educating its workforce about lean production; why
Leyland Trucks needed to build to order, rather than for stock as its
European competitors do, and the crucial role of employees in the search for
improved quality.
Imai is full of praise for the management's commitment to involving the
workforce. But he feels management could set more targets. 'Too many western
managers think TQM means just letting the lower level people form a quality
group to come up with ideas,' says Imai. 'But management should always be
challenging the workforce by setting targets.'
Oliver believes this is what management is doing but admits that 'in the
early days we were confused between delegation and abdication of
responsibility' to the workforce.
The changes the workforce has accepted are considerable. As recently as
1989, there were 50 job demarcations at Leyland Trucks. Now there are only
six descriptions, allowing more flexible deployment of the workforce.
Perhaps the most fundamental change has been the introduction of Additional
Vacation Days, where overtime is now 'paid' in extra holidays which are
taken when there is slack demand. Before this system the workforce might
have been paid overtime one month only to be laid off (with pay) the next
because demand had slackened.
The union has now accepted a system that more closely matches the supply of
labour with the unpredictable demand of its customers.
'Nobody liked AVDs and they still don't,' says Steve Southworth, union
convener at Leyland Trucks. 'But they understand why it has to be done after
going through lean enterprise training. It saves the company money and when
you are building to order you have to do it.'
Having introduced the idea of lean production at Leyland Trucks, the company
is now focusing on a programme of 'supply chain optimisation' - spreading
the word about lean enterprise to its 800 suppliers.
There are obvious areas of co-operation - new models are now discussed at
the design stage with suppliers rather than after design is completed. But
Leyland Trucks' small size remains a constraint. Much as John Dwyer,
operations manager, would like suppliers to deliver fewer parts more
frequently, he admits Leyland Trucks would be asking for uneconomic order
sizes.
To Imai, the assembly plant was a pleasant surprise. 'It is quite an
achievement to have reached a stage where they can start building their
trucks after they receive their orders.' But he says the Leyland assembly
plant still contains a mountain of opportunities for further improvement.
Oliver agrees the company is still some way behind the best Japanese
standards. The achievements to date have, however, allowed the company to
invest Pounds 25m on its new 55 series 11-15 tonne truck for continental
Europe, its first new product launch outside the UK.
Given Leyland Trucks' history, this could only be contemplated because the
company is making the transition from outmoded mass production techniques to
the lean production methods of the future.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call for higher VAT
thresholds in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government should lead a campaign within Europe to raise
substantially the threshold at which companies must register for and
administer VAT, says David Kern, chief economist of the National Westminster
Bank.
Raising the threshold would release many small businesses from the excessive
burden of administering the tax, he says.
'What we need is a legalised black market,' Kern says. 'At the moment we are
asking potential entrepreneurs to start worrying about form filling at a
point where they are too small to do it.'
Raising the VAT threshold would liberate businessmen and women to focus on
building and nourishing businesses.
The case for raising the threshold is valid throughout Europe, Kern says.
'Europe is a low growth and high unemployment area,' Kern says. 'The
employment rules are already very rigid in Europe. By reducing the obstacles
to people starting their own businesses, Europe would generate a more
enterprising economy.'
In the UK, Kern says NatWest Bank is asking the chancellor to use the Budget
later this month to raise the threshold from its current level of Pounds
45,000 to Pounds 60,000. But, he says, a Pounds 100,000 threshold should be
the target. The cost to the Treasury, even at the higher level, 'is not
negligible, but small given the state of public spending', he says.
Based on VAT statistics, Kern estimates the following benefits.
Raising the threshold to Pounds 60,000 would cost the Treasury Pounds 120m.
It would remove 125,000 companies from the VAT net.
Raising it to Pounds 75,000 would cost Pounds 245m and liberate 230,000
companies.
More than doubling the threshold to Pounds 100,000 would cost Pounds 425m
but would remove 400,000 companies from the burden of administering VAT. A
20 per cent rise from Pounds 37,600 last November took 75,000 businesses out
of the net.
Any move to raise the threshold could run into severe difficulties in the
European Commission. When the government last raised the threshold, UK
Customs &amp; Excise had 'informal chats' to make sure there were no objections.
Previous increases show the UK government is pushing the thresholds above
the rate of inflation because it is good for business. The last four
increases in the thresholds, starting in March 1991, were respectively 38
per cent, 4.5 per cent, 2.7 per cent and last November's 20 per cent rise to
Pounds 45,000.
But the UK knows it cannot push Brussels too far. Any radical departure from
this ad hoc system of back door derogations would be resisted in Brussels
unless there was a political will to change the system throughout Europe.
This is unlikely, given the battle over new VAT rules already taking place
in Europe. The EU is moving towards collection of VAT at rates applicable in
the country of origin rather than at rates prevailing at the destination - a
system that is likely to need harmonisation of thresholds rather than more
divergence.
Some say that Kern's call for higher thresholds is not sufficiently radical.
Graham Bannock, a small companies consultant, says administering VAT is a
very real problem for small companies.
'For many people the cost of administering VAT is greater than the tax they
actually pay,' he says. But rather than tinker with the existing system,
Bannock believes the government should simplify an unnecessarily complex law
 -removing zero-rated categories and lowering the overall rate, for example.
This is the only way to ensure businesses and the Customs &amp; Excise have a
workable tax to administer, he believes.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Monitoring urged for management training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday questioned the effectiveness
of government spending in the development of management skills in smaller
companies.
Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's small firms council, said the
government spent Pounds 100m a year supporting programmes aimed at
developing management competence but little was known about whether it
achieved its objective.
He said: 'Evaluation of government schemes for small and medium-sized
enterprises tends to focus on take-up rates and customer satisfaction,
avoiding the difficult but vital task of isolating the actual impact on
business performance.'
Mr Parsons said the Department of Trade and Industry spent Pounds 50m a year
on developing management competence. When pump-priming money and the
management development element of the Investors in People programme was
included government spending in this area came to more than Pounds 100m a
year.
The CBI called for more rigorous research into the effectiveness of
management development programmes, most of which are delivered via training
and enterprise councils and business links organisations.
The call for more focused government spending follows research by Warwick
Business School earlier this year which showed there was no evidence that
management development programmes made companies more successful in terms of
lower failure rates or greater profitability.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Cook urges EU to widen, not deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should be more concerned about expanding to the east, its
mission for the 1990s, than tightening the links between the present member
states, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday.
In his first speech since Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, appointed him to
speak on foreign affairs, Mr Cook laid out the opposition's European policy
priorities.
Mr Cook told the conference of the Confederation of British Industry in
Birmingham: 'We should take no steps to deepen the bonds of the European
Union which will make it more difficult to widen access.'
Talks to define future relations between the EU and eastern European
countries once part of the Soviet bloc have started but there is little
expectation of the EU having eastern members during this century.
Mr Cook put EU accommodation with the east - the buttressing of market
economies there - as one of his four priorities.
The other three reflected a sharing of views between the Labour leadership
and the CBI:
He called for the proper working of the single market, citing anomalies such
as the British import of electricity from France and the French refusal to
import or transmit British electricity elsewhere.
He demanded symmetry of regulation - the imposition of EU rules
even-handedly across the EU countries.
He urged the reform of the common agricultural policy.
Later, business leaders said that separating the activities of government
and business would strengthen the single market. Sir Michael Angus, deputy
president of the CBI, said: 'Over-regulation destroys jobs. Freeing business
from unnecessary regulations is one positive step in addressing the
critically high unemployment.'
UNICE, the federation of European employers' organisations, called for close
analysis of the costs and benefits of European legislation. Mr Francois
Perigot, its president, said: 'Every project should be judged in terms of
its positive impact on competitiveness and nothing else.'
Sir Michael, true to CBI form, wanted to ensure that 'social objectives are
not pursued at the expense of competitiveness but rather result from it.'
Mr Padraig Flynn, the European commissioner for social affairs and
employment, received a polite rather than enthusiastic welcome.
He had a warning for the CBI, a dedicated opponent of the EU's social
chapter and devoted supporter of the UK government's opt-out.
He said: 'As we seek to build a Europe for business, we must also be seen to
build a Europe which is not only for business. We have to build a Europe
that offers a broad vision of economic and social progress for all.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Gas industry tiptoes into free market: Ministerial caution
will dictate the choice of testing ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is growing speculation that procedures for introducing competition
into the domestic gas market could be tested in south-west England.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, says a site has yet to be selected. But
industry executives say parts of the south-west, such as Bristol, might be
chosen for political reasons.
Conservative MPs in the region have been vociferous in questioning the
benefits of the planned liberalisation of the national market in 1998. They
fear that consumers in the region, which is the furthest from the main
coastal gas terminals, will suffer sharp price rises with the end of British
Gas's monopoly and the withdrawal of uniform, national pricing.
According to industry executives choosing the south-west for the proposed
pilot project would be politically astute. They say that since the region is
likely to benefit least from competition, it should benefit first.
Independent gas companies, keen for the national market of 18m households to
be opened to competition, would have a big incentive to ensure that gas
prices in the pilot area fell substantially.
Speculation about which region would be chosen has increased with industry
confidence that a new gas bill will be included in the government's
legislative programme to be announced in the Queen's Speech next week.
Fears that competition would lead to higher rather than lower prices for
many domestic customers had threatened to erode government support for the
liberalisation programme announced last December by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary.
Recent hearings by the Commons trade and industry committee highlighted MPs'
fears about future gas prices. The issue formed much of the questioning
directed at witnesses including Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister,
and Ms Clare Spottiswoode, industry regulator.
Their reassurances that competition should result in lower prices helped
remove lingering fears among ministers that gas liberalisation could be
politically explosive so close to a general election.
The heavily revised and much more cautious approach to the phased opening of
the market announced by Mr Eggar last week is likely to have reassured
ministers.
Under the revised proposals the government has abandoned plans to open 5 per
cent of the market in April 1996, and a further 5 per cent in April 1997.
The original plan raised serious doubts among British Gas executives, who
earlier this year called for a six-month delay to ensure the new procedures
and systems required by competition were fully tested.
Mr David Dewar, director of development at TransCo, the British Gas pipeline
and storage division, said the decision to run much more modest pilot
programmes in specific areas is a 'much more practical and better way' to
test the new systems.
The first phase of the pilot programme is due to start in April 1996, and
will cover an area with about 500,000 gas consumers. The second phase,
scheduled for April 1997, will include a whole region, containing about 2m
consumers.
Ofgas and the government say competition could be introduced nationally in
1998 if the pilots prove successful.
Mr James Ball, of the industry newsletter Gas Matters, believes the more
cautious approach does not represent any reduced commitment to full
competition by the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas. Instead, it
reflects a realisation that the original plan was 'a grand vision that could
not be guaranteed to work'.
The new arrangements are 'driven by practical reality', he said. 'They are
testable and controllable. You can stop it and make changes if it isn't
working.'
He said many in the industry were unhappy with the new arrangements, which
because of their limited nature would not give British Gas's would-be rivals
any significant commercial boost.
Ms Caroline Harper, of Amerada Hess, the US oil company which is keen to
expand its British gas business, said: 'We would have preferred to go for 5
per cent. But (the new arrangements) are the price we have to pay for full
competition in 1998.'
Mr Ball believes any legislation which emerges in the next parliamentary
session should merely provide a framework for liberalisation, to allow Ofgas
maximum flexibility in opening the market.
Others disagree and want the legislation to include a firm date for full
competition.
The chief executive of one of the bigger independent gas marketing companies
said yesterday: 'We're hoping that the gas act is crystal clear about the
date for introducing full competition. It's time the gas industry stopped
being a political football.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / CBI chief tells executives to set pay example: Excessive
rises undermine management credibility, conference told - Labour names
European goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders have a 'clear responsibility, moral and political, to set
an example on pay discipline', Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the
Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday.
Excessive executive pay rises undermined the credibility of managements in
the fight against inflation, Sir Bryan told the CBI's annual conference.
He called on remuneration committees to recognise the undesirability of
managers and directors awarding themselves 'increases and performance
bonuses which are not only well above inflation, but also out of proportion
with the rewards received by the workforce for the company's performance'.
Sir Bryan, chairman of Bupa, the private health-care group, said most CBI
members he met 'are not satisfied' with high executive pay awards, 'and yet
the problem exists'.
His was one of the few comments on the subject during a conference dominated
by broader issues such as European integration and manufacturing
competitiveness. But each time it has come up in Birmingham, it has led to
awkward discussions.
Mr Tony Hales, chairman of the CBI's National Manufacturing Council and
chief executive of Allied Domecq, the wine and spirits group, was asked in a
press conference on Sunday the size of his employees' pay rise last year. He
said the group's UK pay awards 'tended to be 2 to 3 per cent. Mine hasn't
been published (yet) and I'm not talking about it here.'
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the confederation's executive
had not discussed whether executive pay should be a conference topic. The
CBI believes that executive pay should be set by a mechanism involving
people outside the management, such as a remuneration committee. with
external directors. But Mr Davies said that what process a company used to
link pay to performance was not a matter for the CBI. 'People should be able
to defend themselves,' he said.
The debate over pay had been moving rapidly, he said. A year ago many people
had felt three-year rolling contracts for directors were acceptable. But now
Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, head of the Postel pension fund, who has been
campaigning against them, was 'winning the argument'.
A report on west Midlands remuneration by KPMG Corporate Finance helped to
highlight the issue at the conference.
It says directors' pay in the region's utilities rose 22.8 per cent to
Pounds 95,600 in the fiscal year 1993-1994, by 15 per cent in large
companies to Pounds 124,800; by 5.7 per cent in medium-sized companies to
Pounds 63,200; and by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 52,800 in small companies.
Over the same period, the average wage per employee in the region rose 4.7
per cent to Pounds 14,500.

FT  08 NOV 94 / BAe plea over Airbus decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace could lose its role as Airbus's wing designer and supplier
if the government fails to buy the new European-made military transport
aircraft, Mr Julian Tapp, BAe's chief economist, said yesterday.
Mr Tapp told the CBI conference that purchase of the Lockheed-made US rival
could force BAe to drop out of the European consortium which is offering the
Future Large Aircraft. Production and design of the FLA's wing would go to
Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary.
When Airbus tackled the next generation of wide-bodied aircraft, Dasa would
be able 'to migrate its newly developed large-wing capability straight to
the new project,' displacing BAe, Mr Tapp said.
BAe, Britain's biggest exporter, would lose not only foreign sales of the
military aircraft, but also those of Airbus's new large airliner. Britain's
aerospace skills base would be seriously diminished, he added.
'We need a government with an aerospace strategy that supports industry and
avoids this outcome,' he said.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Manufacturers warned against complacency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers must guard against complacency brought on by rising output and
orders and remain committed to achieving international competitiveness, the
National Manufacturing Council, an arm of the CBI, said yesterday.
Mr Tony Hales, the council's chairman and chief executive of Allied Domecq,
the drinks group, said: 'It is now crucially important that companies do not
become complacent in the short term and relax the drive for both fundamental
change and continuous improvement.'
He urged the government to take further action on competitiveness, tax
structures and other measures to help create the best business environment.
But he also reminded business that the onus lay on it to make the most of
the opportunities created.
The scale of the task was underlined by Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of Gooding
Group, a Welsh consumer electronics maker. He said: 'In terms of
manufacturing capacity, we are not much better off than we were a quarter of
a century ago. What the hell went wrong with UK manufacturing? The answer is
a failure to invest on the necessary scale.'
He called for a tripartite effort from industry, the City and government to
raise investment levels. Public spending, for example, should be increased
on roads, railways and other infrastructure projects.
The issue of inadequate transport facilities was taken up by several
speakers in the conference debate on manufacturing.
Mr Neil Ashley, chairman of Amey Holdings, the contractor said one reason
business lacked the networks it needed was a combination of 'Treasury
parsimony and green hype'.
The sharpest exchange in the debate came over the British Standards
Institution's BS 5750 quality certification programme. Mr Jeremy Woolridge,
chairman of BW Wedge Holdings, a West Midlands galvanising company, said:
'Its handbook allows an inferior product to be made to consistently bad
standards.'
Mr Vivian Thomas, chairman of the BSI, said it was a shame to 'take
something successful like BS 5750 and use it as a whipping boy'.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Gummer backs two-tier councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday firmly signalled that
he would allow two-tier local government to remain in much of England.
He told the annual conference of the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils that he wanted England to have a 'variable' local government
structure.
The Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has recommended
that the two-tier system should remain in the bulk of the counties for which
it has so far made proposals. Mr Gummer has the power to reject them.
Last November Mr Gummer told the commission he wanted the two-tier system to
survive only in 'exceptional' circumstances.
Mr Gummer promised yesterday, however, that he would ensure that surviving
county councils would devolve more powers to district and local councils. He
also attacked the campaigns which some counties had waged against reform.
He said his own county of Suffolk had been 'pretty bad', while Cleveland
county council 'should be ashamed of themselves'. Members of both councils
described his comments as 'scandalous'.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrats' local government spokesman, said the
review was a 'shambles', and predicted Mr Gummer would even reject some more
of the proposals where Sir John had recommended abolition of two-tier
counties.
Separately, Mr Gummer said he would be working with Mr William Waldegrave,
the agriculture secretary, on a new white paper on rural issues. He said
this would cover mainly planning and environmental topics. and ensure the
'voice of the countryside' was heard in national policymaking.
Urban dwellers in Nottinghamshire and Cleveland are to have new forests on
their doorsteps, the government announced yesterday, Alison Maitland writes.
It approved the Greenwood Community Forest north of Nottingham and the
Cleveland Community Forest around Middlesbrough.
The two forests are part of the government's 40-year programme to establish
12 forests covering 4,500 sq km to act as 'green lungs' for urban areas.
Grants will be available to encourage landowners to participate and the two
commissions will also purchase some of the forest land.
Forests are already under way east of London, in south Staffordshire, and in
Tyne and Wear and north-east Durham. Seven more await government approval.
They would be in or near Merseyside, Greater Manchester, south Yorkshire,
Bedfordshire, north London, Swindon and Bristol.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Heseltine tells business it must invest more: CBI conference
told expectations on returns are excessive; Doubt cast on prospect of tax
breaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses are not investing enough, because of their excessive expectations
of investment returns, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
told the CBI conference yesterday.
The criticism cast doubts on the likelihood of the chancellor granting
further tax concessions on investment in this month's Budget.
Mr Heseltine said: 'The CBI tells me that businesses look for steady demand,
for a decent return on new investment. You now have these conditions. But
you are still not investing enough.
'The CBI tells me that the majority of firms continue to require rates of
return above 20 per cent. A senior banker last week told me his bank
habitually asked for 30 per cent returns on capital. These figures speak for
themselves. They have a chilling message built into them.' A 30 per cent
return implies that projects have a pay-back period of only about three
years.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, the president of the CBI, acknowledged that 'clearly
there is the case for companies re-examining their rates of return'.
Mr Heseltine's criticism was an indirect rebuttal of the argument by Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, that the government's
competitiveness white paper contained a gap on the tax question. Mr Davies
said: 'There is too little recognition of the importance of a tax
environment sympathetic to investment.'
Small-business lobby groups have been calling for the chancellor to give 100
per cent capital allowances on the first Pounds 100,000 of investment.
Higher targeted rates of return, which Mr Heseltine criticised, are more
common among medium-sized and larger companies.
The CBI's national manufacturing council has identified consistently
sluggish investment as a major factor behind the UK's productivity shortfall
relative to its competitors.
Mr Heseltine said yesterday: 'We are not investing enough yet in either
people or products; in the workforce, in innovation.'
The trade and industry secretary joined the CBI president in warning against
excessive pay rises for directors. 'Wage levels must reflect performance, in
the boardroom as well as on the shop floor' he said.
In an effort to align his department with the concerns of business
rationalised by recession Mr Heseltine said his first objective was to
reduce the size of the department of trade. It would employ a significantly
smaller number of people in two years time than it had when he took office,
he said.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'It sounds
suspiciously as if Michael Heseltine is again playing to the right wing of
his party by adopting the Michael Portillo line on the role of the DTI.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Scottish Office told of staff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil servants at the Scottish Office were told yesterday that jobs would be
cut at all levels in the next financial year as part of a programme to cut
annual staff costs by 6 per cent. Further reductions are likely in the
following two years.
The staff cuts follow the white paper on the civil service published in July
by Mr William Waldegrave, then the public service minister, with the aim of
'cutting the state down to size by demanding quality at a price the taxpayer
can afford'. Other government ministries are working to bring the white
paper's plans into effect.
The Scottish Office and its executive agencies, excluding the Scottish
Prison Service, employ 6,035 staff who will cost Pounds 130m this year. A 6
per cent cut would trim this by almost Pounds 8m. A further 4,500 work for
the Scottish Prison Service, which is carrying out its own staff review.
Sir Russell Hillhouse, permanent secretary at the Scottish Office, told
staff yesterday that jobs would be lost at all levels. It was too early to
say how many would go but he hoped the savings could be achieved by natural
wastage and voluntary early retirement.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Office prices 'to stay sluggish'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth in commercial property prices will not be as strong as previously
thought, with the market likely to remain sluggish for the remainder of this
year and next, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says.
The London Business School commercial property model, sponsored by the
institution, is forecasting capital growth of 9 per cent this year and 2.6
per cent next year.
This represents a considerable fall compared with predictions earlier in the
year. In June the model predicted that capital values would rise 18 per cent
this year and 7 per cent next.
Mr Richard Lay, for the institution's commercial property section, said that
pressure on company profit margins and sluggish demand for new retail and
industrial space meant that the strong recovery experienced at the start of
the year had not been sustained.
He said: 'The office sector has been hardest hit due to the government's
rise in interest rates. This has affected a market already characterised by
excess supply.'
The London Business School model forecasts that the year-on-year rate of
capital growth from commercial property will decline to 1.4 per cent in the
second quarter next year from 14.2 per cent in the third quarter of this
year before gently accelerating as demand for business space picks up.
The annualised rate of capital growth is expected to peak at 10.8 per cent
in the first quarter of 1997.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Women 'likely to take most new jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment will stay above 2m in Britain until at least 2001 in spite of a
projected 1m extra jobs, says the review of the economy and employment
published today by the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick
University.
The report suggests that the bulk of new employment will come from 'cyclical
recovery rather than long-term growth'. Male full-time jobs are expected to
decline, with most additional employment going to women, the majority of
whom will be working part-time.
The study forecasts an annual improvement of 3.3 per cent in industrial
output from 1993 to 1997, the best performance in the economy for 40 years,
with a 2.7 per cent growth in output per person.
The institute says: 'Some further reductions in unemployment are expected as
the economy picks up but these are not likely to be dramatic.'
It says Britain's labour force should rise steadily until the end of the
decade, partly owing to the increase in the number of women between the ages
of 25 and 50 in employment.
The number of plant and machine operatives is expected to fall by more than
100,000 by 2001.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Tories glad to see Scott buried in paper: Jimmy Burns
assesses the effects of the delays in the arms-to-Iraq investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years after his arms-to-Iraq inquiry was set up and seven months from
the end of the main public hearings, Lord Justice Scott is not even a
quarter way through writing his report. The estimated publication date has
again slipped, this time to 'sometime around Easter'.
The latest delay has been greeted with concern by some Labour MPs, who fear
that the momentum is being lost. Some of their colleagues, however, continue
to flood the Scott team with documentation, saying that the inquiry has not
gone far enough.
Tories, predictably, appear only too pleased to have one less hot potato to
contend with in the current political climate.
Mr Peter Viggers, a Tory MP with a special interest in defence matters,
gleefully remarked at the weekend: 'It seems to have faded from the media,
from the House of Commons, from everywhere.'
Sir Charles Powell, a former senior adviser to Baroness Thatcher, the former
prime minister, said: 'I think by April the Scott inquiry is going to have a
certain stale air.'
The judge appears unruffled by such scepticism while sensitive to the
suggestion that his work is no longer an issue of public concern. And he is
somewhat irritated by what he sees as the Labour party's inconsistent
approach to his inquiry.
In November 1992 he agreed to head the inquiry in the midst of a huge public
row - led by Labour - following the collapse of the trial of three
executives of Matrix Churchill, the machine-tool company, who were charged
with breaching export regulations.
Those charged alleged that they had exported to Iraq with the full
connivance of the government, even though Britain was supposed to be
pursuing a policy banning the sale of defence-related equipment to Baghdad.
While initially focused on the Matrix Churchill case, the judge has been
determined to ensure that his terms of reference were sufficiently wide to
allow him to examine other arms-related prosecutions where the conduct of
government lawyers has been open to question.
According to his officials the judge's low profile in recent months belies
the progress he has been making towards completing an inquiry which has
already forced ministers and officials to account for their actions in a way
they have never been required to do before.
Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, secretary to the Scott inquiry, said: 'We don't
want to be open to the suggestion that we haven't followed up every
reasonable line of inquiry. If in the end we bring out a report which is not
based on a firm footing, we will be rightly criticised. We are not having
that.'
In recent months the judge has found himself having to test the massive
amounts of documentary and oral evidence made available to him by
cross-examining MI6 officers in private, and seeking further statements from
Whitehall officials and ministers.
He has widened his list of witnesses to include Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury
minister, and Sir Charles, neither of whom gave evidence in public hearing.
Mr Aitken told the inquiry that while serving as a non-executive director of
the British Manufacturer and Research Company, a defence group, and
subsequently as defence minister, he had no recollection of clandestine
exports to Iraq or of government connivance.
Sir Charles for his part has told the inquiry that although he was
personally aware of the attempt by Whitehall officials and junior ministers
to change secretly guidelines on defence exports without informing
parliament, this was not passed on to Lady Thatcher when she was prime
minister.
Among additional evidence that has landed on the judge's desk in recent
weeks are documents provided by Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's transport
spokesman. These relate to the activities of the defence company
International Signal and Control (ISC) before its purchase by Ferranti in
1987.
The inquiry team is probing the extent of government knowledge of an ISC
contract for the supply of a precision guided missile system capable of
carrying nuclear or chemical warheads which might have been diverted to
Iraq.
Mr Jim Cousins, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, who has kept a close
watch on the inquiry, said at the weekend: 'It's important that Scott should
become more than an echo of distant thunder. He shouldn't be sidetracked by
minutiae but concentrate instead on what the government knew and what that
tells us about the nature of the arms trade.'
The judge is adamant that he is not dancing to anyone's political tune. Mr
Muttukumaru said: 'You shouldn't underestimate the extent to which he is
determined to follow an independent line.'
At present the balance is weighted on the side of ensuring that there is no
whitewash. Like Aesop's tale, the judge is hoping that with his 'slow and
steady' approach he will, as did the tortoise, get there in the end.
And it may be of small comfort to the government that the latest delay means
that the Scott report could coincide with the first public findings of Lord
Nolan's inquiry into standards in public life.

FT  08 NOV 94 / PM hits at rumours on leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday hit back at rightwing attacks on his leadership as
rumours spread at Westminster that a 'stalking horse' candidate is preparing
to challenge him later this month.
Amid sniping from the right Downing Street dismissed claims that the Post
Office privatisation debacle showed the government had run out of steam.
Officials said the prime minister retained the support of the 'vast
majority' of Tory MPs and there was 'a tremendous head of steam' behind the
legislative programme for the next parliament.
Uncertainty deepened, however, as Mr David Martin said he had resigned as a
parliamentary private secretary partly because of Mr Major's handling of
allegations of impropriety against ministers.
Mr Martin, who quit on Sunday as PPS to Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
said he was annoyed by the sacking of Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate
affairs minister, who denies newspaper allegations of impropriety.
Rightwingers said that the prospect of running a 'stalking horse' candidate
against Mr Major - intended to open the way for a challenge by a more
serious candidate - was again being discussed after being dropped during the
summer.
The threat was dismissed by Tory officials, who said there was no prospect
that such a candidate could collect the 34 nominations required.
A senior official said: 'There are no stalking horses around who would
remotely command the support required to proceed. There are a few wooden
horses around who might fall down at the first fence, but that's about all.'
Mr John Biffen, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said that Mr
Martin's resignation 'crystallises' the frustration felt by many
rightwingers over the Post Office retreat.
He warned rightwing MPs to 'do a spot of arithmetic before you start
striking attitudes'. The government was 'much wiser' to proceed only with
legislation it was sure it could carry.
Rightwingers remained determined to embarrass the government by seeking to
block a crucial bill to increase UK contributions to the European Union.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, sought to ease tensions
over Europe by insisting in a speech to the CBI that EU membership was 'a
key attraction' for overseas companies investing in the UK.
But rightwing suspicions of Brussels were exacerbated by confirmation that
Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, is pressing for an end to
the UK's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's target for M0 - the narrow gauge of money supply - serves
'no useful purpose' and should be scrapped, Mr Tim Congdon, one of the
Treasury's independent advisers, says in the November edition of Gerrard &amp;
National's Economic Review.
Annual growth of M0 has been above the government's target of 0 per cent 4
per cent since January last year.
Mr Congdon says that if the Bank of England's claim that M0 has been a 'good
leading indicator of retail inflation in the past' was correct, its
above-target growth ought to have had a significant impact on inflation.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Machine tool industry in surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The machine-tool industry recorded a trade surplus of Pounds 5.7m in the
first half of the year compared with a deficit of Pounds 7.7m a year
earlier, according to the Machine Tool Technologies Association, Andrew
Baxter writes.
The turnround continues the improved performance in the second half of last
year, which enabled the industry to achieve a trade surplus of Pounds 9m for
1993 - its first for 10 years.
In the first half of this year machine-tool exports rose 18.6 per cent to
Pounds 174.5m, due mainly to sales growth in the US and Far East.
Continental Europe remained relatively weak, although there were signs of
recovery, the association said.
Imports of machine tools rose 9 per cent to Pounds 168.7m, reflecting
improved manufacturing investment.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Consumer credit falls in September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer demand for credit eased in September, but official statistics
published yesterday show consumer credit at or near records in the third
quarter.
The Central Statistical Office reported that net lending to consumers by
finance houses, through unsecured lending from building societies and on
bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, fell to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 479m in September from a record Pounds 632m in
August.
But the monthly consumer credit figures - known as the CSO's narrow coverage
 -are notoriously erratic. Statistics for the three months to the end of
September suggested steady growth of consumer credit demand.
Net lending on the narrow measure reached a record Pounds 1.46bn in the
third quarter compared with Pounds 1.27bn in the three months to the end of
June and Pounds 959m in the third quarter of last year.
This mainly reflected record net lending by finance houses to consumers of
Pounds 1.19bn in the latest three months after Pounds 996m in the second
quarter. There was only a modest increase in net lending on bank credit
cards to Pounds 245m from Pounds 234m, while consumer credit from building
societies slipped to Pounds 24m from Pounds 41m.
Most gross figures for credit business were also at record levels. The CSO
said the Pounds 5.28bn 'narrow' total of credit advanced in September was a
new high, up from Pounds 5.26bn in August. It reflected record advances of
credit through bank credit cards and by finance houses of Pounds 3.02bn and
Pounds 2.04bn respectively.
The total of new credit granted on the narrow measure in the third quarter
rose to a record Pounds 15.68bn from Pounds 15.11bn in the previous three
months.
Third-quarter figures for the CSO's broader consumer credit coverage, which
includes lending by banks on personal accounts, insurance companies,
retailers and on all bank credit cards and charge cards, were at their
highest since the boom in the late 1980s. Net lending rose to a five-year
high of Pounds 1.53bn in the quarter from Pounds 1.34bn in the previous
three months.
The broad coverage, which has been available only quarterly, will be the
basis of the monthly credit figures from January 6, when the Bank of England
will take responsibility for publication and the CSO's present narrow
coverage will be dropped.
The narrow figures published yesterday showed that net lending by finance
houses slipped to Pounds 381m in September from Pounds 486m in August. Net
lending through bank credit cards declined to Pounds 102m from Pounds 125m,
while there was a net repayment of Pounds 4m of consumer borrowing from
building societies after net lending of Pounds 21m in August.

Regulators yesterday moved to toughen rules governing auditors and directors
over public statements on whether a business is a 'going concern'.
The issue has been one of the most controversial in corporate governance and
accounting since the spectacular corporate failures of the late 1980s.
Investors complained that businesses which had been audited and presumed to
be going concerns failed soon afterwards.
But auditors fear the new rules might raise expectations that published
accounts are unable to meet. They want the public to realise that 'going
concern' is not a guarantee of survival.
The publication yesterday of the Auditing Practices Board's Statement of
Auditing Standards 130 overtakes guidelines which gave auditors a passive
role in scrutinising going concern.
The standards statement, which has the force of law, requires auditors to
take an 'active role' in establishing going concern and unlike the present
guidelines, removes the time limits on what constitutes the 'foreseeable
future'.
The standard requires auditors to register an adverse opinion if they do not
agree with the directors that a business is a going concern.
Auditors are required to qualify accounts if they believe the directors have
not taken adequate steps to satisfy themselves that the going- concern basis
is appropriate.
The board said the new rules should not make accounts preparations more
costly. The standard is effective for periods ending June 30 1995.
The working group on going concern, set up after last year's Cadbury Report
on corporate governance, has also published its guidance to directors of
listed companies. It dovetails with the auditing board's work.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Robust growth seen for industrial output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is experiencing robust and broadly based growth of industrial
production, according to official statistics published yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said output of the production industries and
manufacturing grew in September at seasonally adjusted year-on-year rates of
6.6 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively. It reported substantial upward
revisions of earlier data.
Production industry output, which includes manufacturing, mining and
quarrying with oil and gas extraction, and the electricity, gas and water
supply industries, is thought to have risen 0.1 per cent in August compared
with July and 0.6 per cent in July compared with June. This compares with
last month's report of a 0.1 per cent decline in August and a 0.1 per cent
gain in July.
The office believes output rose at year-on-year rates of 5.5 per cent in the
two months compared with the earlier report of 4.6 per cent growth in August
and 4.8 per cent in July. Figures for manufacturing, which makes up 84.4 per
cent of the production industry, tell a similar story.
Taking three months' figures, production industry output increased 1.2 per
cent in the latest three months compared with the preceding quarter, as did
manufacturing production.
Mining and quarrying, including oil and gas extraction, increased output by
0.8 per cent and the output of the electricity, gas and water supply sectors
rose 1.6 per cent. Oil and gas production reached an all-time high in the
latest quarter.
Nearly all manufacturing sectors increased output between the second and
third quarters. All except the leather and leather-products industry raised
output compared with last year's third quarter.
In the latest three months production of computers rose 32.9 per cent from
the previous year while output of the quaintly named 'telegraph and
telephone apparatus' sector was 36.8 per cent higher. This strong growth of
computers and telecommunications equipment output helped production of the
electrical-goods branch of the investment-goods industry to a record high in
Sep-tember.
Output of the engineering and allied industries grew an-above average 2.3
per cent between the second and third quarters, with the transport equipment
industry increasing production by 3.5 per cent. Food, drink and tobacco
production rose 2 per cent in the latest quarter and reached a record level
in September.
Among broad manufacturing sectors only textiles, leather and clothing, and
the coke, mineral oil refining and nuclear fuel industries registered
falling output between the second and third quarters, of 0.6 per cent and
5.5 per cent respectively.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Ferry ban cuts calf prices by up to 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calf prices have fallen by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in some markets in
south-west England as a result of Brittany Ferries' decision on Friday to
join a ban by cross-channel ferry companies on exporting animals for
slaughter.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said he was
concerned about market prices, which had already fallen by 15 per cent
year-on-year since P&amp;O and Stena Sealink banned live exports in the summer.
Brittany Ferries, which had continued to carry animals for further fattening
before slaughter, said last week it was halting this trade because of
'flagrant breaches' by hauliers of its code of conduct.
Sir David has written to Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, saying
European-wide rules must be introduced urgently to control cowboy hauliers.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, yesterday said efforts
continued to finalise proposals which would strengthen the law and introduce
a code of conduct for hauliers and farmers.

<TEXT>
A change to the rules on building society mergers and takeovers, to allow
the public interest to be taken into account, is to be urged today by Mr
Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman.
Mr Darling wants no more takeovers and mergers to be allowed until new
guidelines have been set. He says that while no one could blame investors
for being ready to accept Pounds 1,000 to give up their membership rights,
'payments of this sort are no way to make policy'.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Bumpy ride for balloon company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airbourne Group, the company which made the hot air balloons that hold the
records for the highest and furthest journeys, has come down to earth with a
bump, Jim Kelly writes. It has gone into receivership after spending Pounds
2.5m on airship development.
But Touche Ross, the receiver, is confident that it can fly again. At least
six potential buyers have contacted Touche Ross and there are 'stacks of
orders' for its core products - hot air balloons, barrage balloons and
thermal defence targets.
Airbourne, and its trading companies which include Airborne Industries and
Thunder and Colt, is responsible for 30 per cent of the world's hot air
balloon market.
Mr Andrew Peters, joint administrator, said the group had an annual turnover
of Pounds 10m and there was a good chance of a sale as a going concern.
Development into airships had caused the problems, he said. The craft, used
mostly for advertising, had not found a market.
The company's plants are in Southend and Oswestry and employ about 130
people.
Airbourne balloons hold the world altitude record at 64,997 feet and the
world distance record at 7,672 kilometres. Both were set in 1988.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Train companies attack long rental contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The companies which will run trains after British Rail is privatised are
being forced to sign inflexible contracts with the companies set up to lease
them rolling stock, according to South West Trains, which runs services from
London Waterloo to Southampton and Portsmouth.
The company said it was being asked to sign four and eight-year leases when
it would like at least some of its fleet to be on one-year leases.
Mr Peter Field, managing director of South West Trains, told a conference on
rail privatisation: 'If there is a recession, you need to be able to escape
quickly (from a long lease). In the last recession we had to withdraw 20 per
cent of our rolling stock.'
The long leases mean the rolling stock companies, which are early candidates
for privatisation, can forecast their revenues with a greater degree of
certainty. But train operators bear most of the risk of a downturn.
The train operators say they are being 'bounced' in negotiations with the
three rolling-stock companies which are attempting to conclude lease
negotiations by mid-December.
Mr Field said: 'I would be reluctant to sign up to their present offer but I
might have no choice.'
The train operators are also worried that they will have to meet the cost of
any design faults in the rolling stock they lease.
South West Trains has encountered problems with its modern air-conditioned
trains but has been told that the leasing companies will not take
responsibility for faults inherited from British Rail.
An official for the leasing companies said that the length of rolling stock
leases had been chosen as a reasonable compromise between the needs of the
train operators and the leasing companies. The cost of putting right known
design faults would be the responsibility of the train operator but would be
reflected in lower rental.
Rolling stock leasing charges will be the second biggest item on the profit
and loss account of the train operators. South West Trains faces an annual
leasing bill of Pounds 80m for the 250 trains it needs.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Blair sets out to woo business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will today set out plans for a working relationship between
business and a Labour government, based on partnership and a positive
approach to the European Union.
In an effort to reassure business that the party has dumped its 1970s
ideological baggage, the Labour leader will offer strong support for a
dynamic market economy in which the government's role is limited to support
for industry.
Mr Blair is expected to tell 200 senior executive members of the Per Cent
club, which organises charitable activity that it will require a new style
of government and a new relationship with industry.
He plans to say: 'New Labour will not return to the old style, corporatist,
Whitehall-knows-best attitudes. Our job is not to do the work of individual
companies but to create a government in which all sides of business work
together.'
Mr Blair will declare that the debate between privatisation and
nationalisation is over, and will rule out a return to the punitive taxation
rates imposed by the last Labour government.
He will also acknowledge the abandonment of Labour's one-time plans to
dismantle the framework of employment law established by the Conservatives
since 1979.
But Mr Blair will stress that Labour plans a programme of industrial and
economic change which will be more radical than the changes forced through
by Baroness Thatcher between 1979 and 1990.
He will say: 'Tory radicalism may be extinct now that Thatcherism is dead,
but Labour's radicalism is not. The idea that all radicalism is dead because
Thatcherism is dead is absurd.'

A full Channel tunnel passenger service for drivers and their cars will not
start before the end of November or early December, at least two weeks later
than Eurotunnel's most optimistic forecast.
The company, which operates the Channel tunnel shuttle services, had hoped
to start turn-up-and-go passenger shuttles from November 15 but this early
deadline will not be met, it said yesterday.
Eurotunnel will this week apply to the Franco-British intergovernmental
commission in charge of safety for an operating certificate to run full
commercial passenger services. It will take two to three weeks for the
commission to respond.
Eurotunnel said that there was no single reason for the delay.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Traineeships sail off down the Tyne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The workforce of Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter has been reduced to a
skeleton since receivership, but one group remains - the trainees who were
the company's stake in the future.
Redundancies have cut employees from 2,400 on receivership in May last year
to less than 350 now, and 220 of those will lose their jobs on Friday.
But through all the trauma of the past 18 months, the trainees have worked
on to gain the craft skills which, they hope, will give them the chance of a
working life.
Now, with Swans' last ship, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, gone from the Tyne
and the company's demise drawing near, the unions and the Tyneside Training
and Enterprise Council are searching for new employers for the trainees.
The Swans' Traineeship, launched in late 1991, superseded the traditional
shipyard apprenticeship by offering a flexible, standards-based, three-year
programme leading to nationally recognised vocational qualifications.
Formulated with strong support from the unions, which described it as 'a
scheme with a future', it recruited 18-year-old trainees in 1991 and 1992.
So far, Mr Dick Gonsalez, a union leader, has found work for three trainees
with North Tyneside Council; 18 remain, including six about to complete
their three years' training.
One of them, 21-year-old electrician Mr Mark Bennett, said he was grateful
the trainees had been kept on, although the uncertainty and the sight of
skilled people losing their jobs had been hard.
His ambition to become a chartered engineer remains unshaken. 'We were taken
on to carry the industry forward into the future,' he said.
Miss Amanda Redmond, another electrician and the only female trainee, said
the collapse of Swan Hunter had been heartbreaking. 'You learn a lot about
life the hard way.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Dublin will free IRA prisoners by Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government said yesterday it would release several IRA prisoners
before Christmas as part of its response to the IRA's ceasefire.
Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, also said talks were
taking place with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, on the surrender of
the IRA's weapons.
The move prompted immediate concern in London about the speed of events in
Dublin and was greeted with dismay by rightwing Conservative MPs and Ulster
unionists.
Ms Geoghegan-Quinn said details of the numbers to be freed and the timetable
of their release had yet to be fixed. 'But I can confirm that a number will
be released between now and Christmas,' she said.
The minister stressed that there was no question of trading prisoners for
weapons. 'But the dismantling of IRA arsenals is being actively pursued,'
she added.
Last night the British government would say only that the release of
terrorist prisoners was a matter for the Irish government. A Downing Street
spokesman said: 'The prime minister has repeatedly made it clear in the past
that IRA prisoners are serving sentences for criminal offences. They are not
political prisoners and the question of an amnesty does not arise.'
Privately, ministers are sanguine about Irish concessions to the IRA, which
they hope will help to lock the terrorists into the peace process. There is
concern in London, however, that Dublin is moving too quickly.
Ministers are also keenly aware of the need to reassure unionists that their
interests are not being ignored in the struggle to draw the republican
movement into mainstream politics.
Mr Henry Bellingham, Conservative MP for Norfolk North West, said he was
'deeply disturbed' about the announcement. 'I can understand why the Irish
government want to keep the momentum behind the peace process going, but I
think they are taking far too big a risk,' he said.
Mr Bellingham, a member of both the British Irish Parliamentary Body and the
Conservative Friends of the Union, said it was too early for such a release
of terrorist prisoners, which would merely strengthen the IRA's active
service units if the peace process broke down.
Mr Bellingham said Conservative MPs would accept that it was not possible
for Britain to prevent the release of terrorists convicted in Ireland.
'But I hope very much that Downing Street will make its grave displeasure
very clear to the Irish government in private,' he said.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, said he was becoming increasingly
worried by what he described as the republic's piecemeal approach to the
ceasefire which was in contrast to Mr Major's more considered and structured
attitude.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Carey seeks stronger ties for Church and commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial self-interest is likely to degenerate into 'gangsterism and
corruption' unless businesses are run according to sound ethical principles,
Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday.
Dr Carey, in an address to Manchester Business School, defended wealth
creation and called for a stronger partnership between the churches and the
business community.
He emphasised, however, that he did not regard vigorous wealth creation  -
without which there was little chance of overcoming the problems of world
poverty and environmental degradation - as the same thing as the complete
free play of market forces.
He said: 'We do, indeed, need to ensure that we define our own ends as a
society and do not pretend that we can abdicate our responsibility to market
forces alone.' The market was a good servant. but a bad master, and market
forces needed to be 'constrained and directed to service the common good'.
Any attempt to remove ethics from business, was to 'remove humanity' from
the market. It was important for companies to develop a culture in which
ethical dilemmas were worked through conscientiously, he said.
Dr Carey acknowledged that clergy had pronounced too glibly about the moral
ambiguity of aspects of business.
He wanted the church to become more approachable and available for people
who were trying to wrestle with ethical challenges in a competitive world.
He hoped that the church's liturgies and worship could reflect more
adequately the 'aspirations and contribution of all those who strive to
create the wealth of our country'.
Business expertise had a vital part in play in the management of the church,
but the crude importation of business language and models would be
inappropriate and counter-productive, he said.

Sony Electronic Publishing is to open a base in Liverpool as its European

It is forecasting world sales for its products of more than Dollars 300m
(Pounds 182.90m) in 1995-96.
Sony acquired its Merseyside base last year, when it bought Psygnosis, a
Liverpool games software house, for an undisclosed sum. The new jobs more
than double the 235 that came with Psygnosis. Other Sony jobs may be moved
north from the south-east.
The company's main product - the Lemmings computer game - has sold several
million units worldwide. Other games include Shadow of the Beast, Ecstatica,
Novastorm and Mickey Mouse.
The company will occupy a building in Wavertree Technology Park which has
been empty for more than a year. Sony said the building's availability for
long leasing was crucial to its choice of the UK. It is also negotiating to
expand on adjacent land.
Mr Ian Hetherington, joint managing director, said: 'This is an emerging
technology and must be the largest growth sector in the world at the moment.
If we can pull some of that into Sony - and we can - 259 new jobs will only
be the tip of the iceberg.'
The development was fought over by inward investment agencies in France,
Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. But in industrial development terms,
government help has been small compared with the Pounds 58m which helped
entice Samsung to the north-east last month. The site already had Pounds
4.3m of derelict grant.
Of new money, Pounds 1.75m is regional selective assistance from the
Department of Trade and Industry, almost matched with Pounds 1.7m from the
European Union. A further Pounds 625,000 will come from Merseyside Training
and Enterprise Council.
Merseyside scored over other European locations partly because of north-west
England's educational infrastructure, and the prospect of EU funds for
expansion. This helped overcome Sony's criticisms of poor motorway links
into Liverpool city centre.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Underground to probe tunnelling method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground is to hold its own inquiry into the 'new Austrian'
tunnelling method which is being investigated by the Health &amp; Safety
Executive following the collapse of a tunnel under construction at Heathrow
Airport.
The latest inquiry has been launched by managers in charge of the Pounds
1.9bn Jubilee Line extension where work has halted on two stations - London
Bridge and Waterloo. Both stations were being built by the 'new Austrian'
method.
LU ordered work to stop on the stations following the Heathrow collapse.
Work has halted at two other stations being built as part of a Pounds 300m
rail link from Heathrow to Paddington station in central London.
LU is concerned that work on the two Jubilee Line stations should not be
delayed longer than necessary.
It hopes its investigation will enable an early decision on whether to
resume work using the 'new Austrian' method or switch to an alternative
method which might cost more but would prevent an even more expensive delay.
BAA, the airport operator, meanwhile, is conducting a separate inquiry into
the collapse at Heathrow.
The 'new Austrian' method requires engineers to utilise the strength of the
ground surrounding the tunnel and keep to a minimum the amount of extra
strengthening required to prevent collapse or catastrophic settlement.
A thin layer of fast-drying concrete is sprayed over the walls of the
tunnel. Once the project is sufficiently advanced a reinforced lining is
installed. The method, which allows faster construction and greater design
flexibility, can be up to a quarter cheaper than alternative tunnelling
techniques.
A delay in construction, however, would be very damaging if it meant that
the project could not open on time and start earning expected revenue as
happened at the Channel tunnel.
The Waterloo station, for the Jubilee Line, is part of a Pounds 157m
contract which includes constructing a new rail tunnel between Green Park
and Waterloo and a new station at Westminster. Only Waterloo station is
using the 'new Austrian' method.
The work on a new London Bridge station is a single contract worth Pounds
76m. Only two out of 12 stations for the Jubilee Line extension are being
built using the 'new Austrian' method.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Hostile bids ruled out in secret GEC and BAe deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC and British Aerospace negotiated a two-year agreement in July last year
barring either from making a hostile bid for the other as part of friendly
discussions on a merger of their defence interests.
The 'standstill' agreement does not expire until July next year and contains
clauses forbidding either company from talking about the deal.
In the competition between the two companies to buy VSEL, the shipbuilder,
GEC asked the Takeover Panel, which governs City deals, to force BAe to
disclose the existence of the standstill agreement.
It is understood that GEC wanted the pact made public because it felt that
it had a material impact on the value of the shares BAe is offering VSEL
shareholders.
The panel considered submissions from GEC and BAe and declined to act. The
panel is reluctant to force disclosure unless such agreements have a direct
financial impact on either company.
The companies made confidential financial information available to each
other last year, including management reports and long-range profit
projections. BAe insisted that in return for exchanging the share-price
sensitive data GEC should accept a standstill.
BAe refused to confirm or deny the existence of the agreement yesterday. Mr
Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director, said: 'We have many contracts
with GEC, all of which were freely entered into by both sides. However, we
do not comment on any specific contracts.' GEC also declined to comment.
The standstill agreement is apparently considered to be legally binding by
both sides, and prevents a hostile bid by GEC for BAe until the middle of
next year, contrary to speculation before the bids for VSEL.
GEC has made no secret of its interest in merging BAe's defence operations
with GEC-Marconi, its defence arm.
Since BAe had well-known financial difficulties in 1991-92, GEC was keen to
gain as much information as possible on BAe as part of the friendly talks
last year. It thus agreed to the standstill, limiting its freedom of action.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Labour cautious on coal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour does not intend to renationalise the coal industry, Mr Martin
O'Neill, shadow energy minister, said yesterday, apparently contradicting
previous party statements.
Last year's party conference backed a motion seeking to renationalise the
industry. Mr Robin Cook, former shadow trade secretary, told parliament in
March he would be 'astonished if our plans to rescue the coal industry did
not involve public ownership'.
But party leaders have never been comfortable with the policy, particularly
since the election of Mr Tony Blair. Mr O'Neill said yesterday that Labour
was not in the business of 'making blanket promises to renationalise'.
Speaking to the monthly meeting of the Coal Industry Society, Mr O'Neill
said that if any of the companies which are buying British Coal's mines got
into difficulties, 'government would have to look afresh at the question of
ownership.
'We will intervene at any time we feel that safety is endangered,' he said.
Fleshing out the leadership's thoughts on energy, Mr O'Neill said: 'We will
have to keep at arm's length those who advocate a particular kind of energy,
nuclear or gas or coal, because they see it as a job-creation scheme.'
He added: 'Worthy though such an approach may be, if it is at the expense of
other more valuable resources or in conflict with other more compelling
priorities we will have to make this abundantly clear.'

Canada and China yesterday signed deals on nuclear power and friendly aid.
Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien is leading a 300-strong delegation of
top executives and nine provincial premiers. The development aid accord
covers six projects to support Chinese administrative, legal and economic
reforms through the Canadian International Development Agreement. The
nuclear co-operation deal opens the way for trade in nuclear material and
equipment for peaceful uses, including a possible sale of four nuclear power
stations. China is the fifth nuclear-weapon state with which Canada has such
an agreement. The others are the US, Britain, Russia and France. Sale of
four heavy-water reactors would be worth up to USDollars 3.7bn to Canada's
nuclear industry.
Chinese customs figures show that in the first nine months of 1994 Canada
exported to China goods worth USDollars 1.1bn, up 3.8 per cent over the same
period in 1993, and imported Dollars 959m in goods from China, up 12.5 per
cent. China is Canada's fifth largest export market and Canada the 13th
largest market for Beijing, Chinese figures show.

<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German car maker, yesterday launched a new production
facility in Taiwan. By 1996 the assembly plant will reach capacity of 30,000
light commercial vehicles per year, of which 20,000 will be sold in Taiwan
and the rest exported to south-east Asia and, later, China.
The new company, Chinchun Motor, is a joint venture with Chinfon Global, a
Taiwanese industrial group with interests in manufacturing, construction and
banking. Volkswagen will provide technology and expertise and Chinfon the
facilities, management and administration. The products will be marketed
jointly. Chinfon holds 66.6 per cent of the paid-in capital of DM190m
(Dollars 127.5m) and Volkswagen holds the rest.
The Taiwan site may be expanded to produce 150,000 cars a year depending on
cross-strait political developments and China's smooth accession to Gatt. It
is hoped that eventually more sophisticated parts made in Taiwan may be
exported to supply Volkswagen's plants in China and completed engines made
in China will be brought to Taiwan to install in the Taiwan-made vehicles.
Taiwan requires that 50 per cent of parts be locally sourced.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Volume of N American air freight surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The air freight sector in North America is experiencing one of the best
pre-Christmas peaks in recent memory, with most airlines or cargo agents
reporting rising volumes to and from North America, Reuter reports from
Toronto.
'There's just an explosion of world trade occurring, and cargo is reaching a
new plateau,' according to Mr Mike Canney, a senior cargo manager at
Singapore Airlines in Los Angeles.
The recovery has been mounting on most big North Atlantic and Pacific
routes, eastbound and westbound. Some analysts attribute the rise to the
paradox that North American economies are strong while their currencies are
weak, stimulating imports and exports. Others say world trade reforms and
the North American Free Trade Agreement have lowered trade barriers.
The strongest surge this autumn is in traffic from Europe. Pacific traffic
has been growing rapidly in the last two years, but capacity growth has
tended to keep pace and, as yet, there is no capacity squeeze. Autumn is the
peak period for air cargo in North America as stores stock up for Christmas
while airlines scale back flying schedules from the summer passenger travel
peak.
The industry has been full of talk of a capacity crunch, but airlines were
reluctant to raise capacity, especially using freighters, to avoid being
stuck with the cost of flying empty.
'The capacity that's there is basically the same as last year's peak,' said
Mr Jack Veracoechea, the New York-based vice-president of national accounts
for British Airways World Cargo.
He said BA had not experienced significant backlogs in the US but demand was
very strong for all US routes.
On the other hand, Toronto and Montreal, cities where freighter services
axed during the recession have not been replaced, are experiencing serious
delays this year.
Although Danzas of Canada, is a big global freighter, it has taken up to 20
days to move goods from Italy to Toronto. Mr George Kuhn, president of
Danzas (Canada), said that a lack of sufficient direct services between
Italy and Canada meant cargo was being trucked to Paris, Frankfurt or
Zurich, where it became backlogged.
Lufthansa, the world's leading carrier for international air freight, also
raised ex-Canada rates on November 1 by up to 8 per cent. Industry experts
said Lufthansa's move confirmed their belief that cargo rates - long
depressed by overcapacity - might keep inching up for some time.
Air France and British Airways are among others which have already
implemented similar rate rises from North America, and virtually all
airlines have raised rates to North America by 5 to 15 per cent in the last
six months.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Boeing warns of battle for clients -
Excess capacity will boost competition despite fast growth in demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Demand for air travel in Asia will be the motor of growth for the world's
airlines and aircraft makers in the next two decades, the president of
Boeing, Mr Philip Condit, said yesterday.
However, excess capacity among manufacturers will produce an increasingly
difficult competitive environment, despite the rapid growth in demand for
new aircraft.
Mr Condit told an audience of Japanese businessmen that Boeing expected
world air travel to triple in the next 10 years. More than a fifth of that
growth was forecast within Asia, with a further 40 per cent linking Asia
with Europe and North America.
In China alone, rapid economic expansion was expected to increase the number
of airline trips per person by 20 times within 15 years.
That rate of growth would mean that by 2015 the country would have become
the third largest market for commercial aircraft after the US and Japan.
Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium and Boeing
rival, estimates that China will buy 300 aircraft during the next 10 years -
some 25 per cent of expected world deliveries. Airbus has been taking steps
to strengthen its presence in the fast growing Chinese market, and last week
announced the establishment of a flight crew training centre in Beijing.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas already operate similar facilities. Boeing,
which manufacturers part of the tail section for its 737 aircraft in China,
believes local manufacture helps in local sales. Mr Condit said the global
travel surge would translate into far higher demand for aircraft, with an
extra 700-800 commercial jets needed in the next 20 years. But since
aircraft makers were left with the capacity geared for earlier commercial
booms and military demand of cold war proportions, 'this will be a market
that has excess capacity until well into the next century'.
Boeing could single-handedly meet the extra demand for aircraft out of its
own capacity, he said. The result would be 'intense competition and intense
pressure on prices' for manufacturers and a 'difficult environment' for
airlines.
Mr Condit also said Boeing was studying plans to build a small 80-100-seat
passenger airliner to replace the company's 737 and rival McDonnell
Douglas's DC-9 models.
Last week China signed a contract for 34 V2500-powered McDonnell Douglas
MD-90 airliners with engines produced by International Aero Engines. The
first MD-90 is scheduled for delivery in early 1996 and half the aircraft
will be manufactured in China with US-supplied parts.
Mr Condit said that Boeing was considering 'a very large commercial
transport project' with 'huge costs and huge risks'.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Senate threat to Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation to implement the Uruguay Round trade treaty is in danger of
failing in the US Senate when members of both houses return for a special
post-election session later this month. This was the view put forward
yesterday by the business group dedicated to getting the accord passed.
The Alliance for Gatt Now published a list of 45 senators who could vote
against either a budget waiver, which is needed before the legislation could
come to the floor, or Gatt itself. Sixty of the 100 senators must vote in
favour if there is to be a waiver of the budget rules. The implementing
legislation alone needs only a simple majority.
Ms Liese Wright, a Gatt Now official, warned the situation could change
quickly. The coalition was 'pleased that Gatt did not become an election
issue', but worried about the effects of any Republican takeover of the
Senate.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, is on the list of those who
might vote against the waiver. The administration fears he will block Gatt
to appeal to the Republicans opposed to liberalised trade.
Some in the opposition see publication of the list as a fundraising ploy.
The coalition in favour of Gatt hopes to raise enough money to support a
advertising campaign to explain how delay would affect the the eight-year
effort to free world trade.

FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China signs contract for 34 McDonnell
Douglas airliners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreigh Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China has signed a contract for 34 V2500-powered McDonnell Douglas MD-90
airliners. The engines are produced by International Aero Engines, of which
Rolls-Royce is a principal shareholder.
The deal, which was signed in Washington, represents an increase of 14
aircraft over the previously announced number and the value of new business
for Rolls-Royce is about Dollars 50m. The first MD-90 is scheduled for
delivery in early 1996. Half the aircraft will be manufactured in China with
US-supplied parts.
Mr Li Lan Oing, vice-premier of China and Mr Ron Brown, US commerce
secretary, both attended the contract signing. The V2500 order book now
stands at 1,525 engines worth more than Dollars 8.5bn.
The V2500 has been ordered on the Airbus A320 and A321 and the MD-90-30 as
well as being available for the A319 and MD-90-50. Airbus Industrie, the
European aircraft manufacturing consortium, has been taking steps to
strengthen its presence in the fast growing Chinese market and last week
announced the establishment of a flight crew training centre in Beijing.
V2500 engines are manufactured by Rolls-Royce in the UK and by Pratt &amp;
Whitney in the US, the other principal shareholder. Other partners in
International Aero Engines are MTU and FiatAvio in Europe and JAEC in Japan.
The deal with China was signed last Friday and is worth a total of Dollars
1.6bn.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner for External Trade Relations,
yesterday warned that negotiations on China's re-entry to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were in danger of 'grinding to a halt' and
called for flexibility on terms for China's accession.
'We have insisted that China should show its intention to pursue reform
within the World Trade Organisation (the successor organisation to Gatt) by
making a down-payment in the form of progress now toward open markets,' Sir
Leon said.
'But we have also accepted that not all changes can come immediately and we
have argued with our Gatt colleagues that timetabled commitments to change .
. . are a more realistic basis for progress than expecting full reform
overnight.'
Sir Leon's comments, to a meeting of the International Business Leaders'
Advisory Council, reflect growing concern that time is running out on
negotiations for China's Gatt entry if it is to become a founder-member of
the WTO at the beginning of next year.
This has prompted thoughts of deferring China's entry to the WTOuntil later
next year. Sir Leon appeared to allude to this in his Shanghai speech: 'With
flexibility on all sides, we are still confident that the negotiations for
an early Chinese entry into Gatt/WTO can succeed. But the momentum must not
be lost.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Republicans eye Senate win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday spent the final 24 hours of a bruising
mid-term election campaign issuing dire warnings about the consequences of
the Republicans gaining control of Congress.
'Why,' he said in Minneapolis, 'would we want to give Congress to people who
want to take us back to what almost wrecked us in the 1980s?' Republican
campaigns were based on 'malice and cynicism - our least charitable
impulses, our lowest common denominator,' he said.
However, most of the opinion polls and much of the political comment ahead
of today's polls suggest that the Republicans stand on the cusp of wresting
back control of the Senate, which they last commanded in 1986. Even the
House of Representatives could fall to Republican control for the first time
in 40 years. Democrats also expect to lose several of the 22 governorships
they are defending out of 36 decided today.
The two Republican leaders, Senator Bob Dole and Congressman Newt Gingrich,
both forecast in the last 24 hours that the party would finish in the
majority in both chambers. Mr Gingrich put the likely Republican gain in the
House, where a 40-seat net gain would make him the next Speaker, at anything
between 30 and 75 seats, adding 'you really have to squeeze to get below
35.'
A New York Times analysis yesterday identified 124 seats as very competitive
in the 435-member House. Of these, 89 were being defended by Democrats and
only 34 by Republicans, with the lone independent Congressman, Mr Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, under threat from a Republican.
Mr Clinton spent his final hours of campaigning in three states where
Democratic Senate candidates are given a chance of winning today. He started
in Minnesota, where Ms Ann Wynia is running even with Republican Rod Grams
for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator David Durenburger.
He moved on to Michigan, where Congressman Bob Carr, the Democrat, appears
behind Mr Spence Abraham in the race to succeed the retiring Senator Don
Riegle, the Democrat. Last stop was in Delaware, where Mr Charles Oberly,
the Democratc state attorney general, is trying to unseat Senator William
Roth.
Mr Clinton's campaign attacks on the Republicans were preceded by a less
confrontational television interview on Sunday. Though he predicted his
party would retain control of Congress, he said that win or lose he was
ready to work with Republicans if they were sincere about bi-partisan
co-operation.
Some scattered late opinion polls polls gave individual Democrats reason to
hope. In New York, Governor Mario Cuomo was leading Republican Mr George
Pataki by 50-37 per cent in one survey, but by only 44-40 per cent in
another.
In Virginia, the weekend Richmond Times-Despatch poll gave Senator Charles
Robb, the Democrat, 39 per cent to 31 per cent for Republican challenger Mr
Oliver North and 12 per cent for Mr Marshall Coleman, the independent.
Other surveys have given the Senator an infinitesimal lead and Mr North,
dismissing any suggestion he might lose, predicted he would triumph by 3
points or more on the basis of his private polls.

Three months ago, they braved the Straits of Florida on makeshift rafts in a
bid to escape from Cuba to the US, reports George Graham in Washington. But
in a striking reversal this weekend, dozens of Cuban refugees, broke down
fences and leaped from a cliff into mine-strewn waters to swim back to Cuba
from the US military base at Guantanamo Bay. Fed up after languishing in the
camp since August, a group of 85 tried to flee, but only 39 made it to Cuba.
The rest were caught by US troops and returned. In all, about 32,000 Cubans
are interned at Guantanamo, which the US still leases from Cuba, and in
Panama.

FT  08 NOV 94 / More troops to quit Haiti and Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US plans to withdraw nearly 14,000 of its troops from Kuwait and Haiti
over the next six weeks.
The withdrawal will leave around 9,000 US troops in Haiti to supervise the
parliamentary elections scheduled for January, but in Kuwait the US will
keep only prepositioned heavy equipment and aircraft.
Administration officials said the decision, approved by President Bill
Clinton at the weekend, had nothing to do with today's congressional
elections. Indeed, they said the White House had asked the Pentagon not to
make a public announcement of the withdrawals because it would look like a
political ploy.
'The drawdown of forces in Haiti is linked to mission accomplishment, not to
artificial timetables,' said Mr William Perry, the defence secretary.
Nevertheless, the news that most of the US soldiers now deployed in Haiti
and Kuwait will be home in time for Christmas is expected to be popular.
Mr Clinton had hinted at a December pullout when he visited US troops in
Kuwait recently, telling soldiers not to forget their Christmas shopping.
This had reportedly caused some morale problems among soldiers in Haiti, who
felt they were being overlooked.
The 7,800 US troops in Kuwait are expected to be back in the US by December
22. They went to Kuwait after Iraq had shown some signs of threatening a
second invasion of the emirate by building up its forces in the south.
The navy and marine forces already in the Gulf region before the Iraqi
build-up will stay in position, and the US will also keep an extra 50
warplanes, mostly ground attack aircraft, in the Gulf.
The US has already withdrawn 6,000 of the 21,000-strong force it sent to
Haiti in September to oversee the safe return of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide and to ensure the departure of the military leaders who ousted him
in a coup in 1991.
This weekend's order will mean that another 6,000 troops can return to the
US by December 1.
US officials said that troops from other countries such as Bangladesh had
now taken over some of the security duties originally fulfilled by the US
occupation force.
In addition, around 3,000 Haitians who have been trained by United Nations
instructors are expected to be ready to take over policing responsibilities
next month.
In Port-au-Prince yesterday, a new prime minister was expected to take over
after a vote of confidence in the lower chamber of the Haitian parliament.
Mr Smarck Michel, chosen by Mr Aristide for the post, had already won
approval from the Haitian senate.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Uruguay elections marked by factionalism: David Pilling
previews what amounts to a poll on the reforms of the past five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Uruguay, elections come only once every five years, but when they do they
all come together. On November 27, 2.8m Uruguayan voters will elect a new
president, 90 deputies and 30 senators (the entire congress) and 19
governors.
As if this were not enough, the electoral system, described as 'crazy' even
by government ministers, combines party primaries with national elections,
leading to fierce factionalism.
Three competing candidates for president have emerged from the governing
National party, or Blancos, while the opposition Colorado party, not to be
outdone, has three of its own. Altogether there are 21 hopefuls for
president.
Elections have transformed Uruguay - normally a tranquil, relatively
prosperous backwater wedged between Argentina and Brazil - into a frenzy of
music-blaring campaign buses and party pamphlets littering the cobbled
streets.
At issue, in essence, is whether Uruguayans support or reject the
neo-liberal reforms that have been tentatively ushered in by the current
Blanco president, Mr Luis Alberto Lacalle. Mr Lacalle has tried to re-impose
fiscal discipline, has halved annual inflation to about 40 per cent and
opened the economy to foreign competition. He has been less successful in
attempts to slim the huge state bureaucracy, to privatise state enterprises
or to reform the bankrupt pay-as-you-go state pension scheme.
Elected with only a 22 per cent mandate, Mr Lacalle saw much of his attempts
at structural reform beaten back by parliament. He has also faced hostility
from a public accustomed to the benefits of Latin America's most developed
welfare state. Uruguayans - whose ageing population is being supported by a
diminishing tax-paying workforce - are suspicious of all attempts to
overhaul the social security system.
A few months ago it seemed that public distaste for Mr Lacalle's policies
was certain to return power to the Colorados, led by former President Julio
Sanguinetti. Last May, the Colorados were 15 points ahead of the
third-placed Blancos in poll ratings, but by November the Blancos had drawn
level on 30 points.
'This trend now makes the Blancos the most likely winners . . . although the
opinion polls do not allow one to predict with certainty,' says Mr Michele
Santo, contributor to the Busqueda weekly.
According to Mr Augustin Canzani, director of Equipos polling and research
consultancy, that turnaround reflects 'lagging' recognition of economic
progress during the Lacalle term, including accumulated economic growth over
the five years of about 19 per cent.
Mr Canzani believes the government, though unpopular for much of its
duration, has won an 'ideological victory' by persuading the public of the
need for responsible economic policies. 'Because we never had hyperinflation
we never worried much as long as (inflation) stayed below three digits - now
we do,' he says.
Of the four serious presidential contenders, two Blanco candidates represent
a continuation of Mr Lacalle's programme. Mr Juan Ramrez, Lacalle's
handpicked successor, and Mr Alberto Volonte, a lawyer and 'non-politician',
are distinguishable more by their styles than by any ideological difference.
Both would seek to bring down inflation further, cut state jobs and push
through a repackaged version of privatisation.
Mr Sanguinetti, who offers a social democratic alternative, is campaigning
on the issues of unemployment (now more than 8 per cent), a depressed
manufacturing sector and the large trade deficit, expected to reach about
Dollars 900m this year. He recently backed away from suggestions of an
export-boosting peso devaluation, but has hinted that he would like to
renegotiate some aspects of the Mercosur customs union with Argentina,
Brazil and Paraguay.
Mr Tabare Vazquez, the left-wing mayor of Montevideo, heads the Encuentro
Progresista, a broad coalition that advocates an uncertain mix of
redistributive and market-oriented policies. Mr Vazquez, who is hugely
popular in Montevideo, has so far been unable to build adequate support in
the more conservative interior and by November was trailing the Blancos and
Colorados by 6 percentage points.
Latest polls show Mr Sanguinetti with 19 per cent, against 11 and 9 per cent
for the two Blanco candidates, Mr Volonte and Mr Ramirez respectively.
However, because of the peculiarities of the electoral system, such a lead
by no means assures Mr Sanguinetti of victory. The president must come from
the winning party, so if the Colorados fail to win at party level Mr
Sanguinetti would not become president even if he collected the most votes.
Victory may be only the first hurdle. 'Whoever wins will probably have even
less congressional support than Lacalle,' says Mr Canzani.
'The political system functions in a way that encourages factions,' says a
diplomat, 'which makes it difficult to create and maintain a coherent policy
course over five years.'
Such an analysis augurs badly for those in the government who believe that
Uruguay must adapt to the changing times. In order to untap the 'colossal
potential' of Mercosur's huge market, the country must learn to compete,
says Mr Ignacio de Posadas, the foreign minister. Those who believe it can
continue to muddle through, ignoring the sweeping changes throughout the
continent, are deluding themselves, he says. 'That kind of thinking could
become very dangerous.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Israeli economy shows overheating signs: Fast growth may be
in jeopardy, the central bank governor tells Julian Ozanne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's economy is growing faster than expected but is showing signs of
over-heating with rising inflation, high wage agreements in the public
sector and an increase in private consumption.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, warned in an interview yesterday
that the government faced a serious policy challenge in 1995 to ensure
growth would be sustainable. Without a reduction in labour costs, government
expenditure and the public sector wage bill, high medium-term growth of 5
per cent a year could be in jeopardy.
'I think we have just the right conditions to justify a vigorous effort to
stabilise,' he said. 'Our economy is growing quickly, there are clear signs
of over-heating reflected both in the rapid rise of consumption and in a
growing current account deficit. Restrictive macro-economic policies are
warranted on the fiscal and monetary front.'
Mr Frenkel said the economy would grow 6.7 per cent this year, well above
the forecast of 5.3 per cent and last year's 3.4 per cent. The growth he
said was of a 'healthy variety', driven principally by private sector
activity, expected to grow 7.7 per cent, and a 16.3 per cent increase in
non-housing investment.
However a significant part of 1994 economic growth reflects a 10 per cent
increase in private consumption fuelled by civilian imports, which will
increase by 13 per cent. The trade deficit for 1994 is expected to widen
from Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.6bn) to Dollars 8.3bn, causing the current
account deficit to grow from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 3bn.
'If you ask me, based on these figures, whether economic growth is
sustainable the answer is no because private sector consumption has grown at
a rate which exceeds the rate of income growth,' Mr Frenkel said.
Private consumption in 1994 has been stimulated by growing perceptions of
economic growth, the rapid fall in unemployment this year from 10 per cent
to 7.2 per cent and public sector wage increases of 10 per cent in real
terms.
Mr Frenkel said the real danger was the spill-over of public sector wage
rises into the private sector. 'If this happens it will affect profitability
and might have adverse consequences for investment and growth and will also
make the fight against inflation so much more difficult.'
Economists at the central bank are urging the government to reduce private
sector labour costs, slash its wage bill - which has risen 6 per cent this
year - and curb expenditure to ensure a continuing decrease of the budget
deficit, which is expected to fall to 2 per cent of gross domestic product
this year.
The bank is advocating a 3 per cent cut in the public workforce, which has
grown 5.8 per cent this year from 575,500 to 608,600 and says this could be
achieved by a hiring freeze.
Government action on public expenditure will be critical to fighting
inflation, now at 14 per cent. While the central bank has increased interest
rates 6.5 percentage points since last year, many economists believe it
should have acted faster. Mr Ptachia Bar-Shavit, economist at Bank Hapoalim,
said the central bank mistook the inflation trend in the summer of 1993,
which showed a seasonal reduction, and reacted slowly.
However, the central bank had to fight for tight monetary policy against
criticism from the finance ministry and manufacturers. It also says the main
contributor to inflation was housing costs, which are expected to rise 30
per cent this year. Government measures such as increased sale of public
land and re-designating land uses from agriculture to housing have yet to be
effective.
Mr Bar-Shavit said the government had not done enough to solve the housing
crisis and said the government should introduce a buy-back policy to ensure
builders operated at full capacity. He said housing costs would only come
down significantly when builders produced 50,000 new units a year instead of
the less than 40,000 units started this year.
The bank, however, says interest rate rises have contained the acceleration
of inflation. Together with the government, it has decided on an inflation
target of 8-11 per cent for 1995.
'Up to now we have contained the acceleration and now we are in the phase of
a gradual reduction towards the inflation target,' said Mr Frenkel.
Economists say the achievements of 1994 should not be underrated. Mr
Bar-Shavit said per capita income would grow 4.4 per cent, greater than the
OECD industrialised countries. Reduction in unemployment, given continuing
absorption of about 70,000 new immigrants annually, was also an impressive
achievement he said.
Export growth of 8 per cent this year partly reflects benefits from the
Middle East peace process. Exports of goods to Asia, excluding Japan, are
set to rise 25-30 per cent this year from Dollars 1.7bn in 1993.

Mr Solomon Mamaloni was yesterday elected prime minister of the Solomon
Islands, following the resignation of Mr Francis Billy Hilly, the previous

government would review logging policy, and warned that the Pacific nation's
economic condition was 'precarious'. Logging in the Solomons has been the
subject of international attention, with criticism levelled at some of the
foreign companies operating there. Mr Mamaloni, 1982-84 and 1989-93 prime
minister, is a popular figure in the Solomon Islands. But he can be
unpredictable and in the past has fallen out with other governments,
according to a diplomat in Honiara.

over 2,000 former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the African National
Congress's armed wing, had been dismissed from the South African National
Defence Force for failing to report to duty despite numerous government
warnings. The decision marks a new hard line by the ANC-led government on
dissent by former guerrillas who have complained of harsh discipline and
poor living conditions while being assimilated into the SANDF. About 25,000
former Umkhonto members, and several thousand others from the former
homeland armies and the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, are due

The Indian finance ministry will allow foreigners, including Indians
residing outside the country, to become directors of joint venture
stockbroking companies, it said yesterday. The ministry said clauses of the
Securities Contracts Rules, 1957, would be amended 'to allow joint-venture
stock broking companies to have non-Indian citizens on their boards of
directors'.

Mr Imamali Rakhmonov, Tajikistan's parliamentary chairman and acting head of
state, won the republic's first presidential election, taking 60 per cent of
the vote, according to official preliminary results announced yesterday. His
opponent, Mr Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, a former prime minister and at present
Tajikistan's ambassador to Moscow, won 35 per cent in Sunday's contest. An
official said more than 90 per cent of the 2.6m electorate had voted for a
new constitution, which among other things creates a presidential system. Mr
Abdulajanov's team alleged on Sunday there had been cases of ballot boxes
being fraudulently stuffed with votes for Mr Rakhmonov, and that other votes
had been tampered with.
Many opposition leaders are in exile in Afghanistan, from where their
fighters have been launching cross-border raids since losing a civil war in
late 1992. Some analysts said that, given an opposition boycott, the
election would not help resolve deep problems in Tajikistan, where clan
loyalty is seen as more important than ideology.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Bank lottery lures Japan's savers

<TEXT>
Cynics who have come to regard opening a Japanese bank account as tantamount
to buying a ticket in a lottery have had their suspicions confirmed.
Johnan Shinkin Bank, the country's largest credit association, yesterday
launched a deposit account that includes eligibility for a raffle with cash
prizes of up to Y50,000 (Pounds 317).
The one-year 'Super Dream' account, the first of its kind, can be opened
with a minimum deposit of Y100,000 and carries an interest rate of 2.1 per
cent per year, in line with one-year deposit account rates at other leading
banks.
But every six months, account holders will be entered into a kind of
financial tombola, with winners receiving between Y3,000 and Y50,000 when
their deposits mature. More than 4,000 prizes will be won every half-year
and bank officials said the structure of the lottery would give customers a
3.38 per cent chance of winning something.
Johnan Shinkin's scheme is the latest in a proliferating series of special
attractions offered by banks to lure customers in a more challenging, less
regulated competitive environment. A key element in the recent financial
deregulation has been the liberalisation of deposit interest rates.
The process began a decade ago but was completed only last month, when all
remaining controls on banks' deposit rates were lifted.
The reforms leave banks in the unfamiliar position of having to compete
energetically for depositors.
Among the more successful post-liberalisation campaigns has been one by a
regional bank that fixed its interest rate to the batting average of the
local baseball star.
More predictably, there has been a rapid growth in the number of accounts
carrying with them the sort of cute freebies for which the Japanese have a
penchant.
The frontiers of consumer choice in this field have recently been extended
to include giveaway toys depicting everything from Walt Disney's creations
to the increasingly popular 'Dinky the Dinosaur' cartoon character.
But the more serious competition centres on the pecuniary advantage that
banks are now able to offer their customers. Since last month's changes, a
small but significant differential has opened up between bank deposit rates.
The gap seems set set to grow wider, which will threaten the already anaemic
profitability of Japan's banks as demand for lending remains sluggish, and
they struggle with a heavy burden of non-performing loans.
Johnan Shinkin estimates that the Super Dream account will cost the bank
about the same as an extra 0.2 percentage point added to interest on a
one-year deposit.

<TEXT>
Mr Luciano Benetton, hosting a reception in Tokyo yesterday, shrugged off
his team's defeat in the Japanese Grand Prix at the hands of Damon Hill in a
Williams-Renault. But even though 155,000 motor racing enthusiasts sat in
the rain on Sunday watching the duel with Benetton-Ford's Michael
Schumacher, the allure of Formula One racing in Japan seems to be on the
wane.
Until last year, eager fans snapped up tickets at triple the normal price of
Y31,000 (Pounds 196). This year, a 30 per cent discount has failed to
attract buyers. Television audience ratings have also steadily fallen,
hitting Fuji Television Network, which acquired F-1 broadcasting rights in
1987, while two out of five car racing magazines have closed.
In addition to the declining benefits of advertising due to shrinking
audiences, corporate sponsorship has been hit by the economic downturn, and
deteriorating earnings have dulled the appeal of having the fastest-moving
logo on earth.
The number of sponsoring companies has fallen to a fifth of the 50 in 1991.
Footwork, a parcel delivering company which pulled out last year, said it
thought the role of Grands Prix as a marketing tool was over.
Industry analysts started to detect a peaking in F-1 popularity after the
retirement in 1991 of Satoru Nakajima, the leading Japanese driver. Honda
Motor, whose engines won the constructor's championship for six consecutive
years from 1986 to 1991, announced its withdrawal in 1992. The final blow
appears to have been the death earlier this year of Ayrton Senna, the
Brazilian world champion.
So will Japanese fans return if the economy recovers and the glitz in F-1
racing returns? 'The Japanese get hot easily but they also cool just as
fast,' says Mr Mutsumi Kumagai of Auto Sports, one of the remaining car
racing magazines. 'Maybe Japan needs a second Senna to attract a new
generation of supporters.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / S Korea eases curb on business with North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday announced a gradual easing of
restrictions on economic ties with North Korea following the recent
settlement of the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
Seoul is expected to announce tomorrow that South Korean businessmen may
visit North Korea to discuss proposed investment projects and establish
representative offices in the North.
Direct investments of less than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.1m) will be permitted,
and machinery used in reprocessing commissions from South Korean companies,
such as for textiles, can be shipped to North Korea.
But the measures stop short of allowing the large investments that North
Korea is seeking from South Korea's main industrial groups.
South Korean officials view full-scale economic co-operation as a carrot to
persuade a reluctant North Korea to resume talks with South Korea on such
issues as intra-Korean nuclear inspections.
The partial lifting of the restrictions essentially returns the North-South
economic relationship to the situation two years ago before co-operation was
suspended as a result of North Korea's threat to withdraw from international
nuclear safeguards.
South Korea's main economic organisations, which have been lobbying for the
easing of restrictions, welcomed the announcement.
Mr Kim said a key test of North Korea's willingness to co-operate would be
its acceptance of South Korean nuclear reactors stipulated under the recent
nuclear accord between Washington and Pyongyang. He also expressed support
for North Korea's participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum.
North Korea meanwhile said yesterday it would hold meetings with the US in
the next few weeks to implement the recent agreement to dismantle its
nuclear programme.
Talks on the disposal of the North's spent fuel rods, capable of producing
five nuclear bombs, will be held in Pyongyang from November 12 to 19.
Consultations on the supply of light water reactors to North Korea to
replace its graphite reactors, which can produce large amounts of
weapons-grade plutonium, will be conducted in Beijing from November 30,
while discussions on the opening of a liaison office between the US and
North Korea will be held in Washington from December 6 to 10.

FT  08 NOV 94 / China explores the merits of regional economic links: The
background to President Jiang's four-nation South-east Asian tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When China's President Jiang Zemin leaves today for visits to Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia - where he is to attend the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum - and Vietnam, he will be engaging in what Chinese media
aree describing as a 'new diplomatic drive'.
This probably overstates the case, but there is also no doubt that Mr
Jiang's mission is one of his more important forays abroad. His meeting with
President Bill Clinton during the Apec summit will be the centrepiece of his
four-nation tour.
The two last met in Seattle at the first Apec summit a year ago under less
auspicious circumstances. Then human rights issues predominated. The US had
not severed the link between renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status and human rights. With that irritant removed it should be possible
for leaders of the two Pacific powers to talk more constructively about such
issues as the future of Apec itself and its evolution into a trade
liberalisation vehicle which depends on active Chinese involvement.
But any concessions on that score are likely to come at a price. In the
lead-up to Apec, Chinese officials have made it clear that Beijing would
look more favourably on an Apec free trade zone proposal, however nebulous
that proposal may be, if lingering argument over its application to re-join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were resolved.
As the Apec summit draws nearer Chinese officials are making the link
between the two issues even more explicit. In a weekend newspaper interview
Mr Long Yongtu, an assistant minister in the foreign trade ministry, asked:
'Is China's Gatt accession good for trade liberalisation advocated by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum?'
This is an argument that Mr Clinton is likely to hear directly from Mr
Jiang. China, in seeking Gatt entry, is playing the Apec card, knowing that
influential Apec members, such as Australia, wish to secure broad
endorsement for the implementation by 2020 of the proposed Asia-Pacific Free
Trade Zone proposal.
Mr Jiang is likely to stop short, however, of backing a timetable except in
the vaguest possible terms. This reflects Beijing's caution about committing
itself to regional institutional arrangements unless it can be sure that
these will work to its advantage. China's persistent fear is that such
forums could be used to assert pressure on issues such as human rights and
trade liberalisation.
Chinese foreign policy research institutes, including the Academy of Social
Sciences, recently advised the government to join efforts to broaden Apec,
but to avoid specific commitments to a free trade zone timetable. Professor
Zhang Yunling, director the academy's Asia Pacific Studies Institute, and
one of the authors of the study, said that while China saw growing regional
co-operation as an 'irreversible trend', it was not yet clear whether Apec
was the most appropriate framework for such a process.
'China is improving gradually its understanding of the region. It has no
choice but actively to participate, but at the same time it has to find ways
not to harm itself,' he says.
Mr Jiang's visits to Malaysia and Singapore will be largely ceremonial,
although in Kuala Lumpur China's president will feel obliged to repeat
Beijing's endorsement of a Malaysian proposal for an East Asia Economic
Caucus. Beijing has indicated at best a tepid enthusiasm for the EAEC.
Mr Jiang's visit to Vietnam on the last stop of his Asian tour may require
some nimble diplomatic footwork, but Prof Zhang does not expect the
continuing dispute over territory in the South China Sea to mar the visit.
He said that the two sides had no interest at this stage in allowing
relations to deteriorate. He noted that cross-border trade was flourishing
and that both countries were intent on developing their economies after
barren years. This dictated a stable regional environment.
At a personal level, Mr Jiang's extensive tour also assumes importance. He
will be hoping that his appearance on a world stage at the Apec forum will
bolster his stocks at home in this transitional phase to a new generation of
Chinese leaders.

<TEXT>
Japan and the US will today begin their largest joint military exercise, a
sign of their wish to keep trade tensions separate from strategic links.
More than 26,000 men, roughly half from each side, will take part in the
exercise, called Keen Edge 1995, over the next five days in northern Japan.
The aim of the exercise, part of a series started in 1986, is to defend
Japan from an imaginary invasion by sea and air.
This latest exercise, planned last year, coincides with a visit yesterday by
Mr Walter Slocombe, US under-secretary of defence, designed to bolster
US-Japan security co-operation.
After a meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, Mr Slocombe called
for more co-operation between the two countries in international
peacekeeping and the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
The military manoeuvres are the latest reminder of the sharp policy switch
by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister.
Mr Murayama used to oppose the US-Japan defence treaty and Japan's right to
maintain military forces, but soon dropped those policies after coming to
power in June, in order to fall into line with his conservative Liberal
Democratic party coalition partners.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Indonesian labour leader jailed for three years
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leader of Indonesian's largest independent trade union was sentenced to
three years' imprisonment yesterday by a court in the northern Sumatran town
of Medan, where workers' demonstrations led to riots in April.
Mr Muchtar Pakpahan was sentenced for allegedly inciting the Medan workers
to riot by encouraging them to call for higher wages. Prosecutors had
demanded that the leader of the Jakarta-based independent Indonesian
Prosperous Labour Union (SBSI) should serve a four-year jail sentence.
The sentence comes a week before leaders from the Asia Pacific region,
including US President Bill Clinton, are due to meet at the Indonesian
presidential palace in Bogor, south of Jakarta, for the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation summit. Mr Clinton is expected to raise the issue of
workers' rights with President Suharto and the US embassy in Jakarta said
yesterday that Washington regretted the sentence.
The trial of Mr Pakpahan, who said he would appeal, has drawn strong
criticism from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
non-governmental organisations which repeatedly asked the Indonesian
government to drop the charges.
President Suharto and Mr Abdul Latief, manpower minister, insist the trial
is not an attack on workers' rights and that Mr Pakpahan was arrested
because of the activities which occurred during the rioting.
Mr Pakpahan denied he was involved in the Medan riots, which lasted several
days, pointing out that he was in the central Javanese town of Semarang at
the time.
The military blames the SBSI for causing the riots, which left one ethnic
Chinese businessman dead and property damaged. Although other leading
members of the SBSI say they called for workers to strike, they say they did
not incite the rioting.
Mr Pakpahan's trial, which lasted nearly two months, was fraught with
difficulties and his 19 defence lawyers walked out repeatedly during court
hearings in protest at the restrictions imposed by the court on allowing
testimony for their case.
The trial was delayed once after Mr Pakpahan collapsed during an early
hearing in September. 'He was under so much pressure and there were so many
restrictions, so he was not in good condition,' said an SBSI official.
Mr VD Napipulah, the chief judge, told Mr Pakpahan: 'You have shown during
the trial that you do not appreciate this court and have been inclined to
denigrate the importance of the government apparatus,' adding: 'You have
also tried to complicate the process of this court during the trial.'
The US has twice delayed a decision on whether to renew Indonesia's status
under the Generalised System of Preferences which is linked to progress made
in workers' rights.
Washington's main concerns in renewing Indonesia's trade privileges involve
the right of Indonesian workers to form an independent trade union and
reducing military interference in labour issues. Indonesia has two trade
union groupings but only one, run by state bureaucrats, is recognised by the
government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is set to be included in a Dollars 6bn proposal to develop
Kazakhstan's largest gas field, as pressure mounts on the western partners
in the deal to reach agreement with Moscow by the end of November.
Kazakhstan television reported that Mr Yeset Azerbayev, head of the state
gas company, had urged British Gas and Agip, its Italian partner, to approve
by November 30 a proposal for Gazprom to join the development consortium
with a 15 per cent share of the two western companies' stake in the huge
Karachaganak gas field.
He threatened to scrap an agreement giving the two companies exclusive right
to negotiate the development of the field unless they meet the deadline. 'If
it is not signed by November 30, then we shall consider ourselves free from
any obligations under the agreement with the British Gas and Agip joint
venture which we signed in June 1992,' Mr Azerbayev said.
Inclusion of Gazprom is meant to persuade the company to agree to ship
Karachaganak's production through Russia's pipeline system to markets in the
west.
Gazprom discovered and partially developed Karachaganak. It also controls a
large gas treatment centre outside the nearby Russian city of Orenburg,
which was built in large part to process Karachaganak gas. The field
contains proven reserves of 1.3 thousand billion cubic metres of natural
gas, 650m tonnes of gas condensate and 200m tonnes of oil.
British Gas says no official deadline has been set, although dates have been
suggested for the completion of the current round of negotiations with the
Kazakhs.
The company has been negotiating separately with Gazprom over transport and
tariff issues, as well as discussing the terms of its possible participation
in the scheme. The talks have been complicated by uncertainty within Gazprom
over which Russian fields it wants to develop for future export and domestic
sales. The Kazakh threat against the western partners may just be an attempt
to get the long-delayed project moving.
But it also indicates the pressure under which the Kazakh government is
operating to generate hard currency export earnings.
Russia has recently made clear that it wants to take part in large energy
projects discovered during the Soviet era and now proposed for development
in the former Soviet republics surrounding the Caspian Sea.
Lukoil, a Russian oil company, this year succeeded in getting a 10 per cent
share of an Dollars 8bn Azerbaijan oil deal led by British Petroleum.
But the Kazakhstan project appears to be the first in which Russia is poised
to acquire a percentage of the western partners' share.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Russia tries to end securities market chaos
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia issued a long awaited decree yesterday,
aimed at regulating the country's fledgling and chaotic securities market.
The decree, in part a reaction to the collapse of the MMM finance company in
early autumn which ruined thousands of small savers, should also provide a
legislative underpinning to a market in which both domestic and foreign
investors have been wary of investing because of the lack of an adequate
method of registering shares.
The decree, as reported by the Interfax news agency, says that all banks and
other financial institutions must be licensed by the government - 'in
concert with the central bank' - by the end of the year. It allows the
distribution of government securities, registered shares of corporations and
banks, options and warrants of securities, bonds, housing certificates and
other securities permitted by law.
Several Russian funds have taken advantage of investors' gullibility by
offering high rates of interest, sucking in money and then either vanishing
or closing down. The most notorious collapse was that of the MMM fund, whose
head, Mr Sergei Mavrodi, is now ignoring investors' demands for their money
back since he suspended trading in company shares.
The Yeltsin decree also orders the formation of a federal commission for
securities and the stock market, to be headed by Mr Anatoly Chubais  - the
new first deputy prime minister for the economy and finance. Previous rules
and decrees for a commission affiliated to the president's office have been
scrapped.
The present commission, largely inactive, has been composed of
representatives from the central bank, the ministry of finance, the
anti-monopoly committee and other official organisations. The president's
decree calls for a list of members of the new commission to be drawn up
within a month, and for the commission to set out a licensing procedure and
define the responsibilities of the financial institutions operating in the
market.
The decree has been issued as work advances on establishing a country-wide
network of brokers to deal in the shares of the 20,000 companies the
privatisation process has brought on to the market and to cater for an
estimated 40m shareholders. Groups of brokers have been assembled in Moscow,
St Petersburg and the other main regions of Russia. A dealing system based
on the Nasdaq screen-based model should be in place by early next year.
A consultant to the government charged with developing the broker network
said last night: 'In a country the size of Russia, with so many regional
centres across eight time zones, we will see emerging a system where most
deals are handled by regional dealers, handling regional companies, for
regional investors. However, maybe 100, growing to 500, companies will be of
interest to foreign investors.'
The decree does not make clear, however, how far the central bank will have
responsibility for regulating and intervening in the market, if at all.
The issue could be important as there is a fierce debate in Russia on the
relative benefits of the Anglo-American system of raising capital largely
through a freely operating stock exchange, and the German system whereby
commercial banks, under Bundesbank regulation, play a larger part in capital
provision and often join in the management of big industrial companies.
However, the most influential Russian officials concerned with the
development of the markets - especially Mr Dmitri Vassiliev, the deputy
chairman of the privatisation committee - appear to prefer the
Anglo-American model.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Moscow debt fears resurface: Appointment of new negotiator
causes concern on markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Russia's negotiations on a debt which totals Dollars 90bn
(Pounds 55bn) are now causing concern on the world's financial markets
following the appointment over the weekend of Mr Oleg Davydov, the trade
minister, to the post of chief debt negotiator.
Mr Davydov, who has had little experience in the world of debt negotiations,
inherits a complex portfolio which had been commanded by Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the deputy premier for the economy who resigned on Friday. Mr
Shokhin had proposed that the negotiations be continued by Mr Andrei
Vavilov, the first deputy finance minister, but the latter is under a cloud
because of his alleged negligence on 'Black Tuesday' a month ago, when the
rouble lost more than 20 per cent of its value.
Mr Davydov, uninvolved in 'Black Tuesday', is on record as proposing that
Russia should be forgiven its debt - a move which sparked alarm at the time
in the Paris and London clubs of government and commercial bank creditors.
Mr Shokhin later denied that this was a serious option for Russia.
'Davydov is very much not a banker and will take time to come up the
learning curve on debt,' said one merchant banker yesterday. 'He may change
his views, but it's alarming.'
Deutsche Bank, the leading German bank which heads the negotiations on the
repayment of bank debt, is due to hold a further round of negotiations next
week.
Whether or not the Russian side agrees to keep to this schedule is now
regarded as an early test of the intentions of Mr Davydov.
Outline agreements were thrashed out in Madrid for both sets of talks -
agreements which Mr Shokhin expressed satisfaction with, although important
issues still have to be settled.
Both provisional deals involve restructuring the debts over 15-18 years,
with a five-year grace period for at least the repayment of principal.
In the case of the commercial bank debt, the agreement also includes a
repayment of interest over 10 years, possibly with a five-year grace period
 -and with a payment of Dollars 750,000 on the interest accruing this year
and last, to be made before the end of 1994. Talks were stalled by the crash
of the rouble a month ago - and are again in doubt because of the cabinet
changes still going on.
However, Mr Madhav Dhar, a managing director of Morgan Stanley in New York,
said last night: 'Russia is getting very hot now a lot of people see it as
the new frontier, but are prevented from buying equities because of legal
problems. The next best thing is debt - and that will sustain the market in
spite of the changes, which at present seem clearly negative.'
Russian debt slipped from around 35 cents to the dollar to 28 last week.
Ironically, it recovered yesterday to around 30 cents to the dollar as big
buyers, rumoured to be from within Russia itself, pushed up the price. One
London analyst of the market said last night: 'It is a very volatile market
with enormous flows going both ways right now. People are simply divided on
the issue of what the changes mean in the short and longer terms.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / EU split over Ukraine loan: UK resistance to Germany's aid
call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A German-led drive to promote an activist European Union policy to assist
Ukraine yesterday ran into resistance from Britain and other member states.
The split occurred at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels
yesterday over a proposal to provide an Ecu85m (Pounds 67m) balance of
payments loan to Ukraine.
It suggests that the EU is divided over the key question of whether
President Leonid Kuchma can deliver on his promises of economic reform. In
the background are differing assessments of Ukraine's chances of remaining a
viable state in relation to neighbouring Russia.
Germany - supported by the US and the European Commission - is pressing for
early, generous financial aid to President Kuchma. Their collective view is
that a narrow window of opportunity exists in order to stave off economic
collapse and preserve Ukrainian independence.
But the UK government is pursuing a more cautious policy.
Senior British officials are understood to have doubts about President
Kuchma's ability to face down the diehard conservatives in the Ukrainian
parliament, and want tighter controls on western aid via the International
Monetary Fund.
Other EU member states - notably the UK, France and Italy - are also
reluctant to allow the Commission to play an active role in promoting and
operating balance of payments loans to the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe.
Their reluctance is symptomatic of the broader battle over how far the
Commission should take the lead in the development of a common foreign and
security policy in Europe as laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
More narrowly, the Rome government is reluctant to support a balance of
payments loan since Ukraine has yet to settle outstanding debts with Italian
companies. Ukraine, with a population of 53m people, has a total foreign
debt of around Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.2bn).
Since President Kuchma's election last July, the Kiev government has
launched a campaign to persuade western donors that it is committed to
economic reform and that they should provide financial aid and debt relief.
Last month, the Ukrainian national bank passed a decree to unify the
exchange rate, one of the measures which international creditors said was
essential for the credibility of the reform programme.
The government also announced bold measures to liberalise prices and exports
which would cut subsidies on food, rents and energy.
President Kuchma told western donors at a Group of Seven-organised
conference in Canada that the reforms hinge on immediate western aid and a
successful debt rescheduling to cover its Dollars 600m four-quarter balance
of payments deficit.
The US committed Dollars 70m, and pledged to raise the total to Dollars 100m
if the EU provided similar balance of payments aid. Canada pledged Dollars
25m.
Last night, German officials held out hope of a political commitment to
provide aid to Ukraine.
Though this would fall short of a formal decision on balance of payments
support, but it would keep alive hopes of winning the necessary support from
the European parliament later this month.
