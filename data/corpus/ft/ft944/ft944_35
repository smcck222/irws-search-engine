FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Supermarket bargains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwiksave supermarkets offer few frills but have taken care with their wine
selection for the last year or so. Two stunning current bargains are Silver
Hill South African blended white, so smartly labelled that one would never
guess it cost only Pounds 2.79, and a Chilean Sauvignon labelled White
Pacific at Pounds 2.69. Both are whistle-clean and refreshingly high in
acidity.
Safeway's best current buy is their South African white at Pounds 2.29, or
another Chilean white, the Caliterra 1994 Chardonnay, which is reduced from
Pounds 3.99 to Pounds 3.49 until November 12. The latter is better value
than the Caliterra 1991 Cabernet. Progress in Chile generally means the
younger the vintage the better the wine.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Travel broadens the database - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER

<TEXT>
Eighteen months ago I wrote about Thomas Henkel, an American employee of
Conoco, whose business travels had allowed him to produce an extensive
personal database of hotels and restaurants around the world.
Since then Henkel has added a further 500 entries to his database, which now
stands at 3,500, and in response to FT readers' requests for more
information, has launched Henkel's Guide, a bimonthly newsletter dedicated
to 'discovering exceptional, unique and unusual dining and lodging
opportunities worldwide'.
For information on obtaining the guide, contact: Henkel's Guide, 16 Foxhill
Lane, Greenville, Delaware 19807. Tel: 302-992-9927; fax 302-992-0329.
Another guide pioneer is Richard Binns, who since 1980 has been writing and
publishing his French Leave series.
Binns' latest is Alles France] (Pounds 10.99) which includes 60 favourite
hotels and restaurants and a section entitled Franc-wise France - a guide to
350 restaurants and hotels with value for money menus.
For Francophiles this guide will provide uncomfortable reading: Binns finds
French culinary standards at their lowest for 40 years and that eating out
today in provincial Britain can be more enjoyable than the French
equivalent.
A hundred children will prepare, cook and serve a Sunday lunch banquet for
250 people, to raise money for the Young Cooks Trust and Whizz Kids, a
charity which helps provide adapted, powered wheelchairs.
The Big Banquet will be held on Sunday November 27 at noon in the Royal
College of Music, London SW7. The lunch is masterminded by Philip Britten,
Michelin-starred chef of London's Capital Hotel.
Tickets are Pounds 65 per person from Queenie Copping, tel: 071-233 6600,
fax: 071-233 6611.
Restaurant openings never happen exactly on time even with the most
experienced management behind them.
Six weeks after it should have opened its doors, The Chiswick finally opened
for business last week.
This in spite of the fact that its directors include Adam and Kate Robinson
who have made such a success of The Brackenbury, W6 (081-748 0107) and Tony
Mackintosh, the brains behind 192 and the Groucho Club.
The Chiswick's chef is Ian Bates, formerly sous-chef at Bibendum, SW3. The
Chiswick is at 131-133, Chiswick High Road, London W4 (081-994 6887). Closed
Sunday evening and Monday lunch.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Cut-price glamour cuts - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with economising is that, all too often, it is depressingly
evident. The art of paring costs while giving real pleasure to your guests
depends on a calculated blend of sheer greed, a shrewd eye for bargains,
presentational flair, lateral thinking and - last but not least - a smiling
demeanour.
Cut-price glamour is the thing to aim for. Relish the challenge, plan and
execute economies with style, and you might even create the impression that
you are lashing out, rather than being economical.
Soup, for example, is cheap food and the workhouse image haunts its past.
But a broth made from, say, the sinewy left-overs of game birds can be
gloriously savoury. And if it is served theatrically in individual bowls
sealed under puff pastry lids, the image and the eating are decidedly
classy.
A few thoughts on meat cookery are given below. Vegetables, fish and dessert
ideas will follow next Saturday.
For those on the economy trail, one thing to avoid is mince, which has
become linked inexorably with nasty. But some other cheap cuts are both chic
and appetising. Oxtail is splendid rib-sticking stuff, just the ticket for
stews and braises when winter turns wintry. The only worry is that it has
become so fashionable that half your friends may be serving it, too. The
same goes for lamb shanks.
The time has come for avant-garde cooks to greet the revival of shin of
beef, another richly-meaty, awkwardly-bony, lip-smacking, gravy-producing
cut. Once shunned by the smart set, my crystal ball forecasts that it is
tipped to star.
Beef shin has been prized for years by a few cognoscenti who used this meat
(where others used more costly chuck steak) to make splendid casseroles and
stews - with extra cooking time, of course. I suggest, though, that it is
more fun, and much better value, if shin is cooked and served on the bone.
Ask the butcher to cut it across in thick slices, then treat it in much the
same way as shin of veal.
To make what is, in effect, a deeply-flavoured version of classic ossobuco,
colour beef shin slices lightly all over, then lay them flat to contain the
marrow safely in the bones. Pour on reduced red wine, add a plum tomato or
two or a few prunes, some onion, thyme, bay and a curl of orange peel.
Cook very gently indeed for four hours or so until the meat can be pulled
clean from the bone and the gravy is sticky. Garnish with a variation on
gremolada consisting of finely-chopped garlic, parsley, and the zest of an
orange.
For an oriental slant, slow-cook the beef shin slices with onions, garlic,
ginger, soy, oyster sauce and beef stock. Finish with strips of stir-fried
green pepper and a handful of chopped green coriander.
Offal is 'in'. Less celebrated than chicken livers (a ritzy, long-standing
favourite of many paupers) but worth consideration, are sheep and ox
kidneys. The writer Edouard de Pomiane, who considered the last to be
'unjustly despised', raised their status to 'aristocratic' by sauteeing them
and serving with a bearnaise sauce. It is a winning combination.
Lambs' kidneys assume slightly exotic appeal when split, cored, threaded on
skewers, grilled, and served on a bed of rice with a snowstorm of chives and
pats of dukka butter (butter with dukka mashed in) melting over them.
Dukka is an Egyptian treat, a mixture of toasted and chopped hazelnut
kernels, sesame, cumin and coriander seed which is prepared easily at home.
Toast each ingredient separately in a dry frying pan, allowing four parts of
nuts to three of sesame, two of coriander and one of cumin. Mix, add sea
salt and pepper, and pass the mixture through the coarse blade of a meat
mincer.
Dukka keeps well in an airtight jar for many weeks. It can also be served as
a welcome alternative to bruschetta with pre-dinner drinks. Spread dukka on
a tray and warm it briefly in the oven to freshen it (if not newly-made),
then serve it with a bowl of good olive oil and warm, crusty bread.
To eat, break off a piece of bread, hold it by the crust, and dip the crumb
into the oil to dampen it. Then press it into the dukka to pick up some of
the fragrant nut-and-spice mixture.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: Superbuyers flex their muscles - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When J. Sainsbury, the leading UK supermarket, decided some years ago to
launch an own-label armagnac, the size of its initial order was such that,
instantly, it became the world's largest single customer for the fiery
Gascon brandy.
This was just one of hundreds of examples of the power exercised by British
supermarket buyers. In drinks' buying, at least, British chains tend to be
more innovative, centralised and rapacious than their counterparts on the
European mainland - and their American equivalents have no such hold on the
heavily-regulated US alcoholic beverage market.
Only the Scandinavian and Canadian state drinks monopolies can rival UK
supermarkets but, whereas the influence of the former is waning, the British
seem ever keener to buy their wines and spirits in the brightly-lit aisles
of Sainsbury and its rivals - Tesco, Safeway, Asda and Somerfield. Between
them, these five chains sell well over 50 per cent of all wine retailed in
the UK.
While more and more British wine-drinkers seem to love the supermarkets, the
supermarkets themselves love wine. 'The wine department is seen as one of
the recruiting departments for the rest of the supermarket,' says Elizabeth
Robertson, of Safeway.
Because much of the wine is bought at Christmas, the supermarkets view their
promotions for this time of year as their annual chance to lure new
customers - hence the heavy advertising.
Last year's juicy morsel from Safeway was its most successful ever:
Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon at Pounds 1.99. Robertson says it was not a
loss leader although, certainly, it was not a revenue generator, either. The
quantities involved - believed to be about 200,000 cases (well over 100
container lorries) - were so great that two quite different sorts of wines
were supplied. No one complained.
Safeway invests its three buyers with enormous individual buying power (up
to Pounds 50m each a year), and requires them also to be responsible for
selling the stuff. Market leader Sainsbury has made its buyers responsible
for the less glamorous task of shipping it in the right quantity at the
right time.
It is at this point that suppliers, some of them tiny peasant enterprises,
tend to lose such illusions as remain about the value of one large order.
Goliath Stores does not forgive Domaine David his problems with cork
suppliers or label printers, any more than it is prepared to pay a sou more
than it can get away with.
The one thing on which suppliers and supermarkets agree is that the most
important factor in the buying equation is price. There is much hot air and
waffle about upgrading quality and broadening range; but if a new line
cannot be sold with the specified margin (usually considerably higher than
its continental equivalent) at, say, Pounds 2.99, Pounds 3.49 or Pounds
3.99, then the deal is usually off.
Although, in general terms, the modern wine market is buyer-driven, there
have been times when buyers' muscle alone has not been enough to clinch the
deal. Widespread frosts in 1991 greatly reduced the quantities of French
wine so that, for once, the supermarket buyers had to sell their employers
to their suppliers rather than vice-versa.
Safeway's Sarah Kynoch says: 'It was really, really hard work, especially
with growers who thought 'I've just lost half my crop so I'm certainly not
going to sell the other half cheaply'. As a result, we had to drop some
suppliers who wouldn't co-operate on price.'
The two important brewery-owned multiples, Allied's Victoria Wine and
Whitbread's Thresher / Bottoms Up / Wine Rack group, tend to insist just as
much on price 'co-operation' in spite of their relative trickle of customers
compared with the supermarkets.
Tesco's aim is to offer more choice than arch-rival Sainsbury: 785 wines at
the last count compared with just over 500 at Sainsbury, including such
delights as a brace from Brazil made by a Ukrainian-Australian based in
England. But, increasingly, Sainsbury is wedded to exclusivity on individual
lines.
In spite of its stately approach ('we may not be as quick or whacky as some
other supermarkets,' says the company's Claire Gordon-Brown), it has been
voted Supermarket of the Year in the 1994 international wine challenge
organised by Wine magazine.
One thing on which all supermarket wine buyers agree is the need to keep
constant tabs on the competition. They are often to be found snooping round
their rivals' shelves collecting samples. 'I've often bumped into various
suppliers in the wrong supermarket,' admits Gordon-Brown, who once ordered
Pounds 1m worth of champagne with a single phone call.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The Swiss army goes under the knife - Ian
Rodger reports on the cuts being made to Switzerland's militia, the role of
which has become more social than military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a crisp September morning, the Schwagalp in the middle of the Appenzeller
uplands looked like any other Swiss Alp, alight with autumn colours and a
dusting of snow on the higher peaks. A keen observer might have noticed the
absence of cows and ramblers.
Then, suddenly, 50 soldiers pounded over the crest of a hill, dived to the
ground and started firing multiple rounds from their automatic rifles into
the mountainside 50 yards away.
From their left flank, another score rushed in, heaving grenades towards the
same spot. Orders were shouted while officers and other observers stood by
with flags, calmly scrutinising the pandemonium for several minutes.
Then, as suddenly as it began, this 'attack on an enemy command post' ended,
the troops retreated for a few yards and then relaxed and sloped off for a
snack and a debriefing in the midday sun.
On a normal day, the young men who make up the 25th grenadier company of the
25th motorised infantry regiment of the Swiss Army would be working as
bankers, doctors, lawyers, students, taxi drivers and many other
occupations.
But for three weeks every year until they are 32, and less often until they
are 50, they are called up for their WK (Wiederholungskurs) refreshment
training in Switzerland's 600,000 strong citizen army.
During those periods, depending on their function, they patrol borders,
manoeuvre tanks, pilot fighters and helicopters (pilots have to do six weeks
training a year) and carry out all the other jobs that need doing in a large
modern army.
The training is always rigorous. Soldiers regularly use live ammunition on
exercises like that on the Schwagalp.
To an outsider, it all seems a bit silly at first glance. Toys for boys on a
heroic scale. The Swiss have not taken up arms against anyone for more than
200 years and the prospect of them doing so in the foreseeable future seems
remote. No one has invaded their mountainous country since Napoleon.
Gradually, however, it becomes clear to the visiting resident that the Swiss
Army's most important role is not military at all but social.
Many western countries, including France, Germany and Italy, still oblige
most or all able-bodied men to do military service. But Switzerland alone
has an army composed almost entirely of militia troops.
Men start their military service at age 20 or on completion of their
education or apprenticeship with a 17-week basic training course and they
are then constantly available for call-up and keep their kit at home until
they are dismissed at 50.
By then, they have given nearly a full year of their lives to the army.
Those who choose to train to be officers must give much more time: a full
colonel will have spent five years in uniform.
As a militia, the Swiss army permits no class distinctions. Bank executives
rub shoulders with dustmen, scientists with waiters. Middle managers more
and more find themselves giving orders to their civilian bosses, because the
bosses no longer have the time to devote to officer training.
The men meet and test each other in severe conditions, bivouacing in a
blinding snowstorm on a mountainside, surviving a two-day slog over
mountains and through swamps. Strong friendships and enmities are formed and
renewed every year.
It is at least arguable that one of the reasons that Swiss banks and big
Swiss industrial companies have been so successful over the years is the
ability of their leaders, thanks in part to army experience and contacts, to
avoid egregious mistakes in selecting top managers.
Today, the Swiss army is in the midst of its most important shake-up since
1910, adapting at a stroke to the post-cold war world and the increasing
sophistication of military equipment.
Its complement is being slashed by a third to 400,000; more professionals
are being engaged; and ordinary citizens will from next year train less and
sign off at 42.
While the restructuring has been widely accepted on security grounds, many
people fear that the considerable social benefits of the old system will be
reduced or lost.
Since the 1815 Council of Vienna imposed armed neutrality on Switzerland,
the role of the military has been restricted to defence. Its current
structure dates from 1961 and was designed to implement the hedgehog or
porcupine strategy developed during the second world war.
The Swiss realised they could not stop an invasion, but they reasoned that
an invader's only purpose would be to gain control of the Alpine passes. So
they set out a defence strategy that make this virtually impossible.
To this day, railway and road bridges and tunnels are armed with explosives
at 2,000 points throughout the country.
This strategy survived the second world war, but not the great technological
advances in military hardware that came with it. In 1966, the Swiss
announced a more ambitious strategy, to defend the country to its borders
using the most modern mechanised and mobile equipment.
The army now has 1,800 armoured vehicles and more than 300 aircraft as well
as some of the latest self-propelled artillery and wire-guided anti-tank
weapons.
Cavalry battalions were disbanded in 1974, although the army did not give up
all the old ways. Its tough bicycle infantry is a modern-day rarity, as are
the carrier pigeons, now threatened with demobilisation as an economy
measure.
Already in the 1980s, the army was being contested on a variety of fronts.
Environmental protection groups objected to the disturbances caused by army
exercises. Women, hitherto restricted to auxiliary roles, demanded a chance
to enlist as regulars.
Swiss companies, which previously made it a point of pride to count a few
colonels among their top executives, were beginning to regret the long
absences of those colonels. And Swiss wives began to complain openly about
the long periods they had to look after the children alone, not to mention
the huge loads of dirty laundry their husbands sent home from the field
(postage free).
The public was also becoming more sensitive about the dangers inherent in
military training. Newspapers now give full coverage of the inevitable
accidents.
In 1989, the government was stunned when more than a third of voters
accepted the proposal in a pacifists' referendum that the army should be
abolished.
It rushed out a new security policy for dealing with 'a world in mutation'
which, in turn, led to the elaboration by the defence ministry in early 1992
of a complete overhaul of the military establishment.
Army 95, as the plan is called, is based on the idea of a more flexible
security force, able to help in international peacekeeping activities, to
protect the population in the event of natural and military catastrophes and
to combat terrorism.
It saw the need for fewer soldiers, so the army's manpower could be reduced
by a third. On the other hand, the complexity of military equipment meant
the new army would need more full-time, professional soldiers.
And as Mr Kaspar Villiger, the defence minister, points out, troops going on
overseas peacekeeping missions will have to be professionals. 'You cannot
motivate a militia army sent to some distant corner to resolve a problem,'
he says.
Mr Villiger refuses to accept that the militia will become a second-class
army, and leaves no doubt that his main concern is the social role the
institution plays. 'It contributes to the psychological strength of the
country,' he said in a recent interview.
Full implementation of Army 95 is two months away, and dozens of battalions
and companies are about to be stood down for the last time.
I returned to the mock battlefield in the Schwagalp a few weeks after
watching the 25th grenadiers. I looked carefully, but could not find a
single spent shell or cartridge case or any evidence that anything had
happened. The Swiss keep things clean, even in their war games.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Travel: Clear the Highlands again] - Nicholas Woodsworth
heads north in search of Scotland's great deserted wilderness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday, en route
The cafeteria food is awful, the traffic outside on the motorway north of
London is bumper to bumper, and my history of the Highland Clearances lacks
something of the zingy style required of holiday reading.
A quick sample? ' . . . the entire population were then compressed into a
space of 3,000 acres of the most barren land in the parish, and the
remaining 130,000 acres were divided among six sheep farmers . . .'
Normally, historical disputes of this sort have me rooting for the underdog.
In this case, I feel won over wholeheartedly to the cause of absentee
landlordism and sheep.
Londoners should be so lucky as to have 3,000 acres of barren highland at
their disposal - if my Scottish historian is looking for real compression,
let him try the London Underground on a close summer's day. I am depressed
by pawed-over countryside and cities that sprawl, one into another, far over
the horizon. The idea that, somewhere on this island, is an area as wild and
empty as any in western Europe is reassuring.
I sigh with happy anticipation and abandon my soggy little motorway lunch.
Who needs Vegetarian Bake when raw Scottish nature lies just around the
corner?
Thursday, Thurso
Bring back cruel landlords, bring back mass evictions] Something has gone
horribly wrong. In spite of everything the brochures say, the Highlands are
swarming with people.
At least, Thurso is. It is the town on the far north coast of Scotland where
the ferry leaves for the Orkney islands. Not everyone, it seems, throngs the
Mediterranean coasts in summer - at peak season, large numbers of
Mediterraneans, seeking relief from the tourist invasion of the south, turn
around and invade the north.
Every bed and breakfast on the Orkneys is, consequently, full and the
overflow, waiting for a free bed, is jammed into Thurso. I spend this
evening in Sandra's Cafe with hordes of Italians. We all eat pizzas and
watch video clips on the satellite channel MTV - hardly the Highland escape
I was hoping for. The Orkneys, molto belle as they are, deserve a visit at a
quieter time of year.
Friday, Ullapool
Ullapool is hardly any more peaceful. It is a pretty little town, three
hours' drive north of Skye - far enough, I would have thought, to out-run
the tour groups that ply the Highlands and Islands' routes. But no: the
harbour-side street running along the quiet waters of Loch Broom is packed
with tea rooms, souvenir shops and woollen mill outlets doing a roaring
trade.
It is not the Italians but the French who seem to have claimed Ullapool as
their own. They are voracious shoppers. They snap up boxed presentation sets
of single malt miniature bottles; silver-plate Nessie earrings,
commemorating the yet-to-be-found monster; shortbread wrapped in Cellophane
plaid; dismal videos of hairy men singing Danny Boy; and postcards of the
what's-under-that-kilt variety. High road, low road, any road in between,
few avenues are unexplored by Scottish kitsch.
I have snapped up something, too - an Ordnance Survey map showing, I hope,
an escape route away from these Highland horrors. On it, I have circled
Achiltibuie, a village sitting on a single-track road on the Coigach
peninsula north-west of Ullapool.
My guidebook makes only passing mention of it. It has no Highland games, no
castles, no shops selling woollens, no sheepdog trials, no Celtic music
festivals, no celebrated golf courses, no stately homes open to the public
from 10am to 5pm, no fragrant, peat-smoking distilleries to visit.
It sounds a good bet.
Saturday, Achiltibuie
It is. What surprises as you drive into Achiltibuie is land, sea and sky,
and just how much there is of each.
The village, a thread of white-washed stone houses stretched along a rocky
shore, hardly impresses itself upon the eye at all. It is nature that
everywhere overwhelms - the bald, treeless moor sweeping down from the top
of the hills to the edge of the sea; the confused archipelago of the Summer
Isles sitting offshore like a great fleet caught in some muddled manoeuvre;
fold upon fold of the mountains of Ross receding into infinity across a
broad stretch of cold, north Minch water.
What holds it all together in such soothing manner are the soft and muted
colours of the Highlands. Forget Harris tweed. Slate greys and kelp greens,
beech reds and wrack browns, bilberry blues and heather mauves all combine
more subtly in this vast landscape than they do in any jacket.
Repose for the eye is one thing, rest for the tired traveller another. Where
to stay in this great uncluttered space? Along the whole Coigach coastline -
five little communities spread along 15 miles of water - there are just 300
residents, one pub, and one small hotel.
I pull up at the Summer Isles Hotel in Achiltibuie, drawn by the sound of
fiddles and accordions. It is early, the afternoon sun still bright in a
calm sky. But, outside the bar, in a little courtyard overlooking the sea, I
spy a crowd of drinkers and half a dozen musicians flailing away in a wild
storm of jigs and reels.
In the parking lot I meet a tiny, silver-haired woman who tells me she was
married here many years ago; today is her anniversary. The wedding was
tragic, she laughs; the night before the reception, the fishing fleet sailed
in. 'They drank the bar dry,' she says. 'Our tongues were on our knees, but
you could'na get a drink for love nor money.' She rushes off to the bar to
make up for it.
Is this the perennial fear of all those present, their grounds for early and
avid tippling? The fleet, one feels, must be just around the point and
bearing down hard on Achiltibuie.
There may be cheer and music aplenty at the Summer Isles Hotel today, but
there is not a room to be had.
'Try Mrs Campbell,' someone suggests, whisky-inspired, giving me a telephone
number. Finally, after a dram of this and a call to Mrs Campbell, a dram of
that and a call to Mrs Barnes, more drams and more calls to Mrs Mackenzie
and Mrs Macleod, I find myself a guest in the bed and breakfast
establishment of Mrs Lottie Ross.
There is nothing tweedy about my room, it is bright pink: pink bedspread,
pink walls, pink carpet, pink lampshades. I like it, anyway. Outside, dim
white puffs of sheep wander in the moonlight and the grey sea swells and
surges on the ragged rocks below my window.
Lottie and Jimmy Ross sit me down in front of a fire in their sitting room
before they step out to the pub for the evening. 'Make yourself at home,'
they say, showing me the coal scuttle and tea kettle.
I am beginning to realise I am a long way from London. It is not that the
Rosses are unaware of the nasty possibilities of leaving a complete stranger
alone in their home - before he retired from the police force, Jimmy walked
a beat in Glasgow. But things in Achiltibuie simply do not work the way they
work elsewhere.
Sunday
On Sundays, in fact, most things do not work in Achiltibuie at all. 'This is
Free Church of Scotland territory,' Lottie tells me over a truly
magnificent, unstintingly generous, mountainously high-cholesterol fried
breakfast. I have been asking about a fishing trip out on the Hectoria, the
tour and sea-angling boat that leaves from Achiltibuie's little harbour.
'We're still a bit traditional and the Hectoria never sails on Sundays, I'm
afraid. But we are beginning to move with the times - a few years ago, I
couldn't even hang out my laundry to dry on a Sunday.'
I have no laundry to hang out. But a vague Sunday morning mood of
culpability persists - the product, no doubt, of too many Saturday evening
whiskies. I make my way down the seaside road to a white, wooden building on
the edge of the village. There is nothing for lingering guilt like a morning
service at the Free Church in Achiltibuie.
The Wee Frees, as they are known, get no prizes for interior decoration;
their church makes the average anchorite's cell look like a riot of sensual
abandon. There is no colour, no ornamentation, no graven image of any kind.
There is no organ to give false courage to our singing.
Nor is there even much chance, it seems, of redemption or forgiveness. There
is just a stiff, wooden pew and the stern voice of Douglas Gebbie, the Free
Church missionary, reminding us of our own awfulness. I suspect it does
everyone gathered a power of good.
It certainly does something for me. Stumbling out of the gloom, I emerge
into bright sunshine, fresh northern air and a thousand sheep browsing on
grass cropped as smooth as a bowling green. I feel exhilarated. Beyond the
churchyard lies endless sea and island and mountain, a view that has not
changed since creation. Once again, I sigh with happy anticipation. I have
arrived in the Highlands.

FT  05 NOV 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Snowboarders in a storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They spent October in Australasia and are now in
the US on the last leg of their odyssey.
At noon on October 26 we were flying over a volcano in New Zealand. At
precisely the same time and date our Air New Zealand 747 was starting its
descent into Los Angeles. Such are the miracles of crossing the date-line.
Having skied on so many volcanoes in the southern hemisphere, we thought we
should climb to the top of at least one before leaving for Mammoth Mountain
in California.
We chose Ruapehu, which, unusually, has a lake in its crater. As we climbed
up from Whakapapa's Far West T-Bar, the weather became progressively worse -
mist, rain, hail, and, eventually, a white-out.
By the time we reached the lake, we could not see a thing. All that climbing
had been in vain. So the following day we hired a light aircraft to get to
see what we should have seen the previous day.
One of the highlights of New Zealand was our visit to Queenstown, the base
for two of South Island's best-known resorts, Coronet Peak and The
Remarkables. But just as we drew up at The Remarkables, the Queenstown
constabulary arrived to arrest some Japanese snowboarders. The charge:
skiing with children's season tickets.
The Japanese snowboard phenomenon is a very recent one. This is only the
first year in which large groups of Japanese have spent the entire winter in
New Zealand as ski bums, and according to the authorities they have brought
with them a mini crime wave.
After two of them had been grilled about phoney tickets another 20 admitted
they had done the same. Said one ski area official: 'We want to stamp this
out before it spreads.'
Recently a local newspaper claimed: 'Queenstown's Japanese snowboarding
community is at the centre of a glue-sniffing controversy.' Another reported
a mugging in which the suspect was dressed 'like a Japanese snowboarder'.
But the Japanese are not the only snowboarders who have made themselves
unpopular here. As in Europe, they are viewed as being a mixed blessing.
Skiers at Treble Cone resort have complained about the 'allegedly dangerous'
behaviour of snowboarders and the management is reportedly talking of making
the ski-field only available to skiers.
In spite of this, Queenstown is a bustling but charming little lakeside town
with exceptional views of the jagged snow-capped Remarkables and Lake
Wakatipu, which according to Maori mythology is the only surviving remnant
of a giant: a still beating heart which accounts for the regular rise and
fall of the deep blue waters.
The sheer Remarkables pinnacles cradle some good bowl skiing, but the best
runs are not served by lifts: a long, fairly steep gulley called Scarper
(also variously known as Toilet Bowl, Killing Time and Kill An Hour)
involves a 25-minute climb from the top of Sugar Bowl Chair; the challenging
Elevator and Escalator Chutes require a 20-minute climb; and even the
homeward runs involve being picked up way below the ski area base in a kind
of cattle truck shuttle.
Coronet Peak, on the other hand, has more lift-served terrain, but apart
from the back bowls, little in the way of 'out of bounds' skiing.
But the newly-installed Express high-speed quad chair is one of the fastest
in the southern hemisphere, hurtling skiers almost 1,500 vertical feet to
the top of the mountain in under five minutes.
Those in the business of clocking up altitude can manage as many as 50,000
vertical feet here in a day.
Having such a fast-moving armchair to the slopes was bliss, after several
days of struggling in New Zealand's 'daunting dozen' club fields. But in the
end, we almost had the measure of these basic ski fields enjoyed by hardy
skiers who thrive on camaraderie and cheap lift tickets.
We have even purchased as a souvenir one of the dreaded 'nut-crackers' -
metal devices shaped like large nut-crackers which you fling over the moving
rope and hang on to grimly until the top.
This device, which is fixed to a belt round your waist, is seen as a macho
device by aficionados, and also serves to scare away wimpish recreational
skiers such as Lucy and me, thus leaving the club fields uncrowded.
When this system of uphill transport is combined with a total lack of
grooming, it tends to make club fields the domain of the hardy and skilful
few. Craigieburn, for example, had some of the most dramatic and
exhilarating terrain south of the equator.
But few 'ordinary' recreational skiers could get the best out of it. In some
club fields, it is difficult to assess which is more exhausting: trying to
use the rope tow or trying to ski down in breakable crust.
Craigieburn's neighbour, Broken River had an extra impediment: you have to
walk for half an hour or so up a steep path to reach the slopes. Add rain,
and the fact that Broken River, was closed when we finally got there, and
you have a grim day out.
We eventually got it right at Temple Basin, which the manager, Tony Galvin
opened especially for us, complete with our personal ski patroller Alistair
Moore (who brought his dad - the only other skier on the mountain).
In spite of a steep hour-long walk to get to the ski field, we managed to
master the nutcracker and both snow (entirely ungroomed) and terrain were
excellent. At our fifth and final attempt we had become club skiers.
Our hardships were nothing compared with the pioneers who built the fields,
often carrying enormous amounts of equipment and building materials up steep
mountain tracks. Mount Robert, which has a two-hour walk-in, has just
celebrated its 50th anniversary with a book of its history. This includes
the following recollections.
'At least 50 per cent of the lodge was carried up Mount Robert on people's
backs. The walls became a wonderful home for mice, so we were never lonely.
One could lie in the bunk and scrape the solid ice off the bare corrugated
iron about six inches from one's face. One hut lasted three months and then
completely disappeared in a storm.'
Being rather more hedonistic, we preferred hotels to huts.
Skiing at Mount Hutt, South Island, Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at
the Powder House, Methven. On North Island they stayed at the Skotel,
Whakapapa Village. They also stayed at the Lakeland Hotel, Queenstown.
Their visit to New Zealand was arranged by the New Zealand Tourism Office,
New Zealand House, 80 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4TQ, tel: 071-973 0360; and Air
New Zealand, Elsinore House, 77 Fulham Palace Rd, W6 8JA, tel: 081-846 9595

FT  05 NOV 94 / Travel: Across a landscape carved by elephants - Michael J.
Woods follows in the footsteps of the big game in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaves, golden brown and crisp as crackers, crunched underfoot. A squirrel
skipped through the long cream grasses with quick bounds and a deer passed
between the tall trees in front of us, one foreleg raised uncertainly. But
there was no sound of traffic, no horse riders passed us in the early
morning light and, much as it might have looked like it, this was no Surrey
woodland. For the squirrel was a mopane squirrel, the deer a bush buck and
the wood was part of Mana Pools National Park on the banks of the Zambezi in
Zimbabwe.
It was the beginning of day two of our three day safari, walking from one
mobile camp to the next through the Park. We followed the Zambezi
downstream, rarely straying from the river terraces where the rich soil
nurtured tall trees. Dark-leaved ebonies grew on termite mounds, their
yellow spring flowers rich with scent. The sumptuous, deep red velvet
upholstery blooms of the sausage trees had just finished and were scattered
blousily on the ground around the trunks. Among these were other trees,
tamarinds and feathery, apple-ring acacias laden with seed pods. Nearby were
the over-arching, elephant- sculpted pillars of cathedral mopane.
Browsers keep the leaves neatly clipped so that there are long views under
the tree canopy to a distant thin blue haze. Across this moved silhouettes
of dancing impala, disdainful kudu, scruffy buffalo and stately elephants in
a mist of grey dust. Our pace was gentle and our course erratic.
Occasionally we had to cross depressions which hold temporary water and grow
a dense crop of adrenalin grass. This is where old buffalo rest and lion lie
up during the day, hence the name and the need for caution.
But I had already seen lion on my only game drive during nine days in the
African bush, from the airstrip to the start of the walk. We spotted them
from the truck and, as my guide, Garth Thompson, explained, park rules
forbad us to drive any closer. 'But never mind,' he said, 'In Mana Pools we
are allowed to walk.' And so, less than 15 hours after leaving London, I
found myself walking towards a pair of lions. I was back in Africa.
As soon as we stepped clear of the vehicle, the male roused from lethargy to
needle-sharp alertness. 'Watch his tail,' said Garth and I studied it
intently. As we drew closer it began to twitch and wave with the increasing
tension of the cat. Finally we settled down against a tree and the lion
relaxed as his mate, lolling on her back, coyly rolled over and licked his
face.
Although this was to be my only sighting, we regularly heard lion in Mana
for they were part of the myriad of night sounds that lulled us to sleep in
our tents, pitched in a number of spectacular spots overlooking the river.
Their coughing roars were joined by the whoops of hyaenas and the occasional
bark and scream of an argumentative baboon. On the marshes in front of the
camp hippos moved squelchily, fat black silhouettes against a rising orange
moon and the distant silver strip of the river running beneath the mountains
of Zambia. Now and then they gave hollow laughs, a deep sound which
contrasted with the high pitched bell-like calls of the frogs and the
repetitive soft 'prrrp' of a scops owl.
Just as dramatic as Garth Thompson's camp sites was the location of
Chizarira Wilderness Lodge. It is situated in a concession on the edge of
little known Chizarira National Park and on the edge describes it precisely,
for it is on the very lip of the escarpment and each room has a wooden
balcony suspended over the abyss. Chizarira is a mountainous park whose
porous sandstone yields water through a number of perennial springs. These
ensure that the bird life is excellent but that the game is more scattered
as there is little need to congregate at scarce water points.
Led by Steve Alexander, I walked from spring to green spring, strolling
through dry valleys of golden grass and climbing slopes along terraced
elephant paths. One led to a gap in the sandstone rocks which looked
impossibly narrow. It would be difficult enough for a horse to pass through
let alone an elephant. Yet the age-old elephant path led over the great warm
bed-rock slabs towards the low cliff and through the mere slit of a cleft.
Rough elephant hides had deposited a skim of dust and mud on the coarse
stone walls on either side as the animals squeezed through the narrow gap
and then followed the winding trail down the hill to the spring.
Generations of elephant feet, padding in exactly the same places every time,
had carved plate-sized footprints in the sandstone leaving a series of worn
steps. In the late afternoon, with the sun dipping towards the horizon, the
primeval hills of Chizarira had the atmosphere of an old monastery where
daily processions of monks had, over centuries, worn prints in the steps
leading to their cloisters.
It is difficult to feel equally reverential about game viewing from a
speedboat. This creates a carefree atmosphere as it whisks you across the
waters of Lake Kariba from Musango Camp to a suitable walking spot in
Matusadona National Park. But tracking black rhino in jesse bush, a dense
curtain of scrubby vegetation which can hide an elephant in a few yards,
demands a certain sobriety and not a little caution. We found spoor and
droppings but none of the animals which, because of poaching, are extremely
scarce.
Nevertheless game viewing from a boat has its attractions. Many mammals seem
much less concerned by people in front of them when they are drinking and
allow remarkably close approaches. And occasionally you find a bird which is
astonishingly confident. A tiny malachite kingfisher provided us with a
perfect show one afternoon. We drifted towards its perch until we were
almost touching the branch and watched it dive repeatedly, its iridescent
blue and bright chestnut form plunging into the water after small fish and
then flying free again.
The sun was already low as we started back and within minutes its fiery
orange ball had slipped beneath the waters of the lake. At once the colour
was gone and we raced home over an absolutely still lake through warm
evening air full of scents and soft to the touch. Africa at its most gentle.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Travel: A sharp eye on the clouds - Kate Bevan visits Santa
Barbara and its wine-producing hinterland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rain is usually welcome in the California desert. But not today. The clouds
hanging over the Santa Ynez mountains north of Los Angeles posed a threat.
For this was the day the Chardonnay grapes were to be picked at the
Firestone winery.
This offshoot of the tyre and rubber empire sits in stark countryside. The
Santa Ynez Valley is home to more than 30 wineries, and the winemakers there
claim that their grapes are so good that established wineries from the Napa
Valley, north of San Francisco, buy their grapes from Santa Ynez.
Once a thriving wine region, it was virtually killed off by prohibition. It
did not pick up again until the 1970s when growers such as the Firestones
moved into the valley.
The hills and valley are graced by nothing more than scrubby dull green
vegetation. But in spite of the harshness of the landscape the region is
well suited to viticulture.
At the Firestone winery, Hayley Firestone Jessup was keeping a sharp eye on
the clouds. There had been a 'storm' - more like a shower to anyone used to
regular rain - the night before and any more rain would seriously damage the
crop.
Earlier she had guided us through a tasting of some of the vineyard's
produce: we sniffed as we swirled, pulled faces as the wine swilled over our
palates and then religiously spat out the liquid before moving on to the
next one. With our newly acquired knowledge we all looked sagely at the sky
as we left and were relieved that the rain held off.
The valley is less than an hour by road from Santa Barbara, an upmarket
resort town 90 miles north of Los Angeles.
Reaching Santa Barbara after the hot dusty drive up the coast from LA is
like finding an oasis. The lush palm trees and intensely green grass running
down to the Pacific are a sudden contrast after the uniform ochre and tan
colours of the dull industrial towns such as Oxnard which sprawl alongside
the coastal highway.
Money has created the oasis here - Santa Barbara is a popular weekend
getaway for city dwellers and the scent of money around the pools of the
pricey hotels competes only with the scent of sun-tan oil and expensive
perfume.
The town has come a long way from its beginnings. Initially named by a monk
aboard the ship of Sebastian Vizcaino, a Spanish explorer, when the coast
was sighted on the feast of Santa Barbara on December 4 1602, it was founded
 -like so many of California's towns - as a mission.
The town now boasts attractive pseudo-Spanish architecture that is quite
engaging until you realise that most of it is post-1925, when an earthquake
devastated the town. One of the few buildings to survive the earthquake is
the attractive mission, further up the hill, dedicated in 1820 and known as
the 'Queen of the Missions', where visitors can take a tour of the restored
church and outbuildings.
Building since the earthquake has been strictly regulated and anything
taller than a couple of storeys is likely to be pre-1920s. But at least
there is uniformity in the ersatz style: red-tiled roofs and sunwashed
buildings are always attractive, even if they do contain expensive boutiques
and restaurants.
Santa Barbara is also blessed with a wonderful beach, one of the few to run
east-west in California as it is tucked into a corner of coastline.
It would be easy to get hooked and spend the rest of your days loafing on
the beach and drinking the local wines. But just as I was getting carried
away with the fantasy, I noted the kind of people who could afford to live
there - ex-president Ronald Reagan and pop star Michael Jackson have houses
in Santa Barbara. Then I looked at my wallet - and headed back to reality.
Kate Bevan travelled to California as a guest of Continental Airlines and
Four Seasons/ Regent Hotels. Continental Airlines flies daily from London
Gatwick to Los Angeles. Reservations tel 0293-776464. The Firestone vineyard
is open every day from 10am to 4pm, tel (805) 688 3940.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: This is the night that sales
explode - Clive Fewins visits a company which is enjoying its annual
seasonal boom - it sells firework displays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Hutchison was born at 8pm on November 4, 1955. 'If I had been born
four hours later my parents tell me they would have called me Guy,' he said.
'I have a feeling that would have totally altered my destiny. I do not think
I could be taken seriously if I was called Guy.'
Hutchison is managing director of The Firework Company, a 10-man operation
based in an 800 sq ft mill outbuilding in the village of Uffculme, Devon. He
says: 'In a game in which there are about 18 players we rank ourselves in
the top half dozen serious suppliers.'
You will not see fireworks made by Hutchison's company on sale in the high
street. In fact, in common with the majority of its competitors, it does not
manufacture.
'More than 60 per cent of our fireworks come from China - only about 10 per
cent are UK-made - and they are nearly all designed for large displays.'
Hutchison said. 'Our business is selling display packs to groups to fire
themselves, and creating what we call operator-fired displays that we mount
for customers.'
Hutchison was a deputy store manager with Marks and Spencer, but left at 25
because he feared he was becoming institutionalised. The desire to run his
own business found him first in control of a car valeting business in north
London, with his wife, Peggy.
'It was a successful business but after six years I woke up one morning and
decided I was not having any fun,' he said. Peggy agreed. She was even more
amenable when they decided they were going to return to their Devonian
roots. The fireworks came later.
'Basically I felt that firework companies were putting explosives in the
hands of the public but not taking their responsibilities seriously,'
Hutchison said. 'When I rang round the companies I was appalled at the lack
of service and attention they provided.
'Perhaps it was my M &amp; S training in customer care, but I felt I could do
better.
'I also felt there was potential in expanding the market throughout the
year. Nearly three quarters of all the goods we sell go up in smoke in the
few days around November 5. That leaves plenty of scope for the rest of the
year.'
Hutchison set up The Firework Company with Pounds 1,000 in 1988. In just
over six years he has raised turnover from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 550,000.
The company mounts operator-fired displays costing from Pounds 1,000 to
Pounds 20,000 - they are doing 16 tonight - for customers ranging from local
councils to charitable organisations and large corporate bodies.
For what he calls 'DIY' displays - for organisations with more modest
budgets who fire the display themselves - Hutchison supplies packs costing
from Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,400.
This autumn the company was runner-up in an international firework display
competition in Macau. 'Nobody likes not winning but in our business it was
like coming second in the Eurovision Song Contest when you are a song
writer,' he said.
'Although we are at full stretch and have to hire temporary staff to assist
us, nights like tonight give me a great buzz. I wish I could visit all our
displays,' Hutchison said. As a child he was no more interested in fireworks
than any other lad. But how he is a committed enthusiast with a 'passion for
fireworks'.
'Our products bring pleasure to about half a million people a year,' he
said. 'Big displays of the type we are capable of mounting really get the
adrenalin going. There is something basic in all of us that responds to
fire. Professionally my preference is to join the spectators. That way I can
pick up the vibes. I am a great believer in selling the feeling, and I can
only do that if I can really absorb the experience as one of the crowd.
'Peggy and I started with Pounds 1,000 and we have grown The Firework Co out
of our customers' money,' he said. 'Our initial trading pattern was to find
the customer, take the money with the order and then buy the fireworks. This
way we have spun a pyrotechnic web out of very little.'
Now the company is bigger he increasingly finds himself having to buy
fireworks from China and several European countries well in advance of the
orders for the explosively busy month of November.
This has led to what he calls 'a certain retraining' of his bank manager.
'Life has not been all roses with the NatWest, partly because the company
owns no premises and quite a bit of our borrowing is unsecured,' he said.
'We run on a Pounds 50,000 overdraft facility and have a Pounds 10,000
long-term loan.'
Stock peaks at around Pounds 300,000 retail value in October, when the 15
tonnes of fireworks a year the company imports begin to move out from their
warehouse. 'In January the figure is nearer Pounds 10,000,' Hutchison said.
'During the period in between we have huge cash flow pressures, despite our
policy of always demanding payment before we despatch goods.'
In the UK it makes sense for the company to diversify into non-November
sales. Hutchison wants to develop the New Year's Eve market. 'In the rest of
Europe December 31 is a very big,' he said. 'There is no reason why it
should not be the same here.'
The other big event in his sights is the millennium. Hutchison also hopes he
will be able to capitalise on the kudos gained in Macau by increasing
overseas sales, especially to the Middle East.
'If we could hit the French Bastille Day peak on July 14 it would help our
cash flow enormously,' he said.
'So far we have been on a get-rich-slow path, but exports will unlock the
door,' Hutchison said. 'Last year we made a Pounds 10,000 loss on a Pounds
500,000 turnover. This year we are hoping to return to profit.
In spring 1993 Hutchison sold a total of 17 per cent of the company to five
acquaintances to raise cash for the company. 'What we could do with now is
an inward investment from a business angel or loan guarantee scheme.
'It would help us to buy in a more efficient way - which often means earlier
 -and also to buy better. It would also help dilute my summer shackles . .

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Borrow at your peril . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The wrong current account can be expensive, says a report in the latest
Which?, magazine of the Consumers' Association (CA). A Pounds 300 overdraft
over three months would cost Pounds 61 with the Clydesdale Bank - but less
than Pounds 7 with the Alliance &amp; Leicester or Woolwich building societies.
Overdraft charges on bank accounts often are expressed as fixed fees rather
than percentages. If you overdraw by just a small amount, though, a fixed
fee of Pounds 50 or so can translate into an astronomical annual percentage
rate (APR).
Which? suggests switching to one of the current accounts that charge no fees
when you overdraw by agreement: Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, First
Direct (up to Pounds 250), Halifax, Nationwide and Woolwich.
Credit cards are a cheaper way to borrow larger amounts or for more than a
few days - but make sure you have the right one. Those issued by the high
street banks are not usually the best value, with interest rates typically
between 21 and 24 per cent.
Save &amp; Prosper is increasing the interest rate on its Visa and Mastercards
from 0.95 per cent a month (APR 13.9) to 1 per cent (APR 14.6) from December
1, but they are still some of the better-value cards around.
Other credit cards with APRs under 20 per cent include Bank of Cyprus,
Coutts, the GM Card, Leeds Permanent, MBNA, N&amp;P, and Royal Bank of Scotland.
If you do not borrow regularly, avoid cards with annual fees as well as the
Royal Bank of Scotland, which charges interest from the date of purchase
even if you clear the balance in full. Fee-free cards like the GM Card, MBNA
and N&amp;P are best for occasional borrowers.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mother won't open account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My elderly mother has never had a bank account and insists she does not want
one, so I have cashed cheques for her through my own bank account. But with
the increase in 'account payee only' cheques, this is becoming increasingly
difficult.
I have heard there are agencies which cash cheques for individuals for a
small percentage fee. Would this be an option?
The recent legislation reforming cheque law is aimed at narrowing the
possibility of cheque fraud. Thus, 'account payee only' cheques are
omni-present and your mother will have no alternative but to open an
account. But this is not intimidating and any one of the clearers should be
able to help. (Murray Johnstone).

I have been helping my parents invest their offshore savings in such areas

Because you are not remunerated in any way and are simply advising members

FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax demand is negligent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter has been renting her furnished house in the UK while she is
living in Australia. She did not work either in the UK or Australia during
the tax year April 1993 to April 1994 and did not leave Australia during
that year.
The rent from the UK house is her only income for that year, but the Inland
Revenue has refused to allow her the UK single personal tax allowances for
this year.
As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, she is entitled to a full personal
allowance by virtue of section 278(2)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988.
Write to the District Inspector, marking both your letter and the envelope
'For the attention of the District Inspector': you will probably find the
inspector's name printed on the tax office's letterhead. He will be grateful
to you for drawing his attention to this example of maladministration.
He will also ensure that:
1. Appropriate adjustments are made to the case VI assessments for 1993-94
and 1994-95.
2. Compensation is paid to your daughter for the consequences of the
officer's negligent tax demand for 1993-94.
3. All other assessments and repayment claims dealt with by the officer in
question are checked by a competent colleague, since it is unlikely that
your daughter is the only person who has been over-charged unlawfully.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight years ago, I bought a freehold house in France. I now wish to convert
it into a time-share, with six individuals each taking one-sixth of the
property for Pounds 10,000 each. Should the legalities be arranged in
Britain or France? And what exactly are the tax implications?
France. After all, it was in that country's alpine resorts that time-share
began in the 1960s, so a French property lawyer should be able to guide you.
We assume you are a UK resident; thus, capital gains liabilities may arise
in the transfer to the time-share company. The Inland Revenue publications
department at Somerset House, London WC2 (tel: 071-438 6420) will be able to
supply you with an appropriate booklet. (Murray Johnstone).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter foolishly let a business associate (now under police
investigation for fraud and deception) know the number and PIN of her
Barclaycard. Large sums then were debited to her account by him. Her initial
credit limit was Pounds 3,000 but now she is being chased by Barclaycard for
Pounds 25,000. Can she refuse to pay beyond the agreed limit?
When applying for a Barclaycard, one contracts specifically not to reveal
its details to anyone else. Undoubtedly, Barclaycard will rely on the
contributory negligence of your daughter to pursue her for the debt.
This sorry tale obviously is very complicated. We suggest you contact a
solicitor to explore your daughter's situation in detail. The Consumers

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: 'Tax free' can trap you -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds that savers can lose out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing experts have long used sex to promote their products. In the world
of investments, the words 'tax free' have something of the same pull. But
investors should beware of buying something simply because it carries that
tag.
Take basic-rate taxpayers who buy a personal equity plan solely because it
will save them tax. They are likely to find that the savings take many years
to arrive because of the provider's costs in running the Pep.
Ian Hughes, a freight and distribution consultant, is wary of investments
billed this way. He was sold a 10-year friendly society policy by his
financial adviser who told him it offered 'unique' tax-free advantages that
would bring higher returns than other 10-year investments.
Friendly societies run tax-exempt 10-year savings plans where interest rolls
up gross of tax. In return for tax exemption, the maximum contribution into
these policies is capped by the government at Pounds 200 a year, or Pounds
18 a month.
Hughes was told that his Pounds 9-a-month policy from Family Assurance
friendly society, amounting to a total investment of Pounds 1,080 over the
full term, would have a likely maturity value of Pounds 2,611. But when the
plan reached maturity at the beginning of October, it delivered Pounds
1,222.
As the table (by Micropal) shows, the plan did not keep up with inflation or
with a building society account. Hughes will not have to pay tax on his
matured lump sum, but that is not much comfort, since the building society
figure is shown after deduction of basic-rate tax.
The table also shows that the average friendly society returned Pounds 1,900
over the same period, beating Micropal's unit, investment trust and
insurance fund indices.
Family Assurance's Growth Fund performance is lower than the average for
friendly societies but it is better than the figure for the insurance funds
sector.
Barry Chambers, marketing director at Family Assurance, argues that it is
not fair to compare the performance of the fund - which has just under
Pounds 30m - with the other, far smaller funds in the friendly society
sector where the next largest has just under Pounds 1m under management.
But Hughes received much less on his policy. This is because the figures in
the table do not take charges into account, and it is here that friendly
societies fall down despite their tax advantages. For one thing, the annual
charge is high: Family Assurance charges 1.95 per cent.
Chambers admitted Hughes did not get a good return. 'The reason for that is
the impact of charges,' he said. 'Although they were comparatively low in
monetary terms, as a percentage of premium - Pounds 9 a month - they were
high.'
Fixed costs do eat away a higher proportion of a low-premium investment than
others, but there are some tax-free policies which offer good returns at no
charge.
Small savers can earn up to 8.62 per cent a year tax free through the
government's save-as-you-earn (Saye) scheme. This is a five-year plan with a
minimum monthly saving of Pounds 1 a month and a maximum of only Pounds 20,
or Pounds 1,200 maximum.
The bonus, paid at the end of five years, is equivalent to an annual return
of 8.3 per cent. If the money is left for another two years, it is 8.62 per
cent. These figures gross up to 13.8 and 14.4 per cent for a higher-rate
taxpayer, or 11.1 and 11.5 per cent for someone paying the lower rate.
Early withdrawals are allowed but no interest is paid if a withdrawal is
made in the first year; the rate is 6 per cent thereafter. You can have only
one Saye contract at a time. Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford
&amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Britannia and Halifax are among those offering
the scheme.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: The wrong policies - Diary of a
Private Investor / Derivatives can lead to huge losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I believe strongly in the benefits of insurance, and insurance-linked
savings and pension schemes. But there are two new threats which may affect
the value of my policies and those of millions of others.
Since July 1, UK insurance companies have been allowed, in calculating their
assets, to include the value of their holdings in derivatives. This might
well encourage them to take a much greater part in the highly speculative
and volatile markets for options, swaps and futures.
Although derivatives can be useful for efficient portfolio management, the
question is whether some insurers' relative lack of experience in this area
could lead them into loss-making contracts.
It is fairly easy to make huge losses on derivatives.
Metallgesellschaft, for example, lost well over Dollars 1bn from oil
derivatives, while Procter &amp; Gamble lost Dollars 157m on leveraged currency
swaps.
Perhaps of more interest to pension and life assurance investors is the fact
that a number of US pension funds have lost big sums on derivatives. Several
have dropped more than Dollars 20m each.
A few years ago, I forecast in the FT that some people with endowment
mortgages might have to increase their insurance premiums or face the
possibility that, when their policies matured, the proceeds would be
insufficient to repay the mortgage. This has proved true, with a number of
companies warning of possible shortfalls because of lower investment
returns.
Imagine how much greater the shortfalls might be if some companies, as well
as making unfortunate share and property selections, also invest in
derivatives which produce losses]
The second new threat is from the government, which is considering 'whether
the favourable tax treatment of dividends paid to pension funds encourages
companies to pay larger dividends than they might under a neutral tax
regime'.
This leads to one particularly pertinent question. If companies did pay less
in dividends, would they really use the money saved to fund more research
and development - or would they, instead, make over-generous and
inappropriate take-over bids for other companies, and reward senior
executives with even greater salaries and perks?
If the government does make changes that affect adversely the level of
dividend payments, what effect will this have on insurance companies'
performance if they can no longer rely on a regular stream of good dividend
income?
When the chancellor unveils his Budget this month, I believe that if he
wants to encourage British industry and ensure parity between pension funds
and ordinary investors, he ought to give private investors the same tax
breaks as the government gives to institutions, rather than tampering with
existing tax reliefs.
People should be encouraged to create and manage their own personal pension
fund, rather than having to invest through an institution.
Not so many years ago, everyone's tax return had a section labelled
'chargeable assets acquired' into which people had to list all their shares.
The government should re-introduce such a section, but label it 'pension
assets acquired'.
People should use this to list shares and other assets, up to a specified
level each year - say, a quarter or half of their average annual income. The
dividends and capital gains from such assets would be given tax-free
treatment so long as the assets were used eventually to provide the
individual with a pension.
Such personal schemes would increase greatly the percentage of shares held
directly by individuals, rather than institutions. People also would save
the cost of fees to pension fund managers and would have complete control
over their pension assets.
They would know exactly what they had invested in whereas, with existing
institutionalised schemes, they have little idea - perhaps until too late -
of what the fund manager has done with their money. They could also, if they
wished, avoid derivatives.
It is also worth reminding the government - and the opposition - that it is
individual private investors who are more likely to support long-term
actions by companies.
And, with a few notable exceptions, it is private investors rather than
institutions who are vociferous in condemning directors who get huge
pay-offs for poor performance and/or undeserved salary increases.
If the balance of shareholder power was swung back in favour of private
investors, perhaps there might be less need to worry about 'corporate
governance'. After all, a majority of private investors is much more likely
to boot out a 'bad' director.
Thus, two new threats could be turned into something positive instead.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Move north, pay more - Christopher
Elias on a tax anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER ELIAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The owner of a house in Scotland could find he has to pay more to the Inland
Revenue than someone with a property south of the border. This development,
which could come as an unpleasant surprise to those concerned, affects staff
who must sell up because their employer requires them to move their place of
work from one area to another.
In his spring 1993 Budget, the chancellor of the exchequer announced he had
decided to withdraw various tax concessions. One result was that staff
getting re-location costs from their employers became liable to tax on part
of them. But because of differences in property law between Scotland and
England, the additional tax has resulted in an anomaly.
In most cases, staff members moving their workplace will not be taxed on
benefits provided by their employer to help sell existing homes - such as
payment of estate agents' commission - so long as the benefit is provided
after the employee's 'beneficial interest' in the property has been
transferred.
There, though, is the rub. In Scotland, beneficial interest in property is
not deemed to pass from the owner until the change in ownership is recorded
at the Land Registry. In England and Wales, however, beneficial interest
passes at the date of the contract to sell, and not when ownership itself
passes to the buyer.
One way in which the bill can be reduced in England and Wales is for the
employer or re-location company to enter a contract to buy a staff member's
existing home.
By doing so, it acquires the employee's beneficial interest, which stops the
potential tax bills adding up for him. The actual transfer of ownership is
postponed (along with the legal costs and estate agent's commission) until a
new buyer moves in.
In Scotland, however, all the costs which the staffer would have had to bear
if his employer had not paid them will, potentially, be taxable.
Take a middle manager on a 40 per cent tax rate who is being moved from an
Pounds 85,000 house in Scotland. The rules mean he could have to pay at
least Pounds 850 in tax over and above that in England and Wales, while his
employer could have to pay at least Pounds 1,000 more.
Ian Payne, managing director of PRIcoa Relocation - part of the Prudential
Insurance group - which is lobbying to amend the rules, says: 'While I
appreciate the Revenue's hands are tied, we have a grossly unfair tax
anomaly which must be rectified.
'This would remove a fiscal penalty on employees asked to move to or from
Scotland which their English counterparts do not have to pay. The lobbying
exercise aims to achieve tax parity as soon as possible.'
The writer is a partner at City solicitor Elias Freeman.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Down but still battling - Leslie
McClements remains optimistic about his pension prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE MCCLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After leaving a public sector pension scheme, the author took a lump sum
transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. When the annual charges rose,
he decided he could do better by himself and transferred the personal
pension into a small self-administered scheme . . .
By mid-summer, the likelihood of a rise in base rates had increased. The
prospect of more short-term interest rate rises over the next year had also
grown, so it was time to reduce further the portfolio's exposure to
interest-sensitive stocks. This assessment was confirmed when base rates
were increased by half a percentage point on September 12.
Early in August, I sold the Abtrust Preferred Income investment trust income
shares and Bristol and West permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). While
the sales yielded capital gains of 79 and 15 per cent respectively on their
purchase prices in early 1993, the proceeds were 13 to 14 per cent below the
peak prices of late January 1994. With hindsight, I should have acted six
months earlier.
I wanted to increase my overseas weighting and felt Australia and New
Zealand should benefit from both higher commodity prices and their trade
with the more dynamic Pacific economies. So, I bought NM Smaller Australian
and New Zealand investment trusts, although they have since declined by 14
to 15 per cent. While the yields are much lower, these stocks should have
better prospects over the next couple of years.
I have also experimented with traded options. A small proportion (2.5 per
cent) of the fund was used to open Redland and BTR call options early in
September. With interest rate worries and the weakness in the US dollar,
both are showing substantial losses. But as they are the February 1995
series, I hope they will recover before then. Nonetheless, I continue to
feel options are too volatile for me.
Sphere investment trust income shares, with a 1.6-fold increase since early
1993, are the star performer in my fund.
Early in October, Dartmoor investment trust offered eight new shares for
every 25 Sphere shares and the prospect of an improved yield. In response,
Sphere intends to pay an enhanced dividend. The market reaction has been
adverse, however.
The bidder and two fund managers, who account for more than half the Sphere
income shares, have accepted the Dartmoor offer but I have decided to retain
the Sphere shares until the wind-up in October 1995. By that stage, the
discount of more than one-tenth should be eliminated. Meanwhile, the net
asset value will increase with any recovery in world markets.
Artesian Commercial and Artesian Second Commercial, the unquoted property
companies, have produced their first audited accounts. Commercial has
achieved an 11 per cent increase in its net asset value and will pay a gross
dividend of 12 per cent for the year.
Second Commercial began to acquire properties only this year and issue costs
led to a small decline in shareholders' funds. Both companies are geared
highly but their borrowings are protected by interest rate caps.
Mucklow Group is my fund's other property investment. It specialises in
Midlands industrial estates and should benefit from continued growth in
manufacturing output. In all, property now accounts for one-fifth of the
portfolio. I have reduced exposure to interest-sensitive stocks greatly
since the beginning of the year (see chart).
The portfolio is now down 10.8 per cent on the position in January, which
compares with a fall of 6.8 per cent in the FT-SE-A index adjusted for gross
dividends. But the fund should outperform in a market recovery.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annuities are either pension-generated - that is, bought with a retirement
fund - or purchased with the individual's own capital.
Income from a pension-generated annuity is taxed as earned income, but
payments from a purchased life annuity are split into interest, which is
taxed, and return of capital, which is not.
So, the net income from a PLA is greater for the higher-rate taxpayer than
that from a pension-generated annuity bought with the same money.
If the investor has poor health, an impaired purchased life annuity, offered
by a small number of life companies, should be considered. These give
enhanced rates based on the perceived life expectancy of the investor and
are particularly attractive to people who have, or are expecting, high
health-care costs.

investment. PURCHASED LIFE ANNUITIES are bought by people wanting extra
regular income. Rates are attractive for older people. The annuity
income is not fully taxable. The table shows rates net of 25 per cent
income tax. Certain rates include 'capital protection', allowing the
capital invested - less instalments paid to you - to be returned
to your estate when you die.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Pay now but wait until 1996 -
Tickets for popular events can go on sale years ahead. Jacqueline Shorey
wonders why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE SHOREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses usually have 30 to 60 days to settle bills and consumers pay cash
for many goods and services. But sport and music fans are being expected to
pay for tickets up to 2 1/2 years in advance.
Tickets for the 1996 European soccer championship, to be played in England,
went on general sale last week - 20 months before the first game kicks off.
But season ticket-holders at English league clubs were offered priority
booking last January - nearly 2 1/2 years before Euro '96 begins.
Mike Parry, of the Football Association, says early ticket sales are 'to
give real fans ample opportunity to buy them. It's a huge operation,
involving 1.3m tickets at eight venues. The time is needed to ensure the
smooth running of the competition and to administer a direct debit system,
which we're offering to fans to spread the cost'.
Yet, football fans do not even know what teams they will see, since the draw
will not be held until December 1995. For now, they are simply buying seats
at a ground.
Steve Beauchampe, of the Football Supporters' Association, says: 'One reason
for such early ticket sales is that the FA needs to be sure that it will
sell out all the matches. Some of the less attractive games may be a
struggle.'
The FA expects to raise about Pounds 60m if all matches sell out. What
happens to that cash, and the interest it generates? Answer: the money goes
into a trust fund account and. after expenses, the profit is split between
Uefa, soccer's European governing body, and the FA.
Music promoters also are keen to get their hands on your money early. A US
rock group, REM, will play big British stadiums next July - but tickets,
costing Pounds 23, went on sale on October 22, nine months in advance. How
does Paul Flower, marketing manager of promoter MCP, justify that?
'REM is one of the world's biggest bands. They haven't played in Britain for
five years and have had three No 1 albums. We want to make sure that
everyone who wants to see them can.' Flower declined to say where the money
went, and to whom, but said advertising and venues had to be paid for and
groups needed cash to hire equipment and finance often-elaborate shows.
Nick Blackburn, sales and marketing director of Ticketmaster, a leading
ticket agency, says: 'I sympathise with promoters, who take big risks and
who are being squeezed on deals. But customers need protection. We sold
Pounds  1/4 m-worth of tickets for a UK tour by the Bolshoi Ballet this
summer but the promoter, Derek Block, went under before the concerts took
place. We had passed the money on to Derek Block, so we had no money for
refunds.'
If a promoter fails, the prospects are bleak. Susan Hayward of the
Consumers' Association (CA), says: 'The ticket-holder has a contract with
the promoter, not the agent. Under the Consumer Credit Act, if the tickets
cost more than Pounds 100 each, are paid for by credit card and payment is
to the promoter direct, the credit card company must pay compensation if the
promoter fails. But most payments are made via an agent.'
Ticketmaster decided to refund Bolshoi clients from its own pocket.
Blackburn says: 'It's hard to see what lesson can be learnt from this
experience. Promoters and acts continue to press for ticket money.
'I'd like to see an escrow fund - from which ticket money is not released to
the promoter until the show - which would protect the public.' The CA would
like to see a bond scheme, similar to that in the travel industry.
Harvey Goldsmith, a rock music promoter who has put on shows by Pink Floyd
and Elton John, is chairman of the Concert Promoters' Association. 'We are
encouraging ticket agents to come up with a code of practice, being drawn up
with the help of the Office of Fair Trading,' he says.
Why did tickets go on sale so early? 'Because people buy tickets with
'today's money'. If we wait and put tickets on sale all at once for 10
different shows next summer, people won't have the money to buy all they
want. We try to stagger ticket availability and give people time to buy - or
they go mad at us.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Making money with options - Heather
Farmbrough investigates their good points but finds some pitfalls, too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past month, stockbrokers Fidelity and Wise Speke have launched
options-dealing services designed to attract private clients. Is this a sign
that the market is taking off?
Well, no. It seems more likely that trading has been quiet in the
derivatives market and brokers are trying to drum up business. Nevertheless,
it is well worth looking at options, particularly as the market does not
need to be rising for investors to make money.
Options often are marketed as a cheap and safe way into the stock market.
Paying 15p for an option might seem a small outlay compared with 800p for a
share in ICI. And, as Fidelity's Judith MacMichael says: 'They have some of
the characteristics of trading shares within the stock exchange account (no
longer possible since the introduction of rolling settlement). You don't
have to put up much money to make short-term gains and losses.'
Under the old stock exchange system of trading accounts, it was possible to
buy and sell equities over the 28-day account period without having to part
with any money apart from settling losses. Now that is no longer the case,
the two best ways of playing the market in the short term are either options
or margin trading.
The latter requires investors to arrange credit to pay for the majority of
the purchase cost of the shares on settlement day, but this can be
complicated and expensive. So, options seem likely to become the more
popular, particularly when the equity market settlement period is reduced to
five days next year.
With a call or put option, you buy the right to purchase or sell shares. But
as you are under no obligation to take up the option, your potential losses
are limited only to the premium paid to acquire the rights to the shares and
your dealing costs.
If you understand the markets, the low-cost, execution-only dealing services
offer good commission rates for private investors.
Three years ago, Sharelink shook the market by undercutting commission
rates, offering 1.5 per cent commission on opening and 1 per cent on closing
bargains. But Fidelity has just launched a new execution-only discount
dealing service which undercuts Sharelink by charging 1.25 per cent on
opening, although the closing commission is the same (see top table).
If you are a regular options trader who does not need advice and tends to
deal in small amounts, Sharelink is good value, especially as its contract
fee is smaller than that of Fidelity. But if you are dealing in larger
amounts, Fidelity's lower commissions may be better.
Advice costs more: commissions for Wise Speke's original advisory service
start at 2.5 per cent on opening bargains of up to Pounds 5,000, while
Albert E. Sharp charges 4 per cent.
There is no shortage of brokers offering an advisory service. Some offer
discretionary dealing services, too. The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has a 15-page booklet crammed with the
names of private client brokers. It is worth shopping around as rates do
vary considerably (see table). Liffe also publishes several well-informed
booklets and organises regular seminars for investors.
Wise Speke's new specialist options guidance service is designed for the
investor who has decided which stock he wants but who wants guidance on the
best way to buy. But, you might ask: isn't an investor who knows which
options he wants better off paying less for a no-frills, execution-only
service?
Not so, says James Butcher at Wise Speke. 'People become obsessed with
commissions, but one of the problems in the options market is that you do
get a wide spread between bid and offer.'
He claims that because his dealers know the supply and demand in the market
for various stocks, and usually are dealing for several clients at a time,
they can offer better terms than clients may receive placing one-off
transactions elsewhere. As an example, he says the spread on Hanson or
British Gas February 220 calls is now 11-14 pence. By dealing in a larger
size, Butcher claims he is more likely to be able to buy the options for his
clients at 13p, saving 1p on each contract.
There are some brokers who will trade in options on a discretionary basis
(see bottom table). But others claim that most clients prefer execution-only
services. 'Options investors tend to tell us what to do - not the other way
round,' says Peter Loxton, of stockbroker Charles Stanley. But if you are
new to options, bear in mind that good advice can cost far less than the
losses from a poor investment decision.
If you write an option - that is, you receive the premium for an option and
agree to sell or buy the shares if required to by its holder  - the picture
is very different. Potential losses can be open-ended.
The London Stock Exchange's derivative instrument risks' warning states, in
bold type: 'You should not deal in derivatives unless you understand the
nature of the contracts you are entering into and the extent of your
exposure to risk.'
In other words, do not write options unless you have enough cash to buy the
underlying shares or you hold the required number of shares underlying the
option.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: See the wood and buy the trees -
James Buxton explores a new scheme to lure forestry investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual investors have barely touched forestry as an investment since
1988. That was when the government terminated the tax break system which
gave the industry a bad name as high-earning sportsmen and show business
figures planted hillsides full of conifers in northern Scotland.
Yet, not everyone dislikes conifers, and the plantations are being made more
attractive to see and visit. Furthermore, forestry still offers generous tax
concessions.
No income tax is payable on income from commercial woodlands and there is no
capital gains tax on increases in the value of standing or felled timber.
Investments in forestry held for two years qualify for 100 per cent business
property relief from inheritance tax (IHT).
Up to now, those tax benefits have been enjoyed mainly by land-owners. Now,
though, a fund has been launched which will enable individuals to make small
investments - the minimum stake is Pounds 1,000 - in existing woodlands.
The Timber Lands Distribution Fund (TLDF) expects to offer a net annual
distribution of 8 per cent a year over the next decade. Since that is free
of income tax, it represents the equivalent of 13.3 per cent for higher-rate
taxpayers.
TLDF is sponsored by Neill Clerk Capital (NCC), a company which has
specialised in business expansion scheme companies, and Savills, a surveyor
and estate agent. They intend to raise up to Pounds 4.13m to buy plantations
of mature and semi-mature sitka spruce trees from Tilhill Economic Forestry,
a management company which will run the woodlands.
The first forest to be acquired is Black Rigg at Newcastleton, Cumbria,
followed by another at Lochgilphead in Argyll, while the sponsors have an
option on three more. Fund-holders will be allowed to explore them, and much
of the woodland will be harvested gradually over the fund's 10-year life.
The sponsors believe the value of the timber will increase because conifers
are known to appreciate in value over their 40-year span, especially in the
final decade.
On top of that, the sponsors say timber prices are recovering from their
all-time low at the end of 1991 and point to the 12.5 per cent rise (in the
year to March 1994) in the index of standing conifer sales compiled by
Forest Enterprise, part of the Forestry Commission.
At the end of the fund's life, all the capital will be returned. The
sponsors hope the amount will at least equal the starting capital - although
there are no guarantees - and claim it is possible there will be a capital
gain from selling the remaining standing timber.
TLDF is not a trust but an 'unregulated collective investment' under the
1986 Financial Services Act. This means it is not subject to any regulatory
body (although NCC belongs to the Securities and Futures Authority).
Unlike a unit trust, there is no established market for the fund, and the
sponsors warn that investors could have difficulty selling their stakes if
they want to pull out before the fund is wound up - although NCC will try to
arrange sales on a matched bargain basis. NCC also cautions that tax rates
and reliefs may change and timber prices could fall.
Investors will have to bear issue costs estimated at 6.5 per cent, including
a 3 per cent commission to intermediaries, as well as property acquisition
costs put at 1.5 per cent; an annual 1 per cent management fee for NCC; and
an annual forestry contractor's fee of Pounds 5.50 a hectare for Tilhill.
The fund, which closes on December 20, should appeal to higher-rate
taxpayers wishing to diversify their investments, and to people seeking to
reduce their IHT liability. An interest in forestry is an advantage.
Prospectuses are available from Neill Clerk Capital: telephone 071-734 4446.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Institutions get tougher - New
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pulled flotations, over-subscriptions and healthy trading premiums this week
have illustrated the stark contrast in the receptions accorded to different
companies in the new issues market.
New Look, the women's wear chain, confirmed many a sceptic's view that the
market has overheated when on Wednesday - the afternoon before the share
pricing was due to be announced - it postponed its flotation plans.
The following day, however, TLG - the holding company for Thorn Lighting
Group - said its flotation was three times over-subscribed. And there was
good news from Calluna: shares in the disk drive manufacturer leapt 42 per
cent on Monday, its first day of trading.
Schroders, the adviser to New Look, trotted out the well-worn 'adverse
market conditions' excuse. But City analysts are taking a different view.
They point out that after the flood of new issues this year, the market is
returning to a form of equilibrium with new issues again being judged on
management, prospects, track records, margins and other fundamentals
Most of all, the fall in demand from institutional investors has prompted a
re-rating: prices are being forced down. In the case of TLG, for example,
the shares originally were offered to institutions at a figure 10 per cent
higher than their eventual price.
In New Look's case, retail analysts say that with institutional share buying
at a seasonal low, the Budget looming and retailers gloomy over the outlook
for Christmas, launching a shopping company at this time was always going to
be tricky.
New Look has more than tripled operating profits and turnover in the past
three years. Profits of Pounds 11m last year were almost matched by the
near-Pounds 10m posted for first six months of this year, while operating
margins of 16.9 per cent are double those of its nearest rival, Etam, and
well ahead of the market's retailing doyen, Next.
'With margins like those, where would any expansion come from?' asked one
fund manager.
The success of TLG and Calluna shows the new issues market is still a place
for healthy business. New Look's postponement demonstrates a more rigorous
attitude from institutional investors.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Just five days to pay - Bethan
Hutton on the latest stage of rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors have just under eight months to get used to the idea of
paying for shares five days after buying them. The London Stock Exchange
announced this week that T+5, the next stage of rolling settlement, would
start on June 26 1995.
The first stage of rolling settlement was introduced in July when the old
stock exchange account periods were axed and replaced with the new system of
settling share transactions 10 days later, known as T+10.
The move to T+5 was planned originally for January but was postponed to
allow market traders more time to adjust. The main pressure behind rolling
settlement comes from the big institutions, which account for the bulk of
dealing on the stock exchange.
'It will make life more difficult for the minority but I think it is
inevitable. Wall Street is moving to T+3,' says Brian Tora, of private
client stockbroker Greig Middleton. Paul Killik, senior partner at Killik &amp;
Co., agrees. 'The dynamics of this are institutional and international - you
cannot stop it. It is no good complaining.'
The advent of T+5 will increase the pressure for changes in practices which
started with T+10. 'We certainly think that T+5 is going to be difficult for
a lot of private clients to meet,' says Tora. Selling is not such a problem,
but he feels more investors will find their broker asking for payment up
front before he will place an order.
Tora adds: 'If you look at the pure mechanics of it, you are talking about
phoning an order in and the contract note being issued which, at the very
best, is going to arrive a day later, maybe even the day after that,
depending on circumstances.
'Then the private client has to send the cheque, which will take another
day, and that cheque is going to need three days to clear - so, effectively,
the broker is going to be out of funds.'
There is a growing tendency for brokers to charge interest on late payments
but they are also working on other ways around this problem. Common
solutions are to provide client banking facilities, so eliminating the time
wasted sending cheques through the post, or to offer credit. Usually, this
is done through margin trading where brokers lend clients money to buy
shares on the security of shares they own already.
Greig Middleton already has banking arrangements for its customers. 'Clients
have a nominated deposit account: sales can be credited to that and
purchases settled from it. Obviously, it makes life a lot easier,' says
Tora.
The firm is still working on its plans to offer margin trading. Similarly,
Killik is hoping to have client banking and margin trading facilities in
place in good time for T+5.
T+5 will make nominee accounts for holding shares almost unavoidable, as the
five-day system simply makes the physical sending of share certificates to
and fro increasingly infeasible.
More than 90 per cent of Killik's clients now use nominees, although Killik
is still unhappy about some drawbacks of the system, such as the effect on
communication between companies and shareholders.
Most brokers say that the transition to T+10 was much smoother and caused
fewer problems than they expected. They now hope that halving the settlement
period will prove equally trouble-free.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Stale result for baking giant - The
week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Associated British Foods, the UK's biggest baker, will be hard
pressed to make pre-tax profits for the year to September any higher than
the Pounds 338m a year earlier. Some analysts are looking for as much as a
Pounds 40m fall. Improved food and sugar profits in the UK are likely to be
offset by falling profits in Australia and a further deterioration in
finances.
Net interest earned might be halved from the previous year's Pounds 61m but
the dividend is expected to rise 0.3p to 6.8p for the year.
MONDAY: The City forecasts pre-tax profits at BAA to rise from Pounds 237m
to around Pounds 262m in the first half. The group, which operates seven UK
airports, is expected to show strong growth in traffic but analysts will be
looking to see if Stansted, London's third airport, has moved into profit.
TUESDAY: British Airways should make pre-tax profits between Pounds 210m and
Pounds 220m in the second quarter, up from Pounds 172m last year. Analysts
expect the core airline business to perform very well. But the performances
of the US carrier USAir, BA's French affiliate TAT and its German partner
Deutsche BA, will all come under scrutiny.
TUESDAY: Investment bank SG Warburg will announce earnings for the six
months ended September 30 and securities analysts are offering no prizes for
guessing the results. Last month, Warburg put out a profits warning in which
it said that it expected to report earnings of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m for
the period, down sharply from the Pounds 148.8m in the same period in 1993.
TUESDAY: Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is expected
to announce another strong set of results, with interim pre-tax profits
rising from Pounds 307.8m to around Pounds 355m. But the figures could be
distorted slightly by last year's 53-week period and an early Easter
holiday. Analysts are concerned about trading levels and start-up costs on
the continent.
TUESDAY: Anglian Water is forecast to show interim pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 110m (Pounds 100.5m) when it reports, and an 8.5 per cent increase in
the pay-out to 7.9p. Treatment of infrastructure charges could affect the
headline numbers.
WEDNESDAY: Commercial Union is forecast to show pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 285m compared with Pounds 144m last time. The results will be the
first since the acquisition of French insurer Groupe Victoire, though its
impact is expected to be marginal at this stage.
WEDNESDAY: Half-year results from Amersham International, which makes
diagnostic pharmaceuticals, should present a clearer picture of the
company's fortunes than did last year's, which were distorted by
acquisition.
A good performance from its product, Metastron, should help the company
record a pre-tax profit of at least Pounds 20m, compared with Pounds 17.4m
last time, and allow a 14 per cent rise in the dividend from 4.4p to 5p.
WEDNESDAY: Analysts are forecasting interim pre-tax profits in the range of
Pounds 550m to Pounds 580m for Cable &amp; Wireless - which at mid-point is
about 11 per cent up on last year's Pounds 509m.
Continued strong growth at Hongkong Telecom, far and away C&amp;W's largest
profit earner, will be offset by slower growth at Mercury, C&amp;W's UK
subsidiary, which is fighting hard against rising UK competition and fast
declining BT prices. Start-up costs for ventures such as Mercury One-2-One
will also affect non-Hong Kong earnings.
THURSDAY: Second-quarter pre-tax profits at British Telecommunications are
expected to fall between Pounds 750m and Pounds 800m, after about Pounds
100m in redundancy charges but before a Pounds 75m re-purchase of bonds.
That compares with Pounds 743m last year after redundancy charges, giving
underlying profits growth of about 4.5 per cent.
Although other cable operators are advancing, most analysts believe that BT
is responding positively to growing competition in the British market.
Cellnet, BT's mobile joint venture with Securicor, is expected to report a
strong performance.
THURSDAY: Royal Insurance is expected to confirm its recovery from heavy
losses early in the 1990s with a pre-tax profit figure of about Pounds 310m
against Pounds 113m last time.
THURSDAY: Northumbrian Water is likely to show a substantial rise to about
Pounds 39m (Pounds 22.6m) in spite of non-core losses, and could follow the
example set by Thames Water with an 11 per cent dividend increase to 9p.
THURSDAY: ScottishPower will be expected to offer some indications of future
dividend growth after the recent electricity price review. Forecasts are for
about Pounds 124m (Pounds 115.7m) in pre-tax profits, with an increase in
the dividend from 4.13p to about 4.6p.
THURSDAY: Burton, the clothing retail group, is forecast to announce pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 43m for the year (Pounds 18.5m).
Margins at the multiples, which include Burtons, Dorothy Perkins and Top
Shop, are thought to have been squeezed. The best performer is again
expected to be the department store Debenhams.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of stock by Geoffrey Brown, chief executive and major shareholder
at CentreGold, an electronic games publisher and distributor, came soon
after its final results. Broker Smith New Court took company executives to
visit its institutional contacts, a move that generated considerable
interest in CentreGold. But the resulting demand for stock could not be met
in the market; thus, Brown's sale.
Bluebird Toys featured a couple of weeks ago when chairman Torquil Norman
sold 1.2m shares. Although he undertook not to sell any more, one of the
executive directors, David Laxton, has now disposed of almost half his
stake.
The buying in Wickes is significant, if only because it is unusual to see
quite so many directors buying all together. The share price has languished
since announcement of final results in August. But such a show of unity
should not be ignored completely.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: For income, growth and tax planning,
too - Debbie Harrison examines insurance bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those seeking the best way to invest a lump sum to provide capital growth, a
regular income or a combination of both may - in addition to a host of unit
trusts - come across a confusing range of insurance bonds which claim to
meet these requirements and, at the same time, offer chances for tax
planning.
Insurance bonds, sold by life offices, are one-off or 'single premium'
investments. In most cases, they have no fixed maturity date. The range of
funds is similar to unit trusts although there are special low-risk
insurance bond options that appeal to the ultra-cautious investor. But the
tax treatment of insurance bonds and unit trusts is different.
The element of life cover offered by insurance bonds, although nominal,
allows them to qualify for standard life assurance tax treatment. This means
that the fund, not the individual, pays tax that is equivalent broadly to
the basic rate on both income and capital gains.
With unit trusts, the dividends distributed are deemed net of lower-rate
income tax but the fund rolls up free of capital gains tax (CGT), which is
paid by the investor when units are cashed in. This gives unit trusts two
advantages over insurance bonds.
First, the investor can use his annual CGT allowance to offset this tax.
Second, non-taxpayers can reclaim all or most of the income tax (depending
on the fund) which is deducted from the dividends. The same is true for
investment trusts.
Under an insurance bond, these taxes cannot be offset or reclaimed, which
means that non-taxpayers generally should not invest in bonds. Taxpayers
should consider the CGT implications very carefully before opting for a bond
rather than a unit or investment trust.
The main distinguishing feature of bonds is that the investor can withdraw 5
per cent of the original capital for 20 years without having to include this
'income' in the tax return. This is because the Inland Revenue regards these
withdrawals as a return of the original capital investment. The 5 per cent
annual withdrawal can be carried over fully or partially to future years.
For lower-rate taxpayers, there is no further liability, but higher-rate
taxpayers will be liable to tax when the bond is cashed in. But they can
claim 'top-slicing' relief on any profit they have made.
This works by averaging the profit over the number of years the bond has
been in place and adding the result to the investor's income, so arriving at
any higher-rate tax due.
You can make withdrawals larger than 5 per cent. These are treated as net of
basic-rate income tax, so there is no further charge for basic-rate
taxpayers. But those paying higher-rate tax will incur a 15 per cent
liability (the difference between the basic and higher rates). This
flexibility over the amount of income withdrawn is considered one of the
most important features of insurance bonds.
Advisers usually recommend that the policy is written on a joint life basis
so that, if the policyholder dies, the bond can continue in the spouse's
name. You can also write the policy in a simple family trust so that, on
death, the fund passes on in a tax-efficient way to the next generation.
Charges on unit-linked bonds are similar to unit trusts with a 5 per cent
initial charge (the bid/offer spread) and an annual management charge of
between 0.75 per cent and 1.25 per cent depending on the fund. Fee-based
advisers will be able to reduce or eliminate the initial charge.
If you are interested in a bond, your adviser should consider the tax
consequences and your attitude to risk before selecting the most appropriate
product (see 'choice' below). With a large number of funds available for
most types of bond, independent advice is essential.
Good, consistent performance is paramount, but the adviser should also check
the provider's charges and financial strength. This is particularly
important in the case of with-profits funds, which must have substantial
reserves.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Making the right choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is important to select the right type of insurance bond to match your
requirements, both from the tax aspect (see above) and your attitude to
risk.
Guaranteed income bonds
These are designed for the very cautious investor who wants a regular income
and to preserve capital. They are fixed-term products usually held for one
to five years, with a penalty for early termination.
Charges are not disclosed but are deducted from the return, as with a
building society account. Rates change often but it is possible at present
to secure an annual return of 7.5 to 8.5 per cent, net of basic rate tax,
for five years. Guaranteed growth bonds operate in a similar way but
re-invest the income.
With-profits bonds
These are designed for cautious investors who want an element of capital
growth. The fund invests in equities, property, gilts and cash. While the
full return of capital is not always guaranteed, the annual return (or
'bonus') is, once it has been allocated.
Bonuses have fallen in recent years, but a well-managed fund should outstrip
building society returns by a substantial margin. There is no fixed maturity
date, but a minimum term of five years - and preferably 10 - is recommended.
If market conditions are very poor, the provider retains the right to make
deductions (known as the market value adjustor) when a bond is cashed in.
Distribution bonds
These represent the next step up the risk ladder from with-profits bonds.
Your investment buys units in the fund, which is invested in similar assets
to the with-profits bond. Distribution bonds separate the income from the
capital growth. Withdrawals are taken from the income, leaving the original
capital intact.
Managed and specialist
unit-linked bonds
These are designed for the more adventurous investor. Managed funds
generally invest in a range of the providers' main funds but tend to be
equity-dominated. Specialist funds invest in particular markets - say, Far
East or European equities - but low-risk funds, such as cash and fixed
interest, are also available. Usually, it is possible to switch between
funds free of charge or for a nominal fee. These internal switches will not
incur a tax charge.
High-income bonds
These are similar to guaranteed income bonds but there is no guarantee that
the full capital invested will be returned. Instead, this usually depends on
the performance of the FT-SE 100 index. If the index does not fall over the
investment period, the return of original capital may be guaranteed. At
present, these bonds offer 9-10 per cent income a year net of basic-rate
tax. Investors should always check the conditions under which the full
capital will be returned.
Guaranteed equity bonds
These are growth-orientated and not recommended for people seeking income.
The bond usually provides a minimum rate of return - for example, 25-35 per
cent over five years on top of the original capital. There may be additional
returns, depending on the performance of the index to which the bond is
linked.
Offshore bonds can be used as long-term vehicles for tax planning,
especially where you want to leave the assets to the next generation. They
are gross funds: the tax and CGT liability rests with the individual.
This guide was compiled with the help of Andrew Jones, a partner with the
David Aaron Partnership, an independent adviser which will provide
individual surveys on guaranteed income bonds, with-profits bonds and
distribution bonds plus a guide to simple family trusts. Write to the

FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: BAT awaits their judgment - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton Pollack, stands between BAT Industries
and a higher rating of its shares. On December 5 in New York City he will
open the trial sought by the US Federal Trade Commission to block BAT's
Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco.
After a near-trebling of BAT's third quarter US tobacco profits, reported
this week, investors are in no doubt about the importance of cigarettes to
BAT. The story was repeated around the world with a strong resurgence in
Brazil and booming UK exports, particularly to eastern Europe, the former
Soviet Union and the far east. Tobacco trading profits were up 13 per cent
to Pounds 920m in the nine months ended September.
In contrast, financial services contributed Pounds 674m, up 3 per cent, to
group trading profits. This division has its own problems ranging from
investigations by UK regulators of the personal pension industry, rising
claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake and falling investment
income at Eagle Star in the UK.
'We've scored a unique regulatory double,' Martin Broughton, group chief
executive, said unveiling the results. Any expense from compensating
individuals poorly advised to buy a pension from BAT's Allied Dunbar or
Eagle Star subsidiaries is likely to be minor, analysts estimate. Greater
investor concern is focused on Allied Dunbar's style. Although well run and
growing its profits, it is still cold calling and paying only commissions to
sales staff while many of its competitors are moving to salaried, less
aggressive techniques.
The tobacco hurdle is higher. Buying American Tobacco from American Brands
would push BAT's US market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent, third
behind Philip Morris with some 46 per cent and RJR Nabisco with 28 per cent.
The FTC argues that American Tobacco's loss of independence would remove a
price 'maverick' from the market and make it easier for the remaining
companies to collude on prices. BAT argues that the deal will make it a
stronger number three and, anyway, the Supreme Court ruled several years ago
that collusion was impossible and BAT competed keenly on price.
Judge Pollack, the bane of lawyers in the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy
and other high profile cases, will decide the issue. Observers say he is
quick of mind and court action, crusty, independent and unlikely to take
bureaucrats' arguments at face value. Moreover, the FTC has lost roughly
half the anti-trust cases it has taken to court in the past 17 years.
Losing American Tobacco would be a blow to BAT. It would forego the cost
savings, added marketing clout and brand synergies the deal would bring. But
its existing US business is performing well and abroad BAT is benefitting
from a brands swap it agreed previously with American Tobacco.
BAT is the most international of cigarette companies. Global consumption
fell by 0.5 per cent a year between 1988 and 1993, according to Diana Temple
of Salomon Brothers. But for every market declining, another beckons as it
opens up to foreign cigarettes. The most enticing is China, accounting for
one-third of the world's cigarettes. On one hand the government is trying to
curb consumption but on the other it is opening the market. BAT has about
half the imports which account for roughly 5 per cent of consumption. Its
weakness, though, is it lacks a local venture unlike Philip Morris, RJR and
Rothmans International.
Encouraged by the third quarter results, analysts raised their full-year
pre-tax forecasts a notch to around Pounds 2bn against last year's Pounds
1.8bn. But thanks to rising tax and minorities, they left earnings per share
unchanged at around 40p versus 38.5p. The best part is the yield of around 6
per cent with a bigger payout to come at the year end.
An all clear from the judge would remove a cloud over BAT's shares and let
investors focus on the wider tobacco potential around the world. But for
real value, the bulls say, the tobacco and financial services arms should be
floated separately. That, however, is a judgment BAT seems reluctant to
make.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: Roll over Tiny, sell-offs and superstores - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly, things change. Several eras that had helped define British
business life over many years came to an end this week: government
enthusiasm for privatisation, the growth of out-of-town supermarkets and
Tiny Rowland's reign at Lonrho.
Selling off the Post Office always threatened to be a privatisation too far
for the Conservatives. So it proved for a handful of their backbench MPs,
who forced the government to abandon what would have been the centrepiece of
its forthcoming legislative programme.
One reason for the recent backlash against privatisation has been the
behaviour of the water companies since they were sold off. The government
was anxious to ensure that the industry would have funds to make long
overdue investment in infrastructure, so the companies were offered a
generous regulatory regime.
The water companies have responded by pushing up charges and raising - at an
even faster rate - the level of boardroom remuneration. Thames Water kicked
off the sector's interim reporting season with an 11 per cent dividend
increase - above market expectations. This boosted the share prices of most
of the water companies, but the National Consumer Council said the dividend
increase just confirmed its view that the original price controls had
allowed companies and shareholders to benefit more than consumers.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of Thames, warned investors not to expect such a
generous dividend under the new pricing regime, which starts in April.
MPs were also to the fore in warning that further construction of
out-of-town shopping centres and superstores should be restricted.
Next day J Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, confirmed that
tougher government planning restrictions were starting to bite, and said it
expected to open only 12 new supermarkets next year compared with plans for
20. The group won only one out of nine planning appeals this year, and did
not foresee a reversal of this in the near future.
Sainsbury increased its interim pre-tax profits by 6.5 per cent. However, it
said like-for-like sales, excluding new space, increased only 1 per cent,
with price deflation of 0.6 per cent. The fall in prices was partly a result
of Sainsbury's 'Essentials' price-cutting campaign, which started a year
ago. David Sainsbury, chairman, said he believed the campaign had
neutralised the threat from low-priced discount competitors, and profit
margins could now be held.
The big retailers have certainly fought back hard against their discount
rivals. Kwik Save consolidated its position as Britain's leading discount
grocer through buying 117 Shoprite stores in Scotland and northern England
for Pounds 45m. This is the first significant withdrawal among the discount
chains that expanded rapidly in the UK during in the early 1990s. Shoprite's
shares were the best performers in the food retailing sector last year, but
plunged after the group expanded too quickly paying too much for sometimes
substandard sites.
The departure of Rowland after 33 years at the head of the international
trading conglomerate Lonrho had been often predicted. So often, in fact,
that the initial reaction in the City was to doubt whether the German
pretender Dieter Bock really had ousted his fellow joint executive. It does
appear that the 76-year-old swashbuckler is on the way out, but no-one who
has followed his extraordinary career would assume we have have heard the
last from Tiny.
Such fin de siecle musings proved diverting in an equity market which
continues to suffer low turnover, high volatility and sporadic alarms from
currency and bond markets.
The week's main event was the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report
which said the UK's inflation outlook had improved. Its forecast of
underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage interest payments) in mid-1996
has been reduced to 2.5 per cent, from around 3 per cent in its last
forecast. However, the bank also implied that interest rates would probably
need to rise over the coming months to keep inflation on target.
Relief on Tuesday that an immediate interest rate rise did not appear to be
on the cards helped turn around an early 20-point fall in the FT-SE 100,
which had been provoked by the adverse reaction of the dollar and global
bond markets to figures showing the highest level of US business activity
for seven years.
The fall of the dollar to a postwar low against the yen on Wednesday
provoked strong intervention by the US Federal Reserve. British bonds
responded favourably to the better performance by US bonds and the dollar,
and this bolstered London equities.
Traders finished the week in uncertain mood. There is some concern that the
next rise in interest rates will be dictated not by domestic inflation
concerns, but in response to an increase in US rates to support the dollar.
That will not happen before Tuesday's US mid-term elections, but the City
spots a window of opportunity for the chancellor to push up rates between
then and his November 29 Budget.
The Treasury's six-man panel of independent economic forecasters advised the
chancellor against an immediate rise in interest rates. Professor Patrick
Minford of Liverpool University said no one should be misled by the large
rises in commodity prices over the past year. He said most of the increase
was a necessary correction to their huge past relative price declines.
A milestone week ended with news that two investment banks are planning on
moving staff into Canary Wharf, which would reduce the Pounds 1.5bn Dockland
complex's unoccupied space to less than 1m sq ft out of a total of 4.5m sq
ft. Canary Wharf no longer a white elephant? Can one rely on nothing these
days?

FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: A strange birth and an awkward death - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bit of commonsense seems to be coming back to the main new issues market.
Promising issues such as Thorn are resoundingly oversubscribed; chancier
ones such as New Look are aborted. This is how the issues market is meant to
work - saying 'yes' to the sheep, 'no' to the goats.
Vetting them is a suitable job for the pros - sponsors and the investing
institutions. And once a company has been accepted on to the market, private
investors can have some confidence that it will not fall to pieces quite as
quickly as some of this summer's debutantes - Aerostructures Hamble, for
example.
So all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds - at least for the
next week or so. But one corner of the issues market is still lagging behind
this brave new world: investment trusts.
Consider Abtrust Latin American Investment Trust, which has just raised
Pounds 20m through a placing with institutional investors. Abtrust was
delighted with the response. Which seems fair enough - until you check out
the names of some of the key shareholders. Top of the list is Abtrust
itself. Then come Murray Johnstone, Jupiter Tyndall, Fleming. Those four
account for nearly half the shares placed. And curiously enough the other
three all run several overseas trusts themselves.
Nice to know that competition is so civilised in the fund management
industry. But does not such enthusiasm for taking in each other's washing
look just a teeny weeny bit like backscratching?
A decent ending to a company's stockmarket life is as important as a decent
birth. When the Stock Exchange said recently that it was getting more
trigger happy in suspending company shares, it upset some personal
investors. For suspensions tend to penalise the innocent bystander.
The classic case revolved around Jim Raper at St Piran. The stock exchange
kept shares in all Raper's companies suspended for over two years in a vain
attempt to force Raper to play by the rules.
Such efforts to protect the public interest all too often end up by
penalising those members of the public actually involved in the test case.
But how much better is it if the exchange turns a blind eye to
irregularities and attempts to persuade a company to mend its ways? A rather
sad little bulletin this week announced the impending retirement of one of
the exchange's oldest quoted companies, Van Diemen's Land. First granted its
Royal charter in 1825, the company, which owns a large chunk of Tasmania,
has applied to have its London Stock Exchange listing cancelled with effect
from November 14.
The background to this statement is an ongoing tussle between the company
and the stock exchange over the fact that only 12 1/2 per cent of the shares
are in public hands - half the proportion stipulated in the rulebook.
So far, so dry. The background to the background is a touch more colourful.
During the past six years a controlling shareholding in Van Diemen's has
been handed round a chain of ageing whizz-kids: David and Richard Thompson
(Hillsdown), David Kirch (property), Graham Ferguson Lacey (ubiquitous
entrepreneur and evangelist). A year ago the stake ended up with a New
Zealand company called Tasman Agriculture, a company in which Sir Ron
Brierley's Brierley Investments is believed to have a large interest.
Tasman has already spent a lot of money turning part of Van Diemen's
territory into a Brobdingnagian dairy farm. Later this year it will propose
both a rights issue and a cash offer to minority shareholders. But the
listing will have gone before details of either offer are known.
This is not how minority shareholders in a company with a London Stock
Exchange listing expect to be treated. Van Diemen's shares, which touched
600p in the mid-1970s were quoted at around 85p-95p yesterday, but have been
rising sharply since early 1993 - presumably in the hope that Tasman will
think it worth paying over the odds to mop up the minority.
Van Diemen's is a rather grubby little tale with an obscure ending. Once
again the Stock Exchange has proved incapable of providing any positive help
to small shareholders. But at least they have always had the chance to cut
and run.
The Personal Investment Authority this week suspended a financial adviser
for the first time. What happens to the firm's existing clients? The PIA is
unlikely to have taken such a step frivolously. So they may be cooling their
heels for quite some time. In the interim period, the adviser is not allowed
to give them any fresh advice, but he can legitimately report on the
progress of their existing investments.
The real question for clients is whether to wait around to find out the end
of the story. There are three possible outcomes to a suspension. If the
adviser appeals, the case is heard either by the chief executive as a matter
of urgency or by the disciplinary committee in due course. The bureaucrats
can apply to have the adviser's membership terminated. Or they can ask the
firm to remedy specific defects and then lift the suspension.
Not much fun for the clients. But at least the door is always open.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Increased dividend flow - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water company shares were marked up this week after Thames Water announced a
higher than expected interim dividend, up 11 per cent to 8.2p. The market
had expected an 8 per cent increase.
Thames was the first of the privatised water companies to bring out interim
results, and its increased payout made analysts optimistic about the
prospects for the rest of the sector.
However, Thames chairman Sir Robert Clarke, warned investors not to expect
such a generous dividend under the new pricing regime. 'Life is going to be
tougher,' he said.

<TEXT>
House prices were unchanged in October, the Halifax Building Society price
index shows. After a rise of just 0.1 per cent in September, the figures
confirm that the underlying trend in prices remains broadly flat.
Halifax said that it expected this trend to continue until consumer
confidence improved. Prices paid by first time buyers fell by 0.8 per cent
in October, and are now 1.2 per cent lower than October last year. The price
of new houses rose by 1.2 per cent last month after a fall of 4.6 per cent
in September.
Conversely, the Nationwide building society's index rose of 0.7 per cent in
October, after a fall of 3 per cent in September.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: All work and no plays for the brokers - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Americans are working more than has been the case for years - and they
are working much harder. But they are not getting paid a lot more, and they
certainly seem nervous about spending what extra they have. With interest
rates likely to be cranked up again later in November, is this any
background against which to buy shares?
More jobs should be good for business. They put money into consumers'
pockets. According to the latest monthly employment figures released
yesterday, the rate of unemployment in the US slipped to 5.8 per cent in
October, from 5.9 per cent the month before and 7.7 per cent in mid-1992.
Manufacturing has led the way. Who would have thought just two years ago
that Michigan - home of the US car industry - would see its unemployment
rate tumble well below the national average, to 5.1 per cent?
At the same time, overtime hours have been rising rapidly, with the average
workweek now longer than at any time since February 1987. Yet pay is not
rising much: in the year to September, the total compensation package for
the average worker went up only 3.2 per cent, one of the lowest increases on
record. That is in part because of an overall shift in employment towards
lower-paid service jobs, in part because of moderate pay agreements in the
manufacturing sector.
For retailers and the companies whose products they sell, this creates an
uncertain background. Christmas began officially on Tuesday as seasonal
goods started to flood into shops - yet October store sales figures,
released Thursday, showed a mixed picture at best, and retailers are already
talking about holding down their prices to last year's levels, if not lower.
For US car makers, too - and the steel, glass and tyre companies whose
products they buy - the outlook is not as rosy as it seemed only a matter of
weeks ago.
General Motors' stumble during the third quarter revealed that the country's
biggest manufacturing company continues to struggle, even in the best
economic conditions for some time. While car sales in October were up
strongly on a year before, it is noteable that Japanese car makers managed
to increase their combined market share by more than one percentage point,
to 13.3 per cent - even though the yen hit a new high against the dollar
last week.
While shares in Ford and Chrysler remain firm, General Motors has slipped 15
per cent in the past three weeks, to just under Dollars 40 yesterday
morning.
If the Federal Reserve increases interest rates at its next policy-making
meeting the week after next weaker consumer demand and the higher financing
costs faced by US companies could dampen things even more. That was the
worry that hit share prices for most of last week. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average had lost 94 points by midweek, to 3,837.13, before stabilising on
Thursday and Friday.
The word from the takeover market, meanwhile, has not been encouraging for
US share prices either. Throughout much of this year, frothy takeover bids
(and even frothier rumours) have buoyed stock prices in a range of
industries.
Two announcements last Wednesday suggest that expectations have got ahead of
themselves. First came news that soft drink maker Snapple had agreed to be
bought by Quaker Oats for Dollars 1.7bn. No fancy premiums here: the shares,
which had traded as high as Dollars 32 1/4 in February, had slumped to
Dollars 14 1/4 . As if to rub it in, Quaker Oats offered even less - Dollars
14 a share.
Then there is the saga of Kemper, the financial services company that agreed
to a Dollars 2.7bn bid from insurance group Conseco. In part because higher
interest rates have hit the outlook for financial service companies,
Conseco's bid has been looking increasingly fragile in recent weeks. Last
week the company said it wanted to cut its original offer.
If that was not enough, there have been signs that the anti-trust
authorities are taking a tougher line. Just over a week ago they announced
an intention to block a takeover of American Tobacco by Britain's BAT
Industries.
Then, on Thursday, the regulators hammered out a deal with drug maker Eli
Lilly over its proposed Dollars 4bn acquisition of PCS, a big seller of
drugs. Lilly was adamant that its compromise with the regulators did not
undermine the logic of its bid - but it may be no coincidence that on the
same day, Value Health, another healthcare group, said it had abandoned
plans to auction its own drugs sales company. Its shares fell 5 per cent on
the news, to Dollars 37 5/8 .
If the takeover market slows, those companies with big acquisition premiums
built into their share prices could come down with a bump.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The Long View: When deflation rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite diving into crippling deficit only four or five years ago, Britain's
corporate sector is now becoming awash with wealth. In the first six months
of 1994, industrial and commercial companies were running a surplus at the
rate of nearly Pounds 20bn a year. The future course of the economic cycle
will now depend largely on how they decide to spend it.
According to the latest CBI quarterly survey, business optimism is now back
to cyclical peaks last seen during the mid-1980s. National output has at
last moved above the 1990 pre-recession high point and is climbing at nearly
4 per cent year-on-year (including a bonus from higher North Sea oil
output).
The corporate sector has reaped unusually lush rewards for two main reasons:
the 1992 devaluation has boosted export profitability and, in a depressed
labour market, nearly all the rewards of a leap in productivity are accruing
to employers. While personal incomes from employment are edging ahead at
about 3 per cent a year, company trading profits are jumping by 23 per cent.
That is why profits as a share of GDP rose from 12 to 14 per cent in 1993
and may top 15 per cent this year. Because spending on fixed investment and
stocks has, if anything, fallen back, the result has been a rapid surge into
financial surplus.
What happens now? The conventional (and official) wisdom is that the
corporate sector should plough back its wealth into growth by increasing its
investment spending. One of the present economic scares is that the economy
will soon run into the buffers of a capacity constraint, capping growth and
triggering inflation. The scale of any remaining 'output gap' remains vague
but - according to the Bank of England's Inflation Report this week - is
certainly substantially smaller than a couple of years ago. Investment
intentions are now positive, according to the CBI survey, but are not yet
back to late 1980s' levels. Of course, there are big changes going on in the
productivity of invested capital; quality is just as important as quantity.
There are other uses for corporate wealth, however. Dividends have been
unexpectedly strong, rising by 7 per cent over the past 12 months and
heading for perhaps 9 per cent growth next year, according to City
expectations. In some cases, such as where profits are piling up in monopoly
utilities and capacity expansion would be inappropriate, capital is being
returned to shareholders: East Midlands Electricity is giving back Pounds
186m before Christmas. Barclays bank, running short of lending
opportunities, is said to be considering something similar.
For the time being, certainly, the corporate sector surpluses are serving to
reduce borrowings; companies have become debt-averse after the financial
scares of the early 1990s. Now the tables are turned and these are anxious
times for the banks, because companies are continuing to repay borrowings at
roughly last year's Pounds 11bn annual rate.
When British company bosses have money to burn, they resort traditionally to
take-over activity. At the height of the last acquisition boom, in 1989,
British companies spent Pounds 27bn on acquisitions and increased their bank
borrowings by Pounds 34bn to help pay for these and other excesses.
The wave of take-overs at home and abroad produced many disasters; an
interesting research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this
week suggested that foreign companies (Britain's prominent among them) spent
Dollars 316bn on US acquisitions in the past decade but are, in aggregate,
running them at a loss. At home, the battle for control of VSEL suggests
that the bad old habits of buying second-hand capacity rather than building
new factories are still evident. But spending on acquisitions was only
Pounds 7bn last year and has not accelerated greatly in 1994.
There is one other way in which companies could spend their new-found
riches. They could cut prices - some call it an investment in market share.
True, it is not a British attitude; but when Rupert Murdoch found that his
television businesses had turned round into surplus last year, his response
was to recycle the money into newspaper price reductions.
The British approach, judging by the ambitions of those replying to the CBI
survey, is to exploit an unnecessary shortage of supply by being slow to
increase capacity and then raising prices (as a balance of 20 per cent are
hoping to do in the next four months). This is the attitude that led to such
a rise in import penetration in the past. It became ingrained when British
companies regularly faced spiralling labour costs and an over-valued
currency.
Surely, though, companies should be more aggressive when labour costs are
quiescent and profitability is high. The outcome might vary from sector to
sector and plainly will be different in retailing or food manufacturing,
where capacity will remain excessive, than in capital goods, where it might
soon become short.
Meanwhile, of course, a revenue-hungry chancellor could have his own designs
on the corporate sector's riches. The Treasury has changed the details of
dividend taxes already: it did that 18 months ago, and the full impact is
now coming through. It would be surprising if companies escaped unscathed in
this month's Budget.
From the investor's point of view, the challenge is to judge the durability
of the profits boom. Has there been a permanent structural shift towards
capital? Or will a cyclical rise in costs push the profit share back down
towards its historical norm? Relative strength in sterling, certainly
against the dollar, might prove to be an important factor here.
The unusual feature of the 1990s is that it could be the deflationary forces
acting on prices that take the icing off the cake, rather than the more
familiar upwards pressure on costs.

of the former East Germany adjusting to unification? Judy Dempsey asks them
and finds them unsettled by change and lacking in self-confidence

It was the longing for the tide.
'I wanted to see the ebb and the flow,' said Hannelore Bohm. 'We could never
see it at the Ostsee (Baltic Sea) in east Germany. It has no tide.'
Bohm was born in 1929 in Gorlitz, a beautiful nineteenth century town tucked
deep in the south-eastern corner of Germany. Unscathed by bombing during the
second world war, Gorlitz had been divided between East Germany and Poland
after 1945. Territory east of the river Neisse had been ceded to Warsaw.
'This part of the country never had access to West German television during
the DDR days. We could never travel to the west. We could never see the
tide,' said Bohm.
The chance to travel came soon after the Berlin Wall fell on November 9
1989.
'It was May 1990. We went to visit a cousin in Ravensburg. We were very
excited. But then he told us that the time spent under the DDR were 40
wasted years for which we had nothing to show. The arrogance, the ignorance
was awful.'
Under the Communists, Bohm also never had the chance to study medicine, a
profession practised by her father and grandfather. 'After the war, I
applied for a university place. But it was forbidden. I was from a bourgeois
family. They said it was now the chance of the workers. What could I do? I
started a family. It was only in the late 1950s that my brother was allowed
to study medicine. I later trained as a teacher. Until 1989 I was deputy
head of the school here in Gorlitz. I never joined the Communist party.'
'With hindsight, I realised how much we lived in a cosy world.'
Jens Reich, professor of molecular biology at the Max Delbruck Centre for
Molecular Medicine in Buch, east Berlin, was sitting in his office. From his
window, a spectacular array of red and rust autumnal leaves was falling.
Reich, a long serving member of the East German opposition, had been one of
the founding members of Neues Forum, the independent civil movement set up
in east Berlin during September 1989, the month thousands of East Germans
were trying to escape to the west via the West German embassy in Hungary.
Earlier this year, he ran for federal president. He is now waiting to to be
reconfirmed as professor.
'Before unification, I was stressed at work. But everything was clear. The
politics was clear. The resistance of the people was defined. We knew where
we stood with the economy. Everybody knew what to do. You did not have to
worry about your future. We lived on a modest level. But we were living like
children. Now now we are adults'.
Are the east Germans finding it difficult to cope with adulthood which has
been so quickly thrust upon them?
'I can't explain it very well. But adulthood means taking responsibility
which means mastering the strength to make decisions. A lot of people lack
the strength to have inner responsibility. We are now responsible for many
more things, things that we had earlier only dreamed about. Then, we were
like birds in a cage.'
He gazed out the window. 'I never want those days back again. It is
sufficient for me to read my old diaries to recall the Mauerkrankheit - Wall
sickness - and the melancholy we had.'
What is it about unification that is so unsettling for the east Germans?
'It's partly a kind of resentment. People have lost their equilibrium. Their
self-confidence. Maybe that is why many voted in the last federal election
for the PDS (the successor to East Germany's former Communist party). Deep
down, it is a sort of inferiority complex. Injecting money is no substitute
for overcoming the psychological problems.'
What sort of psychological problems?
'Everything was got rid of so quickly. There was no transition period. The
whole establishment of the society had been changed, and to a much greater
degree than in West Germany after 1945.'
Was it the speed with which the West German system was imposed on east
Germany which has contributed to this disequilibrium?
'Here in east Germany, everything had to be refurbished in order to conform
to the bureaucratic prescription of the west. I think part of this process
represented the inferiority of the west Germans. The first thing they did
was to implant western conditions here. You felt they were uneasy if things
did not look like what they were accustomed to. The furniture. The towels.
Everything western had to be transplanted on the east. It was like a Gummi
tree being transplanted in a botanical garden.'
Jens Reich sat very still. 'It is our fault. You defend your culture or you
simply imitate.' He looked at his desk, packed high with papers, documents,
books and forms.
What do you feel personally about unification?
'Believe me. I do not want the old system back. I am a winner. My wife is a
winner. My children are winners. I feel free now. But that is not the
panacea for happiness. I am free in my work. To decide the budget. How I
will allocate it. To pursue particular lines of research. I have to be
responsible for my life and the future.'
How has this sense of responsibility changed you?
'In some ways I often deplore the loss of Knappheit (scarcity, or
shortages). I now have a lot of books. But I don't have the time to read.
Ten years ago a western magazine kept us happy and busy for a whole weekend.
I remember what a gift it was when someone came with a new edition of some
philosopher. What a feast]' Reich added that the book would be shared with
friends and would be discussed for days.
'In those days, there was a scarcity of intellectual supply. With hindsight,
that is something which I now value. It made me hungry. It made me read with
wide open eyes. Of course the shortages were terrible. But now I read
without an appetite. My appointments diary is full. I have an impulse to
throw it away and hide myself and not answer any more calls. Simply to
re-establish some equilibrium. Do you know what I mean?'
He stared out of the window. 'There is so much to be done besides ending
this dis-unification. We must oppose the tendency towards resignation.'
Is Chancellor Kohl prepared to address these issues of the disunited
Germany?
'Look at the recent election campaign. Not a word was said about the future.
It was kept out of the campaign. The decisions that have to be made were
quite happily forgotten. They were pushed aside. These were the first signs
of a reunited Germany: not to take up the burden of responsibility; not to
ask about our national interests as a united Germany and our place in the
world; not to address the huge potential for instability in the east, our
neighbours.'
Reich looked at the time. 'I have to go to another meeting,' he said. He put
on his dark grey woollen jacket. It seemed to add to his burden of
responsibility.
'We had the chance to build socialism. But we gambled it away.'
Egon Krenz, East Germany's last ruling Communist party leader was sitting on
his terrace in Pankow, east Berlin, once home to East Germany's Communist
elite. The terrace faced out on to a large, lush, green garden.
Now aged 57, Krenz had spent all his life in the Communist party. For years
he had been groomed for the top party post by the late Erich Honecker. His
chance came on October 18 1989, two days after 100,000 people demonstrated
in Leipzig to demand reforms and a free East Germany. But the immense
pressure from the East German people proved too much for Krenz and the
Communists. He resigned just seven weeks later on December 3, joined by the
entire politburo and central committee.
'We had a dream. To build something different from capitalism.'
Do you have regrets about how you treated people?
'Look what unification has done. The settling of accounts of East Germany's
past has been so total. The East German intellectuals have been totally
decapitated. East Germany was a country. It was our fatherland.'
Do you not have any responsibility or guilt for the way in which the
Communists ran the country?
'Of course we made mistakes. But that's not the point. I believed in the
idealism. Look, I am not nostalgic for the past.'
Krenz took out his old identity card of the former German Democratic
Republic. On one of the worn pages was an instruction stating that he was
entitled to access to a special party hospital in case of illness. 'This ID
card is only valid until the end of the year. I still have my DDR driving
licence. Look, I know German unification is a reality. I am not a man that
struggles with a windmill.' He paused to allow the noise of a low-flying
aircraft pass over.
'About this belief that I held. I thank the Russians for my life. I was
seven years old when the Russians came to Germany. I had typhus. My mother
was alone. She could not work. She was sick as well. We had to flee to
Kolberg, near the Ostsee, which is now in Poland. The Russians saved us. I
make no excuses for what I did for my homeland'.
What do you do now?
'I ended my political life in the beginning of December 1989. Since then I
have been forbidden from working in the public sector. I cannot teach. I am
under pressure. The federal property office wants to take away my house
which I legally bought in 1989. I travel a bit. I am now a private person.
In early 1990, I worked for an estate agency, then in a finance office. But
not for long. I have found some work in a special commission looking at east
German history. I rely on my friends for support'. It had started to rain.
He put his DDR papers back into his short, brown leather jacket.
The waiting room was full of people. But they were all silent. An assistant
came in from time to time to summon a client. It was like waiting to visit
the dentist.
Lothar de Maiziere's office was large and comfortable. Situated in east
Berlin, a short walk from the bustle of the big train station on
Friedrichstrasse, de Maiziere had started up his private law practice soon
after he was forced to resign as East Germany's last prime minister when it
was discovered he had informed for the Stasi, the east German secret police.
He had become the first non-communist prime minister of East Germany after
the first free elections in April 1990.
'I had one hope during those days,' he said, speaking softly. 'I hoped that
we would have a united German team participating in the Barcelona Olympics
in 1992.'
His hopes, however, have since faded into disappointment, and some confusion
about the pace and methods of unification.
'Please don't misunderstand me. Our economy under the Communist system was
so unproductive, the materials so awful. I knew what a catastrophic
situation we were in by the end of the 1980s. But despite unification, there
are enormous differences still existing between east and west Germany.'
What sort of differences?
He started to smoke.
'Over the past 40 years, two different cultures evolved in East and West
Germany. Take language. We speak German differently. The west Germans have
practically forgotten their grammar. They hardly use the genitive case, or
the adverb any more.'
He paused to light another cigarette.
'But it's more than that. The eastern and western parts of Germany were
always different. The west was catholic, and more open-minded to the
Romantic tradition. The east was Protestant and sober. Look at the red brick
Gothic architecture which you find in the east but not in the west.'
How has the past 40 years accentuated those differences?
'During those years, we experienced, heard, and read different things. The
easterners were exposed to art which was concrete and realistic and Slav
influenced. We read Solzhenitsyn and Akmatova (the Russian writers) and
listened to Shostakovich and Penderecki. The West Germans looked westwards,
hugely influenced by the US. There is such a large gap in our cultural
experiences. The west opposed communism and the east opposed capitalism. And
now we are trying to get together again.'
And are the two Germanys coming together?
'Inner unity does not exist. It's the way they (the west Germans) talk to
us. The way they treat our past. My God] You would think we never ate with a
knife and fork before the Wende ('change', the name given to the collapse of
the Berlin Wall). The big mistake was that the Wessis (westerners) did not
have to make any psychological compromises after unification. The
establishment made no effort to integrate the intellectuals and old
functionaries. One of the other negative things about unification is the
bureaucracy. It's worse than the times under the Communists. But the west
Germans told us: 'Do things like us and everything will be fine.'
What about you, personally? They found out about your Stasi past. What had
you done?
'I was a defence lawyer in the DDR. I was involved in many political cases.
We had to speak to the authorities. I did not know that everything would be
recorded. In 1991, the Bundestag (Germany's lower house) passed a law in
which every (east German) lawyer had to be vetted. They spent a year vetting
me.'
What did you feel when they found out about your past?
'I was helpless.'
An assistant came in. She said there was a client waiting.
'I had been a member of the Liberal Democratic Party Germany,' said
Hans-Werner Bohm, Hannelore's husband. The LDPG was a 'block party'
sanctioned by the ruling Communist party.
'After fighting on the front during the war I finally returned from Russia
in 1949 to Gorlitz. I was 25 years old at the time. I trained as an engineer
and worked in a private Handwerk, a small workshop belonging to my uncle.
But in 1972, the Communists banned the remainder of the private sector.'
After German unification, the Free Democrats, the junior partner in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, took over the LDPG.
'I remember it well,' said Bohm. 'I got this letter from Otto Graf
Lambsdorff (a senior member of the FDP), welcoming me into the party even
though I had never been asked if I wanted to join. And then he said I should
pay DM15. They just assumed I would join. I refused. It was their attitude.
The arrogance. The way they took us easterners for granted.'
During last October's federal elections, the Bohms both voted for the PDS.
'The PDS speaks out for us. They represent our voice. They do not say the
past 40 years have been wasted or worthless. But don't misunderstand us. We
are both retired. We are well-off. We do not want the old days back. There
are many good things about unification,' said Bohm.
'And the tide. We eventually saw the ebb and flow,' said Hannelore Bohm. It
was in July 1992. At Amrum, an island in the North Sea. The weather was very
hot. It was the speed at which the tide turned which was so surprising. It
was really beautiful to see.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Private buyers shun UK new car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK new car registrations fell last month by 3 per cent year-on-year as the
market weakened under pressure from declining sales to private buyers.
Registrations in October slipped to 122,526 from 126,305 in the same month a
year ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
The rate of growth in UK new car sales has fallen sharply since the summer.
In the first half of this year, registrations rose 14 per cent, but from
July to October sales have risen only 2.2 per cent year-on-year.
The decline in new car sales in October is the second monthly year-on-year
fall this year and follows a drop of 2.5 per cent in July, the smallest
sales month. In the first 10 months, new car sales have risen 8.5 per cent
to 1,710,842.
In contrast to the new car market, registrations of new commercial vehicles
rose 15.1 per cent in October and have risen 15.4 per cent in the first 10
months, reflecting stronger business confidence.
The main factor behind the decline in new car sales in October was the 11.5
per cent drop in sales to private buyers. 'This is a worrying trend,' said
Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive.
Mr Neil Marshall, director of public policy at the Retail Motor Industry
Federation, said sales to private buyers had fallen significantly for four
months.
'There is a growing nervousness in the marketplace over the potential impact
of the forthcoming Budget, and consumer confidence is already fragile
following recent talk over interest rate rises,' he said.
The share of new car sales to private buyers in the UK has declined to 50.1
per cent in the first 10 months from 53.2 per cent a year ago. The share
fell as low as 46.2 per cent in October.
Until now, the new car market has been sustained by rising demand from the
large fleet and small business sectors. The rate of growth slowed in those
segments too in October, however, with an increase year-on-year of 5.7 per
cent.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Brittany Ferries joins ban on exports of livestock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brittany Ferries dealt a blow to Britain's Pounds 200m live animal trade
yesterday when it banned virtually all shipments from midnight tonight. That
cut off the last regular export outlet.
The company joined other ferry operators in halting live exports after
uncovering 'flagrant breaches' by livestock hauliers of its code of conduct.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will meet Mr
William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, early next week to press for new
laws to crack down on cowboy operators, which he claims are ruining the
business for other farmers.
Brittany Ferries stopped carrying animals destined for immediate slaughter
in August after public outcry over the way animals are treated in transit,
but it continued to carry livestock for further fattening before slaughter
on the Continent.
The company required operators to confine deliveries to Brittany, Normandy
and the Loire Valley to minimise discomfort to the animals. It said spot
checks showed the code had been 'cynically disregarded', with some animals
transported as far as Spain.
Mr Ian Carruthers, Brittany Ferries' managing director, said: 'I am both
saddened and shocked by the total disregard the majority of livestock
exporters have shown for the code. Basically they have misled us about the
end destination of the animals in their care.'
The ferry company's decision to ban all live shipments - except of breeding
stock and competition horses - cuts off another route to the lucrative live
export trade.
A chartered ship carried 3,000 live lambs from Grimsby to Calais this week
and several planeloads of calves have been flown out. But farmers' leaders
say that is tiny for a business that exported 2m lambs and 500,000 calves
last year - 20 per cent of British meat exports.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Animals welcomed the ban and said it
would be writing to Mr Waldegrave to urge him to toughen British welfare
standards and impose an eight-hour maximum journey time. European Union
agriculture ministers last week failed to agree on a journey limit of 15
hours.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Fall in US jobless fuels expectations of rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 per cent in October, a four-year
low, raising expectations in financial markets that the US Federal Reserve
will push up short-term interest rates later this month.
Although the monthly increase in jobs was below market expectations,
indications of mounting wage pressures prompted a sell-off in US bonds. The
30-year benchmark bond fell by half a point, yielding 8.16 per cent at one
stage, its highest level since August 1991.
Stocks fell sharply in tandem, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing
down 38.36 at 3,807.52. The dollar was steady, closing in New York at
DM1.514 and at Y97.45.
The debate over interest rates appears no longer to be about whether the Fed
will move. Currency market analysts said it was a question of when rates
would be raised, with most expecting an increase to be announced after the
Federal open market committee meeting on November 15.
The jobs report gave President Bill Clinton an opportunity to highlight the
expanding economy as he campaigns ahead of mid-term elections next week. Mr
Clinton claimed that more jobs have been created this year than in the
previous five.
He said the improvement was due to increased productivity, and to the
partnership between his administration and business to boost exports. While
non-farm job growth in October, as measured by a survey of employers, was
194,000 - less than expected - factory jobs soared by 40,000.
The reasons for the continuing discontent among US voters were also
reflected in the jobs report. Americans are working longer hours - the
factory workweek is averaging 42.1 hours, a level not seen since the end of
the second world war. About 7.6m people - 6.1 per cent of the labour force -
are working more than one job. However, average hourly earnings soared 0.7
per cent to Dollars 11.24 an hour, twice the increase generally expected.
Ms Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labour statistics, said
the growth in manufacturing jobs - 200,000 in the past 13 months - reflected
'moderation in job declines' in defence-related industries.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's call from Japan's banks for a further dose of deregulation does
not indicate mass conversion to free-market economics. But it does say a
fair amount about the tight conditions in which the banks find themselves.
Ironically, one of the problems is the liberalisation last month of deposit
rates. Banks are now free to compete for deposits, with the result that
funding costs are set to increase sharply. On top of this comes the effect
of rising interest rates: traditionally, Japanese banks find they have to
raise savings rates faster than they are able to put up lending rates.
Moreover, with most corporations still busy paying off debt, banks have
little hope of expanding their loan books.
The banks' reaction has been to urge the ministry of finance to enact 80
separate deregulatory measures. Some, such as the extension of the maximum
period for certificates of deposit, are designed to give them greater
freedom in how they raise funds. Others would allow them to move into higher
margin businesses such as selling insurance and investment trusts.
The cautious ministry may well be tempted to respond to the banks' pleas
with half-measures. But half-measures could merely store up trouble, as the
ministry's deregulation of deposits shows. Some group or other will feel
disadvantaged and press for more liberalisation to compensate. Whether it
likes it or not, the ministry may eventually find itself driven to accept
full-blooded deregulation.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smaller companies underperformed large capitalisation stocks sharply in the
third quarter: while the FT-SE 100 index delivered total returns of 1.6 per
cent, the FT-SE SmallCap yielded a 2 per cent negative return. This comes
after a long period of outperformance and looks odd given the robust outlook
for smaller companies' earnings.
Part of the reason for the decline is the market's general listlessness,
which has resulted in the limited trading volume being concentrated in
large, liquid stocks. Another explanation is that small companies are
strongly weighted towards general manufacturing, a sector which has fallen
out of favour. Either way, the fall in share prices has served to accentuate
small companies' relative attractions at this point in the economic cycle.
Profits are set to grow more rapidly than at big companies during 1994 and
1995, yet valuations have become less demanding: the traditional premium
over the market as a whole has shrunk.
Of course, the outlook for small companies depends critically on prospects
for equities as a whole. For those who are sanguine about the general
outlook, now is a good moment to seek bargains. The limited marketability of
these companies' shares will deter the faint-hearted. But buying amid a
general rally in the market at a later date is likely to prove difficult:
lack of liquidity would then act as a catalyst to further outperformance.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fund-raising for Forte's acquisition of Meridien hotels has been
well-handled. The hotel group's share price has remained strong while the
new equity was raised at only a small discount. Forte had been at pains to
point out that it could cover the costs with extra borrowing and played down
the idea of a rights issue which would have depressed the price. Yet some
form of equity issue always seemed the most likely route. Forte's gearing is
already set to rise to over 60 per cent at the year-end due to a change in
the balance sheet treatment of sale and leaseback arrangements in line with
new accounting conventions.
Although this is mostly a matter of presentation, raising new equity does
give Forte more flexibility. In particular, it will not be under any time
pressure over the sale of its stakes in Alpha Airports and Gardner Merchant.
If it had been seen as a forced seller, it would have been unlikely to get
the best prices.
The fact that Forte has opted for a fairly modest placing rather than a full
rights issue may reflect its reluctance to issue shares, or merely to do so
at a big discount. Theoretically, the bulk of the new shares were placed on
behalf of Meridien's vendors; so institutional investors' pre-emption rules,
which limit placings for cash to 7.5 per cent of capital in any three-year
period, did not apply. As a result, the shares could be placed with old and
new investors at a 4 per cent discount rather than offered to existing
shareholders for considerably less. This significant difference rests on an
illogical distinction in the pre-emption rules and it is high time they were
changed.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Inflation aggravation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US jobs data will keep the pressure on the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates. True, October's rise in non-farm employment was lower
than expected. But hourly earnings increased sharply and there was a jump in
the length of the working week. The message is that strong economic growth
is finally showing up in wage inflation. Currency and bond markets will be
sorely disappointed if the Fed does not take action to counter inflation at
its meeting on November 15. A half-point rise is already widely discounted;
only a full point will convince the markets that the Fed is in control.
This week's intervention in currency markets by the US authorities has
bought a breathing space for the dollar. Traders were caught with short
dollar positions and scrambled to cover themselves. But sentiment could
easily be knocked again. One trigger would be a particularly strong
performance by the Republicans in Tuesday's mid-term elections: the party
has campaigned on a tax-cutting agenda and markets will worry if budgetary
discussions look like becoming even more deadlocked than usual. Another
trigger would be lack of enthusiasm in next week's Dollars 29bn refunding
exercise by the Treasury.
Meanwhile, European bond markets are finally showing signs of thinking for
themselves. Since mid-September most have outperformed Treasuries, with
gilts doing especially well. Yesterday was another good day for European
bonds. A complete decoupling from the US - with European bonds rising while
Treasuries collapsed - is unlikely. But further outperformance would be
justified.

FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US jobs data fail to motivate
Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
After holding their own for most of the day in the wake of a broadly
encouraging October employment report, US share prices dropped sharply in
late trading as bond yields climbed to their highest levels in more than
three years, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 38.36 at 3,807.52.
The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 5.63 at 462.28,
while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 1.66 lower at 452.91
and the Nasdaq composite down 6.02 at 766.08. Trading volume on the NYSE was
283m shares.
The market opened in an uncertain mood after the eagerly-awaited October
jobs figures proved a mixed bag for equity investors. The good news was that
the labour market continued to grow last month, but not so strongly as to
raise fears of resurgent inflation. The Labor department reported that
non-farm payrolls increased by 194,000 in October, well below most Wall
Street forecasts. The national unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell
unexpectedly from 5.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent.
Overall, the report was encouraging for stocks. Share prices, however, were
unable to capitalise on the figures because bond prices fell for the fifth
consecutive day. The bond market was upset by particular details within the
jobs report, namely stronger than expected manufacturing employment and wage
levels. As bonds dropped further in the afternoon, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government issue to a new three year high of 8.16 per
cent, stocks moved lower in tandem and the market closed at its lowest point
of the day after a wave of late program selling.
Among individual stocks, several prominent Dow issues took a beating in late
trading. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 7 5/8 , International Paper lost
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 71 5/8 , and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing
slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 53. Eli Lilly fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 62
1/2 after the drugs group announced a deal with the Federal Trade Commission
that will allow Eli Lilly to purchase the drugs distributor PCS. The
company's share price had risen earlier in the week in anticipation of the
agreement. Oil stocks, which were higher earlier this week, ran into
selling, with Exxon falling Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 , Philips
Petroleum Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 7/8 and Royal Dutch Petroleum Dollars
1 3/4 to Dollars 111 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Biogen dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 38 in volume
of 3.2m shares as investors reacted to the news that the company had been
served with several class-action lawsuits alleging federal securities law
violations in connection with Biogen's plans to shut down activities related
to its Hirulog product.
Canada
Toronto stocks posted solid losses with continued weakness in bonds and the
US dollar. The TSE 300 index dropped 28.19 to 4,198.63 in volume of 52.7m
shares. Thirteen of the 14 sub-indexes were down, led by transportation,
metals, conglomerates and industrial products. Only paper and forest stocks
posted gains, up 0.35 per cent on the day. Venezuela
Caracas dipped another 2 per cent, this time as fund managers studied the
government's new resolution on repatriation of profits, announced five weeks
ago in an attempt to bring foreign investors back into the market, but only
published this week. The fund managers thought that there would be big
problems in implementing the resolution, and the Merinvest composite index
fell 2.84 to 138.84.

FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Belgian recovery offset by dollar and
rate rises - Emma Tucker views opposing forces in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news for investors in Belgian equities is that recovery of the
country's compact but heavily industrialised economy has outstripped
virtually all expectations.
At the beginning of the year, growth of 1 per cent was the most that many
analysts hoped for. Eleven months on, new forecasts are hovering between 1.5
and 2 per cent for 1994.
The economy's strength has buoyed the so-called cyclical components of the
Belgian stock market, measured by the Bel-20 index of leading shares. These
well established Belgian blue-chips - Solvay, Petrofina and UCB, for example
 -have had, as one analyst described it, a 'spectacular' recovery in
earnings.
But two opposing forces have all but neutralised these positive steps: a
sustained rise in long-term interest rates since the beginning of the year;
and the weak US dollar.
'The big cyclical companies were supposed to be helped by the recovery, but
instead they have come down thanks to the dollar and interest rates,' says
Mr Pierre Stiennon, Belgian equities analyst at Goldman Sachs in London.
As long-term interest rates in Germany have moved upwards, so Belgium's have
followed suit, to settle roughly at 8.5 per cent. There are still question
marks over the government's ability to reduce the size of the budget
deficit; with the market still demanding a risk premium for investing in
Belgium, the long-term rate is about 90 basis points higher than in Germany.
Short-term rates are also more likely to rise than fall. 'Even if the next
step by the Bundesbank is down, I think that by this time next year,
short-term rates will be higher,' says Mr Guy Lerminiaux, an analyst at
Petercam in Brussels. 'Inflation pressures may not be particularly visible,
but they are certainly around.'
The weakness of the dollar has affected the competitiveness of companies not
just in Belgium but across all of Europe. Furthermore, many of Belgium's
biggest companies are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar, with
interests in the US and denominating much of their business in the currency.
A good example is Union Miniere, the Brussels-based mining and minerals
company. It sells a large part of its products to the European car industry
but, as a largely dollar denominated company, has suffered from the US
currency's decline.
The result is that compared with a year ago, the bourse has remained
virtually flat, the Bel-20 hovering at around 1,350 points, down just 1.5
per cent. Since the beginning of the year, when optimism about the recovery
pushed prices higher, it has sunk by about 10 per cent. It is thus roughly
in line with other European bourses.
Domestically, economic conditions are stable. In October, inflation dropped
to 2.12 per cent on an annualised basis and, as the Belgian daily newspaper
Liberacion optimistically described the situation: 'Even if a small lift is
expected before the end of the year, the inflationary menace is not
particularly present.' Meanwhile, the Belgian savings ratio remains high, at
over 20 per cent, with consumers displaying characteristic caution and
preferring to wait before parting with savings.
This is bad news for the distribution companies, such as Delhaize le Lion,
the supermarket group, which have as yet shown few signs of recovery. A more
buoyant domestic scene would also help the banks which continue to make most
of their profits in Belgium.
How, then, are analysts who track Belgian stocks weighing up the future?
'I think the interest rate outlook is more or less neutral,' says Mr
Stiennon of Goldman Sachs. 'We believe that long-term interest rates will
stay roughly where they are.'
A boost may be on hand, however, from the dollar. 'We believe that the
dollar has hit bottom,' adds Mr Stennion. 'From now on, the dollar should be
helpful for cyclical stocks.'
He may be a little optimistic. Although he is not alone, some other analysts
believe the US currency still has lower to go. From roughly Y97.30 and
DM1.51 this week, pessimists believe the dollar could drop to Y90-Y95 and
DM1.45 before beginning its ascent.
Mr Lerminiaux believes that the next move for the stock market will be a
hesitant step up. 'But I am not sure whether it will be the cyclicals, the
interest rate sensitive companies, or the distribution sector. I take the
slightly contrary view that some of the banks and retailers will do well,'
he says.
One positive piece of news is the decision by the authorities, announced
earlier this month, to deregulate fees on bourse orders, a move which is
widely expected to lead to lower fees for large private client orders.
The change was designed to bring the Belgian market into line with other
stock exchanges but would have almost no impact for institutional orders
where the fees are already freely negotiated in many operations.
Banque Bruxelles Lambert was one of the first companies to react. It lowered
its fees on all private client orders of more than BFr7m to 0.3 per cent.
Under the previous system, investors paid fixed commission fees of between
0.8 per cent and 1 per cent for orders of less than BFr5m as well as a fixed
200 francs per transaction.

FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Selected German cyclicals take
heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mixed US jobs data were viewed as a source of confusion in Europe, rather
than any real stimulus to equities, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday's short covering process in the morning and the
Dax index rose 16.08 to 2,067.56 on the session, nearly 10 points carried
over from Thursday afternoon. In the post bourse the Dax closed at 2,069.39,
barely higher on the week.
Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.6bn. In London, James Capel's economist,
Mr Stephen King, said that the German recovery had regained momentum after a
soft performance in recent months and suggested that the overall continental
European recovery was driving German exports.
Selected cyclicals took heart, both during the session and after hours:
Hoechst in chemicals rose DM4 to DM325.50; and Daimler and MAN in
automotives and Deutsche Babcock among engineers each rose by DM7.50, to
DM770, DM409 and DM233.50 respectively.
However, there was more pain in retailing which had seen sell
recommendations this week from various investment banks and a Thursday
report showing retailers' sales down by a real 1 per cent in the first nine
months of 1994. Asko closed the session DM25, or 3.2 per cent lower at
DM790; after hours Karstadt and Kaufhof were down DM9 at DM610, and DM14.90
at DM494.
PARIS saw an improvement after the release of US data following a nervous
morning session. The CAC-40 index added 20.52 or 1 per cent to 1,931.65, for
a rise of 1.4 per cent on a holiday-shortened week.
Turnover was estimated at over FFr4bn. Rhone-Poulenc slipped 70 centimes to
FFr133.20 on profit-taking following Thursday's better than expected
nine-month results.
Goldman Sachs revised upwards its full year eps forecasts for the chemicals
group to FFr6.50 for 1994 from FFr4.40 and to FFr11.80 for 1995 from
FFr9.80.
Peugeot dipped FFr6 to FFr801, partly in reaction to investors switching
into Renault, whose institutional subscription period closed on Thursday and
which was 15.5 times subscribed.
ZURICH finished higher in active trading, lifted by the firmer dollar and
content with the US jobs data. The SMI index picked up 6.2 to 2,541.0, up 2
per cent on the week.
Holderbank rose SFr59 or 6.1 per cent to SFr1,020 after the building
materials group forecast that consolidated net income for 1994 would rise by
37 per cent. The group has seen earnings upgrades from a number of analysts
in recent weeks, but the forecast still proved sharply above even the best
expectations.
Landis &amp; Gyr, recently near its low for the year, picked up SFr70 or 10.5
per cent to SFr735 after Thursday's profits forecast, and a statement which
cleared the air after worries about its pension fund.
Winterthur registered added another SFr10 to SFr651 in further response to
Thursday's interims while Swiss Re gave up SFr7 of recent gains to SFr748 on
further switching into Winterthur.
AMSTERDAM's AEX index added 0.40 to 410.76 to gain 0.5 per cent on the week.
Hoogovens rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 82.00 on rising aluminium demand and its
reiterated forecast that it expected a substantial second half improvement.
Among second line stocks Volmac, the Dutch computer services group in which
Cap Gemini Sogeti of France has a majority stake, rose to a new year's high
of Fl 24.50, up Fl 1.10, on reports of increased order books.
MILAN was still fixated on banks as the Comit index added 5.43 to 629.30 for
a 0.8 per cent rise on the week.
Credito Romagnolo rose L429 to L16,962, investors digesting news that a 2
per cent block of its shares had changed hands at L19,500. Credito Italiano,
pressing ahead with its bid for Romagnolo, fell L13 to L1,571.
Ambroveneto gave up L106 to L5,232 on the view that there was little upside
left after BCI's bid for at least 50 per cent of the stock. BCI lost L37 to
L3,533.
Premafin fell L153 or 9.4 per cent to L1,482 after news that its planned to
raise up to L222bn through the issue of shares with warrants.
Olivetti rose L50 to L1,888 and Cir was L54 or higher at L1,809, although
analysts said there was no news to account for the rises.
COPENHAGEN's the KFX index fell only 0.64 to 93.19. However, serious
problems at the shipper and shipbuilder, B &amp; W, dropped the latter by 54 per
cent and hit its bankers. B &amp; W B fell DKr65 to a new 1994 low of DKr55,
compared with a high of DKr533 in February. Den Danske Bank and Unibank
dropped DKr7 to DKr224, and DKr6 to DKr313 respectively.

FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up despite
currency concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over volatile currency movements prevailed but the Nikkei index
gained on arbitrage buying and index-linked purchases by investment trust
funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 60.91 to 19,811.56 after a high of 19,872.87 and
a low of 19,768.95, barely changed on the week. Most investors remained
absent after the dollar's plunge to a new record low against the yen in New
York on Thursday.
Volume was 204m shares against 251m. The Topix index of first section stocks
gained 1.12 to 1,569.80 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.24 to 287.25. Gains
led losses by 501 to 464 with 214 unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.10 to 1,289.32.
Some traders expected institutional investors to remain inactive until the
yen-dollar exchange rate stabilised. Others saw a halt in the yen's
appreciation and in the implicit rise in the value of Japanese stock
holdings - triggering profit-taking by overseas investors.
Individual investors traded small capital stocks. Nakabayashi, an office
equipment maker, jumped Y65 to Y970 in active trading due to increased
interest in its pachinko, or Japanese pinball, related business.
Some high-technology stocks were higher in spite of the yen's fluctuations.
NEC rose Y10 to Y1,220 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y10 to
Y1,600.
Steel stocks were traded actively: Nippon Steel, the most active issue of
the day, remained unchanged at Y398 and Sumitomo Metal Industries lost Y5 to
Y358.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 14.56 to 21,962.31 in volume of 17.7m shares.
Roundup
HG Asia (Singapore) recommended investors to increase weightings for
Singapore and South Korea, but to trim allocations in Hong Kong and go
underweight in Malaysia, Indonesia, India and the Philippines.
HONG KONG had a switchback ride as early gains, which followed the signing
of the financing agreement for the new airport, were pared before prices
recovered once again. The Hang Seng index finished 38.44 higher at 9,530.40,
for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week.
HG Asia's Hong Kong reservations came in spite of the broker's forecast that
the Hang Seng index will rise to 12,000 by March, fuelled by a surge in
prices in the residential property market.
SEOUL finished at a record high although profit-taking erased most of the
gains made in early trading. The composite index ended 1.79 higher at
1,119.52, 2.0 per cent higher on the week after an intraday high of
1,129.99. Some primary blue chips such as Samsung Electronics and Posco
stayed under pressure, Samsung going limit down Won3,000 to Won132,000 and
Posco losing Won1,700 to Won72,000.
SHANGHAI's A share index ended another volatile week with a 7.3 per cent
fall. Losing 53.95 to 681.63, the index was 2.9 per cent lower on the week
and 60 per cent down since the end of September.
KUALA LUMPUR stayed uncertain, a rebound cut back as investors cut their
losses. The composite index closed up 7.95 at 1,074.41, 4.1 per cent lower
over the week.
TAIPEI saw late buying in electronics and plastics push up the weighted
index up 1 per cent to 6,369.11 for a week's loss of 3.5 per cent. In
electronics, sold recently, Acer rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 90.50.
MANILA was encouraged by a decline in the inflation data for October, which
helped the composite index to a rise of 41.59 to 3,096.583, up 1 per cent on
the week.
SYDNEY squared positions ahead of the weekend. The All Ordinaries index lost
9.3 to 1,999.8 in turnover of ADollars 400m, down 1 per cent this week.

FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho busy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho burst into life with 28m shares - 4 per cent of the company -
changing hands as the stock market got its teeth into the potential
implications of Tiny Rowland's departure. The management move, and the sense
of high drama it created, also generated a huge traded options business.
Amid talk of a wholesale clear-out of non-core operations and a rapid
reduction in debt, the shares jumped 12 to 144 1/2 p in heavy two-way
business, although dealers said no large lines came on offer. Even on a busy
day Lonrho seldom trades more than 3m shares.
The consensus in London was that given a free rein the board will now move
quickly to rationalise Lonrho's group structure, which consists of some 600
companies.
Analysts expect a string of new year disposals with best bets pointing to
the UK motor distributors, Dovercourt and Dutton-Forshaw, and the African
non-mining business. These generate around 30 per cent of group profits.
Media conglomerate Pearson lost some of its recent gains after NatWest
Markets downgraded its recommendation on the stock. The securities house
decided that the valuations for BSkyB, the satellite television group, were
too high. Pearson shares fell 20 to 624p.
Conflicting wire agency stories late in the session unsettled Vickers, which
shed 3 to 180p. Speculation of a link-up with a big German company had
helped lift the shares by almost 10 per cent in the previous four days.
A Daimler-Benz spokesman was quoted by Extel as saying his company had no
plans to take a stake in Vickers' Rolls-Royce motor car subsidiary. In
contrast, Reuters weighed in with industry sources suggesting that Daimler's
chances of linking up with Roll-Royce Motors were far greater than those of
rival German motor group, BMW.
At a City presentation on Thursday, Vickers told analysts it would announce
a partner for Rolls-Royce Motors before the end of the year.
Shrugging off a 3 per cent decline in new car sales for October, motor
distributors stayed a clear feature with Cowie, basking in tentative
takeover talk and adding a further 2 at 239p, and Lex Service, which jumped
13 to 361p.
Cowie has put on almost 12 per cent in four days while Lex has staged an
advance of 27p in three days. Dealers pointed to the low volumes in the
shares - Lex traded just 223,000 - plus recent heavy under-performance.
Cowie has lagged the market by 5 per cent over the past three months while
Lex has underperformed by around 15 per cent.
Sun Alliance was one of the top performers in the insurance sector following
talk of a UBS buy recommendation; the shares rose 4 to 341p after good
turnover of 4.3m.
Royals eased 1 1/2 to 308p but remained 19 higher over the week following a
spate of broker buy recommendations, notably from BZW, and ahead of expected
good third quarter results next Thursday.
Prudential gained 5 at 323p Irish Permanent, floated on the market a week
ago at 180p, added 3 to 220p, still buoyed by news that Abbey National, the
UK building society-turned-bank, had bought a 9.9 per cent stake in the
group as a 'long-term investment'.
In financials, Gerrard &amp; National jumped 18 to 483p following support from
income funds while Cater Allen, due to report interims at the end of the
month, continued to move ahead strongly, closing a further 8 higher at 512p,
up 43 on the week.
Sage Group, the computer services company, gave another exceptional
performance, the shares racing up a further 22 to a record 678p, after the
scintillating figures and the French acquisition announced on Thursday.
Radioactivity healthcare specialist Amersham International eased a penny to
985p as it was announced that SG Warburg had reduced its stake to 13.97 per
cent. However there was some support ahead of interim figures on Wednesday
which are mooted to be around Pounds 19.5m.
Consideration of the decision by discount retailer Kwik Save to buy the
retail supermarket business of Shoprite for Pounds 45.4m saw the latter
tumble 5 to 16. Kwik Save, which had published figures above most analysts'
forecasts, was steady at 550p.
Boots, the high street chemist and retailer, lost 7 to 512p on further
reaction to Thursday's cautious statement on potential trading in the second
half of the year.
Courtaulds Textiles gained 6 to 476p in response to a buy recommendation
from BZW. The investment bank says Courtaulds offers strong cyclical
recovery in depressed but structurally satisfactory businesses.
The house also advised clients to buy Marks and Spencer suppliers Dewhirst
and Claremont and the two stocks held firm at 125p and 316p. M&amp;S fell 5 to
414p.
Pulp and paper supplier Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell 8 1/2 to 267 1/2 p after
announcing that turnover in the third quarter of the current financial year
rose to Pounds 686m making Pounds 2.13bn of sales for the nine months.

FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Line of Forte placed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in hotels and leisure group Forte gave a creditable performance given
that institutional investors had to absorb the placing of 78m new shares at
227p a share to fund the group's purchase of an initial 57 per cent stake in
Meridien Hotels.
Forte has agreed to buy the stake from Air France for Pounds 131m and will
eventually increase the stake to 80 per cent. The placing, which raised
Pounds 175m, was carried out by Forte's broker UBS.
The Forte share price closed 3 down at 233 1/2 p, the lowest of the day
after turnover of 3.1m shares with UBS marketmakers keenly supporting the
stock towards the close.
Forte shares have performed well relative to the market recently, moving up
some 11 per cent since the middle of September compared with a 3 per cent
rise by the FT-SE 100 and a 1.5 per cent rise in the leisure sector. The
shares rose despite widespread fears of a substantial rights issue.
Mr Roy Owens, leisure analyst at Smith New Court, said 'the placing removes
fears of a rights issue and it shows there is a continuing appetite for the
shares'.

FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond strength fails to boost flagging
equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The payroll and unemployment data from the US received a somewhat muffled
response from the UK stock market yesterday. Share prices rallied from
earlier losses but were drifting off again in thin trading at the close of
the session. British government bonds had a firm session, although prices
slipped off the top as US bonds reacted to the employment statistics.
Early trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index extend its gain above the 3,100 mark,
helped by a steadier bond sector. But London was clearly in no mood to move
far ahead of the US employment statistics. Trading volume was poor.
The market dropped sharply in its initial response to the US data and,
despite the later rally, the market view was that the statistics will
maintain pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten policy again, perhaps
after Tuesday's mid-term Congressional elections.
The FT-SE 100 Index fell through 3,100 to touch 3,093.1, the day's low
before rallying to close at 3,097.6, a net fall of 6.8. Traders admitted to
a 'dreary day's business', although the analysts were busier as they
scrutinised interest rate prospects on both sides of the Atlantic. The
general view on near-term prospects for UK shares remained highly cautious.
The more revealing picture of the day came from yet another fall in Seaq
trading volume which, at a mere 509.5m shares, was about one third down on
Tuesday's figure.
Poor volume continues to present problems for the market although individual
deals continue to provide profitability for the big names. A substantial
placing in Forte shares was believed to have taken place outside the market.
A leading US brokerage house told clients just before the London close to
'look for the Fed to raise rates next week by 50 basis points. Beware of
central bank intervention if the dollar begins to weaken'. It expects strong
growth in the US industrial sector which would put further upward pressure
on US capacity utilisation, an area which has badly upset markets over the
past couple of months.
However, there was no sign yesterday of further intervention in the currency
markets by the Federal Reserve.
London securities houses were also cautious on the outlook for domestic
rates, reminding clients that this week's inflation report from the Bank of
England still leaves open the likelihood of a rate rise by, at the latest,
the beginning of next year.
However, on a brighter note, the president of the Bundesbank said in London
that he saw no threat of inflation in Germany, and his comments were
favourably received in the bond markets.
The gilt-edged market was firm from the opening of trading and moved ahead
sharply when the US Federal bond sector took the US employment data calmly.
At best, the long-dated UK government bonds were around 7/8 ahead, although
these gains were trimmed to around  9/16 by the close.
Short dates also firmed as the expected timetable for base rate rises
appeared to move back a shade. The Bank of England announced that it is
issuing a further Pounds 700m in tranches of existing government bonds, to
be available for trading from Monday.
The broader range of the stock market continued to recover. Free from the
influence of the dollar stocks and London's stock index futures markets, the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 3.8 to 3534.6.
Next week is likely to present further problems for global stocks markets in
the form of the US mid-term elections, as well as a heavy list of auctions
of Federal securities. These will lead the markets towards the next meeting
of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee on November 15 on which
interest rate worries are now focused.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets report: Dollar steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded steadily on the markets yesterday, with a climactic week
for the currency ending in a whimper, writes Philip Gawith.
The focus of attention - the October employment report - was softer than
market expectations. This calmed market nerves, and reduced expectations of
the Fed raising interest rates before the November 15 meeting of the Federal
Open Market Committee.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.5235, from DM1.5146 and at Y97.8, from
Y97.605. Earlier in the week, the Fed had intervened repeatedly, spending a
rumoured Dollars 2bn to support the dollar.
In Europe, the French franc weakened slightly after Mr Jacques Chirac
announced his candidacy for the presidency next year. Some analysts fear
that a stand-off between him and the prime minister, Mr Eduard Balladur,
might let in the Socialist candidate, probably Mr Jacques Delors, currently
president of the European commission.
The combination of a firmer dollar, and a stable D-Mark, saw sterling weaken
slightly, with the trade weighted index finishing at 80.6 from 80.9.
Although the headline figure of the employment report was better than
expected, some of the underlying figures testified to latent inflationary
pressures. While bonds were undermined, the dollar did not follow suit.
This breach of the recent pattern was clear testimony to the impact of Fed
intervention on the markets. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase
Manhattan in London, commented: 'What intervention has done is put people
off selling the dollar until it becomes clear what the Fed is going to do.'
The expectation is that the dollar will trade in a narrow range until the
FOMC meeting.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday lent verbal
support to the dollar. He told a London audience that 'We are all interested
in a stronger dollar.' He added, though, that the Bundesbank also believed
in a strong D-Mark. 'We have no problem with the strong D-Mark,' said Mr
Tietmeyer.
He was non-committal about whether the Bundesbank would participate in
co-ordinated intervention, saying only that signals to the market could play
a useful role under 'special circumstances'. To be successful, though, they
had to be based on 'consistent and credible policies'.
To many in the market, this means higher US interest rates. Whether the
market will get what it wants is a moot point. Although most observers
believe the Fed should raise interest to curb inflationary pressures, it is
not clear that the dollar will feature much in its thinking.
Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York,
comments: 'It is a mistake to expect the Fed to hike interest rates to
bolster a battered dollar ..The Fed's mandate is to maintain domestic price
stability, promote economic growth and guard the stability of the financial
system.'
'For the Fed to hike rates to defend the dollar, it would have to believe
that a weakening dollar threatens financial stability or price stability.'
In the UK, short term interest rates eased as the prospect of a near-term
tightening of monetary policy receded. Three month LIBOR fell to 6 1/16 per
cent, from 6 5/16 per cent.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 605m of
assistance at established rates, and late assistance of about Pounds 570m,
after forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn shortage.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME trade continues to
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange announced yesterday that its tenure of its old
premises ended last week with the recording of yet another monthly volume
record. And it is confident that the trend will continue on the bigger
trading floor in Fenchurch Street, to which it moved on Monday.
The October trading total of 4.458m contracts beat the September figure by
566,000 and took the total for the year so far to 38.62m, already ahead of
the 1993 full-year figure of 35.28m. The exchange has forecast volume growth
over the coming year at between 20 and 50 per cent.
The investment fund participation that has fuelled this year's impressive
rise in both trading activity and price levels on the exchange was very much
in evidence again this week. All contracts set fresh records for the recent
buying spree. Copper, aluminium and lead prices reached the highest levels
for four years; nickel touched 2 1/4 -year highs; and tin and zinc scaled
two-year peaks.
End-week profit-taking trimmed gains yesterday morning but there was renewed
buying after lunch and all the markets ended with their uptrends intact.
An increasingly prominent feature was the tightening squeeze on copper
supplies. The fall in LME warehouse stocks of the metal over the past few
months had taken the total to a below-par level equivalent to five and a
half weeks consumption, said William Adams, analyst at London broker Rudolf
Wolff. And another analyst, Wiktor Bielski of Bain &amp; Company, pointed out
that most of this metal was held in Europe, rather than the US, where demand
was heaviest.
Early last month concern over the stocks decline pushed the copper market
into 'backwardation' - where there is a premium for nearby delivery - a
reversal of the normal 'contango' position in which the costs of holding
physical metal - principally lost interest, warehousing and insurance - are
reflected in nearby discounts. As it became apparent this week there some
market players were seriously short of metal the cash/three months
backwardation widened from last Friday's Dollars 21.50 a tonne to Dollars 55
at one point.
Three months copper closed yesterday at Dollars 2,693.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 11 on the day but Dollars 35 up on the week. It had earlier dipped
to Dollars 2,655, reflecting a smaller-than-expected fall in LME stocks, but
the squeeze factor prevented selling pressure from seriously threatening the
uptrend.
Aluminium stocks dropped below the 2m-tonne mark for the first time since
August last year, but the 35,525-tonne fall was in line with expectations
and had no discernible market impact. Prices followed the downward trend
early on but then recovered. The three months price closed at Dollars
1,884.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on the day and Dollars 57 on the week, but
Dollars 23.50 below Thursday's peak.
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures were nervous ahead of the
official assessment of Brazil's 1995-96 crop prospects following this year's
frost's and drought, which is expected to be released this weekend.
Selling was encouraged by a forecast from US banker Morgan Stanley that the
crop would be between 20m and 22m bags (60kg each), much higher than the
Brazilian authorities' post-frost projection of 13m-15m bags. But buying was
attracted at the lows and the January delivery position, after dipping to
Dollars 3,315 a tonne on Thursday, recovered to end the week at Dollars
3,405, down Dollars 52 on balance.

FT  05 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wool market, which was accelerating very close to a new seasonal peaks
under the lead of finer merinos in Australia, turned easier this week. The
merinos which previously had risen so strongly eased most sharply, while
broader types maintained steadiness. The week closed with some uncertainty
about whether the worst was over or not. The market indicator in Australia
fell from 802 to 781c/kg. Many in the trade still express long-term
confidence in the supply/demand outlook as a basis for firm prices, but when
it comes to day-to-day trading everyone agrees that price rises in recent
months have been very difficult to pass on. There is also talk of increasing
use of man-made fibres in blends, as wool gets dearer.

Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, reported a sharp drop in first-half
non-consolidated revenues and a wider loss as it was battered by poor sales
at home and the sharp appreciation of the yen.
Sales for the period dropped 12 per cent to Y1,568.8bn (Dollars 16.1bn) from
Y1,781.8bn a year ago, while operating losses ballooned to Y82.6bn from
Y38.6bn. Recurring losses - before extraordinary items and tax - widened to
Y57.9bn from Y28.9bn previously. Net losses rose to Y53.7bn from Y32.8bn,
and the interim dividend wasagain passed.
Nissan's losses came in spite of an increase in sales of securities
amounting to Y32.8bn compared with Y13.1bn in the previous first half.
Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, executive managing director, described the results as
providing 'a very regrettable image' of the company. But he said Nissan
expected to return to the black at the operating level in the second half of
the year and that it would pay a Y7 dividend for the year, equivalent to
last year's amount.
The better result in the second half is expected to come as a result of
Nissan's strenuous rationalisation measures, which are achieving their
targets earlier than expected, a recovery in domestic demand and new product
launches.
During the period, Nissan tried to reduce inventory levels and improve the
profitability of its dealers, Mr Hamaoka said. At the same time,
cost-cutting measures, and price increases, allowed Nissan to counter the
adverse impact of the yen's sharp appreciation on its overseas operations.
The biggest difficulty Nissan had in the six months was selling its cars in
Japan, including those with model changes, as a result of the large
inventory levels at its dealers.
Nissan's luxury cars in particular were shunned by Japanese consumers who
have become increasingly sensitive to price. Domestic sales plunged almost
19 per cent while exports were down only 2.7 per cent under the impact of
the high yen.
Nissan has revised down its full-year forecasts. Instead of breaking even at
the recurring level, it predicts a recurring loss of Y60bn and a net loss of
Y65bn on sales of Y3,400bn.

FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand to spin off
operation as profits dive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, is to spin-off its
international reinsurance business into a new stock market-listed company,
having failed to sell the loss-making activity.
The announcement yesterday came as Uni Storebrand revealed that in the first
nine months group profit, after transfers to life assurance customers,
plunged to NKr223m (Dollars 33.8m) from NKr1.11bn at the same stage last
year. Operating profit of NKr1.45bn was NKr2.38bn lower but there was a
NKr972m increase in net premium income to NKr10.92bn.
Finance income dropped NKr3.04bn to NKr3.8bn due to bonds which were hit
hard by rising interest rates.
Realised losses on securities were NKr710m against gains of NKr2.42bn as
unrealised gains sunk to NKr5m from NKr4bn.
Nevertheless, Uni said it had increased market share, improved the result in
the non-life business and achieved a sharp increase in life assurance
premiums.
In March, Uni said it would seek to sell Christiania Re in the US but, in
the meantime, the unit would be transferred to the non-life unit. Uni had
planned to dispose of the UK business and close the Singapore office. But
the strategy failed and Uni yesterday announced plans to spin them off.
The Oslo, London and Singapore re-insurance units increased nine-month
losses, before allocations, to NKr106m from NKr30m while Christiania Re
expanded losses to NKr165m from NKr16m.
During the past three years, Uni injected about NKr1bn in capital into the
reserves of these units to keep them running.
But Uni said its shareholders would benefit more if reinsurance was divested
from the group so that it could concentrate on core businesses of life
assurance, non-life and asset management.
Existing shareholders will be offered pre-emptive rights to subscribe to
shares of the new company but Uni could take a 10 per cent stake.
Uni will recapitalise reinsurance with 'a couple of hundred million kroner'
and seek a guarantee from its largest shareholders for the disposal of 90
per cent of the new company's shares.
A prospectus is to be issued this month. It hopes to complete the operation
before the summer.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: No time to put his feet up - More at ease
than he has been for months and unfettered from his erstwhile tormentor,
Dieter Bock is now able to make his presence felt at Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock was yesterday exhausted but more at ease than he had been for
months, having won his long battle against Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint
chief executive at Lonrho, the international trading group.
At tea time on Thursday, Mr Rowland, who had been Lonrho's driving force for
33 years, agreed to give up his executive duties at the end of the year and
to stand down from the board altogether next March.
In his first interview since establishing himself firmly in control of the
international trading group, the German property financier did not hide his
delight: 'It will take some time to really relax and move forward without
the burden of having someone on my back,' he said.
He had no doubt that the agreement with Mr Rowland was binding. 'He may try
to hurt me with words, but I can cope with that.'
Mr Bock stressed that the title of Lonrho president, which Mr Rowland will
take next spring if shareholders agree, carries 'no power'. The title of
president had been offered to Mr Rowland because 'the board did not want to
humiliate him'.
He added that opinion within the company was divided on whether Mr Rowland
would bother to continue coming in to the office: 'I think he will come from
time to time.'
He also denied that he had made a significant concession to Mr Rowland by
agreeing to scrap an arrangement which gave him a substantial degree of
control over Mr Rowland's 6.5 per cent Lonrho share-holding.
Mr Bock had previously had the power to force Mr Rowland to sell him the
shares on leaving the company or at the end of 1985. A new arrangement has
now been put in place giving Mr Bock the right to buy the shares only if Mr
Rowland wants to sell them - and that right expires once Mr Rowland leaves
the board.
However, Mr Rowland's Lonrho shareholding continues to be held in an escrow
 -or independent - account. Until he leaves the board they can only be sold
through the company's stockbroker, James Capel, and only if Capel takes the
view that the sale will not damage the company.
Mr Bock's main disappointment over the past year has been his inability to
dispose of peripheral assets, which he blames on the obstructive tactics of
Mr Rowland. 'There have been almost no disposals this year,' he said.
Mr Bock's most ambitious reorganisation attempt so far at Lonrho has been a
plan to create the world's biggest platinum group by merging the company's
South African platinum interests with those of Gencor, the mining
conglomerate.
This however was blocked earlier this year, though there are conflicting
explanations of who was responsible for the impasse. Mr Bock's close
colleagues blame Mr Rowland. Other Lonrho executives say that there was a
widespread view on the company's board that the implicit value being put on
Lonrho's holding in Western Platinum was too low.
Mr Bock said yesterday that his highest priority was to resume negotiations
with Gencor so that both companies could increase the returns they earn from
their platinum interests.
Lonrho will henceforth have only four divisions: gold and coal mining in
Africa; hotels in the UK and internationally; agriculture also in Africa;
and international trading activities. Everything else will eventually be
sold or closed down.
Many Lonrho employees expect Mr Bock to merge Lonrho's hotels with the
continental European Kempinski chain, in which he has a significant interest
through his private companies.
Mr Bock said that such a move had been discussed and rejected - though he
said that the possibility of fusing the two chains might be re-examined at
some point.
Whatever his plans, any sale of the Metropole Hotels would be complicated by
the presence of the Libyan government as a 33 per cent Metropole
shareholder.
Mr Bock professes to be embarrassed by the Libyan link which Mr Rowland
forged. Though how easy it would be to sever that tie is unclear.
Perhaps the biggest one-off boost to profits will come from cutting central
administration costs, which Mr Bock said could be reduced by 'more than
Pounds 10m'. Once Mr Rowland departs, there should also be a Pounds 5m
saving as the group no longer has to pay his salary of more than Pounds 1m
and millions of pounds of other expenses directly related to him.
These costs relating to Mr Rowland include Pounds 850,000 of business
expenses, the Pounds 2m annual costs of running a Gulfstream jet, and even
Pounds 230,000 of contributions to the school fees of the dependants of
various African politicians.
Mr Bock said, however, that by the end of the past financial year on
September 30, he had made good his 'promise' to City of London analysts that
the group's operations would cease being net consumers of cash.
In fact, he said he had been extremely surprised at how good Lonrho's
financial controls had turned out to be. As a result, he is fairly confident
that he will not discover too many skeletons in the company's cupboard as he
extends his influence over the group.
However it is widely believed within the company that Mr Rowland's departure
will probably lead to the disclosure of other company secrets. That there
are some of these is certain, given that he ran the company as a personal
fiefdom, with enormous personal discretion over the use of millions of
pounds of company funds.
One recent example of a hidden liability was the disclosure that Lonrho had
granted an indemnity to Mr Graham Jones, the former employee of Mr Mohamed
Fayed who allegedly defected to Lonrho and is now being sued by Mr Fayed.
Other disclosures may simply be embarrassing rather than financially costly
 -there is allegedly a whole room of secret Lonrho documents in the charge
of one of Mr Rowland's minders.
The stock market yesterday took the view that any unforeseen liabilities
will be outweighed by the additional profits to be earned as Mr Bock
reorganises the company. Lonrho's share price rose 12p to 144 1/2 p, as
28.6m shares were traded, far more than the normal.
Investors will be further reassured by Mr Bock's most surprising statement
of yesterday that - contrary to widespread speculation - he had no intention
of selling his Lonrho holding of 18.8 per cent and would instead be selling
all his private interests over the coming two years, to concentrate all his
time and energy on Lonrho.
'It is such a marvellous company, that I want to devote myself too it', he
said. 'To a large extent the real value has not been unlocked.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom warns over
equity ratio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board said yesterday the
company's equity ratio had fallen to 'alarming' levels after it forecast
that the company's debts would rise 4.7 per cent to DM122bn (Dollars 81bn)
next year, up from DM116.5bn this year.
Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister revealed that the equity ratio in 1995 was expected
to fall to 19 per cent, down from 20.7 per cent, as the company makes
further new investments ahead of its stock market listing in 1996. Turnover
next year is expected to rise 8 per cent to DM69bn, up from a forecast
DM64bn this year.
Gross profits are expected to rise 15.4 per cent to DM6bn but the company
will, for the last time, have to pay half of this back to the federal
government.
A final payment of about DM4bn will have to be made to Postbank and
Postdienst, the two other branches of the state-owned operator which have
been subsidised by Telekom. All three will be turned into joint stock
companies at the beginning of next year.
Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said investments, especially in eastern
Germany, would slowly decrease and that this would allow a gradual reduction
of the company's debts. Earnings are expected to improve and the company
hopes to raise at least DM10bn when it raises capital through a stock
exchange listing early in 1996.
About 6,000 jobs will be shed in the coming year by means of a hiring
freeze, bringing the workforce down to 224,000 people.
DeTeMobil, the Telekom subsidiary which operates the D1 mobile telephone
network, is expected to have sales of DM4.6bn next year, up from a forecast
DM3.8bn in 1994, and will make a 'very respectable' profit, the group said.
The company, which has about 800,000 mobile phone subscribers, is making
monthly profits but not enough to offset investments of about DM4bn.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: London Industrial Pounds 20m acquisition of
17 estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Industrial, the property company which raised Pounds 14m when it
floated on the Stock Exchange a year ago, is buying 17 industrial estates
for Pounds 20m financed by a placing and open offer.
The light industrial estates, acquired from A&amp;J Mucklow Group, are mostly in
the Midlands, taking London Industrial away from its roots in the south east
of England.
The company was formed in 1986 to buy the industrial property portfolio of
the Greater London Council.
Mr Harry Platt, managing director, said the acquisition fitted London
Industrial's strategy of buying properties let to multiple tenants which
require active management.
The new properties are about 82 per cent let, against 78.5 per cent for the
company's existing 36 industrial estates.
The deal is being funded by a placing of shares with institutions at 325p.
Shareholders have the option of subscribing for shares at the same price, on
the basis of seven for every eleven held.
After the placing, gearing will be around 60 per cent, compared with a
long-term target of 100 per cent.
Mr Platt said the company would be seeking additional acquisitions in the
London and Birmingham areas.
The shares closed yesterday up 2p at 330p, against last year's placing price
of 320p.
London Industrial also announced an increase in interim pre-tax profits from
Pounds 355,000 to Pounds 905,100, reflecting the contribution of
acquisitions made at the time of flotation.
Earnings per share increased by 41 per cent to 8.6p and the interim dividend
has been increased by 50 per cent to 3p. The company said that it intends to
pay a final dividend of 7p, making a total for the year of 10p, against 7p
last year.
It added that the level of activity over the summer was higher than expected
and occupancy had improved from 74.8 per cent at the end of the last
financial year in March.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace chief denounces nephews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the motor
distribution and leisure group, yesterday denounced his two nephews who are
leading a shareholders' rebellion.
Mr Barr criticised the managerial skills of Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert Barr,
who have called for their uncle's resignation.
The Barr brothers, who claim majority support among ordinary voting
shareholders, have requisitioned an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief
executive, and Mr Brian Parker, finance director.
Yesterday the board called the EGM for December 1. It has already called
another EGM for November 25 to enfranchise the group's non-voting A shares,
which are owned mainly by institutions.
Mr Malcolm Barr said: 'The board wholly supports John Parker and Brian
Small. Their record to date and the group's current trading have confirmed
that the board made the right decision in appointing them earlier this year.
'Furthermore, we believe that the alternative board being proposed is
insufficiently experienced and qualified to manage BWAT.'

<TEXT>
Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailing group, has had its long and
short-term debt ratings lowered by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based credit
rating agency, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The long-term rating was cut
from AA- to A, and the short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1.
S&amp;P said the retailer's financial risk had been increased by the ADollars
1.26bn (USDollars 941m) repurchase of the 21.45 per cent of its equity which
had previously been owned by Kmart, the US stores group. Coles announced
that the deal - in two separate parts - was completed yesterday and that
payment of the ADollars 1.26bn had gone ahead.
As a result, three Kmart appointees to the Coles board - Mr Joseph Antonin,
Mr Thomas Watkins and Mr Thomas Murasky - resigned as directors of the
Australian group.
S&amp;P added that profitability and cash-flow from operating businesses
reflected the strength of the company's market position, but noted if the
entire block of Kmart shares was cancelled, the company's gearing - measured
as total liabilities to total tangible assets - would exceed internal
targets of 55 per cent to 60 per cent.
Coles pointed out the possible downgrading had been taken into consideration
when assessing the effects of the buy-back, and was expected to have a
minimal impact on profitability.

<TEXT>
Reliance Electric, the US industrial motor company which is the target of a
bid battle between industrial groups General Signal and Rockwell
International, said yesterday it supported the lower of the two bids, from
General Signal, writes Tony Jackson in New York.
Reliance agreed a Dollars 1.3bn merger with General Signal in August, and
the offer was capped last month by a Dollars 1.5bn hostile offer from the
much larger Rockwell.
Reliance said under the terms of its merger agreement with General Signal,
the latter was entitled to a Dollars 50m fee if its offer was terminated.
Taken with the 'many uncertainties and conditions' attached to the Rockwell
offer, the Reliance board said it was 'unable to take a position' on the
offer. It said the General Signal offer was 'an attractive transaction, with
significant benefits for Reliance shareholders'.
Rockwell said yesterday it was clear it had made the best offer, and that it
intended to proceed. Rockwell's offer is in cash, General Signal's in
shares.

Institutional investors applied for 15.5 times the number of shares that
have been allocated to them in the partial privatisation of Renault, the
French motor group, the government said yesterday, writes Andrew Jack in
Paris.
Applications closed on Thursday night for the 25m shares earmarked for
institutions at FFr176 a share, and the over-subscription will trigger a
complex system of distribution.
Meanwhile, an intensive advertising campaign aimed at attracting individual
investors has been launched. Private investors have been allocated 60 per
cent of the 62m shares in the group that are being floated, and can buy them
at FFr165 each.
The offer to individuals is open until November 10, after which allocation
will take place in the middle of the month before trading begins.

Shares in Burmeister &amp; Wain, the Danish shipyard, were suspended on the
Copenhagen stock exchange yesterday, at the company's own request, after it
said it was negotiating an alliance with the Swedish marine industrial group
Kockums, of Malmo, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
B &amp; W said the two groups had signed a memorandum of agreement which
included a provision for a financial engagement in B &amp; W by the Swedish
group. The Copenhagen group, which made a net profit of DKr132m (Dollars
22.2m) in 1993 on turnover of DKr2.3bn, said it would make a deficit of
DKr275m in 1994 and a loss of at least the same order in 1995.
Kockums, which was once a leading European builder of large oil tankers, is
today a subsidiary of Celsius, the state-controlled defence industry group.
It is a diversified marine industrial group with construction of naval
submarines as one of its leading activities. Kockums had a turnover of
SKr2.3bn (Dollars 313.3m) and made a net profit of Skr170m last year.

FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ikea to invest heavily on stores
in China

<TEXT>
Ikea, the furniture retailer, said yesterday it had decided to launch a
heavy investment programme in China. It plans to open up to 10 stores as
well as expanding production facilities in the country.
Mr Anders Moberg, Ikea's chief executive, said the move was one of the
company's biggest investment projects that could total SKr2bn (Dollars 272m)
over the next 10 years.
Ikea, owned by the Swedish Kamprad family but now based in Denmark and the
Netherlands, plans to open the first stores in Beijing, Zhezhen and
Guangzhou. Mr Moberg said he hoped the first store would open by the end of
1996, but he said it was not yet decided in which city it would stand.
The stores, at a cost of about SKr150m each, will be built and run by Ikea.
The group will spend up to SKr500m in expanding production facilities in
China through joint ventures with local partners. It operates two joint
venture operations in the country, supplying wooden furniture to Ikea
outlets elsewhere.
Ikea, founded in 1943 by the Kamprads, has expanded rapidly worldwide over
the past decade based on its formula of keenly-priced furniture built to
low-frills, but stylish, Swedish designs. Annual turnover has more than
trebled since 1984 to SKr36.5bn this year as the number of stores doubled to
more than 120 in 25 countries.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Westminster Scaff in loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Depressed margins and poor trading conditions led Westminster Scaffolding,
the construction industry sub-contractor, to continue its losses.
The pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 came out at Pounds 945,000
against Pounds 1.99m for the eight months to June 30 last year. This year's
figure included a bad debt of Pounds 353,000.
Turnover was down from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 2.47m.
Losses per share came out at 0.3p (3.8p).
Although the losses were lower, the results 'should not be regarded as
encouraging,' said Mr Michael Pelham, chairman.
The group was 'constantly jeopardised by the reluctance of main contractors
to abide by agreed terms of payment' and he could see no evidence of any
improvement in margins.
As a result, the company is scaling down its operations in the UK and
expanding in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
Increased costs arising from its expansion led Banner Homes, the
housebuilder, to turn in lower pre-tax profits for the six months to
end-September, down from Pounds 557,000 to Pounds 504,000.
Turnover increased from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 5.2m. The company sold 43
units in the first half against 28 last time.
The increased overheads and costs of funding a larger working capital
requirement have resulted in higher interest payments of Pounds 438,000
(Pounds 390,000).
After a tax charge of Pounds 166,000 (nil) earnings per share were 2.1p
(4.1p). There is an interim of 0.7p (nil).

<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Bloomer, a senior partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountant, is
to become group finance director at Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest
life insurer, from the start of next year.
Mr Bloomer, aged 40, will be the second youngest member of Prudential's
board, and comes with 20 years' experience at Arthur Andersen, where he is
managing partner of the European insurance practice.
He will be only the second person to hold the post of group finance director
at the Pru: his sole predecessor was Mr Michael Lawrence, who left to head
the Stock Exchange in February this year.
Prudential's executive directors are paid in the range Pounds 295,000 to
Pounds 435,000.
Acknowledging that his post had been vacant for almost a year, Mr Bloomer
said his task would be to bring a further layer of financial analysis to
Prudential's strategic decisions in areas such as east Asia and within the
US marketplace.
He said also that the prospect of being at Prudential at a time when the UK
life assurance industry was going through such a period of change was 'too
exciting an opportunity to pass up'.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bowater to depart paper business with
Pounds 158m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the printing, packaging and coatings group, yesterday closed the
book on a decade of restructuring with the announcement that it had agreed
to sell its last remaining paper businesses in a Pounds 158.3m cash deal.
The company said it had reached an agreement in principle to sell its
Australian tissue operations and related pulp and wood products activities
to the diversified forestry company Carter Holt Harvey of New Zealand for
ADollars 350m.
The deal also includes Bowater's Deeko disposable tableware operations, and
a 50 per cent interest in Sancella, a feminine hygiene joint venture.
Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said the disposal completed 'a
process of regeneration and change' which had been taking place within the
company since he was appointed in 1987.
However, Bowater has been gradually withdrawing from the paper industry
since the demerger of its large US paper-making business in 1984.
Mr Lyon said that if the cash were left on deposit the net effect of the
disposal would be to dilute earnings by about 0.5p. Bowater intended
eventually to reinvest the proceeds in its core packaging, printing and
coatings businesses. It also hoped to increase its presence in Asia, Mr Lyon
said.
He stressed that Bowater's acquisitive period was largely over. The company,
which completed several large acquisitions in 1992 and 1993 at a total cost
of Pounds 853m, would now focus on organic growth.
In the shorter term, the sale would reduce debt as a proportion of
shareholders' funds from 43 per cent to between 20 and 25 per cent.
In the year ended December 31, the Bowater Tissue division reported
operating profits of Pounds 10.7m on sales of Pounds 145m. Net assets before
debt were Pounds 150m. The deal remains subject to net asset adjustments and
regulatory approval.
Bowater also announced that it was considering the possibility of floating
its Australian engineering business, which distributes engines and gearboxes
for trucks, boats and agricultural and mining equipment. Sales last year
were Pounds 114m, with operating profits of Pounds 5.5m. Net assets were
Pounds 44m.
Mr Lyon said flotation was unlikely before next year.
Meanwhile, Carter Holt Harvey, which is controlled by International Paper of
New York, said the acquisition of the Australian operations formed part of a
strategy to expand its core business in the Pacific.
It announced the deal in an interim profits statement which showed an 8 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to NZDollars 192m (Pounds 73.1m) on sales
15 per cent higher at NZDollars 1.43bn. Earnings per share rose from 10.5
cents to 12.01 cents and the dividend was unchanged at 4 cents.
The Chilean associated company, Compania de Petroleos de Chile (Copec)
announced doubled profits of 92.3bn pesos (NZDollars 371.4m).

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A resounding pitter-patter of political arm
twisters - Bernard Gray looks at the lobbying process surrounding BAe and
GEC's attempts to take over VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lobby, lobby, lobby, the sound of political arm-twisters pitter-pattering
around Whitehall has risen to a din in the last week. The bids for VSEL have
turned a slow autumn for the political lobbyists into a bun fight. Both
British Aerospace and GEC have teams of professional political lobbyists
phoning every MP in the House of Commons phone book from A to Z; Sir Tim
Bell is batting for GEC, while lobbying company PPU is doing the honours for
BAe.
Bigger strategic fish are being fried by heavyweight chefs within the
companies themselves. Meetings in the normal course of business between the
companies and civil servants are being turned to the subject of VSEL.
Meetings outside the normal course of business are being called with senior
civil servants and ministers to put the case for one side or the other. Both
Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, and Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief
executive, have been much in evidence at the Ministry of Defence lately.
Then there are the other board members who can lend a hand in time of trial.
BAe has two political non-executive directors: Lord Hollick is a working
Labour peer who runs the financial and media company MAI, while Lord Hesketh
was previously a Conservative government chief whip in the Lords and is an
ex-minister of the Department of Trade
GEC's chairman, Lord Prior, served in Mrs Thatcher's cabinet, while Sir
Geoffrey Pattie MP is a Conservative ex-defence and trade minister who is
now co-chairman of GEC-Marconi, the company's defence arm. All can be
expected to have quiet chats behind the scenes with friends and colleagues
to make sure the right point of view gets home.
The process they are trying to influence is that followed when a bid raises
competition issues. The companies involved, and any customers or government
departments affected, can make submissions to the Office of Fair Trading
about what they think should happen. Since in this case submarines are only
bought by the Ministry of Defence, the MoD's evidence to the OFT will be
crucial.
However, the Department of Trade may also make a submission about the
industrial consequences of the bids.
The Scottish Office may also get involved because the Yarrow yard on the
Clyde falls within its patch, as does BAe's troubled Prestwick aircraft
factory, which might just be under threat if the company's finances are not
strengthened by a VSEL takeover.
Each of the departments can make a separate submission, and may well do so.
But given the highly-charged political atmosphere surrounding these bids, ad
hoc groups of civil servants will be formed to try to iron out
inter-departmental differences in advance.
These officials will then put their recommendations to ministers, who may,
or may not, accept them. Needless to say, ministers from different
departments will also have discussed the issue in advance.
Submissions are then sent to the OFT, which normally tries to decide within
21 days whether or not to refer a bid to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission for a full investigation.
That should mean that the OFT rules on BAe's case by November 16. But
because GEC's bid came later the examination may be extended to December 7.
The OFT then makes its report to the president of the board of trade, Mr
Michael Heseltine, who can accept or reject the findings. At this stage
there will undoubtedly be a cabinet level discussion about the wisdom of any
course of action. If Mr Heseltine clears both bids, the battle would then
move to the stock market, where GEC's financial strength gives it an
advantage. If he referred both bids to the MMC the issue would be in limbo
for six months. If he referred GEC but not BAe, then BAe would probably win.
The lobbyists will crawl all over each stage of the process trying to gain
an advantage. However, the arguments are complicated because while they are
ostensibly about competition in shipbuilding and who should own VSEL, they
are in reality about who should run the British defence industry. So will it
be GEC or BAe which wins the argument? That, unfortunately, is still an
official secret.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Browning-Ferris extends Attwoods bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste services company, yesterday
extended its hostile Pounds 364m cash offer for Attwoods of the UK for 15
days.
BFI has received acceptances for 30.61 per cent of Attwoods shares.
This includes the 29.8 per cent which it has agreed to buy from Laidlaw of
Canada.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, said the level of acceptances
excluding Laidlaw's stake showed that 'our shareholders do not come cheap.'
Mr Foreman said Attwoods would demonstrate its value to shareholders.
Attwoods is expected to publish its third defence document at the end of
next week.
This is likely to include first quarter results as well as indications on
profits for the first half.
Under the takeover code, the UK company cannot publish any new financial
information after November 11.
The extension of BFI's bid was widely expected, with many institutions
holding out in hopes of a higher offer.
BFI now has until November 18 to increase its bid.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hanson Pounds 2m joint venture in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the UK conglomerate, has made its first foray into the Chinese
market in a Pounds 2m joint venture with Beijing's gas monopoly to produce
gas meters.
Hanson Pacific was broker to the deal which UGI Meters, a Hanson subsidiary,
signed with the Beijing Municipal Gas Company. UGI owns 55 per cent of the
joint venture.
The deal is a departure for Hanson, which has not shown much interest in
joint ventures in the past.
Mr Robert Hanson, chairman of Hanson Pacific, said the idea of joint
ventures was a 'big change in our corporate philosophy'.
Mr Simon Hsu, who was appointed chief executive of Hanson Pacific earlier
this year to spearhead the group's expansion in Asia, has convinced the
Hanson group that partnerships are a better way to penetrate China than
take-overs.
Yesterday he said he was working on 'four or five' other deals that the
group was looking at seriously.
Underlining the company's interest in Asian business, Mr Hanson, Mr Hsu and
Mr David Clark, the group's chief executive in the US, are embarking on a
10-day tour of China and south east Asia on Monday to look for sales
opportunities.
Mr Hsu said UGI had big plans for its gas meter business in China.
It is to build a factory in Beijing to manufacture state of the art gas
metering equipment for sale to the gas utility in the Chinese capital.
UGI plans to increase production from an initial 200,000 units a year to up
to 700,000 units in three years. The joint venture will also seek export
opportunities within the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Hanson said: 'We've spent time encouraging our operating companies to
invest in this area.' However, he added that Hanson had no set level of
investment planned for Asia-Pacific.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wm Cook up 6% as interest falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest costs helped to lift pre-tax profits 6 per cent at William
Cook, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, in the six months to October
1.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 3.54m as net interest fell
from Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 410,000. Operating profit remained almost
unchanged at Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 3.91m) on turnover which rose 8 per cent
to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 48m).
Mr Andrew Cook, chairman, said margins had come under pressure as
competitors lowered prices. He claimed that 50 per cent of the company's
continental competitors were trading 'in a state of both legal and actual
bankruptcy'.
Raw material prices have also risen between 50 and 100 per cent in the last
three months.
'In this environment, our own large-scale modernisation and investment
programmes have the effect more of limiting margin erosion rather than
increasing margins,' Mr Cook said.
The company's strategy would be to reduce debt, which stood at Pounds 8m at
the interim stage, while reducing costs and improving efficiency.
The group's capital expenditure was about Pounds 2.5m in the first half as
it completed modernisation programmes at two of its seven plants.
However, it faces difficulties in its overseas market as the weak dollar
affects 75 per cent of its export sales.
Earnings per share rose 0.53p to 10.8p and the board declared a maintained
interim dividend of 2.5p. Shares closed at 266p, down 4p.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forte makes Pounds 175m placing - Proceeds
will help fund the acquisition of Meridien hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte yesterday announced a Pounds 175m share placing to help pay for its
acquisition of Meridien hotels, the international chain which is 57 per cent
owned by Air France.
Forte said the placing by UBS, at 227p a share, was completed by 11am
yesterday, with shares purchased by both existing and new shareholders. The
placing price of the 78m new shares represented a 4 per cent discount on
Thursday's closing price of 236 1/2 p. The shares closed down 3p yesterday
at 233 1/2 p.
Forte said the formal acquisition of Meridien was expected to take place by
next Thursday. The group said that acceptances had reached 90 per cent and
should rise further by next week.
Air France announced in September that it preferred Forte's bid for Meridien
to that of Accor, the French hotel group. The acquisition of Meridien's 54
hotels was a significant victory for Forte, doubling its international
portfolio of first class establishments.
Before completing the deal, Forte had to wait for the approval of France's
Commission de Privatisation, which has now been given. The complicated
nature of the completion process means that Forte will probably end up
paying less for Meridien than the FFr1.9bn (Pounds 220m) originally
envisaged.
Forte will have to pay only 80 per cent of the FFr1.08bn due to Air France
on completion next week. The remainder will be paid early next year, but is
conditional on how many hotel management contracts Meridien retains and on
detailed structural surveys of the hotels.
The minority Meridien shareholders have been offered a choice. They can
either receive payment on the same basis as Air France or they can receive
final payment next week. If they opt for the latter they will receive
slightly less than if they wait for the final instalment next year.
The Pounds 175m raised by yesterday's placing represents the amount that
Forte believes will be payable next week. The final payment to be made early
next year would be funded from borrowings or hotel disposals, Forte said.
When its victory over Accor was announced, Forte said it had three options
in funding the Meridien purchase. The first was to use existing borrowing
facilities. The second was to arrange bridging finance until Forte sold its
25 per cent stakes in Gardner Merchant, the contract catering group, and
Alpha Airports, the airline catering company. The third was an equity
raising exercise.
Forte said yesterday that the first had been rejected because it would have
resulted in an increase in gearing. The second was excluded because Forte
wished to retain flexibility over when it disposed of its stakes in the two
companies.
Forte said it decided on a placing rather than a rights issue because of the
relatively small size of the equity offering and because a rights issue
would have required a more substantial discount.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unions say GEC will keep shipyards open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has pledged that if his bid for
VSEL succeeds, both GEC's Yarrow and VSEL's Barrow-in-Furness shipyards
would be kept open, according to one of the officials formulating the trades
unions' stance on the rival bids.
The undertaking was made by Lord Weinstock at a meeting with union officials
on Thursday evening. Mr Duncan Lapish, national secretary of the
white-collar Apex section of the General Municipal Boilermakers Union, said
Lord Weinstock also said that a successful GEC bid would safeguard jobs at
its electronics systems producer Marconi.
Mr Lapish said he did not doubt Lord Weinstock's undertaking that the Barrow
and Yarrow yards and Marconi would remain in operation if his bid won. 'I
have no reason to doubt his sincerity on that; Lord Weinstock usually means
what he says.'
However, Mr Lapish added: 'He said all these three would be safe but he
didn't say at what size.'
Thursday's meeting, about which GEC yesterday declined to comment, was
between Lord Weinstock and the GEC National Joint Consultative Council,
composed of national officers of unions with members employed by GEC.
It was the first of a series of meetings at which the unions are gathering
information on the strategies behind GEC's and BAe's rival bids for VSEL.
The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions will then decide
whether it has a preference between the two, and whether to press for
Monopolies and Mergers Commission intervention.
CSEU officials are to meet BAe executives on Tuesday to probe their plans.
The unions also hope to meet VSEL management soon. Mr Lapish said they
wanted to know why VSEL had not wished to fight to remain independent.
The manoeuvring to take over VSEL, against a background of shrinking defence
orders, has provoked anxiety among VSEL's 6,000 employees at Barrow in West
Cumbria and GEC's 3,000 at Yarrow on the Clyde.
Before GEC confirmed it was bidding for VSEL, Barrow union leaders had made
their hostility to GEC plain to VSEL management. The Barrow officials are
awaiting a meeting with GEC.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: TBI Pounds 2.4m in black midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TBI, the property investment and development company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.4m in its first interim results since the reverse
takeover of Markheath, the indebted property company, in March.
The profit in the six months to September 30 compared with a restated loss
of Pounds 2.4m in the same period last year.
TBI said both businesses had been successfully integrated and there were
already cost savings.
Management changes are being made to facilitate TBI's intended rapid growth
through active portfolio management. Mr Michael Rendle will step down as
non-executive chairman on January 1 and be succeeded by Mr Stanley Thomas.
Mr Thomas was one of the principal backers of TBI when, before the reverse
takeover, it was the privately-owned Thomas Bailey Invest-ments.
Mr Keith Brooks, formerly a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy
firm, became chief executive on November 1. Mr Paul Guy, who was chief
executive, becomes his deputy and finance director, replacing Mr Ian Creber
who has resigned. Mr Creber was one of two Markheath directors on the TBI
board.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 1.7m) and operating profits were up
Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2m. Net debt fell by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 39.4m,
compared with March 31, and gearing dropped to 84 per cent from 113 per cent
at the start of the year.
Net assets rose to Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 41.7m) in that period.
No dividend will be paid but TBI said it expected a nominal final dividend
to be recommended for the full year if sufficient distributable profits had
been earned.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kay's Food reverses into Corridor in
all-paper deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kay's Food Group, the meat processing company which floated earlier this
year, yesterday announced a reverse takeover of Corridor Food Group, the
privately-owned catering retailer and distributor.
Although the company refused to disclose how much the deal was worth, it
said the all-paper acquisition represented a significant expansion.
Corridor's catering operations are expected to complement Kay's existing
customer base, which ranges from Fortnum &amp; Mason to British Rail. Corridor
shareholders will receive new ordinary shares in Kay's at 5p each.
Kay's, which raised Pounds 2.1m from its flotation, said further shares
could be issued to provide working capital. Funds from the issue have been
used primarily to develop a Pounds 2.3m factory near Milton Keynes, designed
to boost processing capacity from 3,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes a year.

FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Starmin deeper in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson which is in
survival talks with its bankers, yesterday announced increased losses for
the first half of 1994 after a series of provisions and exceptional charges.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 1.24m) was published after the
market closed. Sales were 19 per cent lower at Pounds 6.96m.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis, a status which
accountants Ernst &amp; Young described as fundamentally uncertain given the
negotiations with bankers.
However, Mr Michael Gurner, the chief executive appointed in July at the
behest of Starmin's bankers, said the refinancing talks were going well.
Starmin was considering various ways of raising funds to eliminate its
Pounds 6m debt, such as a placing and open offer.
Toal exceptional charges and provisions came to Pounds 1.5m. Excluding
exceptionals, operating profits from continuing businesses improved from
Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 304,000.
Losses per share deepened to 0.5p (0.4p). Last year Starmin breached banking
covenants when doubled losses of Pounds 23.2m left it with shareholders'
funds of just Pounds 3.42m.

Sir, It is not ignorance or wilful misrepresentation ('Avoiding postal
fudge', November 3) that motivates public unease about Post Office
privatisation. Those who have seen their Crown office close, and the service

reason to wonder what other assets a private sector Post Office would
liquidate for the sake of a share price.

Sir, Mr Richard Bird, in advocating road pricing (Letters, November 2), is
voicing an apparent confusion in much of the public debate on the subject.
The taxation of car ownership and car use is already levied by means of the
vehicle licence and petroleum excise duty respectively. Increasing either,

<TEXT>
Sir, Whether Anglo United beats off the three other contenders, acquires
Coal Products and thus secures its own 'salvation' ('The preferred route to
recovery', November 3) remains to be seen. What is not in doubt is that Coal
Products cannot be fairly described as 'British Coal's cast-off'.
Our subsidiary has achieved a sizeable turnround in profitability over the
past two years. This has been done by closing excess capacity and by
developing the strengths of its branded products.
Oxfam would be grateful for such valuable discards.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Senate' is not the right route to
unite engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROWLAND MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your bland headline, 'Elected 'senate' to unite engineering profession'
(October 26), repeats parrot-fashion what the engineering establishment
wants us all to believe.
Sir John Fairclough's praiseworthy initiative to seek unification of a
profession 'owned by its members' has been hijacked by engineering
institutions determined to stop rank-and-file engineers from directly
electing a majority of members on the new central body.
These are the same institutions that persuaded the profession to replace the
Council of Engineering Institutions by the present Engineering Council, and
that now look likely to endorse the backwards step of resurrecting the old
CEI structure, which did not work.
No agenda has yet been set for debate, discussion and comment and even the
engineers' national forum, the Engineering Assembly, has not been allowed,
and will not be allowed, to express any opinion, although it is the only
representative body for more than 200,000 engineers and technicians.
Engineers want and deserve a central authority that is answerable to them as
a profession. Unless the engineering establishment recognises this and
shifts the balance of power away from the institutions and towards the
membership any dream of a united engineering profession will be lost.
Engineers hoping to emulate the medical profession's single effective voice
should be reminded that it comes not from the Engineering Council's
counterpart, the General Medical Council, but from the medics' trade union,
the British Medical Association.
Perhaps it is only when the engineers have their own 'BMA', free from the
restraints of charitable status and Royal Charter, that the one effective
voice of the profession will become a reality.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Music to political ears: Jurek Martin on the role of
talk-radio hosts in the US elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allan Loudell is passionate about steam radio. Programme director at
WILM-AM, the news-talk station in Wilmington, Delaware, he believes it has a
mission to inform.
His station offers a catholic mix of local, national and foreign news that
is often comparable to the best that the BBC can offer. It is certainly as
good as any in the US, a remarkable achievement for a shoe-string operation
that expects its reporters to use old-fashioned typewriters.
But when, at 1.05pm, he heaves himself out of his noon-hour anchor seat,
perhaps having interviewed the correspondents in Washington for Al-Ahram of
Egypt and even the Financial Times, he gives way to three hours of the man
now synonymous with the political power of talk radio, the cigar-chomping
arch-conservative who has given the term 'Rush to judgment' new meaning.
In fact, Rush Limbaugh and his phoners-in, known as Dittoheads and given to
gathering in bars called Rush Rooms, have been somewhat less than buoyant
this week. Project Restore Democracy, as he coins his programme after the
labels given to US military missions overseas, is having a little difficulty
with the predicted survival of two liberal icons whose demise he has
ardently predicted in Tuesday's mid-term elections - Governor Mario Cuomo of
New York and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Even President Bill Clinton, the butt of most of his sometimes entertaining,
more often savage bile, has picked up a little in the polls. But Limbaugh
will have plenty to crow about on Tuesday.
Loudell contracted with him three years ago because WILM's afternoon ratings
were at their lowest and Limbaugh was already head-and-shoulders above the
rest of the talk-show competition. At about Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,700) a
year, WILM has a bargain and its audience is well up (the Limbaugh programme
commands six-figure fees in major metropolitan markets).
Radio polemicism dates back to the 1930s when Father John Coughlan assailed
communists and President Franklin Roosevelt's reassuring fireside chats gave
hope that the Depression was not forever. Contemporary inter-active talk
radio shares some of the same roots, but is now even more angrily populist
and political, with a strong libertarian strain. The business, which has
expanded four-fold in 10 years to reach an estimated 1,000 stations, even
has its own trade magazine - naturally called Talkers.
An estimated 70 per cent of its practitioners are conservative, in Loudell's
view, more because of audience profile than because of current political
trends. Talk radio first began to blossom 30 years ago in the Midwest on
lower frequency but high-powered AM stations (medium-wave in Europe) which
were heavily into sports and thus drew a mainly older white male audience of
conservative bent. With younger listeners still preferring the variety and
better reception of stereo FM, this remains the predominant demographic
audience profile.
Other right-wing hosts now popular - though well behind Limbaugh in appeal -
include Pat Buchanan, a talk-show pioneer who ran for the Republican
presidential nomination in 1992, and G. Gordon Liddy, the old Watergate
felon. On the left, but with smaller audiences still, stand Jerry Brown,
perennial candidate and ex-governor of California, and Jim Hightower, once
Texas agriculture commissioner.
Popular iconoclasts broadcasting from New York include the satirical and
frequently scatological Don Imus, heard in the mornings mostly on all-sports
stations across the country. There is also the outrageous Howard Stern, who
briefly ran for governor of the state as a Libertarian this summer, but
withdrew because he refused to comply with the financial disclosure
standards required of candidates.
Talk radio - and its later blooming relation, talk television - proved a new
campaign tool in the 1992 presidential election. Ross Perot virtually
launched his independent candidacy on Larry King's TV programme - and he is
now the host of his own radio show.
Though he is now much the object of the medium's discontent, Bill Clinton
showed himself to be its master two years ago, a good talker and more than a
match for Imus in the morning. George Bush, with his fractured syntax,
clearly viewed talk radio as some new-fangled horror beneath his dignity.
In the mid-term elections, talk-radio controversy has already bubbled up in
one important race for the US Senate. Bob Grant, of WABC-AM in New York, is
accused by his critics of bigotry and racism. But politicians he has
endorsed, such as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York and Governor Christie
Whitman of New Jersey, have been accustomed to appear on his programme.
The gauntlet was thrown down by Senator Frank Lautenberg, the Democrat up
for re-election in New Jersey. He announced he was boycotting the Grant
programme because of what he called its 'filth-spewing' content and dared
his opponent, Chuck Haytaian, to do the same, which he did not. Then the New
Jersey Transit Authority announced it was suspending all advertising on
WABC-AM. Grant is unrepentant, naturally, but Lautenberg, his political
point made, is apparently cruising to victory proving that not all talk-show
hosts are that influential.
Generally, however, the angry populism of the broadcasters is directed
against Washington and its incumbents, mostly Democrats. Thus, the latest
Newsweek quotes a Republican pollster on Oliver North's campaign for the
senate in Virginia: 'To many voters, his history (lying to Congress over the
Iran-Contra scandals) won't matter much. He's the handy voice of talk-show
anger.'
Howard Kurtz, media correspondent of the Washington Post, recently spent 24
hours listening to what he described as 'the rawest form of media
democracy'. He observed: 'This all-gab environment has changed the rules for
politicians and their handlers, who once thought it sufficient to stamp out
a brushfire in the New York Times or Newsweek but may now find it raging out
of control in Cincinnati, New Orleans or Tucson.'
Loudell fears it could get worse, noting that some programme directors 'have
begun to consider ideology as part of a station's 'identity''. They find it
increasingly difficult to entertain alternative views, 'much as a hard-rock
album station would alienate its audience by playing Abba', he says. In this
election year the music is not gentle on the ear.

Sir, Barry Riley's reference (The Long View, October 29) to 'bureaucratic
investor protection' rubs a sore spot for many of us in the professions. The
effect of the Financial Services Act for solicitors has been to make them
deliver a worse service at a higher cost. This is particularly frustrating
when the problem could so easily be solved by taking solicitors outside the
Act, provided that they clearly undertook to accept no personal benefit from
commissions.

FT  05 NOV 94 / The return of the high-flyers: Japanese exporters are
learning to live with a rising yen and becoming more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No matter how strong the yen, Japan's electronics exports will always be
competitive, a Japanese executive boasted to a securities analyst last week.
That claim, while exaggerated, helps explain why few in Japan's exporting
industries flinched when the yen touched a new high of Y96.1 to the dollar
in New York on Wednesday, 15.5 per cent above its level at the end of last
year.
Until recently, Japan's exporters were the first to moan when each new jump
in the exchange rate wiped billions of yen off their overseas earnings.
Now they are celebrating. A sharp rise in export sales to the growing
economies of the US, east Asia and Europe has allowed them, for the first
time in years, to shrug off the pain.
With their break-even points reduced by the cost-cutting imposed by three
years of economic slowdown, and more than 20 years of coping with a rising
currency, exporters are starting to make startling increases in profits.
NEC, an electronics group which believes it can still make money on
semiconductors at Y90 to the dollar, signalled that better times were around
the corner a few months ago, when it threw a Y100m (Pounds 635,000) party in
a posh hotel. Lavishness on that scale has been almost unheard of in Tokyo
since the heady days of the late 1980s.
The 150-odd companies which have so far reported their results for the
half-year to September show that NEC is not the only one with the right to
roll out the sake. They produced an average rise of nearly 18 per cent in
recurring profits (before extraordinary items and tax), well above the
average market forecast of 15 per cent.
This is in spite of the yen climbing from Y103 to the dollar to Y98.6 during
the same six months. Even more surprising, the sectors most dependent on
exports include the best performers, with profits from the big five
integrated electronics groups up more than three-fold, and profits from
precision instrument makers doubled.
Yet only recently, the Keidanren and Nikkeiren, the leading business
federations, were issuing dire warnings that the yen's rise would wreck
Japanese manufacturing.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, however, has maintained
that the pain is only short term. In the long term, he argues, the yen's
strength forces corporate Japan to make itself even more competitive.
Some sectors have suffered badly at the hands of cheaper foreign competitors
as the yen has appreciated. In the car market, Japan will this year cede to
the US its position as the world's biggest producer. And South Korea last
year briefly knocked Japan out of top place in shipbuilding.
Overall, however, analysts believe Japan has kept its share of world exports
steady at just over 9 per cent since the last count in 1991. This is because
the exchange rate is not the only factor in competitiveness.
Most of Japan's exporters have found room for improvement in other factors
such as costs, prices, quality and demand. They have become experienced in
searching for such improvements, given that the yen has been on a rising
trend since 1972, when it stood at Y360 to the dollar.
On cost-cutting, Japanese industry's main technique has been to shift
production capacity overseas and to increase purchases of components from
abroad.
Nearly one-third of cars and machines made by Japanese-owned companies now
come from outside Japan. Almost a quarter of its manufactured output is made
abroad, and this is expected to double by the end of the decade, estimates
the Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming, a securities firm.
Pessimists argue that this overseas exodus will deplete Japan's
manufacturing base. Yet, argues Mr Mieno, this is really an appropriate
redistribution of labour between low-wage countries, for making
price-sensitive commodities, and high-wage ones such as Japan, for making
high value-added products.
Japanese exporters' other main cost-cutting technique has been to shed
labour through freezing recruitment and encouraging early retirement. It has
been a slow process, with manufacturing jobs falling by just 3 per cent in
the past year.
The latest bout of labour cost-cutting started in mid-1991, stimulated by
the onset of Japan's recession rather than by the rise of the yen. Industry
was initially slow to act. This was due to the tradition of offering
life-time employment to staff - one reason why corporate earnings collapsed
so dramatically at the start of the downturn.
By the same token, however, this steady cost-cutting will continue into the
upturn, leading many securities analysts in Tokyo to expect much sharper
corporate profits rises in the next two years. There is plenty of scope for
improvement: manufacturing industry's recurring profit margins are thin, at
1.8 per cent of sales.
On prices, Japanese exporters have benefited from following Mr Mieno's
advice to shift upmarket into high value-added products. This leaves them
relatively immune from undercutting by cheaper producers. They have also
continued to expand their lead in quality control, notably in automotive
components, which allows them to sustain higher prices.
Even with commodity-type goods such as paper, steel beams and polyester,
foreign demand has been strong enough during the past six months for
Japanese exporters to push through price increases - despite the yen's rise.
Demand has been the final component in Japanese exporters' new-found ability
to live with a high yen. They have the good fortune to be going into a
recovery with plenty of under-used domestic capacity at a time when US
industry is struggling to keep up with demand. Japan willingly fills the gap
at prices buoyed by the inflationary pressures created by capacity
constraints in the US.
At the same time, the structure of Japan's exports - up 8.3 per cent in the
six months to September - is fast changing in favour of east Asia, where the
yen is not so strong against local currencies and where prices are rising
even faster than in the US. Asia overtook the US as Japan's biggest export
market in 1991, and now its exports to Asia exceed sales to the US by a
third, in dollar terms.
The downside of Japanese companies' success in export markets is that it
contributes to the strength of the yen. The currency pressure on Japanese
manufacturers to sharpen competitiveness further is therefore unlikely to
let up. On their past record, they will not fail to respond.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Classics with extra spin: A new UK audience has been created
for classical music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Musical monks from an obscure Spanish village may seem unlikely rivals of
the world's wealthiest opera stars. But over the next few weeks the Silos
Monastery choir will be battling against Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras and
Luciano Pavarotti for top place in the UK's Christmas classical music
charts.
The Silos choristers' Canto Noel is a seasonal follow-up to their Canto
Gregoriano, a compilation of Gregorian plain song that is this year's
classical best-seller. Their rival for the number one position is the Three
Tenors' 1994 concert before the football World Cup final in Los Angeles.
So far this year, the popular success of records such as these has boosted
the volume of classical music sales in the UK by more than 10 per cent
against the same period of 1993, according to the British Phonographic
Industry. The question for the music industry is whether this year's
increase reflects a genuine widening of the classical market or just the
impact of a few one-off hits.
'The success of the Three Tenors and Canto Gregoriano shows that people
enjoy classical music if they have a chance to hear it,' said Bill Holland,
head of Warner Classics. 'We've got to break down the old snobberies and
help the public feel more comfortable about buying operas or symphonies.'
The UK classical market has experienced similar upsurges before. Sales
peaked in 1990, at 16.7m units (CDs, cassettes and LPs) worth Pounds 67.3m,
according to the British Phonographic Institute. But the increase was
fuelled by the one-off success of particular albums, such as the first Three
Tenors' concert at the 1990 World Cup.
There was no long-term increase in sales, and the new customers drifted
away. By 1992, sales had shrunk to 12.3m units worth Pounds 50.9m.
The market has since picked up again, and is expected to reach over 14m
units by the end of this year. Roughly two-thirds of these will be bought by
serious collectors who form the core of the UK market.
But even at these levels, the classical music market is small in comparison
with that for popular music. It represents 7 per cent of UK music sales by
volume, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry, against 9 per cent in France, 10 per cent in Germany and 15 per
cent in Switzerland.
The cost of meeting demand for recordings of new productions of operas or
symphonies is high. 'It costs at least Pounds 300,000 just to record an
opera and you can expect to sell only 9,000 units in the first year, so
you're looking at a 15 or 20 year investment,' said Kick Klimble,
vice-president international of EMI Classics. 'We also take a long-term
approach to working with a star conductor. We've made 50 recordings with
Simon Rattle over 18 years and he's only just become profitable.'
Occasionally, the pay-off period can be much shorter, with 'cross-over'
hits, records that find an appeal among a mass audience. The Three Tenors'
1990 album sold 13m copies worldwide; Vivaldi's Four Seasons by the
violinist, Nigel Kennedy, launched the following year, has sold 2m.
Cross-overs are an anathema to collectors, however. 'It seems impossible for
the musical establishment to accept that someone can be popular and
artistically worthy,' said Chris Tooth, classical product manager for the
Virgin retail group. 'Nigel Kennedy is a seriously good violinist, but he
was attacked as soon as he became successful.
'No one has actually said Pavarotti is a bad singer. But there is this
sniffy element of 'If he sings My Way, can we take him seriously?'.'
One of the chief catalysts of this year's upsurge in sales, according to Mr
Klimble, is the success of Classic FM. The populist classical radio station,
launched in 1992, has introduced a new breed of classical fans into the
market.
By playing a medley of the most accessible music, Classic FM has built up a
weekly audience of 4.8m listeners. This is double that of Radio 3, the BBC's
classical station, which appeals to purists with entire works, including
austere modern compositions.
Classic FM has provided a tailor-made advertising vehicle for music
companies to target the popular classical market. Its easy listening format
has also helped fuel the appetite for compilation albums of popular pieces
of classical music collected under titles such as Sensual Classics, Classic
Sleepies and Classic Creepies. These now dominate Classic FM's weekly chart.
Compilations are not only heavy sellers but are cheap to produce as they are
assembled from archive recordings. Canto Gregoriano and Canto Noel were
re-edited from four albums recorded at Silos Monastery by EMI in the early
1970s. Warner is rumoured to have paid Dollars 5m to each of the Three
Tenors for the rights to record their 1994 concert.
The purists are even sniffier about compilations than about Nigel Kennedy.
'You can't really call them classical at all,' said Mr Tooth.
However compilations can act as a stepping stone into the 'serious'
classical market. Warner now adds suggestion lists to its compilations
identifying complete pieces of music the listener might like. It has already
detected an increase in sales of those works.
'It will take a long time to break down the elitism surrounding classical
music, but we're getting there,' said Mr Holland of Warner Classics. 'I was
encouraged by the success of Gorecki's Third Symphony last year. It's very
rare for the work of a living composer to top the charts for 35 weeks.
'Then I read a letter in CD Review asking why anyone could have released
such a dreadful piece of music. Six million people bought it. That's why.'

<TEXT>
Sir, The British parliament's raison d'etre was to give the ruled some means
to curb the excesses of the executive.
The system of party politics, combined with the whips' office, ensures that
the executive now curbs both parliament and the ruled, who are now totally
reliant on the media to curb, or at least disclose through the essential
difference between news and propaganda, the activities of the executive.
The ascendancy of the professional over vocational politicians, in what many
of them had come to regard as virtually a one-party state, has resulted in
the mother of parliaments having among its members the best that money can
buy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation is a great British product that has always sold better
overseas than at home. While the policy was widely regarded as the pure
essence of Thatcherism, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, records in his
memoirs that the lady herself was suspicious of it at first and feared that
it would alienate floating voters. As for the word, she hated it; but nobody
could come up with a mellifluous alternative. Public opinion, adds Lawson,
was invariably hostile before every big privatisation.
This puts the decision by Mr Major's government to abandon Post Office
privatisation in context. It was clearly the narrowness of the Conservative
majority rather than the intrinsic flaws of the proposal itself that put an
end to this central piece of the government's legislative programme. Change
is invariably painful. The conclusion of the Cold War may finally have done
for state ownership as a respectable means of conducting big business, but
privatisation retains its capacity to alienate and upset.
As policy nostrums go, this one was always likely to become less effective
over time because its scope is, by definition, finite. The state cannot
transfer more to the private sector than it already owns. And by the last
election about two-thirds of the formerly state-owned industries in Britain
had been transferred to the private sector.
In contrast deregulation will have an infinite policy shelf life if the
volume of legislation continues to be used by politicians as a yardstick by
which to measure their own achievement. There is thus a certain logic -
though no historical inevitability - in the fact that the Deregulation and
Contracting Out Act has usurped Post Office privatisation as the
government's not-so-Big Idea for the next session of parliament.
That is not to say that privatisation has no remaining fans. Executives of
the residual state-owned industries yearn for the excuse that privatisation
provides to lay a hand on remuneration packages to rival those enjoyed by
the potentates of the water industry. Ministers can plop comfortably into
the boardrooms of the enterprises they liberated from the Whitehall yoke.
Productivity gains
Nor is it the case that privatisation has nothing left to offer. Its
achievements, though frequently misunderstood, are real enough. Yet
paradoxically the most impressive productivity gains in privatised companies
like British Steel and British Airways took place when the companies were
still in the public sector. That tells us that the switch in ownership is
not necessarily the key to improved performance. It is simply that important
changes in industrial structure have been easier to bring about via a
prospective or actual change of ownership; and the biggest successes of
privatisation have come from the introduction of competition into hitherto
protected markets, such as telecommunications.
This is what makes the policy so popular with governments overseas.
Infrastructure, whether roads, ports, railways or telecoms, are central to
most economies and frequently run very inefficiently by the state. Removing
the state's monopoly in the course of the privatisation process can create
huge welfare gains, while the fiscal burden is simultaneously reduced.
Price reductions
If privatisation has not been a roaring popular success in the UK it is
probably because the initial gainers, especially in the utility sector, have
tended to be shareholders, rather than consumers. The scope for efficiency
improvements and thus for price reductions was underestimated in the early
stages of the process. In the case of the water companies, the need for
substantially increased investment has resulted in big price rises.
Elsewhere it is the shareholders who have been less fortunate. In Japan,
those who subscribed for shares in the NTT telecom float lost fortunes,
since the Ministry of Finance sought to wring the maximum proceeds from the
sale as the stock market bubble of the late 1980s neared its peak. It is
small wonder that the recent Japanese tobacco privatisation flopped.
Even in the UK, where shareholders have been better treated, the
government's subsidiary objective of popular capitalism has not been
achieved. Private shareholders have tended to cash in their profits and sell
to the big investment institutions.
Privatisation has nonetheless become a lucrative source of invisible
earnings for the UK, as the acquired expertise has been sold to foreign
countries. Even the continental Europeans are adopting the practice, if in
doctored form, with cross-shareholdings, restricted voting and other devices
to pre-empt the discipline of takeovers. As for the discipline of
bankruptcy, it remains to be seen how real it is. A government that flunks
the Post Office test might balk at putting British Steel into receivership -
especially if bankruptcy was the result of subsidised competition from
unprivatised foreign firms. Past experience suggests that when governments
confront politically-sensitive bankruptcies, a too-big-to-fail doctrine can
triumph.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Goodies for a big feast: Though the UK chancellor has little
room for manoeuvre he still wants to unveil a Budget to remember
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old Treasury hands are beginning to wonder what is wrong. With this year's
UK Budget less than four weeks away, an eerie silence is surrounding their
massive Edwardian pile overlooking Parliament Square.
The customary fevered speculation about imminent fiscal change has been
absent this year. The activity of lobbyists has been restrained.
If Mr Kenneth Clarke's second Budget is creeping up on the nation in carpet
slippers, the reasons are clear. The chancellor has himself destroyed one
potentially big story by insisting that tax cuts are not on the agenda. The
government already has a multi-year deficit reduction programme in place
following its two Budgets of 1993. Midway between elections is rarely the
time for fiscal sensations.
Professor Wynne Godley, one of the Treasury's panel of independent
forecasters or 'wise men', has argued that in terms of macro-economic policy
the right course for the immediate future 'is to do nothing at all'.
But Mr Clarke cannot stand up on November 29 and stay silent. More than
ever, after last year's unification of the old spring revenue-raising budget
with the Autumn Statement detailing future government spending, the Budget
is the chancellor's great set-piece occasion in which he explains the
government's financial and economic policies to the parliament and nation.
In spite of the calm, much may be riding on this year's Budget. It could
give the government a chance to put behind it recent mishaps such as the
climb-down on Post Office privatisation and allegations of sleaze. Mid-term
Budgets may not feature much in history books, but they often set the tone
of policy in the approach to the next general election. Mr Clarke's
performance could have important repercussions in the middle ground of
politics, where the government has to meet the challenge from Mr Tony
Blair's new model Labour Party.
There are a host of nitty-gritty tax and spending matters that the
government must tackle every year. But this year's Budget may be more
interesting for the way it addresses broad social issues, such as
unemployment and the changing world of work. Although Mr Clarke has
established his credentials as a prudent and decisive chancellor since
moving into Number 11 Downing Street in May 1993, he has a much wider range
of political interests than his Tory predecessors in the job since 1979.
Issues such as tax reform have less appeal for him than trying to ensure
that Britain's voters feel prosperous.
Perhaps reflecting these priorities, Mr Clarke has appeared less than
obsessed with preparations for this Budget. It is difficult to imagine Lord
Lawson or Mr Norman Lamont cancelling preparatory discussions with ministers
and senior Treasury officials at the chancellor's country residence in
Dorneywood to fly to a meeting of European Union finance ministers to settle
a row over Italian milk quotas as did Mr Clarke last month.
The Treasury too has had other things on its mind. Its internal
reorganisation, unveiled last month, absorbed a great deal of senior
mandarins' time. But there is no sign of the Budget falling behind schedule.
Remarkably, given the controversies surrounding Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
chief secretary, the cabinet is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to try to
finalise the spending side of the Budget.
One reason why the Budget appears to be clicking into place is that it has
long been reasonably clear what the government has to do on both the
taxation and spending sides.
Mr Clarke has insisted that talk of tax cuts is 'hopelessly premature' as
long as the government is running a large deficit. Even if the public sector
borrowing requirement can be cut in 1995-96 to Pounds 25bn - the average
expectation of the Treasury's wise men this week - the deficit would be more
than 3 per cent of gross domestic product and so outside the Maastricht
definition of a prudent fiscal stance.
Conversely, it is fair to assume that the chancellor is being advised
against raising taxes further. There are still those inside the Treasury who
worry that past tax increases and those in prospect could bring recovery
grinding to a halt. They will have drawn comfort from this week's report
from the Treasury's panel of wise men which advocated a neutral Budget, in
which existing tax plans would go ahead and that any further changes should
have only a marginal effect.
The scale of the tax increases in the pipeline is impressive. According to
the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the two budgets in 1993
tightened fiscal policy by 3 per cent of gross domestic product per year
until spring 1997.
The present chancellor's first Budget last November is due to increase taxes
in 1995-96 by nearly Pounds 5bn on top of increased charges that were
announced in Mr Lamont's March 1993 Budget. Thus, a married couple with a
mortgage will lose up to Pounds 3.95 a week from next April because of new
restrictions in the married couples' income tax allowance and mortgage
interest relief. These measures will yield Pounds 830m and Pounds 900m
respectively for the government.
Road fuel duties are due to rise by an average of at least 5 per cent a year
in real terms for environmental reasons. This move is due to add Pounds 710m
to government revenues this year and will yield an extra Pounds 1.1bn in
1995-96.
In spite of his liking for cigars, Mr Clarke has committed the government to
increasing tobacco duties by 3 per cent a year in real terms in future
Budgets. This measure to curb smoking will lift government revenues by
Pounds 590m in 1995-96 after garnering an extra Pounds 375m in the current
financial year.
The insurance premium tax and air passenger duties, introduced this autumn,
will provide extra revenues of more than Pounds 1.1bn in their first full
financial year in 1995-96. Also next year, the March 1993 decision to levy
value added tax on fuel and power will have its full impact. The rate is set
to rise to 17.5 per cent in April from 8 per cent at present, lifting
revenues from this source to an estimated Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96 from
Pounds 950m in 1994-95.
On the spending side of the Budget, Mr Clarke has to cut existing spending
totals if he is to maintain the credibility of the government's deficit
reduction programme.
Last November's Budget forecast that underlying inflation - the year-on-year
rise in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments  - would be 3 1/4
per cent in the current quarter. Instead, it fell to a 27-year low of 2 per
cent in September and has been below 3 per cent for 12 months.
This means that the 'control totals' for overall departmental spending in
the current and subsequent financial years will have to be revised
downwards. Otherwise expenditure will rise in real terms and the Budget will
not qualify as 'neutral' in the sense employed by the wise men.
Mr Clarke has always maintained that the control totals of Pounds 251.3bn
for this financial year, Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272.3bn will be
tough to meet. But the IFS, in collaboration with Goldman Sachs, the
US-owned investment bank, has calculated that the 1994-95 control total
should be trimmed to Pounds 247.6bn to be consistent with unchanged real
spending plans. That for 1995-96 should be cut by Pounds 5bn to Pounds
258bn. General government expenditure, which includes elements of social
security expenditure that are affected by the business cycle, should fall
more sharply than the control totals given the strength of Britain's
economic recovery.
Mr Clarke, unlike some of his colleagues, is not hostile to government
spending and is a keen supporter of what he calls the UK's 'great public
services'. But there are powerful arguments for his at least holding
spending plans unchanged in real terms to avoid a loss of credibility on the
financial markets that could trigger a rise in long-term interest rates.
But the constraints imposed by the bond markets, Mr Clarke's self-denying
ordinance on tax cuts and the need to cut nominal public spending totals
should not condemn the chancellor to inactivity. This Budget gives him the
opportunity to reinforce the recovery and attempt to rebuild some of the
feel-good factor that has been absent since the recession of the early
1990s.
If there has been a consistent theme since Mr Clarke became chancellor, it
is that he is in the business of fashioning a recovery that will last and
avoid the boom and bust excesses of past UK upturns.
This has been coupled with an awareness that ordinary people from
backgrounds similar to his own are deeply disturbed by the pace of change in
the global economy. The old certainties such as steady employment and a job
for life no longer exist.
Earlier this year, Mr Clarke delivered the annual Mais lecture to London's
City University Business School. In that, he outlined two areas where the
government needed to make 'much more progress over the next few years'
beyond its existing policy of creating a more flexible labour market.
These were overcoming the fear of change caused by rapid developments in the
market for jobs and 'ensuring that the growth of prosperity is extended to
all, by bringing the disadvantaged into the mainstream of economic life'.
Could this lecture have provided a foretaste in this year's Budget? It is
possible.
After all, Mr Clarke declared that unemployment must be 'the main
pre-occupation of economic policy makers in the 1990s'. He emphasised the
need to raise the standards of general education in Britain - a task that he
described as 'the biggest supply-side challenge facing the British
government'.
He underlined the growing importance of small businesses as creators of
jobs. He extolled the virtues of a strong welfare state in giving a sense of
security to workers in a fast-changing world. He made clear that the
government was seeking to correct the way in which the welfare system
distorts work incentives for the low-paid, and said he was looking at ways
to ensure that the welfare system encourages the unemployed to accept
low-paid work.
Mr Clarke started down this path in his first Budget when he reduced the
lower rates of employers' National Insurance contributions and announced an
allowance for those on family credit to help pay for child care. An
important part of the jobseeker's allowance, announced last month, is to put
the unemployed more in touch with the world of work.
Picking up on these themes, the IFS has suggested improvements to family
credit and housing benefit to help the low-paid. Among proposals from the
wise men this week was a suggestion for taking the lowest paid out of the
National Insurance system.
Such changes to the tax and benefit system are notoriously difficult to put
into practice. But they may offer Mr Clarke the best chance of conjuring up
a 'big theme' for his second Budget day appearance.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Man in the News: Guardian angel slips on halo - Peter
Preston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week ago Mr Peter Preston looked set further to enhance his reputation as
the longest serving editor of a British broadsheet. The Guardian was making
much of the running in stories of the alleged shortcomings of British
(especially Tory) MPs. Two junior ministers, Mr Tim Smith and Mr Neil
Hamilton, had been obliged to resign, though Mr Hamilton is protesting his
innocence by suing the paper.
The Guardian's sights were thus trained on a much bigger target: Mr Jonathan
Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury and a member of the cabinet. Then
the campaign went wrong. The Sunday Telegraph revealed that The Guardian
itself had engaged in a devious practice by making illicit use of House of
Commons writing paper in pursuit of its inquiries.
For a newspaper that sometimes gives the impression of being holier than
thou, this was a serious charge. There was more than a touch of
Schadenfreude, even among The Guardian's admirers.
Mr Preston has admitted in public that he made a mistake: in retrospect, the
digging out of information - and proof - might have been pursued by better
means than purloining somebody else's address. But he is not immensely
apologetic. He thinks that the use of what he euphemistically calls a 'cod
fax' was the best way of taking forward a story that might otherwise have
been abandoned.
In any case, the Aitken affair - which, for want of a better term, is what
it might as well be called - is by no means the deepest hole that Mr Preston
has been in. If you want to touch a raw Preston nerve, ask him about the
Sarah Tisdall affair of 1983. That, in his view, was 'absolutely the worst
thing that ever happened to him as editor'. It undermined his credentials as
a liberal and as a protector of sources.
Official documents from an unknown source had arrived at The Guardian office
giving the date of the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common. At the
time, that was electric news. The ministry of defence and the police wanted
the papers back in order to discover the source. Not knowing the source
himself, Mr Preston capitulated. He walked down to the police station at
Holborn Viaduct with the documents in his pocket, still wondering whether to
tear them up.
The result was that Ms Tisdall, a junior officer at the Foreign Office, was
exposed and sent to prison for six months. Mr Preston says now that he
should have had the documents shredded immediately, while retaining the
information. Had he known how tender the source was, he would have gone to
the stake for her.
There is no doubt that the episode coloured his future approach to
journalism. He became a tougher, more determined editor with something to
prove and possibly a conscience to assuage. Shortly afterwards, he emerged
as an active member of the International Press Institute, which attempts to
foster an independent press around the world.
Well before that, journalism was his way of life. Preston was born in
Leicester in 1938. He suffered from polio at the age of 10 - hence the still
difficult movement of his arms - and his father died from the same disease.
He went to Loughborough Grammar School, then to St John's College, Oxford,
where he read English and edited the university newspaper, Cherwell, though
his name in those days was Pete not Peter.
Entry to the bigger time came with the Liverpool Daily Post where he wrote
half the editorials and helped put the paper to bed. Since then it has been
The Guardian all the way. Mr Preston joined the staff as a political
reporter in 1963. He was education correspondent (a role now occupied by his
son, Ben, at The Times), he wrote a scintillating diary column under the
heading 'Miscellany', he was features editor, then production editor until
1975 when - at the age of 36 - he became editor.
The Guardian was then in a mess: financially weak and seeking to establish
itself in London (foreign news was still handled from its Manchester
birthplace). Mr Preston gradually pulled it together. He was helped by
strikes at The Times. Yet the mid-1980s brought another decline: first the
Tisdall affair, then the birth of The Independent. The editor reckons that
he had to set out to recreate the paper again.
By and large, he succeeded. The Guardian introduced design changes ahead of
other British broadsheets; also a tabloid section to go with the main
newspaper. In terms of innovation it has been an evolutionary leader in the
British industry.
Editorially, pace the parodies of Guardian readers, it is not especially
left-wing, though many of the letters to the editor are. Mr Preston dabbled
in Liberal politics at Oxford; probably his preference now is for social
democracy, or whichever party most reflects it.
Shortly before the 1979 general election the then Sir Geoffrey Howe came up
with the figure that 40 per cent of Guardian readers vote Tory. It was the
sort of remark that perhaps pleased Mr Preston more than some of his staff.
With nearly 20 years of editing behind him, there is no sign of his going,
despite recent events. He cites British editors he has admired. They come
from the tabloid rather than the broadsheet press: Stewart Steven especially
('absolutely ace'), now at the Evening Standard, and Sir David English of
the Daily Mail. But even they, he says, have made spectacular mistakes
because they had so much to do: they lived them down.
Possibly Mr Preston feels lonely. As an editor, he claims, 'you can't have
friends in a normal sense'. For family reasons which go back many years, he
is quite close to Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary whom he asked to
investigate the Aitken affair, 'but we've never been in each other's house'.
The Guardian's inquiries will go on. Mr Preston says he has no idea where
they will lead, but 'you have to throw a stone into the water to see the
ripples . . . you have to keep pushing at the frontiers'. Under sustained
pressure from his wife, Jean, he stopped smoking his ubiquitous pipe at the
end of August. That may explain any shortness of temper.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Government faces snub by building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies are to snub the government by resisting key suggestions
put forward in a Treasury consultation paper for making them more
accountable to the millions of customers who own them.
The paper marked the second stage of a government review of societies'
powers which has been undertaken as part of the deregulation initiative. A
draft response to the Treasury will be discussed at a meeting of the council
of the Building Societies Association on Thursday. It says there is no
shortfall in the arrangements for societies to be responsible to their
members.
In particular it rejects the idea of making societies more accountable
through setting up consultative committees of members or requiring societies
to reserve some board places for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'.
It broadly supports proposals for streamlining the limits on societies'
powers and relaxing the regulatory controls under which they operate.
If ministers accept the association's argument that societies should have
greater freedom without significant changes in accountability, the Treasury
will be open to criticism for giving them an unfair advantage in the retail
financial services sector.
As mutual institutions societies are owned by members rather than being
responsible to shareholders.
Alternatively, the response will set societies on course for a clash with
the government if ministers insist that they must be made more effectively
accountable in return for greater flexibility.
The association's paper does make some small gestures towards greater
accountability, for example by saying that more efforts should be made to
give members clear and easily comprehensible information about their rights.
It rejects suggestions - originally brought forward as another deregulatory
initiative - to reduce the amount of information societies have to send out
to their members, such as the summary financial statement.
But if there seems little movement on accountability, some societies may
respond to the Treasury's signals that the benefits of mutual ownership -
not having to pay dividends to shareholders - should be passed more directly
to society members. Schemes being considered involve handing a share of
profits to members as a 'dividend'.

FT  05 NOV 94 / New home starts rise 12.5% in first nine months of 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Builders started work on 12.5 per cent more new homes in the first nine
months of this year than in the corresponding period last year, figures
published by the Department of the Environment show.
Figures issued yesterday confirm that new homes have been easier to sell
than existing properties while the general housing market has remained flat
for much of the year.
According to the department builders started work on 123,100 homes in the
first nine months, of which 51,800 were started in the three months to the
end of Sep-tember.
This was 13 per cent more than in the corresponding three months last year
but 8 per cent lower than in the three months to the end of June.
After seasonal adjustment, starts for July, August and September would have
be 1 per cent higher than for the previous three months.
Meanwhile, estate agents reported a further fall in business for the second
month running in October, according to a survey published yesterday by the
National Association of Estate Agents.
Almost 60 per cent of the 200 agents questioned reported a further fall in
inquiries and viewings of houses for sale last month. It was the second
month running that the association reported a fall in activity.
Mr Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, the association's chief executive, blamed the
decline on a half percentage-point rise in interest rates in September. He
said a further increase in interest rates would be disastrous.
'The slowdown experienced after the September rise could be described as a
hiccup compared with to the stranglehold that another increase would put on
the property market,' Mr Dunsmore-Hardy said.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Turning the tide for Tyneside jobs: Chris Tighe on the
area's employment prospects after the death of traditional industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interconnection Systems, one of Tyneside's successful businesses, keeps a
list of people wanting to join the company. The list has more than 1,000
names.
The company, Europe's biggest producer of printed circuit boards, is an
interface between the old and new Tynesides. Based in South Tyneside -
Britain's highest unemployment travel-to-work area with nearly one man in
four jobless - it has been recruiting men from Tyneside's last, now closed,
coal mine and its last, dying, shipbuilder to join a workforce of 850.
Among the lucky ones is Mr George Cook from Jarrow, a former Swan Hunter
boilermaker. Mr Cook is delighted with his new job after 19 years in
shipbuilding - the production-line work is clean and his weekly flat wage
for a permanent night shift is Pounds 250 gross, Pounds 31 more than at
Swans.
But, he says, some former Swans recruits at the company would return to
shipbuilding tomorrow for the companionship it offered. Tyneside's
traditional industries also once offered regular wages for men, a sense of
identity and a formidable world role.
David Dougan wrote in his History of North East Shipbuilding: 'The labour
flowed in and the work flowed out and the north-east became just about the
richest part of the richest country in the world.' The problem for Tyneside
is that this description was of the last quarter of the 19th century.
Between 1970 and 1990 Tyne and Wear, a county with a labour force of
523,000, lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs - half the total - and 25,000, of
its primary jobs - two-thirds - mostly in mining and energy. It gained
50,000 service sector jobs. Today, its proportion of manufacturing
employment is slightly below the national average.
According to a recent Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit report
mid-1990s prospects for the county's manufacturing sector, underpinned by a
growing motor industry centred on Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant,
look good. But it warns of 'much more problematical' prospects beyond then
and predicts some decline in manufacturing employment due to strong
productivity growth.
Inward investment has been vital in diversifying the local economy and
offsetting the decline of traditional industries. Indigenous Tyne and Wear
companies are also strong performers in world export markets.
Yet in spite of decades of effort, Tyne and Wear still has the fourth
highest county unemployment rate in mainland Britain with 65,413 people  -
12 per cent - unemployed.
The loss of Swan Hunter and probably of shipbuilding compounds other
worrying trends.
Other cornerstones of the Tyneside economy - turbine generator maker
Parsons, tank builder Vickers, Northern Electric and British Gas - have all
recently announced significant redundancies.
Professor John Goddard, head of Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and
Regional Development Studies, said: 'What is particularly worrying about the
present time is that the job losses are in the managerial, professional, R &amp;
D area.'
In a region already deficient in substantial locally controlled companies,
Newcastle, the north-east's capital, has also suffered a spate of losses of
regional offices to the Leeds area.
Prof Goddard said big companies and decision-makers in a local economy were
vital to the success of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Tyne and Wear is also having to fight to improve low levels of
entrepreneurship and low post-16 rates of staying in education - both
legacies of its heavy-industrial past.
Mr Ian Taylor, Tyne and Wear sponsor minister, estimates the number of new
jobs created locally by SMEs, high technology companies and inward investors
is equalling the losses in long-established companies, but he adds: 'They
aren't equal in terms of job function.'
For many former Swans employees this means that they are job-hunting house
husbands while their wives go out to work.
'It's total role reversal,' says 38-year-old Mr Graham Gibson, whose typist
wife works a six-day week in two jobs. A former blacksmith who worked his
way up to an operations control job at Swans, Mr Gibson was made redundant
after receivership.
He tries to maintain his morale while seeking full-time work - 50p saunas
for the jobless and spending more time with his children have been the
pluses of being out of work.
And he is now a better qualified unemployment statistic, thanks to a college
computer course. 'I can do CVs for other lads now on my word processor,' he
said.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Tory car-boot gift for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative officials in Lancashire face possible prosecution under data
protection legislation after confidential files about company donations
found their way to a car-boot sale and ended up in the hands of the Labour
party.
The episode has embarrassed the party locally and put a question mark over
efforts by Conservative Central Office to ensure local constituency
associations take proper measures to safeguard computer data.
The early Christmas present to Labour is believed to have come about after a
personal computer was discarded from the Ormskirk offices of the West
Lancashire Conservative Association in a spring-clean after the 1992 general
election. The computer ended up in a car-boot sale where it was bought for
Pounds 20 by an electronics enthusiast.
He discovered that software in the computer contained details of cash gifts
to the Tories from local companies, with canvassing returns related to the
political opinions of the 70,000 people on the electoral register in the
West Lancashire constituency.
Mr Barry Gannaway-Jones, vice-president of the West Lancashire Conservative
Association, said: 'I am very annoyed. I want to find out exactly who was
responsible.'
Mr Frank McKenna, the Labour agent for the constituency, said: 'This seems
to be a cock-up of the highest level. I'm particularly interested in the
data about company donations and hope I will get to see the information in
the near future.'
Lancashire police said yesterday they would be passing a file on the issue
to the Office of the Data Protection Registrar, which is empowered under the
1984 Data Protection Act to take action against groups that fail to take
proper care of confidential computer data.

FT  05 NOV 94 / PO management declares battle against status quo: Andrew
Adonis talks to the chief executive about his determined drive for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's outspoken chief executive, vowed
yesterday to strike hard at the Treasury to gain greater commercial freedom
for the Royal Mail in spite of the collapse at Thursday's cabinet meeting of
plans to privatise the industry
'We're fighters not quitters,' the ebullient Mr Cockburn said of himself and
his senior management. He dismissed out of hand calls for him and to stand
down because of the high profile he and Mr Michael Heron, the Post Office
chairman, had taken in Mr Michael Heseltine's campaign to win over Tory
backbenchers to the cause of privatisation.
Mr Cockburn is determined to sustain momentum behind the current Post Office
review and to gain the Royal Mail greater commercial freedom. He wants in
particular to slash the levy - estimated at Pounds 213m next year - which
the Post Office has to pay the Treasury out of its profits.
Anxious that the status quo should not become the inevitable consequence of
continued inertia - as some on the Tory right might like, to prove they were
right about privatisation - Mr Cockburn cited the government's July green
paper, which came out in support of selling off 51 per cent of the Royal
Mail but also listed areas where greater commercial freedom could be given
if the Post Office remained in the public sector.
Mr Cockburn said: 'We urgently need to squeeze as much juice as we can out
of those bits of the green paper, on a case by case basis. Slow decline need
not be the consequence of the decision to drop privatisation, but it will be
unless we make real headway on this.'
With pre-tax profits last year running at Pounds 306m, the Treasury levy
takes the lion's share of the Post Office's spare cash. The levy has been
rising sharply - up from Pounds 182m last year to Pounds 226m this year.
Mr Cockburn said: 'This can't continue. We will be saying to the government:
'If you bleed us white, we will not be able to deliver a first class postal
service.' That must mean leaving us with more of our profits to re-invest.'
He pointed to a green paper paragraph which states that even if the Post
Office remains in the public sector, its existing Treasury levy could be
'effectively set as a dividend in relation to prospective profitability'.
Since the levy is about twice as large as a reasonable dividend payment,
that implies a cut of about half for next year, leaving the Post Office with
about Pounds 100m extra for investment.
Mr Cockburn will have no difficulty spending the extra cash. 'We are
planning to invest around Pounds 350m in the coming year, but to keep our
existing service modern - with better sorting facilities and the like - we
need to be investing between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m more.'
Talks with Mr Heseltine and the Treasury start in earnest in the next few
weeks. Mr Cockburn will be citing two other suggestions in the green paper:
That the Post Office could be freed from its overall capital spending limit.
That the existing efficiency target for Royal Mail could be replaced by a
direct control on prices, allowing the business to keep more of the gains
from greater efficiency - although in practice price restraints would be
bound to follow unexpected efficiency gains.
Gaining greater control of money is only one of the changes sought by Mr
Cockburn. He sees freedom to engage in joint ventures, and to develop new
lines of business, as equally vital.
He said: 'We are not saying we want to set up a chain of Royal Mail ice
cream shops but we do need to be able to move into other areas of the
communications industry, and have to be allowed to make purchases and forge
joint ventures, on a case by case basis.'
Some of the new activities envisaged by Mr Cockburn are core even to the
existing mail business, such as trunk airline distribution systems to
deliver international mail more efficiently. Others concern new
communications technologies, notably electronic mail and printing systems
enabling the Royal Mail to take on combined printing and delivery contracts
for the corporate sector.
Mr Cockburn cites the example of Sweden Post, the state-owned Swedish post
office, which has bought concerns engaged in the electronic mail field. 'We
must be able to provide our customers with a one-stop shop service, and be
allowed to get into the new communications world.'
For Mr Cockburn the progress of British Telecommunications is ever more
galling. Barely a week passes without BT, which used to be part of the old
Post Office, announcing a joint venture or an international scheme. By
contrast the Royal Mail still needs government approval for all investments
of more than Pounds 20m.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Rover to boost parts purchasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group, the leading UK carmaker, is to increase the value of its
components purchases by Pounds 500m or 18 per cent next year to Pounds
3.25bn, Mr John Towers, chief executive, said yesterday.
The group, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, is expected to raise production
significantly next year as a result of rising sales and several new model
launches.
UK suppliers will benefit most, as they account for about 80 per cent of
Rover's components purchases, which will total Pounds 2.75bn this year.
Last month the company said it was creating 1,450 jobs at its British plants
in response to rising sales, in particular in export markets.
Next year it will launch replacements for its 200/400 range as well as a new
range of MG sportscars as part of its five-year, Pounds 1.5bn investment
programme.
Rover increased production 16 per cent in the first nine months this year to
355,860 from 306,198 in the same period a year ago.
Output for the full year is expected to rise to about 492,000 from 430,200
last year. Mr Towers forecast recently that production would rise
significantly above 500,000 next year.
Rover is continuing to rationalise its supplier base. It has already reduced
the number from about 2,000 in 1989 to 700.
About 360 core suppliers account for 75 per cent of Rover's purchases. The
company said yesterday that it was seeking to reduce the number of its
suppliers to 360 in the next three years.

FT  05 NOV 94 / More than one way to skin a public-sector cat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cabinet's refusal to back Mr Michael Heseltine's plan to sell parts of
the Post Office has prompted a widespread view at Westminster that 15 years
of Conservative commitment to privatisation are over.
Not everyone agrees. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, was among the powerful
figures arguing yesterday against the view that the government no longer has
the stomach to force contentious privatisations through an unwilling
parliament.
But others pointed out that the question might not matter. For one thing
there is little left to privatise, for another, the government has developed
equally powerful and less controversial ways of changing the delivery of
services.
Mr Daniel Finkelstein, director of the Social Market Foundation think-tank,
said: 'The heroic phase of privatisations is over, but a gradualist phase
which could ultimately be more radical and have more profound implications
has begun. In terms of privatisation policy, power is passing from the
Leninists to the Fabians.'
Most of the big privatisations have already happened. In 21 large sales,
starting with the first tranche of BP shares in 1979, the government has
disposed of most of the big public-sector companies and utilities inherited
from Labour.
According to the Treasury more than 50 enterprises remain in public
ownership. But most are either arms of bureaucracy, such as the Central
Office of Information, or scheduled for privatisation, such as British Coal
and the railway companies.
Few straightforward businesses remain. The BBC, Channel Four, and a number
of local authority airports and transport companies could eventually be
candidates for privatisation.
But ministers have for several years been moving towards a successor policy
to old-style privatisation, based on introducing competition to services
which continue to be provided by the public sector. There are three main
elements:
Agencies. At the last count 99 agencies covering 350,000 civil servants had
been set up under the Next Steps programme, launched by Baroness Thatcher in
1988. They range from the social security benefits agency, with 65,000
staff, to the Wilton Park conference centre in Sussex, which employs 30.
The agencies cover activities as diverse as weather forecasting, issuing
passports, and support services for the armed forces. Ministers have
identified a further 67 candidates for agency status, covering another
96,000 civil servants.
Contracting out. Under the market testing programme a range of government
activities are put out to competitive tender. Public-sector units are
allowed to compete, but often lose to more street-wise private companies.
The government's latest market testing bulletin, aimed at potential
private-sector bidders, lists 59 contracts awarded by tender, ranging from
payroll services for the Overseas Development Administration to computer
maintenance for the recruitment and assesment services unit.
A further 72 contracts are being advertised, and ministers have set out a
future programme covering activities as diverse as the agriculture
ministry's reprographic services and the Queen's Flight.
Private finance initiative. Launched by Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, the initiative has attracted only Pounds 500m of private capital
into public projects since 1992, mainly because of uncertainty about rates
of return.
But there is mounting feeling in Whitehall that the scheme is gathering
momentum. A Pounds 150m computer system to hold records on National
Insurance contributors will be the first project of its kind to be funded
through the initiative.

FT  05 NOV 94 / MPs split on week's damage to Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers were sharply divided yesterday over the impact of this
week's Post Office retreat on Mr John Major's personal standing.
Some rightwingers declared openly that the climbdown had further undermined
the prime minister's authority.
Others joined the rebels who blocked the privatisation plans in suggesting
that ministers could yet turn the situation to the government's advantage.
Some MPs felt that Mr Major's handling of the recent sleaze allegations had
been much more damaging.
Mr Bill Walker, MP for Tayside North, said the situation after the climbdown
was 'desperately serious. It is much more serious than just a loss of face -
it will affect party morale and party determination'.
He added: 'It hits right at the heart of what our policy has been in all our
years in government. Either we believe in what we do or we don't'
Asked whether he thought the retreat had increased the chance of a challenge
to Mr Major's leadership next year Mr Walker said: 'It has undermined the
prime minister's authority and the authority of the cabinet. That can only
lead to demands for change.'
Another rightwinger predicted that if the party was still 'on the shoots' in
six to 10 months backbenchers would start panicking. In such circumstances a
new man might 'strike a chord' with the public.
Sir Keith Speed, MP for Ashford, who opposed the planned privatisation, said
he thought the government could 'turn this into a very positive thing
indeed'. He said: 'I don't take the view that this is yet another nail in
(Mr Major's) coffin. I don't actually think it weakens him at all.'
Mr Richard Shepherd, the Euro-sceptic MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said the
prime minister should be 'more relaxed' about the climbdown. 'I think he can
make a virtue of it.'
But he said the handling of the recent allegations of ministerial
impropriety had prompted 'grave doubts' about Mr Major's standing in some
parts of the party.

FT  05 NOV 94 / NUT seeks talks to avoid continued tests boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Teachers said yesterday that it would continue its
boycott of national curriculum tests in England and Wales for a third year.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said a survey revealed strong opposition
to the measures announced in September by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
education secretary. But he asked for talks with Mrs Shephard to end the
boycott.
All three of the main teachers' unions refused to oversee tests for
14-year-olds when they were introduced in 1993. The NUT was the only union
to continue its action earlier this year.
The survey, which covered NUT members in schools which must administer the
tests, found that 84.4 per cent of respondents disagreed with Mrs Shephard's
claim that the tests would 'reinforce teachers' professionalism'.
More than 90 per cent rejected her package of improvements, which included
allowing for tests to be administered by external markers, saying it had not
met their central concerns.
The NUT found strong opposition to the use of test results for publishing
'league tables' of schools' performance. Turn-outs among members affected
was 25.4 per cent.
Mr McAvoy made it clear that he hoped to end the boycott after talking to
Mrs Shephard. He said: 'She has a political imperative and we have an
educational imperative. It might be possible to get the two together.'
Other teachers' unions doubted whether the NUT's stance could withstand a
legal challenge.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers will next week advise its members
that they can continue to boycott statutory assessments linked to the
curriculum only if they create 'unreasonable' workloads.
It advised teachers that this would increase the risk of action from
employers, including withholding salaries. It wants members to administer
the tests and report their results, and says boycotting them for educational
reasons alone would be illegal.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Franchise plan for BBC proposed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The BBC should franchise future commercial activities to a private-sector
operator, the Independent Television Commission, the television watchdog,
said yesterday in its response to the government's white paper on the BBC's
future, Diane Summers writes.
The ITC said it believed that the BBC, as a publicly-funded broadcaster, was
'not in a position to balance successfully the mixed cultures of public
service broadcasting and commercial business enterprise'.
The BBC should concentrate on providing public service radio and television,
financed by the licence fee, to UK audiences. Licence fee income should not
be risked on new business ventures, for 'licence payers are not
shareholders, nor would they enjoy the rights of shareholders'.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Royal Mail flouts pay freeze with 3.4% offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's postal workers have been offered a 2.8 per cent pay rise by the
Post Office from November 1 which will rise to 3.4 per cent from January 1
in a clear breach of the government's three-year public-sector pay bill
freeze.
The Royal Mail described the deal yesterday as a 'reasonable settlement
within the government's public-sector pay guidelines'. But the proposed wage
settlement will add about Pounds 61m to the Post Office's current pay bill,
a 2.7 per cent increase in a full year.
The Union of Communication Workers is balloting its 160,000 members at the
Post Office with a recommendation for them to accept the offer. The Post
Office said it was made up of a 2.5 per cent increase on basic rates plus
0.3 per cent for past productivity improvements.
A Pounds 1.50 a week supplement is to be consolidated into basic pay from
January 1, adding a further 0.6 per cent to earnings. This will mean a total
pensionable pay rise of 3.4 per cent for postmen and women.
Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said in a letter sent to his
union's officers yesterday that the offer was 'by far the best negotiated
settlement in the public sector' achieved by any group of workers this year
and 'as far as the Royal Mail deals are concerned, it is the biggest
increase over inflation in recent years'.
Mr Chris Trinder, head of the independent Public Policy Foundation, said:
'It looks as though the government has turned a blind eye to their own pay
guidelines in letting this offer through. Ministers appear to have drawn a
lesson from the rail signalworkers' dispute and decided not to interfere.'
The proposed pay deal does not exclude any further increases that the union
UCW might be able to negotiate with the Post Office over productivity
improvements in the period to next October, when the current agreement will
end.
Mr Johnson has told his officials: 'There are no strings or conditions
attached and acceptance of this deal will allow both sides to return to the
negotiating table to discuss the union's separate claim on hours of work,
job security and productivity.'
Last week firefighters were awarded a 2.2 per cent pay rise in line with
their wage formula, index-linked to the upper quartile of male manual
earnings.
The police have received at least 3 per cent under their wage formula while
the civil service has had increases of less than 2 per cent. Bank of England
staff have secured increases of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent but these
have all been self-financing.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Hurd attacks media 'culture of criticism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday launched an outspoken
attack on declining standards in the media as the government sought to fight
back against allegations of impropriety swirling around Conservative MPs.
Mr Hurd, the cabinet's elder statesman, threw his weight solidly behind Mr
Jonathan Aitken, the embattled chief secretary to the Treasury, warning that
media standards were slipping fast.
His comments coincided with a tough statement from the Association of
British Editors complaining of 'threats and increasingly intemperate
attacks' by ministers.
The association, which represents national and regional newspapers and
magazines, called on editors to continue to throw more light on the workings
of the government.
Speaking to Conservatives in Perth, Mr Hurd accused journalists of hunting
in packs and developing a 'culture of criticism' in which achievements were
unsung or distorted.
Arguing that the media was the British institution that had 'deteriorated
fastest' in recent years, he said there was 'too little independent
judgment, too little objective description'.
In a direct reference to the methods used by The Guardian to uncover details
of Mr Aitken's stay at the Ritz hotel in Paris, owned by Mr Mohamad Fayed,
he asked: 'Is it a brave defence of our liberties for an editor to authorise
the faking of a House of Commons crest through a fax machine? Is it a
fearless blow for truth when a journalist forges the signature of a civil
servant to get what he wants?'
Mr Hurd's robust condemnation of media standards underlines concern among
senior ministers about the impact of the stream of sleaze allegations on the
government's standing.
Mr Hurd warned MPs to remain 'above approach,' and conceded that the
government would have to join the debate initiated by the Nolan committee on
standards of behaviour in public life.
'Personally I have no difficulty with the idea that MPs should be part-time
farmers, lawyers or businessmen. It enriches the contribution which the MP
makes,' he said.
'But his prime responsbility must be to represent his own convictions in the
interests of his constituents, not to act on the interests of those who pay
him an additional, extra-Parliamentary, salary. We in public life must be,
and be seen to be, above reproach.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Nigerian appeal court grants bail to Abiola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's court of appeal yesterday granted unconditional bail to Mr Moshood
Abiola, the winner of last year's annulled presidential election, who has
been detained by the military regime on charges of treason for declaring
himself president in June.
The ruling offers an unexpected release for Mr Abiola until the resumption
of a trial which has been stalled since September.
'I am optimistic that he is going to be released and we are expecting him
home very soon,' his wife, Mrs Kudirat Abiola, said in Lagos yesterday. 'The
ruling shows that we can still have faith in the judiciary.'
Mr Abiola's doctor met officials from Gen Sani Abacha's government in Abuja,
where he is being held, to discuss his release, which could allow him to
travel to Europe for medical treatment, Mrs Abiola said .
Although the appeal court ruling appears to be a reverse for the government,
the decision may provide a convenient way out of political deadlock for both
sides.
Since the government saw off a strike by the powerful oil workers' union two
months ago, the pro-democracy movement has collapsed, even in Mr Abiola's
native south-west, leaving him in jail and without support.
A freed Mr Abiola inside Nigeria would be an embarrassment to the military,
but they would be less concerned if he were abroad. According to the
Nigerian medical association, Mr Abiola suffers from chronic high blood
pressure and has suffered a back injury in jail and needs to be released for
treatment.
'His health has been deteriorating. The treatment which he needs is not
available in Nigeria,' Mrs Abiola said. 'He will have to go abroad. We have
a list of hospitals in Europe and I am sure that the government will allow
him to travel.'
In August Mr Abiola refused bail that was offered on condition that he
avoided any political activity.
The appeal court did not impose conditions for Mr Abiola's bail but advised
him against causing any civil disturbance while out.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Japan grapples with law of the gun: A string of violent
crimes has shaken citizens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Repeated screenings on national news programmes of the blood-stained Aomono
Yokocho train station in south Tokyo where Dr Takejiro Okazaki was
apparently gunned down by a former patient last week have reminded viewers
that Japan may not be as safe as they imagine.
Japan has long prided itself on the safety of its streets and the
reliability of its police force, if not to halt crime then at least to
contain it in certain neighbourhoods. However, a string of violent crimes
against citizens, such as the murder of Dr Okazaki, has shaken confidence in
the force's abilities.
The branch manager of Sumitomo Bank in Nagoya, the president of a video
distribution company in Kyoto and the head of a toy company in Tokyo are
among a growing list of victims of fatal attacks this year. What has
particularly shocked the public is that more crimes are being committed with
guns.
The murder of Dr Okazaki sent a strong message to citizens that gun use is
more widespread than most had suspected. According to the national police,
1,672 guns were confiscated last year, 73 per cent more than the 963 weapons
taken by police three years earlier.
The rising number of gun-related crimes in Japan is widely seen as a
consequence of several factors combining to ease access to weapons: the
country's growing internationalisation; the ripple effects of the collapse
of the former Soviet Union; and the greater pressures Japan's gangsters are
feeling in the face of a police crackdown and the burst of the bubble
economy.
'The illegal spread of guns is a key result of internationalisation,' the
National Police Agency recently claimed. One new source of firearms, for
example, has been the growing number of ships carrying Russian tourists and
businessmen.
Prof Kazuo Shimada, of the sociology department at Kawamura Gakuen Women's
University, points out that these ships and others from China and Taiwan are
used as a channel for illegal imports, including guns. The arms are believed
to be offloaded at sea, rather than after the ship has docked, thus making
it difficult for Japanese police to stop the trade.
'Japanese society is feeling the after-effects of the collapse of the former
Soviet Union and the end of the cold war,' he says. Many of the guns coming
into Japan belonged to Russian soldiers who no longer have a use for them.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such external changes would have opened
Japan's doors to so many guns and increased gun-related violence if it were
not for the profound social changes taking place within Japan in the
aftermath of the rapid economic growth seen in the late 1980s.
The economic slowdown afflicting corporate Japan has hurt the underworld as
well. Gangsters, who had mostly confined violent crime to the underworld,
are turning to violence against the man in the street and selling firearms
to raise cash.
According to the police, the last time there was a surge in gun smuggling
was in 1984, when demand soared as two gangs fought for supremacy. But the
recent introduction of an anti-gangster law has made it increasingly
difficult for criminals to make a living from such traditional sources as
prostitution and protection rackets.
Recent murders of company executives and bankers, for example, are widely
believed to have been carried out by gangsters unable to extort money from
them, as they would have done a few years ago.
Meanwhile, more gangsters are leaving the underworld as existence there
becomes less easy. But their attempts to start a new life have triggered
violent responses from gangs, Prof Shimada says.
More worrying is the fact that the crime gangs' financial woes are forcing
them to sell guns to citizens to make ends meet.
For example, police have arrested a gangster for selling a Russian-made
Tokarev pistol and seven bullets for Y1.4m (Pounds 8,900) to the man accused
of shooting Dr Okazaki. In the past, gangsters would not have sold guns to
citizens, Prof Shimada notes.
The number of guns confiscated from non-gangsters increased more than
tenfold from 45 in 1990 to 476 last year. In response, the National Police
Agency designated October as an anti-gangster and gun control month.
'The two pillars of Japan's gun policy should be to cut off supplies from
overseas and eradicate illegal ownership of guns within Japan,' the agency
says. 'Gun control is crucial in securing the safety of this country.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Resolution of HK airport row near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The end to Hong Kong's protracted dispute with China over the financing of
the colony's HKDollars 158bn (Pounds 12.6bn) airport project appears in
sight after Britain and China signed an agreement yesterday which finally
settled the financial structure of the project.
The Hong Kong government was hopeful last night that China would approve the
final details of the financial plan, possibly as early as next week. Sir
Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said he was 'enthusiastic'
to build on yesterday's agreement in talks which resume on Wednesday.
The dispute over financing surfaced in late 1989 when the Hong Kong
government said it would push ahead with the project in an effort to boost
confidence in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. China,
which never recognised the need to boost confidence, objected to the cost of
the project from the outset.
Yesterday's accord has cleared the way for the government to approach the
Legislative Council for HKDollars 23bn of equity finance for the airport
railway. It plans to begin this process next Friday.
However, the agreement fell short of being comprehensive, as China wished to
deal separately with two ancillary agreements between the government and the
corporations building the airport and the railway. These will allow the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) and the soon-to-be incorporated Airport
Authority to approach financial markets to borrow up to a further HKDollars
23bn.
According to yesterday's joint statement China understood the importance of
these accords, known as financial support agreements, and undertook to give
its assent as soon as possible. It was hoped that the MTRC's support
agreement could be settled next week.
It is important for the MTRC that an accord is reached soon. It has been
largely absent from public bond markets for the past two years.
The long-running dispute over finance has not materially delayed the
project. Over the past three years the government has awarded 73
construction contracts worth HKDollars 53bn for works related to the airport
and its ancillary projects. In all, 11,000 people are employed by the
project.
Sir Hamish said the government would endeavour to complete as much of the
airport and its railway as possible before British rule ceased in mid-1997.
As part of yesterday's agreement it undertook to review timing and financing
of the project with China during the second half of 1996.

FT  05 NOV 94 / US Mid-term Elections (November 8): Republicans ride the
Tennessee bandwagon - Incumbents are feeling the winds of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tennessee has been one of the US boom states of the last 15 years, a magnet
for Japanese investment and a centre for fast-growing healthcare companies.
The unemployment rate is 4.7 per cent and falling. But you would not know it
from the mood of many of the state's voters, who are threatening to take out
their annoyance on incumbent politicians in Tuesday's elections.
'Incumbents are just not getting the job done,' complains Mr Tom Brewer, a
Nashville bus driver.
'It's anti-incumbent, anti-Washington, anti-Clinton, anti-Hillary Clinton,
frankly. . . sort of an anti-mood, really,' says Mr Will Long, who chairs
the local Republican party in the Nashville area.
Anti-incumbency seems to be taking its toll at all levels of government. 'We
had one sheriff in for 12 years. When he came out he had three or four farms
and when he went in he didn't have a thing, so we don't need him any more,'
says Mr James Gwin, a barber in Camden, just west of the Tennessee river.
But the most prominent victim could be at the top of the ticket: Democratic
Senator Jim Sasser.
After 18 years in office, Mr Sasser chairs the Senate budget committee and
is widely expected to succeed retiring Senator George Mitchell as leader of
the Senate Democratic majority in the next Congress - if the Democrats hold
the majority and if he can win re-election against Mr Bill Frist, a heart
surgeon and political neophyte.
Both Tennessee's Senate seats are up for election this year, but everyone
expected the Republicans to concentrate their efforts and their strongest
candidates on the race to fill the remainder of the term arising from Mr Al
Gore's switch to vice-president.
Sure enough, Republican Fred Thompson appears to hold a lead over
Congressman Jim Cooper, the Democratic candidate. But Mr Frist has surprised
most by eating away at Mr Sasser's candidacy, and a Mason-Dixon poll
released this week showed him ahead for the first time, by the slender
margin of 44 per cent to 42 per cent.
Like many other states in the south, Tennessee has seen a revival of the
Republican party, which since the civil war had been frozen out of political
office.
But as the old style right-wing southern Democrat dies off, Republicans have
been making inroads, even in county courthouse elections.
'I don't think the label is going to hurt you that bad any more,' says Mr
Bennie Castleman, who believes he is only the second Republican commissioner
elected in the last 100 years in Weakley County, north-west Tennessee.
'The south one day will be Republican, there's no doubt in my mind. When it
will be, I don't know.'
Tennessee is not a purely southern state. Its eastern counties, and some
areas in the west of the state, joined the Union in the civil war and have
continued to vote Republican ever since. That offered the Republicans some
of their first advances in the south, and in the 1970s Governor Winfield
Dunn and both US senators were Republicans.
'Tennessee has been historically Democrat-controlled for so long that the
change didn't take, but people are ready for it now and they are organised
well,' says former Governor Dunn.
'We're a border state and neither party has a clear majority. They vote for
the person and that's the way it ought to be,' says Governor Ned McWherter,
the popular politician who defeated Mr Dunn in 1986 and who is retiring at
the end of this year.
Mr Sasser is fighting back with some old-fashioned politics, combining
virulent mockery of his opponent with unabashed pork barrel promises.
Warning farmers that next year is likely to see an overhaul of agricultural
laws, Mr Sasser jeers that 'the closest place Dr Frist ever got to a farm is
the 18th hole of the Bellevue country club'.
And he touts the advantages to the state of having the majority leader,
promising that, with his help, a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) wind tunnel
that the government plans to build will come to Tullahoma, near Chattanooga.
The mudslinging in the campaign has had its creative side. The Sasser
campaign's Hallowe'en party was enlivened by Mr Frist's admission that as a
medical student he had adopted cats from the local stray animals' home for
his experiments.
All the signs are that Mr Sasser, after a slow start, is now getting into
his stride. Heavy participation in early absentee voting - an estimated 12
per cent of registered voters have already cast their ballots in the
Nashville area, and in rural Benton county, just west of the Tennessee
river, the level is closer to 20 per cent - suggests turnout will be high.
'I think it'll be a big vote statewide, and a big vote means one thing -
advantage to the incumbent,' says Mr Jerry Phifer, former sheriff of Benton
County. But it may be too late to stop a bandwagon that seems likely to
carry a lot of southern Republicans into office.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Greyhound's buses near end of the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Like chewing gum, jeans and Coca-Cola, Greyhound Lines is an American icon.
For decades its silver and blue buses have criss-crossed the vast open
spaces of the US, linking small towns with the big cities and providing an
evocative backdrop to scenes of meeting and parting in countless Hollywood
movies.
The buses, however, may not be around much longer. Greyhound is on its
knees: on Wednesday a group of disgruntled creditors filed a petition in a
Dallas court seeking to force the loss-battered company into bankruptcy.
In one sense Greyhound's troubles are a bit of a puzzle. As the only
nationwide provider of long-distance bus services in the US, it enjoys an
enviable niche. It serves more than 2,600 destinations with a fleet of 1,987
vehicles, and collected Dollars 666m (Pounds 406m) in revenues last year.
But Greyhound has been struggling for years. Even bankruptcy would be
nothing new to the company; it only emerged from its last reorganisation in
October 1991 after spending a year protected from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
Born in rural Minnesota 80 years ago, Greyhound had its heyday in the 1940s
and 1950s, when it accounted for nearly half the journeys made between US
cities. But like bus operators all over the developed world, it began to
suffer a decline in patronage as levels of car ownership rose.
Cheap petrol, making car journeys an economical alternative to bus travel,
exacerbated its difficulties. But its problems multiplied in 1978 when the
US deregulated its airline industry, introducing an era of fare wars between
rival airlines on domestic routes and putting air travel within the means of
the less well-off.
Under pressure from airline competition, annual passenger mileage slumped
from more than 10bn in 1981 to 6bn in 1986. Drivers took a 25 per cent pay
cut to help get fares down and keep Greyhound going. But the parent company,
since renamed Greyhound Dial, saw no future in the bus business and sold it
off to a buy-out team in 1987 for Dollars 350m.
The new management turned Greyhound Lines inside out, stripping away layers
of management, slashing fares, launching aggressive marketing campaigns and
investing heavily in the refurbishment of run-down city centre bus stations.
The changes began to pay off, bringing traffic back to 7.5bn passenger miles
in 1989. But under continuing pressure to cut costs, the management fell
into a wage dispute with its drivers.
The dispute was to turn into one of the bitterest and most violent strikes
in US labour history. Although Greyhound kept going, using replacement
drivers, many of its buses were shot at. This proved unpopular with
passengers, and the resulting decline in traffic took Greyhound into
bankruptcy in June 1990.
The Greyhound that emerged from Chapter 11 protection in October the
following year was leaner and fitter. It even made small profits in 1992 and
the first half of 1993. But a fresh bout of fare-cutting by airlines and the
disastrous introduction of a computer reservation system that did not work
sent Greyhound tumbling into losses again.
Three months ago Greyhound announced plans for a transformation that would
end its traditional role as a nationwide long-distance bus operator and turn
it into a regional operator of inter-city services on a small number of busy
routes in the south, north-east and the industrial mid-west.
But the plan has come too late. The company has run out of cash, and some of
its creditors, angered by the terms of a proposed restructuring, are seeking
to put it into bankruptcy again rather than swallow what they see as a raw
deal.
Would Greyhound be missed? Arguably not. Greyhound has always been best
loved by those who do not have to use it: its inner city bus stations are
reputed to be among the most dangerous places on earth, the buses themselves
make few concessions to comfort, and it is a condition of carriage that you
have to endure the life story of the person sitting next to you.
Even so, if it goes, many will feel a piece of America will go with it.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Coleman hardens support in Virginia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marshall Coleman, the independent candidate in Virginia who was expected
to draw votes away from Mr Oliver North, the Republican, is now inflicting
more damage on Senator Charles Robb, the Democratic incumbent, according to
two new state polls.
The surveys both had Mr Robb in the lead, but by statistically insignificant
margins.
Both found that Mr Coleman, a former Republican lieutenant-governor and, on
most issues, an orthodox conservative, was hurting Mr Robb nearly twice as
much as he was Mr North. The director of one of the polls said Mr Coleman's
support was hardening and his campaign manager even predicted a surprise on
Tuesday.
Mr Coleman appears to have scored by emphasising the character defects of
both party candidates - Mr North for his involvement in the Iran-Contra
affair and Mr Robb for his admitted personal infidelities. But Mr North's
adoring hardcore right-wing support, while not constituting a majority,
appears solid and may be understated by a few percentage points, whereas the
senator's is notoriously soft.
Meanwhile, another keenly watched Senate race - in California between
Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Congressman Michael Huffington - has
taken a new twist following reports that the senator may have hired an
illegal immigrant as household help.
Mr Huffington, who has already confessed to the same offence, rushed out a
TV commercial claiming Ms Feinstein had 'flat out lied' in denying she had
done the same. But the Immigration and Naturalisation Service came to her
aid by saying the report appeared to be based on a case of mistaken
identity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government yesterday gave more teeth to the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), its stock-market watchdog, by announcing
regulations intended to provide greater transparency during substantial
acquisitions of shares and takeovers.
Under the new rules, any investor holding or acquiring 5 per cent of a
company will have to make one-off disclosures to stock exchanges where the
shares being purchased are listed. Those with 10 per cent holdings will have
to make half-yearly disclosures.
Those intending to acquire 20 per cent of a target company may be required
to make a public announcement .
Officials said the regulations would provide trigger points for disclosure,
while giving the board more power to supervise takeovers and acquisitions in
a newly liberalised economy.
The exchange board was set up in 1992 amid the chaos that followed the
multi-million-dollar stock market scandal in Bombay, the country's largest
exchange.
Bankers and stockbrokers colluded to use inside information and money
illegally diverted from interbank securities to play on Bombay's then
overheated stock market. News of the scandal sent share prices diving, and
challenged the credibility of Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government.
In the first few months after it was set up, decisions taken by the
securities board, such as the introduction of brokers' fees in November
1992, met resentment and countrywide strikes. In March 1993 a row erupted
between the Bombay stock exchange and the board over the SEBI's first
inspection of stockbrokers' books.
Brokers complained of its heavy handedness, and said it would stifle growth.
But the Finance Ministry was determined to make the board more powerful to
avoid yet another scandal erupting.
The board proved it had come into its own when it banned the age-old
practice of badla, or carry-forward trading on the stock exchange, in 1993.
Under the badla system, brokers and buyers could carry outstanding purchases
from one settlement period to the next without paying for them in full, and
so acquire large volumes of shares with relatively little money.
The informal forward market, which accounted for 70-90 per cent of all
transactions before the ban was imposed, allowed for liquidity of cash in
the market, with buyers and sellers always able to strike a deal at any
price. But the practice encouraged speculation and stunted growth of the
Indian stock markets, some of which are older than developed countries'
exchanges.
The ban, followed by the appointment of a new chairman, Mr S S Nadkarni, to
head the board, paved the way for Indian stock markets to start operating
like their international counterparts. While trading began to thin out, with
buyers having to pay for shares, speculators who made millions milking the
system were weeded out.

<TEXT>
Slovakia's parliament has voted to cancel all privatisation contracts
involving direct sales of shares in state companies to private investors
agreed since September 6. The move could herald another round of tit-for-tat
investigations of corruption in the country's fragile privatisation drive.
It came as Mr Jozef Moravck, the prime minister, tendered his government's
resignation following a general election five weeks ago. He agreed to stay
on as caretaker until a new government is formed.
The privatisation vote affects only a relatively few contracts signed during
election campaigning, in which the government agreed to sell stakes in state
companies directly to mainly local investors. It does not affect a more
wide-ranging sell-off involving the use of coupons which Slovak citizens can
exchange for Kcs60bn (Pounds 1.1bn) of shares in other state companies,
which is currently being administered. However, observers in Bratislava fear
it could start another wave of investigations into political favouritism in
privatisation, similar to one carried out by Mr Moravck's government when it
assumed office in March, and cause fresh delays to a programme beset by
political controversy.

McDonnell Douglas Aircraft yesterday signed a Dollars 1.6bn order for 40
medium-sized twin-engine jets from a Chinese delegation during a three-day
trade conference in Washington on telecommunications and transportation. The
order was welcomed by Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, as another bit of
good news as the mid-term elections approach. The agreement had originally
provided for all the jets to be made in China, but to meet the rapid growth
in the Chinese aviation market, 20 of them will now be built in the US over
the next four years, raising the value of the order. Engines will be
produced by International Aero Engines in Connecticut. The delegation is
expected to place a number of orders to counter the soaring US bilateral
trade deficit. The Chinese are also pushing their case for China's admission
into the World Trade Organisation as a founding member.

Saudi Arabia has refused to accept basing of arms for US troops who might

said Kuwait would pay the largest share of the estimated Dollars 600m cost
of a recent US military build-up in the Gulf against Iraq, but that
Washington also expected Saudi Arabia to help pay the bill. Kuwait and Qatar
have each agreed to provide basing for enough tanks and other supplies for a
US brigade and the Pentagon is searching for a base in the region for enough
equipment for a third brigade. The Saudis currently provide basing for
dozens of US military aircraft but have been reluctant to accept supplies
for American ground troops because of opposition to such a move by Moslem

Brazil's inflation rate has risen alarmingly, leading to calls for
government action before the country's new currency, the Real, is tainted
like its many predecessors by spiralling price rises. The private FIPE
institute said yesterday that prices rose 3.17 per cent in October, compared
to only 0.82 per cent in September. The acceleration in inflation was blamed
on higher rent, food and beverage prices. Inflation is expected to continue
at about 3 per cent in November as companies raise prices ahead of Christmas
and in response to a drought. Some economists fear that at these levels of
inflation, companies and consumers will revert to monthly price rises to
keep up, a practice the Real currency was designed to curb. Monthly
inflation reached 50 per cent before the Real was launched in July.

Japan's leading banks are urgently pressing the ministry of finance to
accelerate the deregulation of the country's financial markets. In a joint
submission to the MoF's banking bureau, disclosed in the Japanese press
yesterday, the largest commercial banks called on the authorities to enact a
list of 80 deregulatory measures soon. Favoured reforms include an extension
of the maximum period for certificates of deposit from two to five years and
the establishment of a market in five-year government bond futures. Banks
also want the MoF to lift restrictions on the opening of new branches and
the installation of cash dispensers outside banks, and are urging an
expansion of their own highly circumscribed spheres of business activities
to include the sale of investment trusts and insurance policies. The MoF is
under growing pressure to accelerate the dismantling of the vast structure
of regulations that govern financial markets.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Current account surplus down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's current account surplus fell 9.6 per cent in September from a year
earlier, the second consecutive monthly decline in the dollar-denominated
surplus. The finance ministry reported yesterday that the seasonally
adjusted current account balance for the month was Dollars 10.5bn. The
country's trade surplus in the same period was Dollars 12.1bn, down by 3.9
per cent on a year ago. Exports rose by 8.1 per cent to Dollars 32.8bn,
while imports were up sharply by 16.6 per cent to Dollars 20.7bn. The
figures provide further confirmation that the combination of a strong yen
and a reviving economy are starting to make small inroads into the country's
enormous external surpluses. In the three months to September the current
account surplus fell by 6.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter.
In yen terms the surplus has been falling for several months, but until the
July-September quarter the dollar-denominated surplus had been rising as the
higher yen raised export prices and cut the cost of imports. It now appears
that the strengthening currency has begun to be reflected in export and
import volumes and, as a result, the surplus is declining in dollar terms.
But the pace of the decline is still painfully slow and is unlikely to take
the pressure off the yen, which has reached new highs against the dollar in
the last week.

China yesterday accused foreign investors of cheating by overvaluing the
worth of machinery and equipment they put into joint ventures instead of
cash. The Xinhua news agency said inspectors had, between January 1991 and
June this year, discovered discrepancies totalling Dollars 500m (Pounds
305m) between the stated and actual value of such goods provided by foreign
investors. Inspectors checked 4,940 shipments of machinery and equipment and
found the actual value was Dollars 1.8bn, against a stated value of Dollars
2.3bn, it said.
It said one Hong Kong investor provided 15 pieces of equipment to a joint
venture in Wuhan, of which two were made in Japan in the 1930s and two made
in China in 1969 and 1973, which he said had a total value of Dollars 2.12m.
But local inspectors found the value to be Dollars 20,000.
In the first half of this year, 23 per cent of such equipment officially
inspected was found to be over-valued, against 25 per cent in 1993, the
agency said. Such equipment accounts for an average of 70 per cent of the
value of the foreign contribution to a joint venture, with the figure rising
to 90 per cent in some areas, it added.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Secrecy, absolute secrecy and five-star hotel bills: As
British ministers writhe amid revelations of all-expenses-paid luxury stays
in Paris, Andrew Jack puts hotel discretion to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying to squeeze a response about leaked ministerial hotel bills out of the
Paris Ritz requires more pressure than crushing the tomatoes in the Bloody
Mary supposedly invented in its bar.
The opulent and secretive Paris hotel broke its silence in a sense
yesterday, but only to mutter, under duress: 'We have a policy of absolute
discretion regarding guests real or presumed.'
That might seem ironic given more than a hundred articles in a gleeful
British press mentioning the Ritz in the last few weeks in connection with
the allegations of undeclared expense-paid stays by two British ministers,
Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Jonathan Aitken, illustrated by copies of their
bills.
Even French journalists have been indulging - though arguably out of a sense
of schadenfreude, relieved to have something to report on aside from the
growing number of their own politicians and business people embroiled in
scandals in recent months.
There again the Ritz, located on Place Vendome off the fashionable Rue du
Faubourg St Honore in the centre, is rather accustomed to dealing with
controversy. Indeed, the hotel - mother of all its more recent and
supposedly more reputable namesakes - was founded on the back of it.
Cesar Ritz opened his hotel in 1898 in Paris after decamping under
mysterious circumstances from his job as manager of the Savoy in London
along with his matre d', chief cashier and chef. They were accused of taking
commissions from suppliers and walking off with large quantities of wines
and spirits.
Ever since, the hotel has tried nonchalantly to shroud scandal in luxury.
Today, it has a Duke and Duchess of Windsor suite, in honour of King Edward
VIII, who lived there for three years after abdicating to marry Wallis
Simpson. It hosted Goebbels, Goering and other senior Nazis during the
second world war, while its director was spying on them for the French
resistance.
The extras consumed by Messrs Hamilton and Aitken are no doubt little
compared to the bar bills clocked up by Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Proust,
Truman Capote, Graham Greene, James Joyce, Scott Fitzgerald and Jean-Paul
Sartre in their day. Hemingway had such fun at the Ritz he once said he
hoped Heaven was going to be as good.
Its kitchens invented Peach Melba and, trying hard to leave his own exotic
mark on the place, Mr Mohamed Fayed, its current owner, has included
bullet-proof glass in a recent extravagant refurbishment.
It is still unclear exactly how Britain's Guardian newspaper obtained a copy
of Mr Aitken's bill, although the newspaper admitted using a fake fax on
House of Commons notepaper. Mr Fayed stressed that none of the hotel's staff
had been directly involved in handing over the information.
Nonetheless, the possibility that journalists - let alone tax inspectors or
jealous wives - might indulge in similar tactics has sent shivers down the
spine of the more discreet Parisian hotels, which have been acting like the
most secretive of Swiss banks on the subject all week.
The five-star Westminster hotel, not far from the Ritz in Rue de la Paix,
said: 'It's absolutely secret. Bills are strictly confidential. All the
information is kept on computer and nobody can touch it. The guest would
need to fax us and give all the details of their stay.'
'It's not very professional of the Ritz,' smirked the manager at another
rival hotel. 'Maybe they should have had to check the information in more
detail.' He added hastily that he disapproved of the Guardian's action too.
Other hotels were quick to reassure any nervous clients that the records
would remain private. The five-star Inter-Continental said: 'The accounting
department decides. Usually we are not allowed to release bills. We would
need to know when you stayed at the hotel and check your address was the
same one you gave when you stayed.'
The De Crillon, on Place de la Concorde, said: 'We don't give out
information on bills. If someone asked for a duplicate by phone we would
want written confirmation to check room number and the dates of stay to know
if it was really the same information that we have.'
Perhaps more honestly, the Meurice, opposite the Tuileries Gardens, said:
'Bills are personal. We cannot give a copy to anyone. We try to have
security but it is difficult. If someone loses their bill and would like a
copy we try to investigate but we would also like to help.'
Few hotels could offer proof of really tight defences against determined
forgery. The chief cashier at the George V Hotel asked simply in response to
a request for a duplicate bill for a fax with name, address and date of
departure.
Le Warwick, on the Champs Elysees, misunderstood the question posed in
English and thought the FT was inquiring about whether the Guardian could be
put on to a guest's room bill rather than the bill appearing in the
Guardian.
The hotel said: 'We charge the Guardian to the room bill.' It then added:
'It would not be easy to get a copy of the bill.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Monetary union panel rules out 'big bang'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An overnight 'big bang' switch to a single currency in Europe has been ruled
out by the panel of experts examining EU ambitions to introduce a common
currency before the end of the century.
Its recommendation will be welcomed by governments, companies, and
organisations who feared that a sudden change could result in administrative
chaos and a bemused populace.
But while stressing the need to tread carefully, the panel, appointed by the
commission, says the switch must happen as swiftly as possible, with the Ecu
and national currencies coexisting only for a limited period.
Mr Cees Maas, chairman of the group, was in Brussels yesterday to present
these and other suggestions to Mr Henning Christopherson, commissioner
responsible for economic and financial affairs.
'The group is convinced that the Ecu will be introduced before the end of
the century and Mr Christophersen was very happy to hear that,' said Mr
Maas, also a director of ING, the Dutch financial services company.
Mr Maas warned the British government that the City of London, Europe's
biggest and most important financial centre, would suffer from the
government's decision to remain outside a single European currency.
'I cannot imagine that the City will accept not taking part in this one
single currency,' said Mr Maas. 'It seems that if it is not part of the Ecu
bloc, it will lose out.'
According to the committee, governments, banking systems and retailers must
start now to prepare for the single currency. Banks should adapt payment
systems and get ready to redenominate loans and deposits in Ecu; local
authorities should adapt parking meters to accept electronic payment;
retailers should similarly alter vending machines and reduce cash handling
as much as possible by introducing modern payment techniques.
Trade and industry should also make allowance for the imminent switch when
making investments in new financial and administrative systems and when
drafting long-term business agreements.
'People should not see such moves as an unnecessary expense,' said Mr Maas.
'It is a stimulus for more efficiency in all payment systems.'
To make things easier, the European Monetary Institute, the precursor to a
European central bank, should state the size of bank notes and coins as soon
as possible.
The design and production of Ecu notes and coins will be a lengthy process,
according to the committee. It argues that they should be introduced within
six months of stage three of European Monetary Union, which will
irreversibly fix the exchange rates of participating currencies.
'If the introduction of actual Ecus is delayed for too long, the markets
might start to test to see whether the currencies are really irrevocably
fixed,' said Mr Maas.
He also favours just one type of coin and note, rather than allowing
different EU countries to put their own stamp on one side.
'This would increase the time it took to design notes and coins, increase
the risk of fraud, increase costs, and prolong production of the new
currency,' he said.
However, the committee recognises the political and psychological importance
of bank notes in spite of the widespread use of plastic cards to make
payments electronically.
'Wide public support is essential to the Ecu's success. Therefore, the
greatest possible attention should be paid to promoting public awareness,'
says the committee's provisional recommendations.
It believes that national currency notes and coins should be phased out
gradually, but with markets being the driving force, rather than
administrative decisions.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Chirac declares candidacy and defies Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, yesterday became the
first mainstream French politician to declare his intention to run for
president of the republic in next year's race.
The surprise announcement allowed Mr Chirac, who is mayor of Paris, to seize
the initiative by ignoring the request by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, to the centre-right coalition to hold off campaigning until
January.
His decision to run destroys any hope among France's political right of
offering a single candidate and looks sets to split the vote and trigger a
bitter election contest.
Mr Chirac, 61, is currently in third place in opinion polls well behind Mr
Balladur of the RPR and Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist candidate and
president of the European Commission, who are running neck and neck.
News of the announcement yesterday triggered the RPR to convene an emergency
congress on November 12 at which Mr Chirac will press to become the official
candidate of the party, in a direct threat to Mr Balladur.
In an unusual move, Mr Chirac spurned the usual practice of announcing his
candidature on national television, in favour of giving an interview to the
Lille-based newspaper La Voix du Nord, the third largest circulation
newspaper in France, with 400,000 copies sold each day.
Mr Andre Soleau, the newspaper's editor in chief, said he believed Mr Chirac
had taken the decision because Lille was the birthplace of General de
Gaulle, for whom Mr Chirac is sometimes portrayed as the 'spiritual son'. He
said Lille also symbolised 'la France profonde' outside Paris.
In the interview, Mr Chirac called for the need to 'meet the challenges and
restore the hope' of France through strong policies and 'rigorous ethics'.
He criticised the 'hypocrisy' of current political debate.
He argued for 'the necessity of change', and said that economic recovery had
not dealt with 'the problem of employment which threatens the destruction of
society'.
Mr Francois Mitterrand, the incumbent Socialist president, ends his second
seven-year term in May, although his poor health may lead to the date of the
election being brought forward.
Mr Chirac, who was criticised by Mr Balladur's supporters yesterday for
acting prematurely, previously stood unsuccessfully for president in 1981
and 1988. He has twice been prime minister.
Five other politicians have announced their candidature for the presidency.
They include Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the National Front, and Mr Robert
Hue, leader of the Communist party.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer sets out tough line on Emu convergence criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday appeared to harden
the criteria for monetary union in Europe: he said that the conditions set
by the Maastricht treaty would have to be met at all times, not just during
periods of economic boom.
He said the Maastricht convergence criteria for economic and monetary union
in Europe had to be 'strictly observed'. 'It is crucial that entry into Emu
is open only to those countries which meet the criteria in full,' said Mr
Tietmeyer.
In particular, he said it was not good enough merely to reduce budget
deficits to within the agreed limit of 3 per cent of GDP in times of
economic boom. Countries needed to hold deficits below the 3 per cent mark
during their recovery periods as well.
Luxembourg and Ireland are the only two European Union member states which
meet the criteria at the moment.
His comments come amid renewed discussion recently about the prospect of a
multi-speed approach to European integration.
Speaking to the the German British Chamber of Commerce in London, Mr
Tietmeyer also fired a warning shot across the bows of the UK. He said:
'Countries that do not have the willingness and the readiness to enter into
a broadly conceived and politically constructive community of solidarity
should exercise caution in entering a monetary union.
'In the long run, any monetary union which lacks extensive political
underpinning is likely to remain a fragile construction.'
On the topical question of central bank support for the dollar, Mr Tietmeyer
was coy about the prospect of Bundesbank co-operation in any programme of
concerted intervention. The US Federal Reserve intervened to support the
ailing dollar on both Wednesday and Thursday.
'I welcome any action that is supporting the dollar. We are all interested
in a strong dollar, as we are, of course interested, at the same time, in a
strong D-Mark. We have no problem with the strong D-Mark.'
He said: 'Joint signals to the markets can under special circumstances play
a useful role.' But he stressed that to be successful, 'signals must be
based on consistent and credible policies.'
In his comments on Emu, Mr Tietmeyer chose to stress the fiscal aspect of
convergence. According to Maastricht, Emu and a single currency would only
come about if member states met treaty rules on convergence of inflation and
interest rates, budget deficits and government debt.
The 3 per cent fiscal target for budget deficits, Mr Tietmeyer stressed, was
'an indicator that should be met over some time. It cannot only be met in
one year, and in a special recovery when tax revenues are increasing
strongly.'
He said the deficit needed to be in line with the 3 per cent 'upper limit'
during the whole economic cycle. 'That means during a recovery, clearly you
have to be below 3 per cent, and not only to a small extent.'
Mr Tietmeyer said it would 'not be appropriate' to overshoot the 3 per cent
target. It should be seen as a 'maximum', rather than as an average.
He endorsed the view that of the two deadlines envisaged in the Maastricht
treaty for transition to monetary union, the prospects for 1999 were better
than for 1997. 'The chances that a majority of the EU countries will qualify
(for Emu) by the end of 1996, as stipulated by the treaty, are not very
great at the moment,' he said, noting that countries 'able' to form a
monetary union should do so. This 'inner circle' would be open to other
countries which later satisfied the economic criteria for joining.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Ministry acts on industrial data 'leaks': Journalists in
Germany called to meeting as officials deny responsibility for disclosures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International news agencies have been threatened with severe sanctions if
they fail to attend a meeting called by the German economics ministry in a
move to staunch the persistent leaking of industrial data into financial
markets.
Representatives from 18 agency bureaux in Germany were summoned by letter
yesterday to talks at the ministry on November 15.
The aim of the discussions was 'to take precautions to ensure that figures
are no longer published or passed on to market participants before the
embargo', the letter said.
'If you are interested in continuing to receive production and order intake
figures before the embargo, I would request the participation of a
representative of your agency at the meeting,' it concluded.
The summons was faxed yesterday morning in response to a report in the
Financial Times that the ministry was investigating leaks of
market-sensitive information, which analysts and economists claimed had been
going on for months.
The FT report stemmed from a non-German bank's complaint that German bond
prices had been affected on Thursday when some traders appeared to have had
access before the official publication time to unexpectedly strong
industrial orders data.
News agencies compete vigorously to be first on the wires with potentially
'market-moving' economic or financial data which is often supplied in
advance to allow reports to be written on condition that strict transmission
embargoes are observed.
There was no evidence yesterday that this week's orders data had been
released prematurely through the normal distribution channels of any agency.
Agency staff said there was no suggestion of sanctions from other official
data sources, although the potential commercial consequences of losing
privileged early access to economics ministry information were expected to
ensure full attendance on November 15. 'It's a threat and it's not even
thinly-veiled,' one correspondent said.
The letter forcefully denied analysts' suggestions, reported in the FT, that
the source of the pre-publication information could be the ministry itself.
It rejected 'any suspicion. . . that the passing on of figures can be traced
to leaks in the ministry'.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, a ministry spokesman quoted by a German agency as
condemning the FT report of possible ministry leaks as 'malicious
insinuation', could not be reached for comment.
Mr Reinhard Krause, the ministry spokesman who signed the letter, said an
investigation carried out yesterday had shown the ministry was not the
source.
He also challenged claims that the only information ever leaked came from
the economics ministry.
Independent economists, too, pointed out that regional inflation data were
routinely transmitted 'to any number of banks' in haphazard fashion. 'It is
about time the Third World standards of German data publication got some
attention,' one analyst wrote in a note for internal circulation.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Bock aims to make Lonrho interests his priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dieter Bock, the German financier who on Thursday won his year-long battle
to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland to quit the Lonrho board, last night pledged to
sell all his outside business interests 'within at least two years'.
He did this to allay widespread concerns that he might lack both the time
and financial resources to take a long-term approach to the reorganisation
of Lonrho.
'I will be involved only in Lonrho,' he said in his first interview since
his victory against Mr Rowland. 'I have the firm intention in a controlled
way to get rid of all my outside interests. That is completable in two years
but it might not take as long as that.'
However, he denied rumours that his private businesses are under financial
pressure.
He also stressed that he had 'no intention' of selling any of his 18.8 per
cent Lonrho holding, which was last night worth Pounds 207m, compared with
the Pounds 90m bank loan he took out to finance the purchase two years ago.
His main private interest is Advanta, a German property company. He also has
extensive property interests in South Africa and a joint venture with Lord
Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman, to develop the Mansion House site
in London.
He did not give details of how he intended to withdraw from the
controversial London scheme. The value of his interests is difficult to
assess, because he holds them through companies in the UK, Germany and the
Netherlands.
Mr Bock gave his priorities for Lonrho over the coming months:
He wants to resume negotiations with Gencor, the South African mining
conglomerate, to achieve a fusion of both companies' platinum interests, a
deal which could create the biggest platinum group in the world;
He plans to cut head office costs by more than Pounds 10m a year;
He will dispose of any Lonrho interest which does not belong in either the
mining, hotels, agricultural or trading divisions. He said he was also
likely to consider whether to redevelop the group's headquarters, in the
City of London's Cheapside.
Lonrho's share price rose 12p yesterday to close at 144.5p.
Mr Bock said he was relieved that the battle with Mr Rowland was at an end:
'It will take some time to really relax and move forward without the burden
of having someone on my back.' He was not afraid of reprisals from Mr
Rowland, the dominant force in the company for 33 years: 'He may try to hurt
me with words, but I can cope with that.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Post Office seeks Pounds 100m cut in levy by Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, ANDREW ADONIS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office called yesterday for a Pounds 100m cut in its annual payment
to the Treasury to compensate for the cabinet's refusal to back the
privatisation plan put forward by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
Amid growing dismay among mainstream Conservatives at the cabinet's
capitulation to a few rebels, senior ministers sought to dispel the
impression of government drift by promising a 'radical' legislative
programme in the next parliamentary session.
But the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Post Office heightened as
it became clear that many senior ministers, including Mr Heseltine, expect
privatisation to re-emerge as the only viable option.
As DTI and Treasury officials waited in vain for ministerial instructions to
begin reviewing the remaining options for the Post Office, Mr Bill Cockburn,
chief executive, warned that only radical change could prevent a slow
decline in market share.
He said the Post Office 'urgently' needed a big cut in the Treasury levy,
expected to amount to Pounds 213m next year, to finance an increase of up to
Pounds 100m a year in spending on updated equipment.
'We will be saying to the government: 'If you bleed us white, we will not be
able to deliver a first-class postal service'. That must mean leaving us
with more of our profits to re-invest,' he told the FT in an interview.
Friends of Mr Heseltine said he was still feeling 'sore' after his cabinet
defeat on Thursday, and would not consider options for the Post Office until
next week.
Those options are likely to include a reduction in the levy, as well as
changes to the rules governing capital spending and pricing.
But Mr Heseltine was said to be convinced that support for privatisation
will grow as it becomes clear that less radical changes are insufficient to
protect the Post Office from private sector competition.
Several senior Conservatives support this view, including Sir Norman Fowler,
the former Conservative party chairman, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor.
Mr Clarke, who again ruled out changes to the Treasury rules covering Post
Office borrowing, said he was 'sure the Post Office will one day be
privatised'.
Mr Heseltine, who dismissed suggestions that his political career had been
soured by the privatisation debacle, mounted a strong defence of Mr John
Major's continued command of the government.
He said that the Queen's Speech on November 16, which sets out the
government's legislative programme for the coming session, would be a
'relevant, radical, forward-looking speech by a government that is in
charge'.
However, the dispute over the Post Office appeared to have widened the gulf
between Mr Major and the party's vituperative right wing.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Russia's deputy PM quits post over lack of progress on
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister of Russia and the senior
reformer in the cabinet, tendered his resignation last night, saying that
economic reform would not succeed under the current government.
The resignation comes as international financial agencies are considering
plans to stabilise the rouble with the aid of foreign loans. One anxious
official said last night: 'There seems to be a constitutional crisis going
on.'
The immediate cause of Mr Shokhin's decision to step down was the nomination
yesterday by President Boris Yeltsin of Mr Vladimir Panskov to the post of
finance minister. The appointment of the former deputy head of the
president's budget department appeared to reflect a continuing struggle
between Mr Yeltsin and prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin.
Mr Shokhin said that Mr Chernomyrdin had told him that he knew nothing of Mr
Panskov and had never met him. According to sources close to the government,
Mr Chernomyrdin had been consulted about Mr Panskov and at first opposed
him.
The appointment of Mr Panskov is part of the fall-out within the government
after the collapse of the rouble on October 11, when it lost almost a
quarter of its value against the US dollar. The acting finance minister and
central bank governor resigned under pressure from Mr Yeltsin, whose
advisers have continued to blame Mr Chernomyrdin's government for the
instability.
A clearly bitter Mr Shokhin complained: 'The economy has become a hostage to
politics.' At stake, he said, was a budget that aims to curb inflation to 1
per cent a month by the end of next year - it rose to 15 per cent in
October. The International Monetary Fund has indicated that it might support
the budget with aid of about Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn).
Mr Panskov, 50, was a career official in the Soviet finance ministry, rising
to become a deputy finance minister, and has a reputation as a competent
professional but not as a reformer.
His entry into the department yesterday was an ambiguous one. Mr
Chernomyrdin introduced him to his senior colleagues with the words: 'I tell
the new minister that a large amount of work has been done on the budget. We
will not swerve from the course we have chosen.'
Mr Shokhin replied, according to one participant in the meeting, that 'there
is a lot to be done'. According to another observer, Mr Panskov also said:
'Now, let's get a real budget.'

FT  05 NOV 94 / Bosnian Serbs mobilise forces after military defeats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serbs, smarting under their first serious defeats in 31 months
of war, served conscription orders on tens of thousands of civilians and
students yesterday but stopped short of declaring immediate martial law.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said a 'general mobilisation'
of men in his self-styled republic had begun. 'We are entering the final
battle,' he said. Mr Karadzic has masterminded the Bosnian Serbs' hitherto
successful defiance of the republic's mainly Moslem leaders, who declared
independence in April 1992.
The mobilisation is a sign that Bosnian Serb resources are being strained to
breaking point as growing Moslem firepower and a desperate shortage of fuel
take their toll. However, a meeting between Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian
Serbs' political and military leadership failed, unexpectedly, to produce
any immediate decision to declare a state of war, or suspend civil rights.
The session followed military reverses at the hands of a Moslem-Croat
alliance, including the loss of the strategic town of Kupres in central
Bosnia.
Officials in Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold where the meeting took place,
said a decision on an all-out state of war would probably be taken next
week. The postponement of this move fuelled speculation among western
observers of possible divisions in the Bosnian Serb leadership, which has
been isolated by its former Serbian protectors in Belgrade.
Reports from Bosnian Serb-controlled territory, which amounts to nearly 70
per cent of the Bosnian republic, said security police loyal to Mr Karadzic
were questioning hundreds of local officials and citizens. The apparent
purpose of the questioning is to root out supporters of Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic, who has accepted the latest international peace plan and
has become a bitter rival of Mr Karadzic.
Meanwhile, UN officials denounced as 'terrorism' a Serb rocket attack on
Bihac, in which seven people were wounded. The sharp reaction raised the
possibility that the UN might order air strikes if the Serbs reacted to the
latest setback by bombing civilian targets. Bihac is one of six enclaves
under UN protection.
Officials from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - the five nations
which make up the 'contact group' on Bosnia - are due to meet in Zagreb this
weekend. The fact that the meeting is taking place was seen as a signal of
continued determination to work together on a settlement.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in income seen by
Winterthur Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Winterthur Insurance, the third largest Swiss insurance group, said its
gross premium income in the first half reached SFr10bn (Dollars 8.1bn). The
group forecast a double digit rise in net income for the full year, from
last year's SFr324.4m.
This is the first time the group, which last month agreed to acquire three
insurance companies from Swiss Reinsurance for SFr355m, has published a
detailed interim report. No comparative figures were given.
Gross premiums from non-life business were SFr6.38bn while claims amounted
to SFr3.85bn and net expenses to SFr1.59bn. The group forecast that gross
premium income would grow 9 per cent in the full year to SFr20bn, helped by
a first-time consolidation of DBV Insurance of Germany.
Net life premiums were SFr3.7bn and net benefits paid reached SFr2.06bn.
Income from the group's SFr50.56bn in investments reached SFr1.5bn.
Mr Peter Spalti, chief executive, said Winterthur had no plans to raise new
capital to help pay for its recent acquisitions.
Swissair, the Swiss national airline group, said the improving business
trend recorded in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter,
but it added that the airline was still being affected by lower prices and
the high Swiss franc.
Mr Hannes Goetz, chairman, said about 70 per cent of the airline's costs
were in Swiss francs, but only a quarter of its revenues were in its home
currency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Islamic activists in north-western Pakistan, agitating for the enforcement
of Sharia laws, shot dead a ruling-party member of the provincial parliament
yesterday, government officials and witnesses said, Reuter reports from
Peshawar.
Mr Badiuzzaman, a North West Frontier Province Assembly deputy and a member
of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, had been killed
in the town of Mingora, said an official in the provincial capital,
Peshawar. Doctors said an Islamic activist had also been killed and at least
six people wounded in gunfire in the town.
The armed Islamists had occupied several government buildings since
Wednesday and taken several government officials hostage. They had also
besieged the home of Mr Habibur Rehman, the provincial sports minister, and
stopped him leaving to address a rally, witnesses said.
Masked activists were roaming the streets, checking vehicles for police or
militia. Groups of armed men took positions on nearby mountains to stop
security forces entering the town. Some activists also occupied the control
tower at the nearby airport, forcing a halt to flights.
The agitators are members of the hardline Tanzim Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi
(TNSM), which has campaigned for months for enforcement of Sharia Islamic
law in the predominantly tribal Malakand Division area.
Shortly after yesterday's shooting, provincial Chief Minister Aftab Ahmad
Sherpao announced Islamic laws for the area would be published within a week
and Sharia courts set up within a month.
A provincial government spokesman called the agitators 'miscreants'. The
government was taking every step to curb their activities, he declared, but
did not elaborate. Government officials said paramilitary forces were
heading for the area. Last May, at least 10 TNSM protesters were killed in a
battle with paramilitary forces when the organisation assembled an estimated
25,000 tribesmen to press their demand.
The demonstrators dispersed after the authorities issued a notification
agreeing to their demand. But the TNSM said the Islamic law had not been
enforced.
F L Smidth, the engineering division of the Danish company FLS Industries,
has won a DKr740m (Dollars 125m) contract to build Pakistan's largest cement
mill with an output of 5,500 tonnes a day, Hilary Barnes reports from
Copenhagen. The order was placed by Chakwal Cement Co, with financing raised
locally and a share issue managed by Union Bank of Switzerland.
The plant, due to come on stream within three years and sited 100km south of
Islamabad, is the sixth complete cement plant F L Smidth has sold to
Pakistan since 1990.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Fed wins respite for ailing dollar ahead of jobs report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday intervened in the currency markets for the
second day running to support the ailing dollar.
Analysts said intervention had gained the dollar a short-term respite,
without arresting the predominantly bearish sentiment towards the currency.
Thin market conditions allowed the Fed to push the dollar higher.
However, the US currency faces an important test today with the publication
of the monthly employment report. Financial markets regard the report as an
inflationary indicator, and concern about rising inflation in the US is a
main factor behind dollar weakness.
The Fed's action follows repeated intervention on Wednesday after the dollar
fell to a low of Y96.05. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, warned
on Wednesday: 'Continuation of recent foreign exchange trends would be
counterproductive for the US and the world economy.'
Earlier in the year the administration came under fire for pursuing a policy
of benign neglect towards the dollar. Critics said the US was using a cheap
dollar to win greater access to Japanese markets. Mr Bentsen and the
administration have since sought to stress that the administration favours a
stronger dollar.
The Fed first intervened yesterday towards the close of European trading,
buying dollars at Y97.90 and DM1.5155, and then continued to buy at regular
intervals. The intervention lifted the dollar to Y98 and DM1.5225 in
afternoon trading in New York.
The US central bank appeared to be following a familiar pattern of buying
dollars in waves through about 15 separate banks, in lots of about Dollars
10m per bank. Traders estimated that the Fed spent Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn
buying dollars in Wednesday's intervention.
There is fairly widespread scepticism about the benefits of intervention
without supportive monetary policy changes. Many believe the dollar will
fall lower if not supported by higher US interest rates.
Many analysts expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy, lifting short-term
interest rates by at least 50 basis points, if today's employment report
shows continued strong economic growth.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, noted that
'Dollars 25bn of Bank of Japan intervention through the year has massively
exceeded Fed intervention, without turning the dollar trend'.
Two reasons cited for the intervention were the US Treasury's desire not to
have the dollar at record lows next week when US mid-term congressional
elections, and the quarterly treasury refunding, take place.

FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores and pharmaceuticals group Boots fell in reaction to disappointment
over the group's half-year results and statement. There was also a sense of
deflation when the company failed to announce details of the sale of its
pharmaceuticals arm.
However, the lack of disposal news failed to stop a welter of speculation on
the timing of a disposal and the ultimate recipient.
Most analysts have set a Pounds 900m price tag on the drugs arm and there
were strong rumours that Astra would buy and Boots was planning a special
board meeting today. However, both the Swedish drug company and the
Nottinghamshire retailer strenuously denied the talk. Other names mooted
were Knoll, which is part of BASF, Menarini, of Italy, Ciba and Zeneca. The
purchase was, however, said to be too dear for Zeneca.
Boots shed 20 at first but rallied to close 10 off at 519p.
Takeover talk and a strong dollar gave a fillip to the pharmaceuticals
sector. The main story was an old one that had been given a new coat of
paint. Dealers suggested that a bid of 170p a share would be made for
Fisons, whose shares gave a late spurt to close 3 1/2 higher at 117 1/2 p in
spite of cynicism from analysts. There was also said to be some active
buying of traded options.
Zeneca was said to be either making a bid for Boots or receiving an offer
from a rival. The shares were also benefiting from reports that it is
considering forming joint ventures or links with US healthcare suppliers and
a deal is likely within four months.
Vickers' City presentation confirmed all and more that analysts had been
hoping to hear, with the group talking boldly of a partner for its
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars unit before the end of the year, plus a big order
back-log in defence where there could also soon be news of European
collaboration.
The company would not be drawn on whether its prospective Rolls-Royce
partner was either Daimler-Benz or BMW, both German groups, but yesterday
the stock market had few doubts and the shares put on a further 4 at 183p in
1.8m volume for a four-day gain of close to 10 per cent.
A downbeat review of the property sector from NatWest Securities pushed the
stocks lower against the day's trend, with British Land and Brixton Estate
among the hardest hit, shedding 6 to 397p and 3 to 186p respectively.
The securities house has moved its sector stance from neutral to
underperform following a reduction in its estimates for the growth of net
asset values this year and next. It singles out British Land, Brixton and
Great Portland Estates (down 2 at 189p) as the most exposed stocks.
Other features among engineers included Laird Group, best known for its
motor vehicle sealing systems, which jumped 15 1/2 to 370p in nominal
trading volume.
Legal &amp; General, which held at 436p, was one of the market's most heavily
traded stocks, with turnover reaching 11m as one institution sold a block of
4m shares at 432p via an agency cross.
Royal Insurance attracted strong support in the options market, as well as
being boosted by broker recommendations ahead of next Thursday's
third-quarter results. The shares settled 8 1/2 higher at 309 1/2 p.
Marley, the building materials group, moved up 3 to 135p after a UBS buy
note, while Blue Circle hardened 3 to 284p after a recommendation from
Robert Fleming.
British Airways moved forward 7 to 366 1/2 p following an increase in
traffic flows for October substantially ahead of the 5 per cent or so that
most analysts had been expecting. The airline's revenue passenger kilometres
rose by 6.8 per cent, although the growth in premium traffic slowed sharply.
The session saw 3m shares dealt, plus heavy stock options activity.
Inevitably the excitement washed over on to airports group BAA, which gained
7 at 522p in advance of Monday's results statement.

FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited sale by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company,
of its near 10 per cent shareholding in Enterprise Oil, largest of the UK
oil exploration companies, did little harm to Enterprise shares, which
finished only a penny cheaper at 385p. Turnover, swollen by double-counting
of the placing, reached 128m shares.
Elf sold 50.8m Enterprise shares, its entire stake plus some stock jointly
owned with Enterprise, comprising overall 10.3 per cent of Enterprise's
equity. The stock was placed with international investors by a syndicate led
by BZW and including Cazenove and Dresdner Bank. The deal involved a bought
deal, with the syndicate believed to have paid 365p apiece for the shares
and placed them at 369p, realising a profit of around Pounds 2m.
Mr Steve Turner of Nomura said: 'In the short term there may be a bit of
indigestion, but longer term it removes a major overhang from the shares.'
The placing triggered heavy switching across the sector, with institutions
selling blocks of Clyde Petroleum and Lasmo in order to buy into Enterprise
on the view that the Enterprise stock was being sold at the year's low
point. Lasmo was 1 1/2 firmer at 147 1/2 p after turnover of 5.4m, while
Clyde, where a block of 4.7m shares, or just over 1 per cent, was sold at
37p, held at 39p.

FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Northern Foods in big trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading food manufacturer Northern Foods saw exceptionally heavy trade late
in the day which prompted well-founded speculation that one of its biggest
stakeholders had sold out.
Large blocks of shares adding up to a total of 21m were all sold at 195p to
PDFM, the fund management group which already holds 10 per cent of the
group.
Northern said it was unperturbed by the change of ownership and unaware of
the seller's identity. If all the trades represented one side of the
exchange, they would amount to more than 3.5 per cent of the company's
shares. Several analysts said the seller might have been Norwich Union,
which in August was recorded as owning 3.52 per cent of the group. The East
Anglian insurance group was unavailable for comment last night.
Northern Foods is expected to suffer in the short term from the recent
deregulation of the milk industry - milk deliveries account for a large part
of the company's business. On the other hand, Northern's shares have fallen
by a third over the past two years and PDFM has a reputation for buying
shares on weakness. Northern's shares closed a penny softer at 199p.

FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved back on to the offensive, climbing confidently
back above 3,100 and wiping out most of the previous two days' losses,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract led the cash market for almost the whole of
the session, the premium rarely dipping below 20 points and at times moving
out to 25 points.
Trading volume was slightly short of Wednesday's level, but dealers said
their was a much better base to business, with a number of old faces putting
in a reappearance.
According to one trader, there were clear signs of Continental buying for
the first time since mid-summer, with a number of sizeable Swiss and
Austrian deals going through.
The size and apparent durability of the premium over cash equities also
triggered fair levels of arbitrage activity.
At the official 4.10pm close the December contract stood at 3,118, up 21
points. The premium to the cash market was 16 points, or twice that of
current fair value.
Just about the only disappointment was the below average trading volume,
with 10,868 contracts dealt, against 12,261 on Wednesday.
Traded options turnover was also lower, dipping to 18,915 lots from 28,484.
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume was just above 12,000 lots. British Airways was
the busiest individual stock option, with 1,041 contracts dealt.

FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index regains 3,100 towards the
close - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reappearance of the Federal Reserve in the currency markets brought a
hurried scramble for stock in the UK equity market towards the close of
yesterday's trading session. The Footsie 3,100 mark was recaptured for the
second time in volatile trading which also inspired a strong list of
individual company features.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,104.4, a net gain of 23.1.
The Footsie had cleared 3,106 at midsession as British government bonds
responded favourably to the better performance overnight in US bonds and the
dollar. But the rise of 25.3 on the Footsie was cut back sharply when news
of a 2.6 per cent gain in US home sales for October weakened the dollar. The
Fed's renewed support for the US currency came late in the London trading
day and triggered a swift response.
UK strategists expressed satisfaction last night with the Fed's evident
determination to support the dollar, but said that the market will focus
closely today on the US October payroll statistics. These are expected to
show a sharp increase and could thus renew the threat to the dollar, and to
European bond and equity markets. The Dow Industrial Average also turned
round in UK trading hours to show a gain of around 15 points in early deals.
The market was active from the opening of business, with Elf-Aquitaine
selling its near 10 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil as it bought a stake in
Renault, the French car manufacturer, whose partial privatisation got under
way yesterday.
The 50.7m-share Enterprise stake, double-counted on the Seaq network as BZW
and Cazenove passed the shares on, boosted the day's volume total, which
received a further lift when a Swiss-based fund management group purchased a
stake in Northern Foods; without these deals, the day's trading volume would
have remained unexciting.
The day's final Seaq turnover total of 683m shares compared with 558.7m on
Wednesday. About 52 per cent of the day's business was done in non-Footsie
stocks, somewhat below recent averages.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, taking in a range of second line stocks which pay
less heed to currency markets, added 8.8 at 3,530.8.
The stock market continued to assess prospects for domestic interest rates
in the wake of this week's inflation report from the Bank of England. Fears
of an immediate rise in base rates have subsided, but the market has not
changed its perception that base rates will move higher around the turn of
the year. The UK Treasury's panel of independent economic forecasters
yesterday called for a neutral budget from the chancellor of the exchequer
in a few weeks time, but some members believed that further rate rises would
ne necessary 'in due course'.
Dollar stocks headed the rebound in the market. Oil shares were particularly
strong, still responding to the good trading results announced from the
sector leaders. The Enterprise Oil deal inspired activity among the second
line issues.
Pharmaceuticals also stood out well, although Boots failed to find favour in
spite of a successful performance in the US by its anti-arthritis drug.
Among the interest rate-related issues, store groups showed up firmly, with
market traders hoping that the all-important Christmas selling period would
not be blighted by any upward move in domestic interest rates.
The market sounded more confident than for some weeks, with some analysts
convinced that the US Federal Reserve would continue to support the US
dollar successfully over the period of the US mid-term elections. Stability
in currencies would offer the opportunity for UK equities to stage a
year-end rally.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities pick up ahead of
jobs data

Wall Street
US share prices posted modest gains as the markets rallied from three days
of losses yesterday. Sentiment, however, remained subdued as investors
awaited today's key employment report, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.75 firmer at 3,845.88 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.41 at 467.91, while the Nasdaq composite
edged up 0.28 to 772.10. NYSE volume came to 285m shares.
Flat bond prices helped to steady equities, which had taken their lead from
declining Treasury prices over the previous three days. The Dow snapped back
15 points at the opening, making up more than half of the ground lost at
Wednesday's close, but then retreated gradually over the rest of the day.
News that the Federal Reserve was continuing to shore up the value of the
dollar also supported stocks by boosting investor confidence and stabilising
prices in the Treasury markets.
Volume was moderate as investors awaited key employment figures, due out
today. Some analysts were predicting the non-farm payroll figure to rise
more than 300,000, slightly above recent trends. Investors were wary that
the Fed could lift interest rates before its November 15 open market
committee meeting if the figure showed an increase much greater than
expected. A smaller than expected drop in jobless claims eased fears that
today's employment data will indicate a rapidly expanding economy.
Several US retailers were up on stronger than expected sales for October.
Sears rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 1/2 , the Gap Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 36
1/2 , Dayton Hudson Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 81 7/8 and May Department
Stores Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 . Wal-Mart, which posted sales below
analysts' expectations, shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 .
The Dow was pulled up by moderate increases among its biggest components.
General Motors gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39, McDonalds Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 29 1/2 and Bethlehem Steel Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19.
Financial services group Kemper declined Dollars 2 to Dollars 48 1/2 in the
wake of Conseco's announcement on Wednesday that it wanted to lower its bid
for the company, raising further doubts about the Indiana-based insurer's
ability to complete the deal.
Reports of a boom in its Latin American lending pushed Bank of Boston up
Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 28 3/8. Some analysts, however, worried that the
bank, which wrote off Dollars 200m in loans to the region in 1984, might
have too much exposure to relatively unstable markets.
United Health Care, one of the leading health care providers, fell Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 48 3/8 on profit-taking after a year of strong growth.
Third-quarter results released yesterday were in line with analysts'
expectations.
Canada
After two days of sharp declines, Toronto stocks were flat yesterday as
investors remained cautious ahead of today's crucial employment reports.
The TSE 300 composite index closed a mere 2.16 points softer at 4,226.82,
while falls outscored advances by 416 to 316 after volume of 58.2m shares.
As well as the US payroll report, seen as a crucial barometer for the
strength of the US economy, the Canadian employment report will be released
today.
Venezuela
Shares were only mildly lower in Caracas in slightly better volume than had
been seen on Wednesday as the confusion surrounding Electricidad de
Caracas's forthcoming share subscription appeared to have been resolved. The
Merinvest index eased just 0.40 more to finish at 141.68.
The National Share Commission's approval of the one-for-six, Dollars 65m
share subscription in Electricidad saw the stock open at 292 bolivars,
before slipping back 9 bolivars to close at 283.
Brazil
Sao Paulo dropped a further 4.1 per cent in light trading, led lower by a
strong selling spree concentrated in the telecommunication, oil and
electrical sectors. The Bovespa index finished 1,929 weaker at 45,080.
Turnover totalled RDollars 267.7m (Dollars 316.4m), down 65 per cent from
the previous session.
Analysts said sentiment that November inflation is expected to rise in spite
of a package of measures adopted by the government to contain consumption
continued to prompt players to lighten positions.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sydney hit by News Corp
preference issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's overnight fall unnerved some Pacific Rim markets, while others
were driven by domestic influences. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday.
SYDNEY finished slightly lower, hit by a fall in the share price of News
Corp as it began trading its preference share issue. The All Ordinaries
index slipped 2.1 to 2,009.1 in turnover of ADollars 407m.
Brokers said the market opened easier, mainly on weakness in News Corp, and
failed to recover, although News Corp regained its balance, adding 42.3
cents at ADollars 5.85 after being adjusted for the preference share issue.
The media shares sub-index gained 2.1 per cent at 12,321.0, although Fairfax
eased 3 cents to ADollars 2.70.
In a mixed mining sector, CRA declined 14 cents to ADollars 18.62, MIM
finished steady at ADollars 2.91 and WMC was 2 cents firmer at ADollars
2.91.
WELLINGTON ended slightly higher in very heavy turnover, boosted by Brierley
Investments' raid on Wilson and Horton, publisher of New Zealand's biggest
circulation paper, the Auckland based New Zealand Herald. The NZSE-40
Capital index put on 8.70 at 2,117.43.
Brierley's purchase of 25m Wilson shares, amounting to a 25 per cent stake,
for about NZDollars 243m at NZDollars 9.50 a share, lifted turnover to
NZDollars 297.7m and overshadowed Telecom's first-half results.
Brierley was 2 cents up at NZDollars 1.25, while Wilson and Horton rose
NZDollars 1.25 to NZDollars 9.50.
The move had a beneficial effect on Wilson and Horton's opposition,
Independent Newspapers, which firmed 40 cents to NZDollars 5.30.
Telecom, which had earlier reported an increase in first-half profits to
NZDollars 293m from NZDollars 251.4m, dipped 3 cents to NZDollars 5.65.
KUALA LUMPUR returned after Wednesday's holiday to further selling forced on
clients unable to meet margin calls. This left the market 2.5 per cent
lower, the composite index losing 27.12 at 1,066.46, with Wall Street's weak
trend also unnerving some investors.
Some analysts said that although market sentiment was weak, they expected
further dips to bring buyers back.
HONG KONG saw some of its early gains erased on profit-taking but the Hang
Seng index still finished 40.20 higher at 9,491.96. Turnover was HKDollars
2.4bn, slightly better than Wednesday's HKDollars 2.2bn.
Property, banking and construction issues rose on news of an imminent
airport funding agreement. Cheung Kong appreciated 30 cents to HKDollars
36.70, Henderson Land 50 cents to HKDollars 50.50 and Hongkong Land 15 cents
to HKDollars 19.70.
HSBC Holdings advanced 50 cents to HKDollars 90.50 and Hang Seng Bank 75
cents to HKDollars 56.50.
SEOUL closed broadly firmer in spite of a further Won33bn of sales by the
securities market stabilisation fund, the composite index adding 11.99 at
1,117.73. Gainers outpaced losers by 565 to 314, with 327 stocks going limit
up.
Medium-priced, large-capitalisation shares were in demand. Kia Motors rose
the day's limit, Won800, to Won17,900 and Korean Air put on Won700 at
Won29,500.
Some securities houses and banking shares rebounded. But primary blue chips
remained weak.
SHANGHAI's A share index ended 7.8 per cent up on speculative buying after a
run of losses in the index since the start of October. The index gained
53.11 at 735.57 on much enlarged turnover of Yn3.0bn, after Yn634.78m on
Wednesday.
Brokers described the day's gains as a technical rebound supported by
speculators, adding that market fundamentals had not changed.
SINGAPORE's weak performance was attributed to the volatility of the US
currency and the fall on Wall Street.
The Straits Times Industrial index shed 11.99 to 2,352.30, with sentiment
also dented by sharp falls in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter.
MANILA retreated sharply at the close on profit-taking sparked by a steep
fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Philippine National Bank.
PLDT reported a 13.46 per cent decline in profits in the first nine months,
the shares losing 30 pesos at 1,420 pesos, while PNB fell 12.50 pesos to
382.50. Petron slipped 1.50 pesos to 25.50.
The composite index dropped by 35.66 to 3,054.99. Losers exceeded gainers by
55 to 26.
TAIPEI declined in modest trade on short-term profit-taking after a strong
rebound on Wednesday, and on political uncertainties ahead of the December
elections.
The weighted index ended 36.37 off at 6,306.29 in modest turnover of
TDollars 44.55bn.
Export-oriented electronics companies led the falls on the recent
appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, with Tecom down TDollars 2 to TDollars
51.
Plastics and financials were also weak. But food stocks rose as President
Enterprises surged TDollars 2 to TDollars 58.50, and marine issues were also
strong, with Yang Ming Marine up 90 cents to TDollars 38.10.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Airlines boosted by KLM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European airline stocks were pulled higher yesterday by the overall strength
in continental European bourses in general and excellent second-quarter
results from KLM, the Dutch carrier, in particular, writes John Pitt.
KLM, which announced a net profit of Fl 354m, at the top end of analysts'
forecasts, saw its shares rise to a day's high of Fl 49.10, before easing
back on profit-taking to Fl 48.00 for a gain of 70 cents.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa, the part-privatised German carrier, advanced to
DM194.10 in official hours, before adding a further DM1.40 in post-bourse
trading to finish at DM195.50, as it announced that it was following the
lead of other airlines by lifting cargo rates to the US by 5.9 per cent from
next year.
Mr Chris Avery, aviation analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, commented that
the KLM figures showed that the airline was making good progess in reducing
costs. He said that he would be raising his full-year forecasts following an
analysts' meeting with the company.
The figures from KLM, he added, showed that both cargo and passenger
operations had done well, while the reduction in fuel costs had clearly been
beneficial. As long as operating costs continued to be trimmed, he said,
there was no reason to be other than bullish regarding prospects. Lufthansa,
in particular, had plenty of potential for cost-cutting, he remarked.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rhone-Poulenc inspires Paris
bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses seemed less sensitive than before to US data, perhaps waiting for
today's jobs figures; in the afternoon, they were more responsive to the
upswing in US share prices, writes Our Markets Staff. Stock-picking seemed
to come back into fashion and there were some strong rises in individual
stocks.
PARIS regained all of Wednesday's losses with a rise of 2 per cent in what
brokers described as a technical rebound. The CAC-40 index ended 37.53 up at
1,911.13. Turnover was FFr3.7bn.
Rhone-Poulenc provided inspiration as it surprised analysts with stronger
than expected nine-month results, and the shares rose FFr9.50 or 7.5 per
cent to FFr133.90. Analysts upgraded their full-year estimates after a 47
per cent jump in net profits. The chemical company's results were helped by
lower tax charges.
There was also good news for Euro Disney, the beleaguered theme park
operator, which was twice suspended limit up after reporting a smaller than
expected loss for the year to September, before ending the day up FFr1.25 or
18 per cent at FFr8.15.
Elsewhere, Elf Aquitaine, FFr2.50 higher at FFr370.30, said that it had sold
a 10.3 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil, of the UK, as expected, and taken a
1.5 per cent stake in Renault, whose partial privatisation began yesterday.
The oil group still retains a 12.9 per cent holding in Enterprise.
FRANKFURT moved from a Dax index rise of 9.13 to 2,051.48 on the session,
helped by a firmer dollar and stable bonds, to one of 21.46 at 2,061.37 at
the end of Ibis trading, lifted further by short covering and a 4.8 per cent
rise in west German industrial orders in September.
Turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM4.9bn. Early strength in financials,
automotive stocks, engineers and in Veba, the energy and chemicals group,
was extended later.
In financials, Allianz rose DM33 to DM2,300 on the Ibis day, and Deutsche
Bank by DM13 to DM742. In automotives, which like a stronger dollar,
Volkswagen climbed DM7.10 to DM445 following a big rise in its October US
car sales, and MAN by DM4.60 to DM401.50 after saying it expected a
significant improvement in current year earnings.
Veba, up DM9.20 at DM503.20, said that it will decide in mid-1995 whether it
will list its shares in New York. By then it would have calculated annual
results for two years in a row according to US generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), described yesterday by the Veba chairman, Mr Ulrich
Hartmann, as 'actually not so bad'.
AMSTERDAM was boosted by another clutch of strong results in a week which
has given investors in Dutch companies an opportunity to feel confident
regarding medium- term prospects for the market. The AEX index moved ahead
4.61 to 410.36.
Philips saw strong US demand after the company reported an impressive set of
figures. These showed that it had nearly trebled its profits in the third
quarter, helped by high demand in markets such as the Far East and Brazil.
The shares rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 56.50, while those in the Polygram subsidiary
reaped the benefit by putting on Fl 2.40 at Fl 75.50.
MILAN eventually regained its upward momentum following Wednesday's losses,
still focusing on banks. The Comit index registered a 1.67 fall to 623.87,
but the real-time Mibtel finished 79 higher at 10,035.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, decided that the time was ripe for investors to
revisit Italy, in spite of continuing political uncertainty and the bourse's
underperformance in recent months. Mr Richard Davidson, who increased its
weighting in the European portfolio, pointed to the outlook for inflation
and a further improvement in the current account as compelling reasons to
buy, on expectations of a market rebound next year.
BCI gained L109 at L3,570 as analysts conluded that its much heralded bid
for control of Ambroveneto was likely to succeed, but some questioned the
benefits of the deal for BCI. Ambroveneto was L23 higher at L5,338.
Credito Italiano slipped L5 to L1,584 as it vowed to continue with its
L19,000 a share suit for 48 per cent of a reluctant Credito Romagnolo. The
latter picked up another L238 to L16,533.
ZURICH marched 1.4 per cent ahead as the stronger dollar brought an
improvement in sentiment, and the SMI index rose 34.8 to 2,534.8.
Insurers were mostly firmer after Winterthur issued a favourable 1994
profits forecast. Winterthur registered picked up SFr21 to SFr641 as
investors switched from the recently strong Swiss Re, SFr 6 lower at SFr755.
Zurich Insurance registered advanced SFr37 to SFr1,200.
The firm US currency supported chemicals issues. Roche certificates picked
up SFr160 to SFr5,810 and Ciba was SFr11 ahead at SFr732.
Among second liners, Schindler bearers rose another SFr45 to SFr1,525, and a
SFr40 advance to SFr2,560 by Baloise, the insurer, was attributed to
speculative foreign buying.
MADRID sprang to life in the afternoon, but the quality of the recovery came
into question. In terms of gains, senior blue chips and ADRs took second
place to the construction sector and a collection of unrelated issues: these
included the stainless steel group Acerinox, up Pta450 at Pta14,050; the
retailer Pryca, up Pta80 at Pta2,125; Tabacalera, Pta70 better at Pta3,320;
and Viscofan, up Pta40 at Pta2,160.
STOCKHOLM fell on rising debt yields, following a controversial government
austerity package. The Affarsvarlden General index shed 23.80 or 1.6 per
cent to 1,447.30.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa sharply higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in Johannesburg industrials, and particularly index stocks, was
attributed to the IFC's launch of new stock indices for South Africa,
although late profit-taking left many prices off their highs.
One analyst said the IFC move gave a fillip to futures trading and that the
bullish tone also spilled over to otherwise lacklustre gold issues. Recent,
good company results, with more to come, were another positive factor.
The overall index rose 102 to 5,839, industrials gained 133 or 2.0 per cent
at 6,738 and golds picked up 16 to 2,257.
De Beers advanced R4.50 to R101, while Anglos added R5.25 at R243.
SAB finished R5.25 higher at R100 after hitting a new peak for the year of
R105 ahead of expected strong half-year results due next week. Amcoal rose
R5 to R220, reflecting strong first-half earnings and a bullish outlook.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed intervenes again to support the US
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday again intervened in the market to support
the dollar, writes Philip Gawith.
Traders said the Fed, which started to intervene as European markets were
closing, was probably trying to underline its seriousness by getting the US
currency to finish in New York above its Wednesday close.
The Fed first bought dollars at DM1.5155 and Y97.90. On Wednesday it came in
at DM1.4955 and Y96.10. The dollar closed in London two pfennigs up at
DM1.5146, from DM1.4945, and at Y97.6050 from Y96.205. It ended in New York
at DM1.5186 and Y97.735.
The markets were very quiet before the Fed came in, with most traders
waiting for the release of the US payrolls data today before making their
next move. The thin conditions allowed the Fed to achieve a measure of
success, in spite of the absence of any support from other central banks,
save for the Bank of Japan.
In Europe, the main mover was the Swedish krona, which fell back to close at
SKr4.847 against the D-Mark, from SKr4,802. This was a reaction to an
opinion poll showing that 52 per cent of Swedes would say no to EU
membership.
In the UK, the Bank of England dealt at established rates in its daily money
market operations. This suggested that there had probably been no decision
taken to lift interest rates at the monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday.
Analysts agreed that Fed intervention had bought time for the dollar,
without arresting the negative sentiment towards the US currency.
A number of reasons were suggested as to why the Fed had intervened. These
included: concern that a weak dollar would feed into US inflation;
signalling disapproval of the level to which the dollar had fallen; and
wanting to stabilise the currency ahead of next week's quarterly treasury
refunding, and the mid-term congressional elections.
Today the key focus will be the non-farm payroll. If it comes in above
market expectations, and the Fed does not respond with a firm tightening of
monetary policy, traders are likely to sell the dollar again.
The market was again thick with explanations for dollar weakness. The most
commonly heard is the fear that the Fed is moving too slowly to combat
inflation. Also much mentioned is the US's large current account surplus,
which is seen as creating a structural oversupply of dollars that can only
result in dollar weakness unless offset by commensurate capital inflows.
But according to Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency strategy at UBS in
London, these explanations do not wash. He said the US current account
deficit, of around 2 per cent of GDP, is no worse than Germany's, but the
D-Mark is appreciating. He also recalls that the dollar was a strong
currency in the 1985-7 period when the current account surplus was closer to
4 per cent.
Mr Chertkow said, instead, that the dollar's weakness is attributable to
lack of confidence in the currency, and US assets, following the Clinton
administration's policy of 'dollar debasement'. As a result, US assets were
not bought, and the capital flows were insufficient to combat the size of
the current account deficit.
For this reason, he added, the issue of whether or not the Bundesbank
participated in the intervention was irrelevant; 'the issue here is the US,
whether the Clinton administration atones for the policy of debasement'.
Mr Chertkow said the dollar had been driven lower by short-term players.
Financial investors and corporates had been largely out of the market. The
resultant illiquidity meant that the short-term operators had been able to
exert disproportionate influence.
He went on to say that institutional investors were underweight in the
dollar because they were underweight in US assets. As a result, they were a
potential source of follow-on dollar buying, should the Fed succeed in
getting short-term speculators to start pushing it higher.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said
intervention had recently been conspicuously unsuccessful; 'Dollars 25bn of
Bank of Japan intervention through the year has massively exceeded Fed
intervention, without turning the dollar trend'.
Tight bill conditions in the UK money markets saw three-month LIBOR rise to
6 5/32 per cent from 6 1/8 per cent. In its daily operations, the Bank of
England provided UK money markets with Pounds 635m of late assistance, after
earlier supplying Pounds 406m of liquidity. The shortage was Pounds 1.25bn.

<TEXT>
Nambia, the driest country in southern Africa, is worried by the loss of
trees, mopane bush and grass in the sandy, heavily-grazed, populous communal
areas of the far north.
Further south it is concerned by the spread of impenetrable thornbush
thickets on commercial farms, which occurs because browsing game animals are
fewer in number and loss of grass around waterpoints gives the bush a
chance.
Argo Rust, who farms near Windhoek Airport, is proposing a controversial
answer to both problems. Cattle, he believes, can cure as well as cause
degradation of arid land.
He has pursued that principle for 25 years and has doubled to 600 the number
of cattle on his small farm. To spread his ideas, which are controversial
with agricultural advisers, he founded the Namibia Centre for Holistic
Resources Management in 1989. It has 65 members.
Success has enabled him to give a better deal to his seven workers. 'If you
want to involve your labour force, they must understand the goal and be part
of it,' he says. 'That can happen only if their quality of life is
addressed.'
In the 1960s he took over the 4,000-hectare family farm, Sonnleiten, which
had only 300 cattle. He was advised to destroy encroaching bush and reduce
the number of cattle.
Instead, he pursued the ideas of a Rhodesian, Alan Savory, who had noticed
that national parks, with their big, constantly moving herds of game, had
good grass.
The problem, says Mr Rust, is not the number of animals but the time they
spend on a piece of land. If this is controlled, the hooves of a big herd
break up the surface and their dung manures it, encouraging grass to grow
and preventing thornbush establishing itself.
He also decided on a holistic approach, avoiding the use of chemicals that
could harm important dung beetles.
Fences are used to divide his land into paddocks around waterpoints. Cattle
stay in each paddock for a limited time. He points out that similar results
could be achieved without fences on communal land by herding cattle from
place to place. He has been surprised to find that grass germinates best in
corridors where cattle tramp most.
Some of his land was like concrete, yet it recovered despite below-average
rain, which suggests even the worst land can be restored.
Researchers have now discovered his land has a higher percentage of
perennial grasses than land farmed conventionally by the agricultural
college next door.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco plans nickel mine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rising metal prices have led Inco, the Toronto-based nickel producer, to
press ahead with a large mine near its Sudbury, Ontario, operation.
Inco said yesterday it would invest USDollars 158m to bring the McCreedy
East nickel and copper deposit to production.
The mine, due to be commissioned in late 1996, is expected to be to be one
of Inco's lowest cost - and most productive - operations.
In its first phase, McCreedy East will produce an estimated 15m tons of ore,
grading 4.32 per cent copper and 1.44 per cent nickel.
At full production in 1999, it is expected to mine 3,000 tons of ore a day
for 17 years. At this rate, it will produce 22.5m lbs of nickel and 77.5m
lbs pounds of copper annually. The mine is expected to employ about 200
people.
As recently as last year, nickel producers were cutting production to bring
supply into line with demand. But the market has turned sharply in recent
months.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: End of the line for bauxite
body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the International Bauxite Association have agreed it will be
dissolved on December 31, saying that the industry and the market for the
aluminium bearing ore have become 'more transparent' and are no longer
'dominated by a few companies'.
The dissolution of the producers' group 20 years and one month after its
formation, followed the withdrawal of some members and a decision by
Jamaica, where the association has its headquarters, that it was leaving
because the IBA was no longer relevant to it.
A communique issued after an extraordinary meeting of the IBA's council of
ministers said that when the association was formed, the bauxite mining and
refining industry was dominated by 'a few multinational corporations who
largely determined the prices paid to producers. With membership which
between them produced over 80 per cent of the world's bauxite and about half
its alumina output, the IBA was able to achieve for members, adequate
returns through mutual exchange of information'.
In announcing earlier this year that Jamaica would recommend the dissolution
of the IBA, Mr Robert Pickersgill, the island's mining minister, said its
members' share of world bauxite production had fallen to about 25 per cent.
'We have said to the other members that we do not think that we are
progressing, and that we want an end to the IBA.'
The association, which bauxite and alumina (aluminium oxide) consumers had
feared would become a cartel, has acted as a data bank for its members,
allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the state of the
industry. It received a setback two years ago when Australia, its most
important member, pulled out. India, another founding member, also left.
This deprived the IBA of about 40 per cent of its budget. The situation was
worsened by a high level of delinquency among remaining members. The
association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Sierra Leone and Surinam. The association lost two founding members - the
Dominican Republic and Haiti - because their industries were shut down. It
lost another with the break-up of Yugoslavia.
The IBA was unsuccessful in expanding its membership, and failed to attract
producers such as Brazil. It also failed to broker a commodity pact between
bauxite producers and consumers under the aegis of the UN Committee on Trade
and Development because of a lack of support from either side, and because
bauxite could not be organised in pacts similar to those for other
commodities. Operations were also hampered by the failure of several members
to pay subscriptions.
In deciding to dissolve the IBA, the members maintained it had been valuable
to bauxite producers. 'Technical and market information supplied by the
secretariat equipped members with a clearer understanding of the industry,'
the council of ministers said. 'This vital ingredient enhanced not only the
quality of negotiations with companies, but facilitated the development of
further processing activities. The market has become more transparent and
the industry is no longer dominated by a few companies.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wool market, which was accelerating very close to a new seasonal peaks
under the lead of finer merinos in Australia, turned easier this week. The
merinos which previously had risen so strongly eased most sharply, while
broader types maintained steadiness. The week closed with some uncertainty
about whether the worst was over or not. The market indicator in Australia
fell from 802 to 781c/kg. Many in the trade still express long-term
confidence in the supply/demand outlook as a basis for firm prices, but when
it comes to day-to-day trading everyone agrees that price rises in recent
months have been very difficult to pass on. There is also talk of increasing
use of man-made fibres in blends, as wool gets dearer.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway forecast to move into
second place in oil exports league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in oil production and the commissioning of several new fields
in 1995 is expected to make Norway, western Europe's biggest crude producer,
the world's second largest oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia next year.
According to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, Norway's oil liquids production
will rise from 2.66m barrels a day this year to 2.97m in 1995, before
peaking at 3.22m in 1996.
Production is projected to dip to 3.11m b/d in 1997 when it begins a sharp
downturn into the next century.
Domestic oil consumption averages 170,000 b/d, leaving net exports of 2.5m
b/d this year, compared with second-placed Iran's shipments abroad of
between 2.4m and 2.7m b/d on wellhead output of 3.6m.
So far this year, Norway's production is running 10 per cent ahead of last
year's levels - even with large output losses due to annual field
maintenance in August and September - but could end 12 per cent up on 1993.
However, official production forecasts could be conservative, as new
technology and enhanced oil recovery methods have allowed oil companies to
avoid precipitous declines in output in recent years.
Alongside continuing production growth from fields such as Brage and
Draugen, which started up during the past 20 months, and the hook-up of
smaller fields into existing production systems, the largest single
increment next year is expected from the 220,000 b/d Heidrun field in the
mid-Norwegian Haltenbank region. Troll West oil, at 160,000 b/d, is
scheduled to come on stream late next year along with the 60,000 b/d
Statfjord North satellite.
Earlier this month, the 40,000 b/d Statfjord East field commenced production
but PIW anticipates that, given capacity limitations at the central
processing platform, output from the prolific Statfjord field may have to be
curtailed to allow maximum production from new fields.
The Norne field, due to start production July 1997, will add 160,000 b/d to
output, but pending the outcome of negotiations between oil companies and
the government on participation rates and royalties, the timing of other
Haltenbanken developments remains uncertain, though Norway is keen to extend
production at the highest levels possible over the longest period of time.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply tightness grips LME's
copper market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange's copper market was gripped yesterday by extreme
tightness and buyers were having to pay a large premium for metal for
immediate delivery.
'Anyone who needs copper between now and November 16 is going to have to pay
dearly for it,' warned Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company.
Another analyst, Mr William Adams, at Rudolf Wolff, said that LME copper
stocks had fallen to a level - representing only 5 1/2 weeks of consumption
 -where there was a shortage of physical metal and the backwardation
(premium for immediate delivery) was justified.
Yesterday at one stage the premium for cash copper over metal for delivery
in three months reached Dollars 55 a tonne. At the close the premium had
eased back to Dollars 50 as the cash price ended at Dollars 2,754.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 41.50, and three-month metal was Dollars 2,704.50, up
Dollars 12.50.
Mr Bielski pointed out that the cash price had risen sharply in the past two
weeks - by Dollars 200 a tonne since October 19 - and 'it seems that some
people are short (of metal) and are being squeezed and will have to pay up'.
However, he insisted that there was a fundamental shortage of copper and LME
prices indicated the supply tightness went out as far as December next year.
Mr Bielski said LME stocks were not only relatively low but also in the
wrong places - mainly in Europe and not the US where demand was heaviest -
and so 'there is no reason why the copper price should not continue its
merry way upward'. The price might reach 135 to 140 cents a pound (Dollars
2,975 to Dollars 3,086 a tonne) in the present quarter and go to 150 to 160
cents (Dollars 3,306 to 3,526) early next year, he said.
Wolff's Mr Adams suggested that, although the copper price was due for a
correction, any dip in the price encouraged more buying. 'There is a lot of
financial and non-trade interest in copper and the market is ignoring
everything else. People are getting nervous in case this powerful buying
continues.' He suggested that it was likely to continue for some time.
While the market fundamentals justified a rise in the copper price, Mr Adams
added, the investment fund and non-trade buying had accelerated the process
'and we are seeing prices today that we would not otherwise have seen until
next year'.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board spins off cattle
breeding division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Genus, the cattle breeding, farm management and animal health division of
Britain's Milk Marketing Board was spun off as a separate company this week
following the de-regulation of the milk market.
The company's Pounds 23m in net assets has been distributed to dairy farmers
who sold milk to the board between 1992 and 1993.
Mr John Craven, chief executive, said the company was facing tougher
competition in its core market of providing artificial insemination for beef
and dairy herds following the relaxation of Ministry of Agriculture rules.
This has allowed smaller operators to undercut prices.
'We clearly have to concentrate on being more efficient and giving better
value for money,' Mr Craven stressed. Genus had a turnover of Pounds 51.6m
with profits of Pounds 4.8m last year.
Mr Craven said that the next couple of years would see the completion of the
company's six-year breeding programme, which is aimed at providing high
quality semen to farmers as a replacement for imported material.
The company currently imports two-thirds of the semen used for inseminating
cattle, but Mr Craven said he hoped to halve this over the next two years.
In its breeding programme, to improve the genetic bank on offer, Genus
concentrates on animals that yield a higher proportion of protein to fat in
their milk as well as strong cows with good legs and feet.
The company expects its new commercial status will see growth in its farm
management business, animal health services and the sale of branded
products.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Property: A revamped Red Book - New rules and techniques for
valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reputation of valuers was left in such tatters by recession that
repairing the damage is going to be a long and difficult job. The question
is whether the property profession will undertake structural repairs - to
avoid similar damage during the next economic downturn - or simply try to
restore a cosmetic gloss.
By proposing to overhaul its valuation manual, known as the Red Book, the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is taking the first steps towards
restoring credibility.
Its proposals are an encouragingly swift response to the Mallinson Report
published in April, the most wide-ranging review of valuation practice
undertaken which was chaired by Mr Michael Mallinson, formerly property
director of Prudential Portfolio Managers.
The 'new' Red Book addresses only those elements of the Mallinson Report
which could be acted upon swiftly. Insurers have estimated, for example,
that almost half of all professional indemnity claims could have been
avoided if valuers had insisted on written instructions. This will now
become mandatory.
The deadline for comments on the new Red Book closed this week and the
institution has received around 80 official responses. So what do valuers
themselves make of the institution's attempts to bring practice up to
scratch?
While many comments are broadly favourable, concern centres on two main
areas: the extent to which the new Red Book should govern all work done by
valuers, including estate agency work; and the proposed introduction of new
valuation concepts to sit alongside open market value, the basis on which
valuations have traditionally been done.
Although the old Red Book became the benchmark for all valuations, its rules
only applied officially to very specific circumstances. In practice, these
were usually situations where the valuation was going to find its way into
public documents, such as published accounts, and probably comprised less
than 10 per cent of all valuation work.
But the institution has proposed that the new Red Book cover almost all
valuations, including residential. This raises the question of when an
opinion becomes a valuation.
Valuers who do a lot of agency work are often asked for a valuation within a
few days or less. Under such circumstances, they argue, enacting Red Book
requirements will simply not be practical.
Should valuers give customers what they want - a professional but speedy
response - or should they insist on a more formal approach?
The institution has suggested a compromise: advice to sellers during estate
agency work is excluded from the new Red Book, but reports given to
potential purchasers are covered.
Even so, many commercial and residential estate agents will find working
under the rigours of the Red Book something of a shock.
'The back of the envelope unfortunately remains a basic tool of the trade
for many valuers,' said Mr Jeremy Waters, senior valuation partner with
Jones Lang Wootton.
The second area of contention goes to the heart of the valuers' work. The
new Red Book will enshrine a new basis of valuation - estimated realisation
price - to complement open market valuation.
The concept of estimated realisation price has its roots in banking. Banks,
the argument runs, are not interested in what a property is actually worth
today, but how much they might raise if they decided to sell. Open market
valuations are therefore too backward-looking.
Estimated realisation price assumes a building is put on the market
immediately and involves the valuer judging how long it will take to sell
and how the market might move in the interim.
The concept was given official approval in valuation guidance note 12,
issued by the institution in conjunction with the British Bankers'
Association earlier this year.
The note was an honest effort to promote better understanding between
valuers and bankers. Since much of the litigation surrounding negligent
valuations has been brought by banks, few valuers would quibble with this
aim.
But introducing estimated realisation price into the wider context of the
new Red Book is more controversial. There are three main objections:
Most international valuation standards give open market valuation as a
common method, so the UK risks moving away from accepted international
practice by introducing an alternative.
Rather than bringing clarity to valuations, clients will become confused
about what the different bases offer.
Valuations based on estimated realisation price could be open to abuse,
because they involve an element of judgment about how the market is likely
to move.
Mr John Rich, head of valuations at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the surveyors, is
openly opposed to the introduction of estimated realisation price.
'My main concern with what is being proposed is the new definition of value.
There will be widespread confusion about what the different bases of
valuation are supposed to provide,' he says.
The debate surrounding the new basis of valuation underlines that the next
phase of the reform process will be much more controversial. The Mallinson
Report suggested a fresh look at the all-risks yield approach, the method of
valuation used when open market evidence is not available. It also called
for work on alternative methods based on the cashflow of a building.
The report did refute suggestions that the all-risks yield approach was
simplistic compared with valuation approaches used in other financial
markets. But it also acknowledged that methods of valuation should withstand
scrutiny if the profession is to retain clients' confidence. Reforms
proposed so far do not go far enough.
Much therefore depends on behind-the-scenes work on valuation techniques and
the response of valuers to further reform. The real test will be whether the
profession is prepared to adopt methods more in tune with the needs of its
clients, even if that means changing other cherished tools of the trade.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mallinson Report recommendations still to be addressed
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Modification of all-risks yield approach
 -Codifying discounted cashflow techniques
 -Development of definition of worth (as opposed to value)
 -Development of methods for expressing valuation uncertainty
 -Standards for measuring and expressing price trends

FT  04 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slightly lower in quiet
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were slightly lower in quiet trading yesterday as the
market calmed down following an extremely volatile Wednesday that saw yields
flirt with 2 1/2 -year highs.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 93
9/32 , yielding 8.093 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/32 lower at 99.26
to yield 6.960 per cent. Trading was light as investors awaited key figures
on US employment due out today.
Prices slightly in the early morning on stronger than expected figures on
single-family home sales, which increased by 2.6 per cent in September over
the same period last year.
By mid-morning, prices bounced back as the Federal Reserve once again
stepped in to support the dollar, even though the US currency had held its
own in early trading.
However, by late afternoon prices slipped again, in line with the slight
decline in the dollar.
News of a drop in jobless claims that was lower than analysts had forecast
also contributed to steadiness in the bond markets.
Claims fell by 3,000 to 321,000 in October, which was good news ahead of
today's employment data. Some analysts predict the government's figures will
show an increase in October non-farm payrolls of 300,000, which would be
slightly above recent trends.
If the figures are much stronger, the market fears the Fed will raise
interest rates immediately rather than wait for its November 15 open market
committee meeting.
The value of the dollar will continue to be closely watched by traders who
are worried that it may spark inflation and deter foreign buyers from
investing in US assets.
As bond traders continued their tense vigil for today's US jobs data,
European government bonds spent most of the day drifting sideways.
Prices staged a late rally when the US Fed stepped into the foreign exchange
market to support the dollar, but drifted lower in after-hours trading.
German government bonds rallied into the close, supported by the Fed's
intervention and a bout of short-covering in the futures pits.
The December bund futures contract on DTB breached psychological resistance
at 89.00 to close at 89.07, up 0.31 on the day.
Prices slipped slightly on buoyant manufacturing orders data for September,
but the numbers had no lasting effect on bunds.
Although the figures were much stronger than expected, they were partly
distorted by seasonal factors.
Moreover, broken down into its components, the release was 'excellent from a
bond market view', painting a picture of export and investment-led growth,
said Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets.
French bonds closed higher, buoyed by strength in other markets and the
successful auction of FFr19.5bn in nine-, 11- and 15-year government bonds.
The paper attracted solid demand, resulting in bid-to-cover ratios of
between 1.7 and 2.4, and was broadly distributed, dealers said. The
unexpected success of the sale prompted some short-covering in the futures
contracts traders had sold before the auction.
UK gilts traded roughly in line with most other European markets, with
traders reporting thin cash activity. The long gilt futures contract on
Liffe closed at 100 3/16 , up  1/8 .
Prices - especially among shorter-dated stock - rose early in the day on
waning fears of an imminent interest rate increase.
Dealers were relieved that the Bank of England did not signal a change in
lending rates at its open-market operations following yesterday's meeting
between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer.
However, given that the last base rate increase came five days after their
meeting, dealers said they would remain cautious, especially ahead of
today's crucial US data.
Swedish bonds took another hit from the first opinion poll on European Union
membership showing a majority of 'no' votes. Bonds, which have been
discounting a 'yes' victory, fell sharply, with the yield on the new 11-year
issue jumping by 24 basis points to 11.43 per cent.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Strong demand for DM300m 10-year offer
from the IADB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euromarkets saw few issues yesterday, continuing the trend of recent
weeks.
The Inter-American Development Bank brought a DM300m 10-year deal which lead
manager Deutsche Bank Frankfurt said was launched at 2.30pm and when
syndicate broke 20 minutes later held steady at 20 basis points over the
government bond.
Deutsche also said this was the first time the IADB had brought a deal using
the fixed-price re-offer system, and the first time it had used competitive
negotiation to decide on a lead manager.
Demand was good, with 30 per cent coming from Germany, 20 per cent from
Swiss retail, 5 per cent from Asia and the rest from the UK and the Benelux
countries.
Bayerische Hypobank came with a four-year Ecu100m offering via BZW, which
followed a five-year Ecu deal last week. BZW said there had been good
demand, mostly from retail investors in Europe attracted by the name.
BZW also brought a convertible bond for Teco Electric &amp; Machinery, the
Taiwan industrial group, which came at a 3 per cent premium.
BNG came with a Ecu150m deal with a four-year maturity through SBC shortly
after the BZW deal for Bayerische Hypobank. SBC, which was yesterday named
with Goldman Sachs to handle the Republic of South Africa's global dollar
issue likely to come to market early next year, said demand for the BNG deal
was strong.
Societe General Acceptance brought a zero-coupon Dollars 250m deal with a
three-year maturity via Lehman Brothers and Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull, which was targeted at European retail demand.
The Instituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's state-owned industrial holding
company, is poised to issue a Y30bn bond later this month, providing a
further boost to the popular yen sector.
The issue, part of a Dollars 2bn euro medium-term note programme, follows a
Dollars 150m five-year FRN offering in May and a Dollars 650m fixed-rate
issue in November.
INI, Spain's largest borrower on the euromarkets after the government, had
originally intended to raise Ecu funding but changed tack in the summer.
It expects to raise up to 70 per cent of the funds from Japanese investors
and will swap the proceeds into a range of European currencies including
pesetas.
Merrill Lynch and Banco Argentaria de Negocios, the investment bank in which
the government has a majority stake, will co-lead the issue, with Merrill as
book-runner.
Maturity is still undecided but the pricing is expected to be tight. INI
typically pays between 5 and 10 basis points more than the Kingdom of Spain
in the euromarkets, a disparity which is due to the smaller size of its
borrowing, according to officials.
Only 30 per cent of the Pta700bn debt owed by the INI holding group is held
by overseas creditors, with that percentage much smaller when all the
group's 600 companies are taken into account.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel to settle Russian oil
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International trading in the shares of JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), Russia's
giant oil and gas construction company, is set to begin on Monday following
the successful private placement of some Dollars 25.5m of the company's
equity with international investors.
The shares have been issued by a RNGS holding company based in Cyprus, which
in turn holds RNGS's equity. The structure has been adopted to avoid the
difficulties associated with share settlement in Russia, functioning in the
same way as a system based on American or global depositary receipts, paper
which represents underlying equity.
The paper, equal to 3.7 per cent of RNGS's equity, has been distributed by
Rhone Finance of Geneva and ICE Securities, a London broker which
specialises in Italian and central European markets.
Settlement will be available by Cedel, the European share clearing system.
'This is the first time that international investors have been able to make
settlement in Russian equities outside of Russia,' said Mr Chris Woodgate,
of ICE Securities.
Under the terms of the placement the shares carry a fixed 8 per cent annual
US dollar dividend payable half-yearly and premium redemption rights by way
of a put.
RNGS, which has agreed to allow up to 10 per cent of its equity to be issued
to foreign investors, is one of a number of Russian companies seeking to
raise capital on the international markets.
Gazprom, the country's gas company, could raise several billion dollars if
its plans to issue global depositary receipts, currently scheduled for 1995,
are successful. Gazprom is seeking to sell 9 per cent of its equity.

<TEXT>
The New York Mercantile Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange have
announced a link that will allow Australian futures traders to trade New
York's popular oil and energy contracts through an electronic hook-up at
non-member rates.
The agreement will put the Nymex's west Texas benchmark intermediate crude
futures and options contracts into the Asian time zone for the first time.
The electronic link is expected to be operational by September 1995.
The announcement may overshadow a mutual offset agreement being discussed by
London's International Petroleum Exchange and another large Asian trading
centre, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.
'The SFE wants to establish itself as a major commodity exchange in the
region,' said Mr Hosking, chief executive of the SFE. 'This is just a
beginning.'
He said the agreement would not affect a long-term feasibility study his
exchange is conducting with the Chicago Board of Trade to share trading in
government bond futures.

<TEXT>
Earnings at Molson, the diversified Canadian brewing group, were hit in the
latest quarter by continuing problems at the US arm of Diversey, its
cleaning services subsidiary, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Earnings for the second quarter to September 30 fell to CDollars 32.7m
(USDollars 24m), or 56 cents per share, from CDollars 37.2m, or 63 cents, a
year earlier. Revenues dipped to CDollars 759.8m from CDollars 769.3m.
Molson Breweries, which is jointly owned by Molson, Australia's Foster's
Brewing and Miller of the US, reported little-changed quarterly operating
profits of CDollars 36.1m.
Sales in the US jumped by 56 per cent to 1.4m hectolitres in the six months
to September 30, due mainly to the launch of Molson Ice in August 1993. But
earnings were hit by a price war in some domestic markets.
Diversey's operating profit tumbled to CDollars 17.2m from CDollars 25.2m,
despite a 15 per cent increase in sales. A loss of CDollars 8.4m was posted
in the US for the six months to September 30.

Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, one of Norway's largest shipowners, disclosed yesterday

its core business,' said Mr Leif Terje Loddesol, chief executive.
The two Finnish sellers, which each disposed of a 15 per cent stake, are
Hollming Oy Shipping and Wicoria Oy.
The terms of the deal call for the Norwegian shipowner to pay Dollars 41.9m
in cash for 30 per cent of Wilhelmsen Lines, and gives the sellers an option
from January through March next year to each acquire 275,000 class B Wilhelm
Wilhelmsen shares. Should the option not be taken up by March 31, Wilhelm
Wilhelmsen will complete the transaction by remitting the outstanding
Dollars 5.3m in cash to Hollming and Wicoria.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Komatsu steps up its foreign
shopping spree - The Japanese group is increasing its imports of components
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be unpalatable for many Japanese manufacturers to import components,
but such a move has become increasingly attractive because of the strong yen
and relatively high labour costs at home.
Ending a relationship with a domestic supplier can be 'difficult to handle,'
says Mr Kazuhiro Aoyagi, president of Komatsu Europe International, the
Brussels-based European co-ordination centre for Japan's largest
construction equipment group.
But in spite of such difficulties Mr Aoyagi believes that it is inevitable
that the purchase of foreign components will increase. Komatsu is well
placed to spread its net wide. He notes that Komatsu imported Y7.4bn
(Dollars 77m) of parts to Japan last year, accounting for 3.4 per cent of
its total procurement for construction equipment. In the current financial
year, this will rise to 4.95 per cent.
The targets for 1995 and 1996 are 8 per cent and 10.7 per cent,
respectively, he says.
Komatsu is keen to bolster the competitiveness of its five domestic
manufacturing plants for construction equipment and so protect its dominant
position in the Japanese market and make it easier to export.
To achieve this, it aims to use the supply network set up as part of its
global expansion over the past two decades. That network has already been
used to good effect.
The group's foreign plants have been given considerable flexibility to make
their own arrangements for parts, since only vital components are produced
according to Komatsu drawings.
Furthermore, local content agreements have obliged the company to develop
links with parts suppliers in Europe, the Americas and Asia. At Komatsu UK
in Birtley, north-east England, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of each
excavator is sourced 'locally', that is in the UK or continental Europe.
In the past two years, Komatsu has been increasingly importing into Japan
parts made by or for its foreign manufacturing plants. This began in 1983
with imports of cast steel parts from Komatsu do Brasil. Four years later,
Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries began shipping cast steel parts to Komatsu
 -using manufacturing facilities it had bought from Komatsu's Osaka plant.
In 1990, new plants were set up in Indonesia enabling Komatsu to import
casting and fabricated components from Komatsu Indonesia, while a joint
venture two years later with Hokuriku United Forging Industry in Indonesia
saw the beginning of imports of forgings for undercarriages. The aim of
these initiatives was to take advantage of lower costs in Japan's
neighbouring countries, says Mr Aoyagi.
Also in 1992, undercarriage parts from Berco of Italy became the first
European components to be imported to Komatsu in Japan. Berco had been
supplying replacement parts for Komatsu's European distribution network.
This year, the Japanese factories began taking seats and floor mats from Kab
and T-Mat, two UK companies which supply the Birtley plant, and started
importing hydraulic hoses from Gates in the US, a supplier to Komatsu
Dresser, a US unit.
Imports of sheet metal and fabricated parts from China will double next
year, says Mr Aoyagi, and there will be a big increase of parts from Cummins
Engine of the US to produce its engines in Japan - an important element of
the two companies' business alliance announced last year.
For its Japanese plants, Komatsu will mainly source castings and
fabrications from Asian countries because of their low labour and
transportation costs, and the relatively lower production technology needed.
More sophisticated machined components will be sourced mainly from the US
and Europe. Mr Aoyagi says that one possibility would be to export
wheeled-loader transmissions and axles produced by its Hanomag subsidiary in
Germany to Japan and the US.
Direct export of parts from eastern Europe to Japan is unlikely because of
high transport costs. However, Komatsu would benefit indirectly from eastern
Europe's low labour rates because of the network of suppliers Hanomag has
developed in countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The procurement initiative is an important element in Komatsu's broad
globalisation policy, which involves producing machines and sourcing
components where it makes best sense to do so, while minimising new
investment on manufacturing facilities.
Inevitably, this has meant that complete machines - articulated dumptrucks
from Norway and big all-terrain cranes from Germany - are being imported
into Japan.
Production of other models has been switched from Japan to plants in their
main markets, from which they can be exported worldwide. In the most recent
changes, announced last year, production of big dozer-tractors and wheeled
loaders has moved to the US, and that of small crawler-tractors to Brazil to
serve the US and South American market. Making big excavators (over 30
tonnes) at Birtley is also under review.
The result is that Komatsu's highly capital-intensive Japanese plants
accounted for only 89.4 per cent of its global construction equipment sales
last year, down from 98.9 per cent a decade ago.
Komatsu will not say how much money it is saving by importing components to
Japan. Mr Aoyagi says in each case it takes three to four years to calculate
the benefits. But doubtlessly it will expect to reduce the cost of the
component by increasing the volume - wherever it does its shopping.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Thailand aims to set up
futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and VICTOR MALLET

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission wants to see a financial
futures exchange established in Bangkok to complement the development of
domestic equity and debt markets, a senior official said.
Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary-general, said a report
commissioned by the SEC from the US consultants Powers Research recommended
the introduction of derivatives as a means of aiding capital formation,
improving efficiency in the allocation of savings and strengthening the
financial system.
Legislation has been drafted and is being studied by US regulatory
authorities and the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector
arm of the World Bank, he said. The hard task now was to convince the
government against a backdrop of international concern over the use of
derivatives and the losses incurred in this area by large companies such as
Procter and Gamble.
While brokers expect the exchange to be set up within a couple of years,
they say an awkward precondition, which is flagged in the consultants'
report, is the need for the government to legitimise short-selling of
equities in the cash market. At present this is banned as part of official
efforts to prevent artificial manipulation of prices.
Unless the government goes ahead, however, derivative markets for Thai
financial instruments will simply be established offshore. Indeed, brokers
are already working on such products.
The report said a stock index contract should be the first product
developed, followed by a short-term interest rate contract and foreign
exchange contracts for the D-Mark and yen against the baht.
A long-term bond contract should only be introduced after the cash market is
more fully established, it said.
Mr Prasarn said that the futures market would enable institutions to hedge
their positions, adding depth to the cash markets.
The consultants' report called, however, for a strong self-regulatory
approach, coupled with 'a broad and robust training and educational
programme' for all participants. It would help the exchange if its products
were declared eligible investments by regulators abroad, especially in the
US and Europe, it said.

St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, bounced back
to profitability in the first nine months on increased volumes and higher
prices, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Overheads were kept stable.
Net profit was CDollars 8m (USDollars 6m), or 17 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 9.9m, or 24 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars
401m, up 10.4 per cent.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 13m, or 29 cents, against CDollars 4m, or
8 cents, on sales of CDollars 197m, up 13.5 per cent.
St Lawrence recently sold its investment in Philip Environmental, a
fast-growing Ontario industrial waste management firm, for CDollars 24m and
a cement terminal and aggregate reserves. Debt has been reduced by 15 per
cent.
The company, controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, has five cement
plants in Canada and the north-eastern US, as well as a large construction
business in Ontario.

Email, the Australian white goods and industrial products company, said
yesterday that it was setting up a joint venture with three shareholders of
Indonesia's Agro Manunggal group, which owns PT Budidharma, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
Budidharma is a large distributor of steel mini-mill products in Indonesia,
and this represents Email's first move into the region.
The joint venture company, which will be 60 per cent-owned by Email's
Bisalloy subsidiary and 40 per cent by the Indonesian partners, aims to
develop a market in Indonesia for quenched and tempered steel.
This higher-strength steel plate could be used in the construction, defence
and heavy mining equipment manufacturing markets.
Initially, the product will be imported from Bisalloy and the joint venture
company will act as a distributor.
However, Mr John Hanna, Email's managing director, said the plan was to set
up local manufacturing operations once sales of the product had built up.
He forecast that this could happen within two to three years.

Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, reported group turnover up 14.2 per
cent to FFr121.7bn (Dollars 23.8bn) in the nine months to September 30,
compared with the same period last year, reports Andrew Jack in Paris.
The increase came in spite of a slower rise in demand for cars in western
Europe during the third quarter - up 3.3 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent
in the first quarter.
Outside this region, there was a third-quarter increase of 6.4 per cent, or
59,750 vehicles. This was in spite of problems with finance in China and
Iran, although there was progressive growth in regions such as Latin America
and Asia.
Total vehicle sales in the third quarter rose by 10 per cent, boosting the
total figure for the first three quarters to 1.46m.
In addition, the group reported a 37 per cent increase in its mechanical and
servicing activities to FFr5.8bn for the first nine months.

<TEXT>
African Oxygen, the South African engineering company with interests in
gases, welding and healthcare, has reported an 8 per cent increase in
after-tax profit to R136m (Dollars 39m) for the year ending in September, up
from R123m previously.
Turnover rose 19 per cent to R1.44bn from R1.2bn while trading profit jumped
15 per cent to R266m from R232m. However, net interest paid increased 37 per
cent to R44.6m from R32.7m, reflecting a rise in net borrowings to R385m
from R228m which the group attributed to a more aggressive investment
policy.
Mr Royden Vice, executive chairman, said he thought the results were
encouraging given the difficult political and economic environment of the
past year in South Africa.
He said he was particularly pleased with the acquisition of the LPG cylinder
business from Engen during the year, which makes Afrox the leading
distributor of liquefied petroleum gas in the southern Africa region.
Of the group's three main divisions, healthcare performed best and was
strengthened by the acquisition of three hospitals. Gases and welding had a
more difficult time, but Mr Vice said both had picked up recently as a
result of Afrox's involvement in several domestic capital projects.
Mr Vice said he was confident that next year should see a marked
improvement. 'Provided the economy grows and violence can effectively be
stemmed, 1995 should reflect an improved performance in all three business
areas.'

Mr Norm Fussell, chairman of Highlands Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based

yesterday that directors were increasingly confident that a mine could be
developed at Nena, the copper/gold prospect close to the Frieda River in the
West Sepik province, within four years.
The resource, he said, was estimated to contain 1.2m ounces of gold and 1.2m
tonnes of copper.
Highlands' stake in it is 66 per cent. Exploration expenditure this year is
expected to rise to K15m (Dollars 9.4m) more than treble last year's level.

group

<TEXT>
Brierley Investments yesterday paid more than NZDollars 243m (USDollars
150m) for a 26.45 per cent shareholding in Wilson and Horton, publisher of
New Zealand's biggest circulation paper, the Auckland-based New Zealand
Herald.
Brierley, founded by New Zealand corporate predator Sir Ron Brierley,
advised the stock exchange before trading began yesterday that it had bought
a 19.9 per cent stake overnight and was standing in the market for a further
5 per cent at NZDollars 9.50 a share. This was NZDollars 1.50 above the
previous day's close. The extra shares were bought within minutes.
Subsequently, Brierley bought another smaller stake.
Directors of Wilson and Horton complained they had no prior notice of
Brierley's intentions. They reminded shareholders of the statement in the
latest half-yearly profits report that the group was trading buoyantly, and
benefits were expected soon from new presses and printing technology. They
said the offer price was well below the Dollars 11.10 the shares reached in
January.
The New Zealand Herald, which frequently produces 120-page editions, has a
circulation of 245,000, about three times larger than any other New Zealand
daily.
Wilson and Horton also owns provincial newspapers and magazines with strong
sales. It has long been viewed as a takeover target, as it is the only
newspaper group in Australia or New Zealand that does not have a
shareholding by an international publishing group, and no leading
shareholder. It has also been considered an under-performer. Brierley
Investments has no other media interests.
Wilson and Horton shares closed NZDollars 1.25 higher at NZDollars 9.50, and
Brierley shares rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.25.

trade at discount

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The limited voting preferred shares issued by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation began trading on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday and
developed a large discount to the ordinary shares.
When trading opened, the preferred shares were priced at ADollars 4.90, well
below the ADollars 5.70 opening level for the ordinary shares. By the close
of business the new securities had made up some ground, finishing at
ADollars 5.14, compared with ADollars 5.85 for the ordinary shares.
The new shares had been issued, by means of a scrip issue, to existing News
Corporation shareholders on a one-for-two basis.
They have been the subject of much debate, because of Mr Murdoch's recent
struggle to find a means of raising new capital for News Corporation without
loading the group with new debt or further diluting his family's equity
interest.
Last year, Mr Murdoch attempted to issue a new class of shares with 'super'
voting rights, but the proposal was scotched by institutional opposition.
Last month, News said it was activating the preferred shares, as their
potential issue had been approved by shareholders in 1990. No stock was
issued at that stage.
Provided investors can be found to buy the new shares, voting rights for
which are extremely limited, capital to fund acquisitions can be raised
through the issue of more preferred stock without diluting the Murdoch
family's stake. However, the smaller the discount between the new shares and
the ordinary shares, the more advantageous it is for News Corporation.
The Australian Stock Exchange said it would only include the preferred
shares in the calculation of the All-Ordinaries Index, the main stock market
marker, on a long-term basis if they traded closely in line with the
ordinaries. It said it would include them for a three-month trial and then
review the situation.

Bristol-Myers Squibb said it had agreed to pay rival US pharmaceuticals
group Merck Dollars 261.5m to acquire its Calgon Vestal Laboratories
division, a maker of skin care and infection control products.
The sale of the company, which employs 700 people and had revenues last year
of Dollars 105m, is part of a previously announced move by Merck to shed
businesses outside its core human and animal health divisions. Merck said
yesterday it expected to pick a buyer for Kelco, a second division which is
for sale, by the end of the year.
Kelco is a maker of alginates and biogums, materials which are used as
stabilisers in food and other products. In 1993, it had sales of Dollars
295m and 1,300 employees.
Bristol-Myers said it would merge Calgon with its own ConvaTec division,
which makes medical devices for colostomy patients, as well as materials for
the care of wounds.
Calgon's products would complement those of ConvaTec, Bristol-Myers said.
The two companies' products would benefit from the wider distribution and
sales networks the transaction would create. ConvaTec would bring Calgon
stronger international distribution while Calgon would give ConvaTec greater
access to the US nursing home and homecare markets.

<TEXT>
Turner Broadcasting System yesterday reported a 46 per cent improvement in
third-quarter operating profits, to Dollars 88m, on revenues of Dollars
739m, up from Dollars 501m a year ago, in the wake of strong contributions
from recently-acquired units, including the New Line Cinema and Castle Rock
movie production companies.
TBS, however, reported a net loss of Dollars 5m for the period due to
several extraordinary items, including accounting changes and a charge to
cover the retirement of debt.
Mr Ted Turner, chairman of TBS, singled out the performance of the group's
New Line Cinema unit, which produced the hit film Mask, TBS's first film to
gross Dollars 100m in box office revenues. Of the Dollars 234m increase in
entertainment operations revenues to Dollars 542m, Dollars 178m came from
New Line, Castle Rock and the Hanna-Barbera animation unit, all of which
were acquired between late 1993 and early 1994.
TBS's news division, which includes the CNN network, posted an 18 per cent
increase in revenues to Dollars 163.5m. Higher domestic advertising revenues
were boosted by stronger viewer ratings, and subscription revenues increased
16 per cent, primarily because of higher sales in the US satellite dish
market.
The baseball players' strike affected TBS's miscellaneous revenues, which
include earnings from the Atlanta Braves baseball clubs. These fell 39 per
cent to Dollars 37.7m.
TBS's share price climbed Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 18 1/8 in New
York yesterday.

America West Airlines, the US airline that emerged from chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in August, yesterday said it made operating profits of
Dollars 33.9m in the third quarter to September, little changed from the
Dollars 33m it made in the same period last year.
However, the company said it had been been constrained by the bankruptcy
process from expanding its fleet of 85 aircraft during both periods, and the
latest quarter had included Dollars 5.1m of operating expense adjustments
relating mainly to additional reserves for bad debts and inventories.
Figures for net income were not comparable with the previous period's
Dollars 14.4m because fresh start reporting was adopted when America West
emerged from bankruptcy on August 25.
From July 1 to August 25 it made Dollars 19.1m, and from August 26 to
September 30 - described by the airline as a season-ally weak period - it
made Dollars 1.2m.
Mr A. Maurice Myers, chief operating officer, said America West had
increased capacity by about 7 per cent year-on-year by making more efficient
use of its aircraft. The extra seat capacity had been filled, keeping the
average load factor at 69.5 per cent.
Mr Myers said America West planned to consolidate its position in existing
markets by increasing frequencies and by expanding cautiously where
opportunities arose - as in its recent decision to initiate services to
Mazatlan and Los Cabos in western Mexico.
He said America West would differentiate itself from other carriers by
offering full service to passengers at low cost.

over Dollars 4bn deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Trade Commission said Eli Lilly had agreed to settle charges
that its Dollars 4bn acquisition of McKesson and its prescription management
business, PCS Health Systems, would substantially lessen competition in the
pharmaceuticals industry, potentially causing higher prices and reduced
quality, AP-DJ reports from Washington.
The settlement would require Lilly to ensure that its drugs were not given
unwarranted preference over competitors in connection with the
pharmacy-benefit management services Lilly will provide as a result of the
acquisition.
Lilly also agreed to build a 'fire wall' between its pharmaceutical sales
business and PCS's pharmacy benefits management business to ensure that any
Lilly division does not gain access to sensitive information about
competitors' drugs from another division, the FTC said.
The FTC said the proposed consent agreement would require Lilly to ensure
that PCS maintains an 'open formulary' - one that includes any drug approved
by a 'pharmacy and therapeutics committee'. The settlement would require
Lilly to appoint an independent committee of healthcare professionals, most
of whom not affiliated with PCS or Lilly, to evaluate drugs for inclusion in
the PCS open formulary.
The proposed settlement prohibits PCS and Lilly from sharing proprietary or
other non-public information - such as price data - from competitors whose
drugs are eligible for the PCS formulary. It also requires Lilly over the
next five years to obtain FTC approval before acquiring an interest in any
firm providing formulary services to more than 2m people in the US.
The requirement also applies to any distribution pact between Lilly and
McKesson, and/or any other wholesaler distributing Lilly products.

<TEXT>
Third-quarter earnings at Horsham, the Canadian investment holding company,
controlled by Mr Peter Munk, were lifted by a large one-time accounting gain
stemming from an issue of shares by American Barrick, the gold producer
controlled by Horsham, when it acquired Lac Minerals.
The third-quarter gain reflects the difference between the price at which
Barrick shares were issued to former Lac shareholders, and the lower value
at which Horsham carries Barrick on its books.
Net earnings, including the USDollars 136m gain, were USDollars 152.2m, or
Dollars 1.42 a share, up from Dollars 15.7m, or 15 cents, a year earlier.
Earnings were 15 cents a share without the gain. Revenues climbed to Dollars
697.9m from Dollars 552m.
Horsham's horizons have broadened with its purchase of a 47 per cent stake
in Trizec, the Calgary-based property developer, and American Barrick's
acquisition of Lac.

The fate of Kemper, the US financial services group, was thrown into doubt
as Conseco, the Indiana-based insurer, reduced the value of its bid for the
company.
The move could open the way for a renewed takeover approach from GE Capital,
the financial services arm of General Electric, or another buyer.
The lower offer, which values Kemper at Dollars 2.4bn, has been made because
the original offer probably would not win the support of Conseco's
shareholders, said Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman and chief
executive.
Many shareholders are believed to be unhappy that a fall in Conseco's share
price since June, when the original offer was made, would leave Kemper
shareholders with a far bigger proportion of the enlarged group once the
deal was completed.
The revised offer valued Kemper at Dollars 60 a share, Dollars 5 a share
less than the earlier bid.
GE Capital's offer of Dollars 60 a share in cash for Kemper in May was
rejected by Kemper's board as inadequate. The decision to spurn that bid
means it will be difficult for Kemper's directors to accept Conseco's lower
offer without facing lawsuits from shareholders.
Conseco said it had proposed the new offer to Kemper, but that its initial
offer remained in effect.
The cash portion in Conseco's revised bid is unchanged, at Dollars 56 a
share. But Kemper shareholders will now be offered fewer Conseco shares.
Under the new bid, Kemper shareholders would receive 0.1087 of a Conseco
share, in addition to the cash, leaving them with about 17 per cent of the
enlarged group.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Report casts doubt on control of
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the international capital market becomes more integrated it is becoming
impossible for even the biggest governments to control their own financial
markets, claims a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, published today.
'Market forces are proving to be irresistible,' says the report produced
over the last year by McKinsey's financial institutions group.
It says that 'the challenge for policymakers, whether or not they like the
growing power of the global capital market, is to learn to work with the
market rather than resist or control it'.
It warns that failure to tackle fiscal problems by a number of developed
countries could result in 'unsustainable levels of indebtedness'.
The report highlights four driving forces behind globalisation of markets:
liberalisation of regulation; the increased quality and availability of
information and infrastructure (and the ease with which the technology can
be transferred worldwide); the securitisation of the flow of funds; and the
growing use of derivatives.
It says that the size of the market tripled between 1980 and 1992, reaching
an estimated Dollars 35,000bn in 1992.
It could reach Dollars 53,000bn in real terms by the end of the decade, an
amount equivalent to three times the size of the gross domestic product of
the developed countries and 19 times the size of their exports.
The report predicts that market rather than government activity will
determine prices in all main markets, with a global approach to the
relationship between risk and return extending beyond bonds into equities.
The internationalisation of the commodity and bond markets which began in
the 1970s and 1980s has already begun in the equity markets, evidenced by
the recent rise in international issuance.
The report is optimistic about the developed world's capacity to generate
savings, which it expects to increase sharply over the next two decades as a
result of demographic factors. These resources can be channelled to the
investment opportunities offered by the developing world, but only if
governments adopt the right policies. 'On balance, if policy-makers can
adjust to a global framework in developing policy, we see far more potential
for benefit than harm from a mature global capital market.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Revenues increase 20% at United
Healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Healthcare, one of the leading US managed care groups, recorded a 20
per cent rise in revenues in the three months to the end of September as
enrollment in its health plans continued to grow strongly.
The Minneapolis-based group said that enrolment was up 19 per cent from a
year earlier, at 2.1m, while revenues grew to Dollars 956m. The company
restated year-ago figures to reflect acquisitions made in the meantime.
The company operates health maintenance organisations, preferred provider
organisations and other health plans, which have grown rapidly in popularity
among companies looking to hold down the cost of healthcare for their
employees.
In spite of the rapid growth in enrollment over the past year, United
Healthcare said the costs of providing medical care had risen less rapidly
than its income. Medical costs in the latest period equalled 79.4 per cent
of its premium income, down from 82.1 per cent a year before.
Net income for the third quarter rose to Dollars 80.8m, or 46 cents a share,
from Dollars 54.8m, or 32 cents, the year before, in line with market
expectations.
Earlier this year, United reported a Dollars 1.4bn profit from the sale of a
subsidiary, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, to SmithKline Beecham.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Feeding frenzy among Italian
banks - The recent spate of bids and mergers in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's treasury minister, came straight to the point
yesterday, when asked to comment on the spate of bids and mergers announced
by Italian banks in the last week.
'It's desirable that the excessive fragmentation of the Italian banking
system should be reduced,' he said.
If anything, this is an understatement. Forbidden to trespass on other
banks' territory until recently, Italy managed to arrive in the 1990s with
more than 1,000 different banks, at least one for each fair-sized town.
In terms of size, if the Japanese are the whales of the world's banking
sector - accounting for 11 out of the biggest 20 in the world rankings
prepared by The Banker magazine - then the Italians are the plankton, with
the important qualification that Italy's banks have so far proved
unattractive to their larger foreign counterparts.
Within the Italian banking system, however, a small feeding frenzy has
begun. The manoeuvres of the last week were not unexpected, and nor was the
fact that the main bids came from the two recently privatised banks, Credito
Italiano (Credit) and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), both based in Milan.
Both banks had raised cash for acquisitions through rights issues earlier in
the year.
Credit is seeking a majority stake in the Bologna-based Gruppo Bancario
Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), for which it is prepared to pay L19,000 a share,
or more than L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
Two days ago - exactly a week after news of the Credit offer leaked out -
BCI decided to make a similar approach to shareholders in Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto (Ambroveneto), with an offer of L7,000 a share, for an initial stake
of between 15 and 29 per cent. This would then be followed up by a full bid
on the same terms, in the hope of acquiring just over 50 per cent of
Ambroveneto at a cost of nearly L1,750bn.
Ambroveneto has so far refrained from comment about the BCI bid, but
Credit's offer for Rolo - less generous, according to analysts - has begun
what could turn into a hard-fought bid battle.
Credit claims its offer is not hostile, but Rolo has reacted defensively,
employing heavyweight advisers Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
International, and announcing plans to revive an abortive merger with the
Caer group, which owns 76.4 per cent of Rolo's nearest rival, the Cassa di
Risparmio in Bologna.
Rolo has been painted as the champion of the prosperous Emilia Romagna
region, with its strong local identity, but its future will depend on the
willingness of its largest shareholders, which include BNP of France and Mr
Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computer group, to hold on to
their stakes.
Whatever the outcome of these offers, analysts say they could mark the
beginning of further rationalisation in the sector.
Until recently, Italian banks had been slow to benefit from the reform of
the sector.
Some banks have taken advantage of the 1990 Amato law, which allows
foundations - the traditional shareholders in some of Italy's biggest banks
 -to float up to 49 per cent of the banks' shares on the stock market.
Others have formed loose regional alliances, but there have been few large
mergers or takeovers.
'The consolidation process has been in the works for a long time,' said one
analyst yesterday. 'I think we will begin to see other banks starting to
take talk about strengthening their links.'
Any future mergers will have to be consummated before the end of this year
if they want to benefit from tax breaks under the Amato law, but observers
say that deadline could be extended, as it has been in the past, to
encourage reluctant partners to marry.
Separately, the recent bids have reignited speculation about who stands to
benefit from the trend for consolidation.
In the short term, there are suspicions that certain investors may have
known too much about the impending Rolo bid: the group's shares rose sharply
ahead of the Credit offer.
In the longer term, sceptical observers identify the hand of Mediobanca  -
the Milan-based merchant bank - behind both the BCI and Credit moves.
Mediobanca gained an indirect influence over the two banks after
privatisation, through big corporate shareholders, and any extension of the
two banks' branch networks would provide more outlets for the sale of
Mediobanca's bonds and financial products.
There is also a suggestion, denied by the banks themselves, that Credit and
BCI have agreed to carve up the north of the country, while Banca di Roma -
the other large state-controlled bank - consolidates its position in the
south.
There is still a long way to go, however, before Italy achieves the level of
concentration of, for example, France or the UK.
Analysts believe that the country can probably support between 100 and 200
banks, and unless Credit and BCI decide to merge with one another, the
country will still lag behind in world rankings.
Mr Dini himself said yesterday that it was up to the markets to decide the
outcome of the mergers and bids tabled in the last 10 days. 'We can only
observe,' he added.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Chilean financial group opts for
Santiago share offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bicecorp, the Chilean financial services group, is aiming to increase its
capital base through an initial public offering of shares this month.
However, unlike other Chilean groups, it has chosen to raise the money in
the Santiago market, rather than New York - in spite of the likelihood that
the New York market would place a higher valuation on the issue.
Mr Eliodoro Matte, Bicecorp's president, calculates that his company's
shares will be valued in Santiago at about 14 times prospective 1994
earnings. In New York - using past flotations for banking groups such as
Banco O'Higgins as a guide - he believes the multiple would be nearer 18.
Mr Matte gives two reasons for selling the shares through the more
conservative Santiago exchange. First, for a closed corporation such as
Bicecorp, the jump to New York Stock Exchange standards of disclosure is a
substantial one. Second, he believes the price of the company's shares will
be less likely to be suffer from big shifts of sentiment in New York.
Bicecorp may be interested in a New York listing in the future, but for now
it believes Santiago-based investors are likely to have firmer hands. This
is in part because Chilean law stipulates that foreigners must hold on to
investments in Chile for at least a year.
Bicecorp, a diversified financial services group which holds the Banco BICE
investment bank and the largest stockbroker in Chile, is the first group to
be designated a bank holding company in Chile.
The group - in which the London-based Rothschild group of Sir Evelyn
Rothschild has a substantial stake - is selling new shares equivalent to 16
per cent of its capital and expects to raise about Dollars 35m.
The offering will dilute the stake of Rothschild - which does much of its
Latin American business in co-operation with BICE - to 34.17 per cent from
40.68 per cent, and that of Mr Matte's Grupo Matte to 47.67 per cent from
56.75 per cent. Rothschild has held a stake in BICE since it was founded in
1979, and boosted the stake to more than 40 per cent in 1987.
The share issue - which will be used to increase the capital of the bank to
international standards and to boost its life insurance business - will
begin trading in Santiago on November 14. The shares will be priced a few
days before that; the minimum set by the board is just under Dollars 4 a
share. The offering is being made through Bankers Trust's Chilean broking
subsidiary, Larrain Vial, and BICE Corredores.
Mr Matte said he hoped two-thirds of the shares would be placed with Chilean
and foreign institutions (Chilean pension funds are excluded from buying new
issues), and the remainder with Chilean individuals, who get tax incentives
to subscribe for new shares.

of Dollars 584m, against USDollars 16.5m, or 17 cents, on sales of Dollars
566m a year earlier.
Moore has changed its traditional forms operations towards electronic-based

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: US and French in joint bid for
Czech telecoms group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic of the US and France Telecom have joined forces in the contest
for the Czech Republic's state telecommunications company which could be
eastern Europe's biggest privatisation.
Initial bids for a 27 per cent stake in SPT Telecom - worth up to Dollars
1bn - are due in December.
N. M. Rothschild, the UK merchant bank acting for France Telecom, said
yesterday it had 'the best client and consortium going forward'. But stiff
competition will come from a grouping understood to include Koninklijke PTT
Nederland (KPN) of the Netherlands, AT&amp;T of the US and Swiss Telecom.
Two other contenders, Deutsche Telekom, the German national operator, and
Ameritech, the regional Bell company, are considering continuing the
partnership which won last year's bidding for Matav, the Hungarian state
telecommunications company.
The US-French partnership starts from a strong position in that Bell
Atlantic has an existing mobile phone operation in the Czech Republic and
France Telecom has provided technical assistance to SPT.
KPN's privatisation earlier this year is an attribute but rivals doubt that
it is ready to enter a tough bidding war.
The Czech government is sensitive about German economic influence, and
Deutsche Telekom's involvement in Hungary, where it promises to set up a
regional communication hub, will inhibit its claims to do the same for the
Czech Republic.
As important as the composition of the consortia are the identities of their
advisers and in hiring N. M. Rothschild, France Telecom has got one of the
most experienced specialists on telecommunications privatisation
N. M. Rothschild was mandated by the Hungarian government for the
privatisation of Matav and was one of the most sought-after advisers by
bidders for SPT.
It is believed that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has built on a
relationship with KPN, established during its privatisation, to work with
the Dutch operator in its Czech effort. Ameritech is thought to have
retained the other leading US advisory firm, Morgan Stanley.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Greyhound faces bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greyhound Lines, the struggling US long-distance bus operator, was yesterday
facing the threat of financial collapse following a decision by some of its
creditors to file an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the company.
A group claiming to represent 25 per cent of Greyhound's convertible
debenture holders filed the petition in a Dallas federal bankruptcy court on
Wednesday, after refusing to accept the terms of an out-of-court
restructuring proposed by Greyhound management.
Greyhound has 20 days in which to respond to the petition. The court will
then weigh up the two parties' representations and decide whether to declare
the company bankrupt.
Greyhound enjoys near-legendary status as the only nationwide provider of
long-distance bus services in the US, but it has been brought to its knees
by a combination of low domestic air fares, high levels of car ownership,
tough competition from regional bus operators, and internal management
errors.
Greyhound has missed a Dollars 4.2m debt payment due to the convertible
debenture holders on September 30, and the 30-day grace period on the
payment expired on October 31, so opening the door to a bankruptcy petition.
Yesterday, Mr Wilbur Ross of Rothschild, Greyhound's merchant bank adviser,
said that Greyhound regarded the petition as a negotiating tactic on the
part of the bondholders and would vigorously oppose it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's MAN engineering group expects to increase its dividend for the
1994-95 financial year as restructuring measures pay off and profits improve
sharply.
Mr Klaus Gotte, chairman, said the payout for the year to the end of June
1995 would win 'more applause' than last time's cut from DM8.50 to DM7
following a drop in net profits from DM230m (Dollars 154m) to DM160m.
Earnings would recover this year to between DM200m and DM300m, he said,
while next year's profits might match the record DM418m in the year to the
end of June, 1992.
The chairman forecast a clear profit from commercial vehicles this year, and
said last time's DM250m loss at MAN Roland printing press subsidiary would
be at least halved.
Reviewing business in the first quarter, Mr Gotte said sales rose 2 per cent
to DM3.32bn. Domestic turnover was down 6 per cent, while foreign sales were
up 8 per cent.
However, incoming orders for buses, trucks, presses, plant and engineering
products had risen 25 per cent in the review period to DM4.7bn. Domestic
orders were 21 per cent higher and foreign demand was up 28 per cent; as a
result, the total value of orders on hand rose 9 per cent to DM16.5bn.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stronger US ties spark 73%
profits gain at KLM

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines saw net profit soar by 73.5 per cent in the second
quarter of 1994-95 under the combined influence of cost-cutting and economic
recovery in important markets.
The quarterly net profit of Fl 354m (Dollars 208m), which compares with Fl
204m a year earlier, led to a near doubling of first-half net profit to Fl
476m from Fl 244m.
Profit per share in the first half rose by a more modest 15 per cent to Fl
5.22, because of the 60 per cent expansion of KLM's ordinary share capital
in early 1994.
KLM also attributed its strong performance to the further deepening of its
partnership ties with Northwest Airlines of the US, though Northwest's
figures are no longer included in the Dutch carrier's profit and loss
account.
Turnover rose by 6.2 per cent to Fl 2.55bn, outstripping a 2.8 per cent
increase in operating costs to Fl 2.17bn.
KLM's shares rose from Fl 47.30 to Fl 48 yesterday in response to the
results.
KLM has introduced a wage freeze for the calendar year 1994, and the airline
is also benefiting significantly from a pension premium 'holiday' agreed
with the company's three pension funds in 1993.
The productivity gains and strict cost controls enabled it to cut unit costs
by 5 per cent.
Overall traffic, including passengers, cargo and post, rose by 9 per cent in
the quarter, which covers the busy summer holiday months from July to
September. Capacity rose by 6 per cent, enabling KLM to lift its load factor
by 1.7 percentage points to 77.1 per cent.
In passenger traffic, yields remained stable, in contrast to previous
quarters when yields were under pressure. But cargo yields fell by 5 per
cent.
KLM said the upward trend was expected to continue in the second half,
provided the general economic climate continues to improve.
However, the pace of the improvement will be slower than in the second half
of last year, when losses narrowed sharply to Fl 141m from Fl 770m a year
earlier. KLM's financial year ends on March 31.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: MoDo sells packaging unit to
AssiDoman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AssiDoman plans to strengthen its position in European packaging papers by
acquiring MoDo Packaging from MoDo, its fellow Swedish pulp and paper group,
in a deal worth SKr1.2bn (Dollars 167m).
The move increases AssiDoman's market share in sack paper, expands its
position in the important UK and German markets, and creates co-ordination
benefits.
MoDo Packaging comprises a pulp and paper mill at Skarblacka in Sweden and
two sack companies in England (Papropack) and Germany (Herkules). The unit
made a SKr36m operating profit on sales of SKr1.01bn in the first half of
1994, compared with a SKr16m profit and sales of SKr955m in the same 1993
period.
Mr Lennart Ahlgren, AssiDoman president, said the purchase represented 'a
major step on the way to a position of leadership in Europe in packaging
paper'.
Mr Bengt Pettersson, MoDo chief executive, said the group was selling the
smallest part of its paper business, and would make a modest capital gain on
the transaction. 'This will enable us to focus on fine papers, printing
paper and carton-board,' he said.
It clears the way for MoDo to approve a SKr2.1bn investment in a new
newsprint machine without having to fund the move through a rights issue.
MoDo will give a final decision on the project later this month.
The purchase will lift the annual sales of AssiDoman, which was partly
privatised by the Swedish government earlier this year, by SKr2.1bn to about
SKr18bn. This means it will overtake MoDo in size to become Sweden's third
largest forestry group
The purchase will increase AssiDoman's share of the European market for
unbleached sack paper from 18 per cent to 26 per cent and its share of the
bleached sack paper market from 24 per cent to 32 per cent.

<TEXT>
A sharp rise in domestic interest rates, which hit Norway's bonds and
shares, were behind weaker nine-month results reported yesterday by Fokus
Bank and Sparebanken Nor.
The banks, however, recorded sharp declines in losses on loans and
guarantees.
Norway's banks are recovering from the sector's worst post-war crisis and
this year have benefited from a strong domestic economy which has
significantly improved the performance of loan portfolios.
This week Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two biggest commercial
banks, reported strong interim figures and indicated they might pay
dividends for 1994. The banks say loan losses will continue to decline and
stabilise by next year at normal levels.
In contrast, Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, reported a
dip in pre-tax profit to NKr244.3m (Dollars 37.5m) from NKr246.8m as net
interest income fell by NKr66m to NKr755m.
Non-interest income was almost halved to NKr233.3m from NKr449.2m,
reflecting securities losses of NKr36.2m, against gains of NKr113m a year
earlier. Foreign currency gains fell by NKr11.6m to NKr35.2m.
Losses on loans and guarantees declined dramatically to NKr66.9m from
NKr251.1m, but operating profit before loan losses was cut by NKr164.4m to
NKr335.6m.
Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, reported a steep fall in
nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr487m from NKr1.03bn.
Net interest income dropped by NKr27m to NKr2.3bn while non-interest income
fell to NKr539m from NKr1.56bn.
The bank suffered securities losses of NKr282m, against gains of NKr717m,
with bond losses of NKr324m, against gains of NKr554m last year.
Operating profit, before loan losses, plunged by more than half to NKr887m
from nearly NKr2bn.
On the bright side, loan losses were cut by 58 per cent to NKr401m from
NKr944m and the bank achieved a strong third-quarter net profit of NKr224m,
up sharply from NKr39m in the second quarter.
Mr Kjell Kran, group managing director, said the positive outlook for the
remainder of the year and strong results so far meant the bank will be able
pay a solid dividend for 1994.

FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Jump in Rhone-Poulenc income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower tax charges helped lift net income at Rhone-Poulenc, the French
pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, in the first nine months. Group income
rose 47.4 per cent to FFr1.14bn (Dollars 222m), compared with the same
period in 1993.
The company yesterday said consolidated net sales improved 6.4 per cent to
FFr63.4bn, reflecting growth in all sectors. The largest increases came in
organic and inorganic intermediates, up 8 per cent, and fibres and polymers,
up 17.8 per cent.
It said operating income would have increased 24.6 per cent if the results
excluded provisions for restructuring expenses and non-recurring items. In
the first half it announced FFr699m provisions in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its
US drugs unit.
The income tax provision fell to FFr647m from FFr1.16bn, while the charge
for minority interests also fell sharply to FFr697m, compared with FFr1.06bn
in the first nine months last year.
The group said the reduction reflected the merger with Institut Merrieux,
and offset a decline in foreign exchange gains and capital gains on asset
disposals which were much higher this year.
Net income for the third quarter alone jumped sharply to FFr807m, compared
with a loss of FFr299m last year while net sales rose 7.5 per cent to
FFr21bn.
The company believed the Full-year outlook remained positive and predicted
an increase in net income due to improve doperations and a capital gain on
the sale of assets.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Elf sells 10% of its Enterprise holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, has sold a 10 per cent stake in
Enterprise Oil, the UK company which earlier this year failed in its hostile
bid for fellow explorer Lasmo.
Elf raised Pounds 187.5m from the placing of 50.8m shares at 369p,
representing 10.3 per cent of Enterprise. The placing price of 369p compares
with an Enterprise share price of 451p before the bid for Lasmo.
The sale was widely expected after Elf's decision earlier this year to
re-classify the Enterprise holding as non-core. Elf has set a target for
this year of FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) from the sale of such assets, as part of a
restructuring programme.
Elf continues to hold 12.9 per cent of Enterprise through the joint venture
company Elf Enterprise Petroleum. The company said yesterday's sale would
not affect the joint venture, which operates three North Sea fields and the
Flotta oil terminal in the Orkney Islands. Elf has a two-thirds share in the
joint company.
Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director of Enterprise Oil, said: 'The disposal
of this block of shares should not be interpreted to mean the unravelling of
the joint venture. Both Elf and Enterprise are content that it should
continue to exist.'
Elf Enterprise Petroleum was formed in 1991 to buy out the North Sea assets
of Occidental, the US group, for Pounds 800m. It was attacked by Lasmo
during Enterprise's unsuccessful bid. Lasmo claimed the venture had been 'a
disastrous investment', with losses of Pounds 238m in 1993, debts of Pounds
1bn and gearing of more than 200 per cent.
Mr Shilston said Enterprise became aware several weeks ago that Elf intended
to place its stake. Under a shareholders' agreement, Elf had to consult
Enterprise over the placing and could not sell the shares to any one buyer.
Mr Shilston said he did not know which institutions had taken up the shares.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sage shares up 51p to 656p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sage Group jumped 51p to 656p after the personal computer
accounting software company reported record sales and pre-tax profits and a
significant acquisition in the French accounting software market.
The Newcastle-based company is paying Pounds 18.7m for Saari, the leader in
the French market. Its position is broadly comparable to Sage in the UK.
The deal will be financed, unusually for Sage, by a Pounds 20m unsecured
five-year loan. There is no earn-out provision, no penalty for early
repayment and on a pro forma basis, interest payments are covered eight
times.
Saari is Sage's second acquisition in France following the purchase of Ciel
in 1992. Ciel sells accounting software at the low end of the market,
whereas Saari's products are directed at the small and medium-sized business
sector.
Mr David Goldman, Sage chairman, said there were considerable possibilities
for rationalisation within Saari to improve margins and profits.
The French company turned over Pounds 29.1m last year, but profits were only
Pounds 1.9m. Its operating margin of 7 per cent compares with 44 per cent
for Sage in the UK.
Mr Goldman said Saari employed 110 people in sales and marketing, compared
with only 12 for Sage. A new chief executive and finance director are being
sought and some Pounds 1.5m has been earmarked for restructuring, which is
expected to take about 30 months. The French company is expected to make an
immediate contribution to profitability.
In the year to September 30, Sage raised pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to
Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 9.66m). Turnover increased 23 per cent at Pounds 50.9m
(Pounds 41.3m), including Pounds 22.3m from sales of upgrades, services and
other products to existing customers.
Earnings per share advanced to 45.4p (32.5p). The dividend for the year is
raised 10 per cent to 10.91p (9.92p) including a final of 7.26p (6.6p).
Net cash at the year end came to Pounds 4m after Pounds 9m was spent on
earlier acquisitions and capital investment.
DacEasy, the principal US subsidiary, raised operating profits by 86 per
cent to Pounds 2.2m on revenues of Pounds 12.9m, demonstrating recovery from
problems experienced last year.
COMMENT
The accounting software business was, Mr Paul Walker, Sage chief executive,
said yesterday 'very simple.' Over the years the company has benefited from
a spare, simple approach to management. Its latest acquisition will clearly
benefit from this approach. Mr Goldman is justifiably pleased with the price
paid - 64 per cent of sales - compared, say, with Microsoft's acquisition of
Intuit for six times sales. Sage's one slip - some carelessness over the
management of DacEasy in the US - was swiftly corrected and the same mistake
is unlikely to be made with Saari. With estimated profits of Pounds 17m -
Pounds 18m this year giving a prospective p/e of between 12 and 13, the
shares are very reasonably priced.

The company had warned in September that its viability would be in doubt if
bankers refused to renew its lines of credit. The company added that its two
banks had agreed to extend the company's facilities until the end of
December while a range of possibilities for restructuring the company's
finances were examined. Enterprise, originally a seller of used mainframe

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Celsis settles with sacked chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more acrimonious corporate sackings in recent years came to a
sudden and apparently amicable end yesterday in a deal that will probably
make Mr Tony Martin, former chief executive of Celsis, the biotechnology
company, a millionaire.
Mr Martin was sacked without compensation in March 1994 on the grounds that
he was 'ineffectual'.
Celsis then sought judicial confirmation that the termination of the
contract was lawful. Mr Martin counterclaimed, alleging unfair dismissal and
said he would sue for defamation.
All these actions will now be suspended. Celsis will pay Mr Martin Pounds
80,000 in a 'without prejudice' payment, and a contribution of up to Pounds
40,000, which Mr John McKinley, Celsis' lawyer, said would be likely to
account for all costs and expenses.
Celsis also agreed, subject to shareholders' approval, to establish and lend
sufficient funds to a share option trust for the benefit of unnamed senior
staff, which would buy 500,000 shares in the company from Mr Martin at a
price of 48p per share.
In addition, Mr Martin will keep 1.3m shares in the company, worth Pounds
923,000 at yesterday's closing price of 71p.
Mr Martin felt he had won a moral victory.
Since his departure from Celsis, he has taken up two biotechnology
non-executive directorships, one in the US and one in Ireland. He plans to
accept a third and said yesterday that he had been offered executive
positions.
Cambridge-based Celsis, which specialises in contamination detection
equipment, said it 'wishes Mr Martin every success in his future
endeavours'.
It appointed Mr Arthur Holden, from Baxter International of the US, as his
replacement in September.

to Pounds 25.1m pre-tax profits came to Pounds 154,000.
In the previous first half pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.02m, because
of an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.3m related to the disposal of
discontinued activities.
In the period under review, the precision engineering and systems division

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Maverick who thumbed his nose at
respectability and the establishment - John Plender and David Wighton chart
a career which led from Paddington station to an international business
turning over more than Pounds 5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 33 years' fighting opponents inside and outside Lonrho it always
seemed unlikely that Mr Tiny Rowland would go quietly.
However, maintaining his reputation for unpredictability to the last, he
appears finally to have agreed to do just that.
He once said that the last thing he wanted was for Lonrho to be respectable
but he has, at last, succumbed to the forces that want to make it so.
Born Roland Walter Fuhrhop, of a German father and Anglo-Dutch mother, Mr
Rowland is a natural outsider and maverick. He has never been accepted by
the UK business or political establishment and seemed to enjoy his
controversial reputation.
In 1973 when Edward Heath, then Prime Minister, famously described him as
'the unacceptable face of capitalism' he replied that he would not want to
be the acceptable face.
Educated first in Germany, then briefly in England, he was detained on the
Isle of Man during the second world war, when he was suspected of Nazi
sympathies. His experiences after the war, which included compulsory
employment as a porter at Paddington station in London, as well as business
ventures in which he fell foul of the Inland Revenue, were not designed to
endear him to his adopted country.
In his early thirties, Africa provided an opportunity for a new start. Yet,
here too, he met with a mixed reception. When he acquired effective control
of Lonrho in 1961, he did so in the face of considerable hostility from the
Rhodesian establishment.
Just over 10 years later came the notorious boardroom power struggle, which
caused the outburst from Mr Heath, in which Sir Basil Smallpeice and a group
of directors known as the 'straight eight' sought without success to unseat
him from executive office.
The pretext was Mr Rowland's failure to reveal to his board the granting of
options to Mr Alan Ball, the chairman, and Mr Angus Ogilvy, executive
director and husband of Princess Alexandra. Mr Ogilvy had been instrumental
in introducing Rowland to Lonrho. Part of the effect of the granting of
options was to reduce the two men's ability to act independently of Mr
Rowland. While Mr Rowland ultimately won the vicious battle for control with
the support of small shareholders, he lost Mr Ogilvy, who resigned from the
board. He also alienated most of the City and the wider British
establishment.
He has never been squeamish about upsetting public opinion either. In 1992,
he sold a stake in Lonrho's hotel chain to the Libyan government which was
subject to United Nations sanctions following the Lockerbie bombing. In an
article in The Observer, then owned by Lonrho, he declared that he hoped to
give 'a lot of enjoyable annoyance to everybody'.
During the 1980s Mr Rowland became increasingly distracted by a vigorous
pursuit of those he perceived to be his enemies. When Mr Alan Bond had the
temerity to plan a takeover bid for Lonrho Mr Rowland ruthlessly exposed the
Australian entrepreneur's shaky finances.
However, Mr Rowland's main adversary was the Egyptian-born Mr Mohamed Fayed,
a former director of Lonrho, who with his two brothers had acquired, in the
mid-1980s, the House of Fraser stores group, owner of Harrods, which Mr
Rowland had long coveted.
In 1977, Mr Rowland first drew up a plan to take over House of Fraser. Four
years later he made a Pounds 226m bid which was blocked by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission on the grounds that it was against the public
interest.
In 1984 Lonrho sold its Fraser shares to the Fayeds who Lonrho believed were
'neither qualified nor capable' of bidding for the whole. However, they
gained control with a Pounds 615m bid which became the subject of a highly
critical Department of Trade and Industry report and prompted years of legal
wrangling.
In the vendetta against the Fayed brothers Lonrho's cash was diverted to the
cause, weakening finances already stretched by years of acquisitions. Mr
Rowland built Lonrho from a turnover of Pounds 4m in 1961 to a group with
sales of more than Pounds 5bn and profits at their peak of Pounds 272m.
Yet from the shareholders' point of view the lucrative period was chiefly
confined to the 1960s. This was despite the disadvantage of a heavy
concentration of mining assets in Southern Rhodesia at the time of Ian
Smith's Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
Mr Rowland attracted a strong following of loyal private shareholders whom
he kept sweet by paying, what turned out to be, unsustainably high
dividends. When he was finally forced to cut the dividend last year he may
have sown the seeds of his eventual departure.
In a characteristically capricious move Mr Rowland suddenly made peace with
Mr Fayed a year ago. By then Mr Rowland was also fighting an internal battle
with Mr Dieter Bock.
A little known German property dealer, Mr Bock was brought into Lonrho by Mr
Rowland as heir apparent, but relations quickly turned sour.
Before long Mr Rowland was attacking Mr Bock in public. Last October he
said: 'I'm still waiting for some performance from him. So far he hasn't
delivered a stroke of business. Frankly, he hasn't a clue.'
Mr Rowland also questioned the financial backing which enabled Mr Bock to
acquire his 18.8 per cent stake in the company. But in the end Mr Rowland
was outmanoeuvred.
One of the most flattering verdicts on Mr Rowland was delivered in the first
and most weighty of the Department of Trade's successive reports on Lonrho.
According to the DTI inspectors, he was a man who had 'vision, negotiating
ability, determination and personality in unusual measure with unbounded
energy to apply his talents'.
At 76, that energy is still all too evident, but he will shortly have to
find new uses for it.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: How Bock turned the tables on Tiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past year, the relationship between Mr Dieter Bock and Mr Tiny
Rowland became increasingly strained.
Mr Bock had ambitious plans to reorganise the business, involving cutting
central management costs and disposing of assets.
However, he felt he was being frustrated by Mr Rowland, who could count on
the support of a series of other directors, such as Mr Robert Dunlop, Mr
Rene Leclezio and Mr Paul Spicer, who had been with the company for decades.
Earlier this year, he persuaded most of Mr Rowland's closest allies to
retire, though they were not to leave immediately. However, his ultimate aim
was to secure the retirement of Mr Rowland.
Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland from his
executive duties. However, hours before September's board meeting, Mr Bock
backed off from putting a proposal that Mr Rowland should step down, because
he became concerned that he could not count on the support of a majority.
A number of Lonrho's directors, whose support Mr Bock believed he had, took
fright from challenging Mr Rowland, because they were concerned that he
would challenge any attempt to oust him through the courts.
Since then, however, Mr Dunlop and Mr Leclezio have left the company. Mr
Bock believed the balance of power had shifted irrevocably in his favour.
Nervous directors were persuaded that offering Mr Rowland the honorific
title of president represented a generous departure deal.
So Mr Bock was ready for what he hoped would be his final showdown with Mr
Rowland. The contract agreeing Mr Rowland's departure was signed at 4pm
yesterday, apparently giving Mr Bock victory. Though, as one of Mr Rowland's
oldest colleagues said, 'until I hear it from Tiny's lips, I won't believe
it'.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National takes 9.9% stake in Irish
Permanent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, has taken a 9.9 per
cent stake in Irish Permanent, the former building society which converted
and floated last month, in a move set to strengthen ties between the two
organisations.
Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said he believed there was scope for
co-operation between the two groups, perhaps in areas such as Treasury
operations or shared use of cash dispenser networks.
Mr Roy Douglas, Irish Permanent chief executive, said the move by Abbey was
a 'vote of confidence.'
Welcoming the prospect of co-operation in some areas, he said he saw few
opportunities for this in terms of life insurance business: Abbey National
owns Scottish Mutual, while in July Irish Permanent bought Prudential Life
of Ireland for Pounds 30m cash.
Mr Birch said Abbey intended to maintain a long-term minority investment in
Irish Permanent, and would keep its options open.
Irish legislation says that no organisation can have a stake of more than 10
per cent in a licensed bank without approval from the central bank; and that
no one can own more than 15 per cent of a former building society for five
years after conversion.
Abbey's stake in Irish Permanent, which has been built up over the past
week, cost between Pounds 15m and Pounds 17m overall. On a per share basis
the range was between 180p and 220p.
Irish Permanent was Ireland's largest society before its conversion. It is
well-placed in the Irish retail financial market, but its cost/income ratio
is the highest in the industry in Ireland.
Abbey's move comes against a background of increasing interest in the Irish
banking sector. Both National Westminster Bank and National Australia Bank
are known to be bidding for TSB Bank (which is not connected with the TSB
group in the UK), which is currently state-owned.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save 'comfortable' with Pounds 135.6m
at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save, the UK's biggest discount grocery retailer, reported a better
than expected 7.5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits despite the
supermarket price war.
However the group, which also announced the planned acquisition of
Shoprite's mainly Scottish stores, acknowledged lower like-for-like sales in
the first eight weeks of the current year.
Pre-tax profits for the 52 weeks to August 27 increased to Pounds 135.6m,
compared with Pounds 126.3m last time, on turnover that grew 5.7 per cent to
Pounds 3.02bn (Pounds 2.86bn).
Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive, said the group had continued
to make steady progress 'in a period when the UK food retailing industry
experienced the most competitive trading conditions for many years'.
Mr Bowler brushed aside concerns that Kwik Save faces growing competition
from the limited range price discounters on one side and the superstore
chains on the other. 'If this is being squeezed,' he said, 'then I am
comfortable with it.'
The growth in full-year sales mainly reflected the opening of 70 new stores
during the year, taking the total to 861. Volumes rose just 1.3 per cent but
the combined effects of lower grocery prices and customers trading down
meant net like-for-like sales fell 0.3 per cent.
Highlighting the continued difficult trading conditions, Mr Derek Pretty,
finance director, said that in the eight weeks following August 27 total
sales rose by just 2 per cent.
Like-for-like volumes, including the effects of trading down, were 2 per
cent lower. This, together with selling price deflation of over 3 per cent,
meant the like-for-like sales value was down by more than 5 per cent.
Even so, Mr Bowler insisted that 'underlying volumes are pretty solid'.
For the full year gross margins improved by 0.1 per cent, mainly reflecting
a better margin mix and improved buying-in prices. Group operating profits
increased 7.3 per cent to Pounds 135.5m (Pounds 126.3m), despite a 25 per
cent increase in depreciation charges to Pounds 39.6m, which reflected the
introduction of a provision for depreciation on freehold and leasehold
property.
Rental income from concessions within Kwik Save stores selling fresh foods
increased by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 23.7m, while net interest costs were
little changed at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 200,000).
Group capital expenditure for the year was Pounds 100.3m (Pounds 103.2m).
New store development continuing to account for the bulk of this spending
and is projected to rise to Pounds 115m this year. Despite competitive
trading conditions, Mr Bower said the group would continue its aggressive
store-opening programme, with the target of adding another 80 stores this
year.
Earnings per share increased 3.2 per to 57.29p (55.49p), held back by a
higher effective tax charge which increased from 32.1 to 34.7 per cent. The
recommended final dividend is 13.85p (12.9p), bringing the total for the
year to 19.25p (18.3p), up 5.2 per cent.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 27m buy for Jarvis Porter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jarvis Porter Group, the specialist label printer, yesterday announced a
Pounds 27.2m acquisition alongside a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
in the six months to August 31.
Jarvis is to acquire Donprint, the Glasgow-based label printer which
specialises in 'intelligent' or barcoded labels used in the computer and
electronics industries.
The consideration will be Pounds 24.7m, of which Pounds 13.7m will be
financed through a placing of 5.17m shares at 265p each with a 3-for-23
clawback, Pounds 5m through the issue of 1.89m shares to the vendors, and
Pounds 6m in cash. The shares closed up 1p to 283p.
The cash will come from the company's own resources and existing banking
facilities.
There will be a deferred balance of up to Pounds 2.5m comprising Pounds
500,000 payable in cash on April 15 1995, Pounds 1m cash on August 7 1995,
and up to Pounds 1m to be satisfied by the allotment of further ordinary
shares to the Donprint Employee Trust.
Jarvis, which supplies the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceuticals
industries, reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.68m (Pounds 3.42m).
Turnover rose 19 per cent to Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 28m), underpinned by a
Pounds 4.13m contribution from three Dutch labelling companies acquired in
May.
Group operating profits rose to Pounds 4.77m (Pounds 3.54m), including
Pounds 838,000 from acquisitions. Margins on continuing operations rose
slightly from 12.6 to 13.4 per cent.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, said the group was increasing market
share in the current period as its multinational customers reduced the
number of smaller suppliers.
Cash flow had been strong, Mr Brewster said, and the group had ended the
period with net cash funds of some Pounds 1m.
Earnings per share emerged at 8.9p (7p) and the board announced an interim
dividend of 1.9p (1.65p).

MMT Computing, the USM-quoted computer services company, lifted pre-tax
profits 45 per cent from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.51m in the year to August
31.
Mr Mike Tilbrook, chairman, said the result was helped by an easing of the
tough trading conditions prevalent in the last few years. He said the
group's policy of working primarily for blue chip and household name clients
was the right one.
He added that MMT planned to move to a full quote 'in the near future'.
Turnover of continuing operations advanced to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.06m)
generating operating profits of Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.1m).
The final dividend is raised to 3.7p (2.75p), making 5.2p (4p) for the year,
payable from earnings of 13.1p (9p).

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sale is likely drugs prescription - Tim
Burt considers Boots' plans for its pharmaceuticals side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is likely to face tough
questions next week on its strategy from an unexpected quarter - its own
managers.
Senior staff from the pharmaceuticals division will meet head office
executives ostensibly to review the company's first-half performance. But
the year-long review of the drugs business is likely to overshadow the
proceedings.
Managers conducting the review, prompted by the withdrawal last year of the
heart drug Manoplax at a cost of almost Pounds 40m, have considered selling
the business, launching a joint venture or retaining it in a radically
restructured form.
While reluctant to indicate the group's favoured option, Mr Gordon Solway,
managing director of Boots Pharmaceuticals, warned yesterday that job losses
were inevitable.
'Whatever happens, there are bound to be redundancies in research and
development in Nottingham.'
In what may be seen as a blow to the city, he added that Boots had not asked
potential bidders to maintain a presence in the East Midlands as a condition
of any acquisition.
Of the possible options, a disposal has looked increasingly likely in recent
months following the group's decision to issue a sales memorandum and hire
Credit Suisse First Boston as financial advisers.
A number of companies have been linked with the division, which offers
laboratory and sales expertise in the the UK and a marketing and
distribution network in North America, the world's largest pharmaceuticals
market.
Zeneca, Britain's third largest drugs group, is thought to have examined the
business, but was put off by the asking price. Medeva has also ruled itself
out, leaving analysts' attention focused on continental European bidders.
They have identified three possible suitors: Knoll, part of the German BASF;
Menarini of Italy; and Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group.
Yesterday, however, Astra denied having any interest while its German and
Italian rivals refused to comment.
Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged among City analysts on Boots'
long-term intentions. Their scenario envisages the pharmaceuticals business
being sold for more than Pounds 700m, greatly strengthening the group's cash
resources.
Profits on the disposal could help fund a share buy-back, which would
reassure investors frustrated by the dilutive effect of the Pounds 900m Ward
White acquisition in 1989.
Analysts suggest the company might then feel confident enough to acquire an
over-the-counter drugs business in continental Europe, preferably in
Germany, for about Pounds 500m.
Mr Solway said although no decisions had been reached, senior managers in
the pharmaceuticals division were under no illusions about the review
process.
'They recognise that their prospects are better if we were to change hands
and become part of a major pharmaceuticals player.'
He denied, however, that the uncertainty over the division had harmed its
performance.
Buoyant demand for Synthroid, the treatment for thyroid deficiency, helped
lift the division's profits by 71 per cent from Pounds 29.2m to Pounds
49.8m.
Research spending has also been maintained and sales have risen from Pounds
215.5m to Pounds 228.1m, although the second half is not expected to be so
healthy because wholesalers stocked up in the first half.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, welcomed the figures. But with most
pharmaceuticals companies facing over-capacity in research and stringent
regulatory hurdles for new drugs, he admitted there was no choice but to
reassess the value of the division.
'We were not alone in having problems and there was no choice but to
reconsider our future in pharmaceuticals. But I don't believe we have
painted ourselves into a corner.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MMC to investigate Stagecoach shares swap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday ordered the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to investigate the taking of a 20 per cent stake by
Stagecoach Holdings, Britain's biggest bus operator, in Sheffield Mainline
Partnership bus company.
It said Mr Jonathan Evans, the corporate affairs minister, considered the
acquisition raised competition concerns about the bus market in parts of
South Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.
Stagecoach agreed in July to swap shares with Sheffield Mainline
Partnership, which was established last November through an employee buy-out
from local authorities in South Yorkshire. The deal with Stagecoach, worth
about Pounds 1m, involved the exchange of 20 per cent of Mainline's enlarged
equity for 500,000 Stagecoach shares.
At the time Stagecoach described it as a form of courtship: if the
relationship worked out, Stagecoach would eventually seek full control.
An industry analyst interpreted the DTI's action as a signal to Stagecoach
that it wants it to halt its acquisitions of bus companies. It now controls
11.5 per cent of the UK bus market.
However, Mr Derek Scott, Stagecoach's finance director, said he saw the MMC
reference as concerned purely with Mainline's area of operations.
He said the 20 per cent stake was intended to protect Mainline against other
predators. 'It's an important development for the industry and we want to
get the principle of what we are doing established. We hope the MMC will say
we are acting in the public interest'. The MMC will report in February.
This will be the fourth MMC inquiry into Stagecoach's activities since it
was set up in 1980. The Office of Fair Trading has also carried out 18 other
investigations into Stagecoach subsidiaries.
Last week Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, wrote to the DTI
demanding an inquiry into Stagecoach's allegedly anti-competitive practices.

On Demand Information, the electronic publishing company, yesterday
announced an 80 per cent slide in pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds
2.62m for the year to July 31.
ODI had been expected to report losses for 18 months after its December
flotation as it invested in operational infrastructure for its new products,
and demerged its marketing activities. Shares, which floated at 78p, were
unchanged at 102p yesterday.
Staff had increased from 97 to 197 by the end of October.
Group turnover in the 12 months fell by 24 per cent to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds
19m), however, input from continuing operations advanced to Pounds 5.23m
(Pounds 2.98m). Losses per share emerged at 5.7p (3.9p).

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Robinson splits TransTec roles - Shares
fall 5p on warning that profits will not meet expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP who built up the specialist engineering
group TransTec , has split his role as chairman and chief executive with a
fellow multimillionaire.
The Birmingham-based group's new chief executive is Mr Richard Carr, 41, who
last year received a Pounds 10m payment from Tomkins for identifying the UK
conglomerate's acquisitions in the US.
Mr Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, will continue as non-executive
chairman of TransTec, which has suffered recently from recession in the
aerospace industry and deferred contracts.
TransTec's shares, which had nearly halved in value from February's peak of
105p, yesterday shed a further 5p to 51p after the group accompanied news of
Mr Carr's appointment with a warning that full-year trading profits would be
lower than expected.
Mr Carr, who left Tomkins at the begining of the year, will subscribe for
one million new shares at 55p each. He will be granted options over further
shares worth Pounds 1m at a price to be determined according to the rules of
the executive share option schemes.
In addition, he has been granted further options over 500,000 shares, which
may be exercised at a price of 140p within the next seven years. Half of
these options may be exercised at 130p within the next six years.
Mr Robinson, who had been under pressure from institutional investors to
split his roles, said yesterday he was delighted to have secured someone of
Mr Carr's quality.
'His experience in running a wide range of industrial businesses under tight
financial controls will be invaluable in improving the profitability of
TransTec's existing businesses. In due course, his proven track record in
acquisitions will enable the group to continue to grow as an international,
industrial company.'
Mr Carr's annual salary will be Pounds 160,000 on a one-year contract, with
no additional bonuses beyond the share options. He led Tomkins to US deals
such as the 1988 purchase of Smith &amp; Wesson, the hand gun maker, for Dollars
112m (Pounds 68m) and its purchase the following year of Murray Ohio, the
bicycle manufacturer, for Pounds 224m.
Mr Robinson, 56, owns has a 16 per cent stake in TransTec worth Pounds 8m at
last night's close. Last year his total remuneration was Pounds 285,000,
including pension contributions.
He said yesterday that his new salary would be set by the remuneration
committee, but would drop considerably to reflect his reduced role.
TransTec has made a series of acquisitions in recent years. As well as the
aerospace industry, it supplies components to the automotive industry -
particularly Ford. In the first six months of the year, the group's pre-tax
profits slumped by 46 per cent to Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 94m.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Euromoney at Pounds 24m and still on the
acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Euromoney Publications, the acquisitive information group
70 per cent owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust, advanced 36 per cent
to Pounds 24m in the year to September 30.
The rise from Pounds 17.7m was struck on turnover up 67 per cent at Pounds
89.9m (Pounds 53.7m), to which acquisitions contributed Pounds 5m (Pounds
4.05m).
Mr Richard Ensor, managing director, said that as well as launching its own
magazines Euromoney acquired them where possible. Euromoney magazine itself,
he said, had its best year ever, with higher revenue from both subscriptions
and advertisements. He attributed this result to a redesign, new writers and
increased pagination, as well as to 'commercial banks having a better time'.
However, the group also acquired companies by degrees, Mr Ensor said. This
involved buying a 20 to 25 per cent stake then gradually adding to that
holding. He said he hoped the flow of acquisitions would 'continue at a
reasonable rate', adding that the group was particularly interested in
acquiring events and database businesses and cross-border
business-to-business publishing.
The core international financial publishing side lifted profits to Pounds
11.7m (Pounds 9.54m), while the training arm saw an advance to Pounds 4.83m
(Pounds 2.71m). This was helped by the merger of DC Gardner's banking and
management training operations with Euromoney's own.
Profits from seminars and conferences jumped to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds
662,000), although Mr Ensor warned that the rise was largely due to the
elevation of AIC, the seminars business based in Australia, from an
associate to a subsidiary. Euromoney now holds 75 per cent of AIC.
In May the group raised some Pounds 23m from the placing of 1.25m shares.
Under stock exchange rules DMGT was prevented from any take-up and its stake
was reduced from 74 to 70 per cent.
Earnings per share grew to 69.38p (56.84p) and a final dividend of 29.5p
lifts the total to 42.5p (38p).

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Seton expands medical products side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the day it revealed a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, Seton
Healthcare is spending Pounds 24.6m to strengthen its medical products
division.
The expenditure is to be funded by a 1-for-3 rights issue at 285p to raise a
net Pounds 28.5m. The balance will reduce borrowings from Pounds 15m to
Pounds 11m and gearing from about 80 to about 50 per cent. The shares closed
down 18p at 343p.
Seton is acquiring for Pounds 13.8m cash a basket of over-the-counter
medical brands from Napp, a private company.
The brands include: five for the treatment of head lice; Paramol, the first
strong analgesic to be allowed to be sold OTC since Nurofen; J Collis
Browne's, a range of anti-diarrhoeal treatments; and four other assorted
brands.
Napp has warranted that its brands had operating profits of Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 1.4m) on sales of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.2m) for the eight months to
August 31.
For Pounds 5m cash, Seton is buying additional rights in perpetuity to the
Betadine range of OTC infection control products. It already had the licence
for the range on a royalties agreement of 15 per cent for the first five
years, jumping to 25 for the next five.
It is also acquiring for Pounds 5.8m cash, shares and loan notes, Brevet
Hospital Products (UK), a maker of compression therapy products. In 1994 it
made trading profits of Pounds 755,000 on sales of Pounds 2.43m.
Seton's pre-tax profits for the six months to August 31 grew to Pounds 4.03m
(Pounds 3.18m) on turnover up 18 per cent at Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 22.2m),
with the UK accounting for 81 per cent (77 per cent) of that figure.
Organic sales increased 11 per cent, with the balance of the rise coming
from three acquisitions for Pounds 9.75m.
The sports and leisure division made flat profits of Pounds 352,000 on
turnover up at Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.55m).
Earnings per share rose to 8.9p (7.3p) and the interim dividend is lifted to
2.2p (1.9p).
COMMENT
Seton has been quietly picking up UK OTC brands from the big boys, which are
now concentrating on global brands. And it has proved - with the 1992
acquisition of Cupal - that it can absorb companies to its advantage. Its
earnings record, at 17 per cent compound a year has been driven by
acquisitions, but contains a healthy proportion of organic progress. In the
current deal it has therefore stuck with what it knows: it has also pitched
the rights price at a reasonable discount to make the decision easy for
shareholders. Forecast pre-tax profits for the current year have been lifted
to about Pounds 11m, giving earnings of 21p and a multiple of just over 16.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vickers close to revealing partner for
Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers, the engineering group, expects to announce a partnership around the
end of this year between its Rolls-Royce luxury cars business and another
leading motor manufacturer.
Its shares rose 4p to 183p, bringing the increase to 12 per cent over the
past fortnight. Companies speculatively linked with the UK group include the
German manufacturers Daimler-Benz and BMW.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, told investment managers
yesterday: 'Looking to the longer term for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, we all
accept that this business will need a partner. A partner who can bring
technology, components and support new models in the latter half of the
1990s.
'We expect steady growth in volumes and in particular I am confident we will
eventually see improvement in both the US and Japanese markets.
'We have an unrelenting programme to continue to improve efficiency at the
Crewe site. We will continue to produce new model variants, low-volume and
exclusive niche cars. This market can be expected to produce a significant
contribution to the overall business performance in the next few years.'
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars recently announced that sales were 2.2 per cent ahead
at 1,051 vehicles in the third quarter and said this kept it on course for a
successful last quarter.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace calls enfranchisement EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the motor and leisure group whose
voting shareholders are split by a family feud, yesterday issued details of
proposals to enfranchise its non-voting A shares.
The board called an extraordinary general meeting for November 25 to
consider its plans to end the company's two-tier share structure.
Ordinary voting shareholders would be compensated by a one-for-one scrip
issue, while the non-voting shares, owned almost entirely by institutions,
are enfranchised.
The proposals are opposed by Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert Barr, nephews of Mr
Malcolm Barr, the company chairman.
The brothers, who speak for nearly 30 per cent of voting shares, have also
called for an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian
Small, finance director.
They are also seeking their uncle's resignation and want to split the
company's two divisions into stand-alone businesses. Ironically,
enfranchisement was one of their own proposals.
Mr Malcolm Barr said: 'The board feels it is essential that all shareholders
have a vote on the very radical proposals from the other side. This is
especially the case because the other side have said they support
enfranchisement.'
However, the board's proposal seems likely to fail as it requires 75 per
cent of voting shares to proceed.
The brothers claim to have enlisted majority support among voting
shareholders for their own proposals. Mr Nicholas Barr said: 'Whilst we
support enfranchisement in principle, we believe it should only be part of
an overall strategy.'
A circular on the rebel shareholders' EGM is expected to be published today.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais recruits Nikko research
team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais Securities has recruited a five-strong convertible bond and
warrant sales team from Nikko Securities Europe as part of its effort to
expand its active quantitative research facility.
Mr Michael Kerr-Dineen, chief executive of Credit Lyonnais Securities, said
the company was seeking to distinguish itself in the highly competitive
stockbroking market by developing unique quantitative products.
'Institutions are becoming much more selective in their use of research.'
Credit Lyonnais, which recently lost the creators of its key Value and
Momentum stock selection model to Robert Fleming Group, said it had already
filled those vacancies internally and was continuing on schedule.
Mr Kerr-Dineen has warned Fleming that he will take legal action if the team
attempts to re-create the Value and Momentum model.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Usborne Pounds 13.2m in the red and calls
for Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Usborne, the grain trading and pig production group, reported pre-tax losses
of Pounds 13.2m for the year to June 30 against profits of Pounds 1.6m in
the previous 18 months following a change in the company's year-end.
The company's auditors qualified its accounts because of lack of information
on the pig division's stock and fixed assets at the outset of the year.
Usborne's chairman, Lord Parkinson, former cabinet minister, also announced
a 4-for-3 rights issue to raise Pounds 6m towards paying down debt. The
issue is fully underwritten by Thomson Investments, the engineering group,
which has a 50.1 per cent stake in the company.
Mr John Aiken, finance director, said that the rights issue will enable
Usborne to reduce its gearing levels to close to 50 per cent by June.
Poor trading conditions in the pig division were exacerbated by a loss of
management control in pigs a year ago which left the company with
insufficient records to provide the auditors with all the information they
needed.
Mr Michael Adams, managing director, said: 'We don't like the qualification
of the results, but it's a reality. We now have every confidence in the new
pig management.'
Mr Adams is refocusing the company on its core business in grain trading
where it made a profit of Pounds 963,000 (Pounds 2.92m) on turnover of
Pounds 183m (Pounds 269m). He is halving pig numbers to 9,000 to concentrate
on a contract to provide the Malton Bacon factory with pigs which runs for
another 5 1/2 years.
'There are opportunities in the agribusiness sector which we want to take
advantage of,' Mr Adams said. The grain business will be expanded with more
offices around the country and the company has agreed with Associated
British Ports to import and handle fertiliser through a new facility at
Southampton Docks.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 218m (Pounds 312m), with Pounds 206m (Pounds
186m) from continuing operations. Losses per share emerged at 16.16p against
earnings of 2.05p.
The shares rose by 1/2p yesterday to 6 1/2p.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail Trust buys cable arts channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust yesterday expanded its interests in the new
media with the acquisition of The Performance Channel, an arts channel
distributed on cable television networks in the UK.
The purchase means that by the end of the month the publisher of the Daily
Mail will own two cable TV channels. Channel One, a 24-hours a day
television news channel will soon be launched, initially in London.
The acquisition of Performance, is part of a Pounds 50m investment to take
DMGT into the electronic media.
Sir David English, chairman of Harmsworth Broadcasting, a DMGT division,
told a Media Week conference in Brighton yesterday: 'We want to expand into
TV. We want to have more channels.'
Cable is an area where newspapers are free to expand without ownership
restrictions. The cable industry is keen to have exclusive channels to
differentiate itself from satellite television.
Performance broadcasts a mixture of music. It is available to more than
750,000 cable subscribers as part of the basic tier of channels and is
already in profit.
At the conference Mr Eugene Connell, president of Nymex CableComs, the
second largest cable operator in the UK, and chairman of the Cable
Communications Association, forecast that cable would have more than 6m
viewers in the UK by the turn of the century.
At the Royal Television Society on Wednesday evening, Mr Charles Allen,
chief executive of Granada TV and LWT, promised that his company intended to
find a way into the pay television market.
Although ITV would remain an important business, Mr Allen predicted that in
ten years' time subscription revenues would dwarf both the BBC's licence fee
and advertising revenues.

FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Financial strength is the issue not
competition - Bernard Gray hears Lord Weinstock's VSEL views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Weinstock's view of the right future for VSEL, and the British defence
industry, could not be more different than John Weston's, the man who runs
BAe's defence business.
GEC's managing director believes that the arguments about competition in
shipbuilding are nonsense, and that the talk of wholesale cross-border
rationalisation of the European defence industry is naive.
Lord Weinstock argues that when the Office of Fair Trading looks at each
order, they will see that each could only be built by one specialist yard.
'The order for the second batch of Trafalgar submarines would always have
been built at Barrow (VSEL's yard in Cumbria), so there can be no real
competition for that contract.
'The other order around is for the last batch of Type 23 frigates for the
Royal Navy. Yarrow (GEC's yard on the Clyde) has built nine of the 13 of
that class and the prices for these ships are well known, so the Ministry of
Defence need have no concerns on that score.'
In the future, ships are likely to be built on a collaborative basis.
'Beyond that is the next generation Horizon frigate, which will not be built
until the turn of the century and is an Anglo-French-Italian venture anyway,
much as you have in BAe's monopoly aircraft business.'
If anything, Lord Weinstock contends that the risk is that Barrow run by
another company would be tempted to put Yarrow out of business.
'If Barrow had won a large submarine contract to keep it profitable, it
might be tempted to buy other contracts and starve its competitors of work.
The history of shipbuilding is littered with similar incidents.'
At a philosophical level, Lord Weinstock also questions whether effective
competition can exist when two potential manufacturers of equipment vie to
supply one buyer.
'If, for example, you have four contracts to parcel out between two bidders
A and B, the maximum split you could make is three to A and one to B,
regardless of whether B was cheapest bid because otherwise B would be out of
work and you would have no future competition.
'There is no real competition under those circumstances and bidders know
that.'
On the broader question of how the defence industry should consolidate, he
thinks that companies in Europe should respond to the rapid rationalisation
in the US, and that countries will, and should, want to maintain strong
self-sufficient defence industries.
'We have to respond to the changes in America. They are producing giant
companies through these mergers. Compared to them BAe and GEC's defence
operations are minnows. We have to form companies of sufficient size to
compete effectively with them or even to have an effective voice in
collaborating with them.'
In the art of the possible, Lord Weinstock does not believe in the option of
rationalisation across Europe with large-scale cross border mergers being
impractical. 'There will be some smaller deals, such as the joint venture
which we have formed with Thomson (of France) in sonar, but the larger deals
are fraught with difficulty.'
What is possible, and desirable, in his view is for Britain to rationalise
its defence business. Lord Weinstock has made no secret of his desire to
merge BAe's defence business with his defence arm GEC-Marconi.
'We have made several attempts to get together with BAe. When GEC bought
Yarrow (in 1985) we suggested to BAe that we form a joint naval systems
business and we did so again in the last few weeks.'
He has also had more recent talks, including well-publicised merger talks
last year, and less well-known discussions about a joint bid for VSEL at the
beginning of the year. Both came to nothing, but it appears Lord Weinstock's
conviction that a merger should happen has grown.
He agrees with BAe's management on at least one point. 'Prime contracting
(the ability to manage complex programmes with many sub-contractors) is
growing into the most important element of defence manufacturing.
'I think that it is vital for the UK to foster a strong capability in
defence prime contracting, otherwise we will not be able to build these
complex systems in future. GEC has a very good record in prime contracting,
and we want to buy VSEL because we wish to do more of it.'
It is in how this prime contracting should be done that he parts company
with BAe.
'For the concept of a prime contractor who accepts the risk of managing a
project to make sense, then the prime contractor has to be able to bear the
cost of a project going wrong.
'Who would you rather take on as a prime contractor, a company with nearly
Pounds 3bn in the bank and can pay for its own mistakes, or one which owes
the bank Pounds 200m? I know who I would choose.'
Lord Weinstock's inference is clear. GEC's strong cash position gives it an
enormous asset to bring to the table. BAe's relatively weak financial
position undermines its credibility. Bring BAe's longer prime contracting
experience together with GEC's financial backing and you have a strong
company able to take on the competition.
Short of that the best solution is to increase the amount of prime
contracting done by GEC. In Lord Weinstock's view, only be good for the
British defence industry. In the longer term he still clearly hankers after
the ultimate rationalisation linking GEC and BAe to produce one UK
super-prime contractor.
'Prime contracting is an important skill. But it is about more than
collecting all of your suppliers bills and adding a fat margin to them.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Kwik Save expands with Shoprite buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save is consolidating its position as Britain's leading discount grocer
by purchasing 117 of Shoprite group's stores in Scotland and northern
England for Pounds 45.4m in cash.
Under the terms of the deal Kwik Save - which yesterday announced a 7.5 per
cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 135.6m - will acquire
assets with a book value in October 1993 of Pounds 59.6m.
The deal signals the end of the rapid rise and fall of Shoprite in mainland
Britain, after it expanded away from its roots as a supermarket, property
and motor retailing group in the Isle of Man in 1990. It is a blow to Mr
Deryck Nicholson, Shoprite's chairman, who, ironically, is the son of one of
Kwik Save's co-founders.
The acquisition would give Kwik Save almost 10 per cent of the Scottish
grocery market - which it has been trying to break into for 18 months, but
where it has only six stores after experiencing difficulties finding sites.
Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive, acknowledged the acquisition
might cause 'some short-term pain' - it will dilute earnings slightly this
year - but believed sales could quickly be boosted by converting Shoprite
stores into Kwik Saves.
Shoprite is the first failure among the discount chains that have expanded
rapidly in the UK during in the 1990s. Its shares were best performers in
the food retailing sector last year, peaking at 241p last February. They
fell 1p to 21p yesterday. Kwik Save shares gained 15p at 551p.
Shoprite has issued two profits warnings in four months and has been working
closely with its bankers since July. Analysts believe it expanded too
quickly, paying too much for sometimes substandard sites.
Mr Charles Good, managing director of Scottish operations, denied the deal
was a distress sale, but acknowledged that with no sign of improvement in
the market 'to try and soldier on would have been catastrophic'.
Shoprite's directors warned that if the disposal is not completed, 'the
group is unlikely to be able to trade out of its financial difficulties'.
Shoprite proposes to use the deal's proceeds to repay borrowings, and
refocus on its remaining eight supermarkets and other operations in the Isle
of Man.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Fears of closure haunt Paris amusement park: Euro Disney's
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the operator of the Paris-based theme park, yesterday
an-nounced full-year net losses of FFr1.8bn (Pounds 214m), down from
FFr5.33bn last time, but said it had suffered a sharp fall in visitor
numbers.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said fears that the troubled park would
be closed had resulted in large numbers of potential customers staying away.
Visitor numbers fell 10 per cent to 8.8m in the year to September 30. Mr
Bourguignon said: 'The best thing about 1994 is that it's over.' The results
are the first to be released since the company announced a FFr13bn
restructuring with creditor banks in June. Mr Bourguignon remained confident
that the park would break even by 1996.
The losses were broadly in line with analysts' projections, and the shares
rose FFr125 to close in Paris at FFr815.
Mr Bourguignon said the company had still not decided whether to raise or
cut prices over the next year. He admitted, however, that many French
customers still regard the park as expensive and he raising prices would be
difficult.
He said Euro Disney had achieved about FFr500m in cost savings in 1994,
including 900 redundancies. He warned, however, that it was unlikely that
similar cost-savings could be achieved in the current year. The company
realised that cost cuts could not continue indefinitely as quality would
begin to suffer.
About 2,000 of the park's 10,000 employees are now on part-time contracts.
The company is also recruiting staff who are prepared to work on shorter
contracts, which would increase flexibility. Mr Bourguignon said.
Euro Disney was launching a new advertising campaign, which would be
tailored for each of its large European markets. A new FFr600m attraction,
Space Mountain, is to open next June. which will give visitors the
impression of being fired from a cannon.
The company said it had cut queueing times by 45 per cent during the year
through new attractions and the redesign of existing ones.
Mr Bourguignon added that managers would be given greater incentives to
raise profits through a programme to turn 150 shops and restaurants into
individual profit centres. Managers would be given greater autonomy in
running these and would be rewarded for results.
The group had net equity of about FFr5.5bn and total borrowings of
FFr15.9bn, down 23 per cent from last year. The one-off restructuring and
related costs were FFr515m, and it has unused lines of credit worth
FFr1.1bn.
Hotel occupancy rates rose from 55 per cent last year to 60 per cent, which
the company said was in line with the French average and reflected greater
flexibility in tariffs. However, expenditure per bedroom fell 14 per cent to
FFr882.
Euro Disney reported operating profits of FFr332m, against FFr391m, before
financing and depreciation charges. Operating costs fell 12 per cent to
FFr2.96bn and management and administration charges by 23 per cent to
FFr854m.
Revenues were down 15 per cent to FFr4.15bn, including FFr2.2bn from the
park, FFr1.6bn from hotels and FFr322m from other activities - mainly its
corporate 'partners' or sponsorship programme. About half the park income
comes from entrance fees and the rest from car parking, food and
merchandise.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Canary Wharf wins vote of confidence as climate alters: The
dearth of 'big spaces'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It frequently happens that monumental buildings are planned near the top of
the building cycle, opened at a time when they cannot be filled, refinanced
in the depression, and occupied during the upturn of the next building
cycle.' World Prices and the Building Industry, published 1937.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has agreed to take an additional
350,000 sq ft of office space at Canary Wharf, the Pounds 1.5bn development
in London Docklands now owned by a consortium of banks.
Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, also
confirmed that Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of
Barclays Bank, is negotiating to take a further 500,000 sq ft. If this deal
is signed, less than 1m sq ft of the 4.5m sq ft Canary Wharf complex will
remain unoccupied.
Canary Wharf's success in attracting tenants bears out the experience of
previous property cycles, as the above quote makes clear. While the
development boom of the late 1980s left central London awash with surplus
space, there is now an acute shortage of large, modern offices.
Although there is an overhang of vacant space - up to 12m sq ft including
fringe areas of the City - most unoccupied buildings are old or small.
Tenants such as investment banks which require open trading floors have few
choices.
According to Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, there are only three vacant
floors of more than 40,000 sq ft in the centre of the City and only one in
the West End. Until yesterday, Canary Wharf could offer a choice of 18
vacant floors of this size. If negotiations with BZW are successful, these
will all be occupied.
Scarce supply is already being reflected in rents. Surveyors Hillier Parker
estimated that top City rents had risen to Pounds 32.50 a sq ft, up from
Pounds 30 at the start of the year.
While others dispute this figure, tenants are being offered fewer incentives
and there is little doubt that headline rents will soon rise. Against this
background, Canary Wharf's competitive position is improving.
The terms of Morgan Stanley's new lease have not been disclosed, but agents
said yesterday that rents of Pounds 20-25 per sq ft are usual at Canary
Wharf, compared with Pounds 30-35 in the core of the City. Rent-free periods
are also longer than the one to two years now common in central districts.
The drawbacks with Canary Wharf in the eyes of many potential tenants are
location and infrastructure. Despite the new Limehouse Link roadway,
improved services on the Docklands Light Railway and the planned extension
of London Underground's Jubilee Line, Canary Wharf is still one step away
from the City.
Barclays has shied away from moving all of BZW to Canary Wharf, opting to
locate only the trading operations. Corporate finance, the equity markets
operation and some senior management are expected to relocate to Royal Mint
Court, a Barclays building near the Tower of London.
Sir Peter was not concerned whether or not Canary Wharf attracted head
office staff. 'It is my job to fill the place with good tenants. Beyond
that, I don't really care who comes here.'
Since it came out of administration a year ago, Canary Wharf has been owned
by a group of 11 banks which financed the ambitious project for Olympia &amp;
York, the Canadian property developer. Yesterday's announcements bring
forward the time when they will be able to cash in their equity by either
selling the company or arranging a stock exchange flotation.
The timing of such a move depends on Canary Wharf's profitability and the
banks' reading of the property cycle.
Last year, Canary Wharf's administrators predicted that the company would
cover its costs by 1997/98, assuming that 80-90 per cent of the space was
occupied. Sir Peter declined to comment yesterday, except to say that the
company was covering its expenses before interest costs.
If the administrator's forecast proves correct, the way could be open for a
flotation within three years. Many forecasters also expect commercial
property prices to peak in about three years time. The banks are doubtless
hoping to make a better job of judging the property cycle than the
developers they backed at the last peak.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Philips buoyant despite flat sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, nearly trebled profits in the third
quarter as it compensated for flat sales in Europe by winning increased
business in higher-growth markets such as Asia Pacific, US and Brazil.
The buoyant results, which exceeded analysts' forecasts, came after a sharp
drop in financing costs and a restructuring that over the past few years has
rid Philips of several loss-making businesses.
Net profit jumped to Fl 530m (Pounds 193m) from Fl 133m, taking results for
the first nine months to Fl 1.19bn, against Fl 1.45bn a year earlier, when
results were flattered by a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain on the sale of a
Japanese joint venture.
The quarterly figure also included a Fl 75m extraordinary gain on the sale
of a small part of Philips' 40 per cent stake in Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing, which was recently floated in Taipei.
Group turnover was virtually unchanged at Fl 14.19bn, but sales grew by 6
per cent if deconsolidations and exchange rate movements are taken into
account.
Europe, which accounts for just over half of group turnover, generated flat
sales, with German subsidiaries, such as Grundig, the consumer electronics
maker, and PKI, the telecommunications group, facing a reluctance by
consumers to spend.
By contrast, Asia, which accounts for 15 per cent of sales volume, was
showing faster growth, allowing Philips to generate higher profit margins.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Boots warns of Christmas challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 66 per
cent increase in first-half profits following buoyant demand for branded
drugs and a Pounds 47.8m gain on the sale of Farleys baby foods.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 174.6m to Pounds 289.7m in the six months
to September 30, although last year's figures were distorted by a Pounds 35m
write off on Manoplax, the group's failed heart drug.
Underlying profits rose 20.4 per cent to Pounds 241.8m as the group enjoyed
increased sales of Synthroid, its thyroid deficiency treatment.
Shares in the company, however, fell 10p to 519p after it warned that US
demand for the drug was likely to fall in the second half, while adding that
UK consumer confidence remained fragile. 'Consumers are still being
cautious, and seeking value. Christmas is going to be a tough challenge for
most retailers,' said Sir James Blyth, chief executive.
Sluggish sales at DIY subsidiaries Do It All, the joint venture with WH
Smith, and AG Stanley contributed to a modest 2.8 per cent increase in
turnover from Pounds 1.99bn to Pounds 2.04bn.
Losses by these businesses undermined strong growth at Boots The Chemist,
the group's largest division, where profits increase 9 per cent to Pounds
144.6m on sales ahead 5.1 per cent at Pounds 1.37bn.
Sir James predicted the loss-making divisions would be profitable by the end
of the decade, but the group's caution persuaded analysts to downgrade
full-year profit forecasts by Pounds 10m to Pounds 545m. They were also
unsettled by uncertainty over the future of the pharmaceutical division,
which contributed sharply increased profits of Pounds 49.8m.
Although the company said its review of the division - prompted by the
withdrawal of Manoplax last year - was closer to a solution, it refused to
confirm expectations of an outright sale. Among the options for the
division, which employs 5,800, are joint ventures and restructuring. If
Boots sold the business, Sir James said it 'would examine ways of giving
cash back to the shareholders'.
The interim dividend was increased from 4.9p to 5.35p. Earnings per share
grew from 11.5p to 20.2p, while underlying earnings rose 16.4 per cent from
13.4p to 15.6p.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Germany to probe leaks of data affecting markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German economics ministry is probing leaks of market-sensitive data,
following a complaint from a foreign bank that German rivals had prior
knowledge of industrial orders figures published yesterday.
Federal bond prices slipped as accurate reports of the
stronger-than-expected data circulated before the official publication time.
It also emerged yesterday that leaks of monthly orders and industrial
production figures, both the responsibility of the economics ministry, had
been occurring for some months.
'This is now a normal thing with economics ministry figures,' said Mr Holger
Fahrinkrug, an economist at UBS in Frankfurt. 'Our futures traders regularly
come in to us with 'rumours' that turn out to be exactly right. The only
fair way is for us all to be told at the same time,' he said.
'It happens rather a lot,' said Mr Stephen King, an economist with James
Capel in London. 'Whether it's serious or not depends on who is doing it and
if anyone is making any money out of it.
'But things are a complete mess. Look at the quality of the data,' he added,
referring to industrial output figures, issued on Wednesday, which carried a
warning that a preliminary 0.2 per cent decline in output was likely to be
revised upwards by at least two full percentage points.
Analysts said the economics ministry should start the leaks probe in its own
offices, since other key indicators such as money supply and inflation
figures issued by the Bundesbank or the federal statistics office were never
leaked.
Raw numbers generated by the statistics office were first passed to the
central bank for seasonal adjustment and then transmitted to the ministry
for publication.
Yesterday's information was reportedly released 45 minutes early by a German
news agency, since rebuked by the economics ministry, but the source of
industrial production figures, circulated prematurely on Wednesday, was not
known.
Selected news agencies are routinely provided with advance copies of
important statistics under strict embargo conditions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those Lonrho shareholders who have supported Mr Tiny Rowland through thick
and thin may regret yesterday's resignation. But investors seem set to
benefit financially now that Mr Dieter Bock has finally won his power
struggle. Mr Rowland's buccaneering style had outlived its useful purpose
and he seemed more keen to cling on to a disparate empire than deliver
shareholder value. The fact that Mr Bock has no proven ability to run a
conglomerate may matter little. The best way to add value is probably to
break Lonrho up. Mr Bock should be able to achieve that.

FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rumour that Euro Disney might close, which always looked implausible,
suited Walt Disney while it was negotiating the theme park's rescue
refinancing earlier this year. But it did nothing to help the business.
Worried that they might arrive to find the gates shut, many potential
customers decided not to book - leading to a sharp fall in visitors between
March and May. They started to pick up from June, when the refinancing was
concluded, though the total for the company's financial year was still down
10 per cent to 8.8m.
Price cuts aimed at combating the park's expensive image left revenues 15
per cent lower. Despite tough overhead reductions, operating profits before
financing costs fell to a mere FFr335m. The recovery in the shares, which
jumped 13p to 96p, had more to do with the absence of the usual
disappointments rather than anything more positive.
There are some grounds for optimism. Those visitors the park does attract
appear to leave well-satisfied, with a good proportion coming back again.
Euro Disney should get a boost from the economic recovery in continental
Europe and the recent weakness of the franc will help. But with rival parks
planned for Spain and Germany, the prospects are hardly exciting.

FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's figures from Kwik Save were impressive - almost heroically so in
the light of the fierce competition in UK food retailing. Pre-tax profits
were better than expected and gross margins improved. All credit to the
management's success in squeezing costs, putting pressure on suppliers and
keeping a tight grip on cash.
The problem is that the strategic challenge facing the group is enormous. J
Sainsbury and Tesco have deflected the threat posed by discounters with
their carefully targeted price reduction programmes. Having already pared
its own prices, Kwik Save is left with limited scope to respond. It will
seek to challenge the majors in high margin areas such as chilled food, and
to copy them by selling a higher proportion of own-label products. But
competition with the superstores will highlight the relative inadequacy of
Kwik Save's offering when product range and customer service as well as
price are taken into account.
Kwik Save thus faces a steady decline in core profitability which its
aggressive store-opening plans - and opportunistic acquisitions such as that
of Shoprite - will not be able to reverse. Kwik Save is better able to deal
with the deteriorating climate than other discounters, but that is no
recommendation when shares in Sainsbury are valued only in line with the
market.

FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots is still struggling to clarify its strategy. After 16 months, the
group has yet to reveal the conclusions of its review of the drug division.
Nor has it announced the promised acquisition to bolster its European
non-prescription medicines business.
The group intimated yesterday that a deal for the drugs division was
imminent. Boots' biggest dilemma will then be what to do with the cash. The
disposal, expected to raise more than Pounds 700m, will heavily dilute
earnings because of the drug operation's high margins. Boots could
compensate by using the sale proceeds to buy back shares. The management has
said it has no hang-ups about returning money to shareholders. Such a move
would also, in some way, atone for the disastrous Pounds 900m purchase of
Ward White. Any non-prescription medicine acquisition could subsequently be
funded by debt. Boots is undergeared given the strength of its cash flow.
Such manoeuvres would considerably reduce uncertainty, but whether they
would lead to the stock's re-rating is doubtful. Boots the Chemist is
struggling effectively in a difficult market. But in a low inflation
environment, sales growth is likely to be sound rather than exciting and
earnings expansion will require hard graft. Such prospects justify its small
premium to the market, but little more.

FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Multimedia manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Revitalisation is the new motto at Philips. After years of painful
restructuring in which jobs have been cut and businesses sold, the Dutch
electronics group plans to expand again. Investment is being stepped up and
Philips is eyeing multimedia acquisitions.
The sharp turnaround in the group's financial performance, underlined by
yesterday's tripling of third quarter earnings before extraordinary items,
certainly justifies a shift in strategy. But operating margins are still a
modest 5.7 per cent, so investors will be wary if the expansion is not
extremely cautious. Only in the semiconductor and components division, where
operating margins are 13 per cent, is the case for greater investment
compelling. Margins in the core consumer electronics business are a mere 2
per cent. Meanwhile, the priority in the loss-making professional products
division must be further restructuring.
The biggest concern surrounds Philips' multimedia ambitions. The group is
excited by the high margins in software compared with consumer electronics
hardware. But that does not mean that Philips can add value to such
businesses. Precisely because of their high margins, software groups are
pricey. Nor is it enough to argue that hardware and software businesses
should, in some vague way, be combined. Similar logic lay behind Sony's and
Matsushita's disappointing Hollywood acquisitions. Until Philips articulates
its strategy more clearly, investors will worry that it will make the same
error.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Japan 'widens lead in motor industry'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese carmakers and component suppliers are improving productivity and
quality at a faster rate than their European and US rivals despite the
recession in Japan, researchers said yesterday at the end of a 12-month
study of manufacturing competitiveness in the motor components sector.
Professor Dan Jones, one of the research leaders, also warned yesterday that
Japanese motor manufacturers were losing patience with many under-performing
European - and particularly British - component suppliers to their UK
car-producing operations.
He said Japanese manufacturers expected to achieve further cost-savings of
20-30 per cent over the next two to three years.
Unless UK suppliers improved, Toyota, Honda and Nissan would consider they
had no choice but to start bringing their own suppliers to the UK from
Japan, said Prof Jones, of Cardiff Business School's Lean Enterprise
Research Centre.
The Cardiff centre joined with Andersen Consulting and Cambridge University
to undertake the study, which compared the productivity and quality
performance of 71 component producers in Japan, Europe, the US, Canada and
Mexico.
It found that the Japanese manufacturers had improved productivity by 38 per
cent since a previous study by the team two years ago despite a 16 per cent
fall in production volumes. 'The signs are that the Japanese carmakers will
emerge from the current recession even stronger than before,' the study
concludes.
The study showed the US industry to be well ahead of Europe on quality, but
still 30 per cent behind Japan. The highly-detailed research found German
quality to be only slightly above average. Productivity remained low.
Of the 13 plants found to be 'world class' in terms of productivity and
quality, five were in Japan, three in the US, three in France and two in
Spain. In terms of productivity, typical UK plants would need to double
output with the same labour force to reach the 'world class' level.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Treasury's 'wise men' call for neutral budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury's six-man panel of independent economic forecasters
yesterday advised Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against an immediate
rise in interest rates and called for a 'neutral' Budget on November 29.
In the last report of their two-year contract period, the six 'wise men'
said the public spending totals set for 1995-96 by Mr Clarke last year
should be cut to offset the effects of lower inflation.
The panel said that lower than expected inflation had increased the level of
real public spending implied by the cash plans in last year's Budget. The
chancellor should aim to reduce the cash plans in line with the lower price
level. 'We would not regard this as a tightening of fiscal policy,' the
advisers said.
Although the forecasters produced differing recommendations on fiscal
policy, they said these were 'within a relatively narrow band around a
'neutral' Budget'. This would be one in which the pre-announced tax
increases for the coming financial year starting in April should take place
as planned, other taxes should be indexed in line with prices, and where
spending was kept as planned in real terms.
Among the panellists, Prof David Currie of the London Business School, Prof
Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research and Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge
University argued for no change in fiscal policy. Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman
Sachs International favoured some further tightening to prevent excessive
demand growth. Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research and Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University spoke in
favour of a small easing of fiscal policy, respectively by cutting National
Insurance contributions and reducing marginal tax rates.
All favoured policy changes to reduce the cost of employing people on low
wages and put forward proposals for a negative income tax and possible
changes to the National Insurance system to make it more attractive to hire
the unskilled. But such measures, if announced this year, would have to be
in the context of a neutral Budget, they said.
The report said none of the six would argue for an immediate change in
interest rates. They wanted to see how the economy responded to September's
rise in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent and the
chancellor's Budget decisions.
Looking ahead, Messrs Britton, Currie and Davies thought further rate
increases would be necessary to restrain inflation, with Mr Davies saying an
increase should be relatively soon if there was no further fiscal tightening
in the Budget. Profs Minford and Godley, by contrast, were strongly opposed
to higher rates in the near future. The report said most panellists favoured
tightening fiscal rather than monetary policy to deal with excessive demand
growth.
The Treasury yesterday welcomed the report. But the panel's future is
unclear.

FT  04 NOV 94 / A continent discovered: Martin Wolf and Tony Walker ask
whether the government can stay on the Chinese economic tiger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of China to the world is,' argues Prof Tong Dalin, vice-chairman
of the Chinese Society for Research on Restructuring the Economic System,
'like the discovery of a new continent.'
If anything, Prof Tong understates his case. Were China to replicate the
performance of other Asian 'miracle' economies, such as Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea, its impact would be overwhelming. China does, after all,
contain 10 times as many people as Japan.
According to official statistics, the economy is already well on the way.
Real gross domestic product expanded by 270 per cent between 1978 and 1993 -
a compound annual rate of 9 per cent a year. In 1992 and 1993, economic
growth exceeded 13 per cent. This year, supposedly time for a slow-down, it
is expected to be above 11 per cent.
There are reasons to believe these figures exaggerate China's performance.
If, for example, the reported growth rate is worked backwards from the World
Bank's estimate for GDP per head of Dollars 470 in 1992, it becomes just
Dollars 195 in 1980 (in 1992 dollars). This is below the rather more
reliable estimates of India's GDP per head in that year, which is quite
unlikely.
Chinese statistics are not entirely reliable. Under-estimation of inflation
is, for example, a well-known problem. More significant are the problems
created by its still semi-reformed economy.
Even in 1992, almost half of the industrial output was generated by the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while more than 61 per cent of total fixed
investment (23 per cent of GDP) was buried within them (see chart). Given
the low cost of official finance, the virtual absence of bankruptcy, and
continued distortions in relative prices, part of this investment is likely
to have been wasted. At least some of the associated increases in output
could also be illusory, as turned out to be the case for the vaunted growth
of the former Soviet-bloc economies.
Nevertheless, China does have solid and measurable achievements. The
country's share of world merchandise trade rose from 0.6 per cent in 1977 to
2.5 per cent in 1993, by when it had become the world's 11th largest
exporter. Foreign direct investment in 1993 was Dollars 21.3bn, more than a
third of total FDI in all developing countries in that year.
Gross national savings reached 40 per cent of GDP in 1993 (which can be
contrasted with the 15 per cent attained in the wealthier US). Such a high
rate of capital formation virtually ensures rapid growth, even if some is
wasted. Moreover, consumption has been growing at a compound rate of close
to 8 per cent a year since 1978.
Non-state enterprises (including so-called township and village enterprises)
now employ some 100m workers. Moreover, most Chinese provinces - not just
those on the coast, like Guangdon and Fujian - have achieved substantial
increases in real incomes.
These achievements are not a miracle. As developments elsewhere in Asia
show, they are the natural result of releasing the pent-up energies of the
world's largest reservoir of motivated people, combined with the capital and
know-how of overseas Chinese and other foreigners.
There is no economic reason why a country whose real output per head lies
somewhere between 5 and 10 per cent of that of the US should not be able to
sustain economic growth at 10 per cent a year for a quarter of a century.
Yet there may still be a reason for failure. For what is amazing is not that
China is at last becoming richer, but that it is still so poor. Politics
kept China poor. It could do so once more.
The reasons for this dismal performance were the country's inability to
combine a reasonable degree of political stability with encouragement of
productive (as opposed to rent-seeking) economic initiative. Under the
influence of Deng Xiaoping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', this
combination has at last been achieved. The big question is whether it will
survive his death.
Optimists argue that progress is assured merely by continuing with past
policies. In the most brilliant example of the indirect approach in economic
history, Chinese policy-makers have simply gone round the obstacles created
by the legacy of communism.
They started by granting freedoms to peasant farming, while political
decentralisation encouraged local governments to compete with one another
for investment. The overseas Chinese and foreigners were invited into
special economic zones and, increasingly, to form joint-ventures with
Chinese enterprises. State-enterprises have been subjected to competition
from without, rather than radical reform from within. More recently,
financial markets have also been created.
The ruling assumption is that China has now reached a virtuous circle of
growth. Economic success engenders both further reform and popular
toleration of the regime. It also makes a return to the old ideologies
impossible. As Mr Zhang Junkuo, senior research fellow of the Development
Research Centre of the State Council, remarks: 'The target itself is
changing all the time.'
The extent to which targets have changed was revealed in the 14th congress
of the Communist party of October 1992, which officially endorsed the idea
of a 'socialist market economy'. This was followed by the Third Plenum of
1993, whose '50 articles' laid out an ambitious programme of further reform.
The document established the principles of central government primacy,
necessary for fiscal and monetary discipline; of a rule-based market
economy, with uniform laws, rather than one based on bargaining; and of the
reform of property rights within SOEs. Above all, it established a
comprehensive blueprint for the transition to a market economy. It goes well
beyond 'groping for stones to cross a river', the original motto of reform.
The success of incrementalism has encouraged reformers to be bolder and more
systematic in what they are attempting to do.
Unfortunately, the benign view of Chinese prospects - in which ever more
rigorous and decisive approaches to reform are built upon the successes of
previous more tentative ones - is persuasive, rather than cogent. Past
reform has not just thrown up successes on which to build. It has also
erected significant obstacles.
Among the most important is the effect on political and social stability.
The most immediate threats include official corruption, unrest among
unemployed workers, the migration of a vast army of indigent peasants in
search of work and a widening gap between rich and poor. The necessity to
establish affordable social security arrangements, after the break-down of
the old cradle-to-grave education, employment, health and welfare system
based on work units is another daunting challenge.
Central control is also being tested by increasingly powerful provincial
officials, especially those from wealthy coastal provinces, whose economic
success has enabled them to carve out personal fiefdoms allowing them, on
occasions, to challenge or even ignore Beijing's dictates.
The fruits of economic success are the only possible basis for political
stability in a country that has turned its back on communist ideology. But
they are also the source of destabilising political and social developments.
Budget deficits, incontinent monetary expansion and inflation are the
economic evidence for these various political stresses. They bubble to the
surface, like lava, where the tectonic plates of fragile central authority,
provincial autonomy and SOE uncompetitiveness clash. They also have the
capacity to engulf even the most vigorous fruits of economic reform.
As William Overholt says in his important book on China's prospects:
'Failure to mobilise sufficient revenue through tax reform has historically
been a key reason for the downfall of China's regimes; it was a fatal flaw
of the Qing dynasty'.(1) It has now become a grave danger to the regime's
stability.
Following earlier reform, revenue from SOEs has fallen from 20 per cent of
GDP in 1978 to only 4 per cent in 1992. This decline accounted for 80 per
cent of the fall in the share of budgetary revenue in GDP, from 34.4 per
cent to a mere 15.4 per cent. Until reforms introduced this year, revenue
has also been collected by local government, leaving central government
starved: the central government's share in budgetary revenue shrank from 59
to 41 per cent, though its share in spending fell only from 46 to 41 per
cent.
Central government has lost the capacity to transfer income from the
wealthier and more dynamic coastal parts of China to the less dynamic
hinterland. More significantly, it has turned in a big way to direct and
indirect borrowing from the central bank, the People's Bank of China. The
chart shows how far it has gone, on the assumption that 80 per cent of the
lending by the PBC to the financial system is, in fact, government-directed
lending and so indirect public spending. It also shows how rapidly the
consolidated deficit itself has been rising. In 1993 it was more than half
as large as total budgetary revenues.
Seignorage - revenue derived from the government's access to the central
bank via monetary expansion - seems to have varied from 6 to 9 per cent of
Chinese GDP between 1988 and 1992, an extraordinary figure by international
standards. In 1992, for example, seignorage from reserve money creation
amounted to just under 40 per cent of total budgetary revenues, while direct
and indirect government borrowing from the PBC amounted to just under 30 per
cent.
The Chinese government is addicted to the printing press because pressures
for spending are growing stronger, while its revenue base is so weak.
Pressures for public spending increase as SOEs come under growing
competitive pressure: almost half of them appear to be making losses this
year, even though the economy is forecast to expand by more than 11 per
cent. It is horrifying to consider what would happen in a real recession.
It is almost impossible to exaggerate the significance of the monetary
financing. Hitherto the Chinese people have willingly held ever more money,
partly because of the lack of alternatives (see chart). Given the degree of
monetisation of the economy - much higher than in other economies at
comparable levels of development - flight from money would cause a
devastating inflation.
The danger is real - and the urgency of decisive action underplayed even
among the more economically educated policy-makers.
The big question is whether decisive action is politically possible. Reform
of state enterprises, creation of a social security system, making a success
of the new fiscal system, reform of the central bank are all extremely
urgent if economic - and so political - stability are to be secured. Is the
Communist party, divided and weak, the instrument to deliver urgent action?
If not, there is no alternative.
Senior Chinese believe that the party will survive this difficult period,
provided living standards continue to improve at a fairly rapid rate. Dong
Fureng, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, China's parliament, says: 'Politically I don't see fundamental
change in the next 10 years. The Communist party will still be controlling
the country with the proviso that it keeps its hands clean.'
Critics would say that the party has failed in this regard and that
corruption is pandemic.
But Mr Dong, who is also a professor emeritus of China's Academy of Social
Sciences, believes that in spite of resistance, the Chinese system is
capable of transformation. 'We will have to change,' he says. 'We will have
to become more democratic and that means increasing the powers of
representative institutions like the National People's Congress.'
Chinese officials insist that their mission is to avoid repetition of
Soviet-style turmoil, on the grounds that China, with its huge, unwieldy
population, simply could not sustain such disruption.
Memories of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution continue to weigh heavily.
Their dilemma, however, is that slow and steady change, which they prefer
and which would avoid upsetting powerful interests in society, may itself be
disruptive. The authorities have to stabilise the shaky public finances and
monetary system now. But they must also not halt economic progress, or awake
overwhelming opposition.
If they get the balance right, they should be able to ride the tiger of
super-charged economic growth for years. China itself would then become more
middle-class, more democratic and more open, while the Communist party would
have to change out of recognition. If they fail, the inadequacy of the
rulers will, again, have short-changed the long-suffering Chinese people.

Nuclear Electric's go-ahead to start up Sizewell B after 10 years of
planning and construction is mixed news for John Collier, company chairman.
Some time ago he wagered that Sizewell would be selling electricity before
Eurotunnel was transporting fare-paying passengers. He can throw the switch
on Sizewell in 28 days, though it will not generate commercial power until
February. But Eurotunnel, despite all its woes, should be earning its first
hard cash from November 14. Though who wants to bet on that?

<TEXT>
Joseph Perella's first big deal for Morgan Stanley is not proving
harmonious. In June, the former First Boston and Wasserstein Perella
takeover artist seemed to have pulled off Wall Street's fanciest bit of
financial footwork of the year. The Dollars 2.7bn break-up bid for Kemper he
conjured up on behalf of Morgan Stanley's client Conseco had everything -
bank debt, junk bonds, even a little bit of equity.
Unfortunately for Perella, the deal has been unravelling fast. Selling
assets to bring down the debt has proved a problem, and forced a delay to
the deal. Now Conseco chairman Stephen Hilbert has had to admit that his own
shareholders won't back the transaction, forcing him to cut the value of his
bid.
Never mind. If Kemper ends up soliciting a higher offer from someone else,
it will have to pay Conseco Dollars 100m. So maybe Perella has earned his
keep after all.

Tough times for the editors of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspapers. Kelvin

into Murdoch's BSkyB and then quit because he couldn't get on with his new
boss.
Now it seems that Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, is
also on the point of quitting the Murdoch empire because his bid to set up
the US equivalent of BBC TV's Panorama programme - called On Assignment -
has been scrapped. Neil has apparently been offered a Pounds 2m-a- year job
as editor of a new five-day-a-week late-night news programme. The money
sounds good - but it could prove to be a bit of a treadmill and interfere
with Neil's extramural activities. A nail-biting time for John Witherow,
acting editor of The Sunday Times, and the publishers of Neil's memoirs.

Another first for the City of London. It has plenty of streets, gates, hills
and even ditches, but up to now never a road. However, it has just had to
accept its first - the south-eastern tip of Goswell Road - and by all
accounts the City elders are none too pleased. It's all the fault of the
changes in local authority boundaries.
'The thing is, you don't need roads once you are in the City, because you
have arrived,' says a City official. Barbara Newman, who heads the City's
planning and transportation committee, is not optimistic about getting
Islington's council to rename its highway, Goswell Street, just to suit the
City.
While Observer was always rather proud to live in a road as opposed to a
street, Newman seems intent on maintaining the City's 'No Roads' policy.
Sounds like a bit of gerrymandering is called for.

The distinction between the editorial and news departments of the Wall
Street Journal newspaper is no secret. The former is a billboard for
conservative thinking, while the latter plays it pretty straight. Each seems
to accept - if not always happily - the existence of the other.
But that inherent contradiction has surfaced this week with the publication
of extracts - by the news section, naturally - of a book by two WSJ
reporters who are highly critical of Justice Clarence Thomas of the US
Supreme Court.
In 1991, when confronted with allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill
during his confirmation hearings, Judge Thomas had no stouter defenders than
WSJ leader writers. Much space was devoted to David Brock, whose book
charged that Hill was part of a liberal conspiracy to undermine the judge,
by foul means rather than fair.
Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, two WSJ reporters, now come to a distinctly
different conclusion. In the extracts, they paint a picture of a man almost
obsessed by the female sex, parading as witnesses four women who worked with
Thomas and whose evidence was never presented to the Senate judiciary
committee. The extracts appeared yesterday - as did spin-off prime time TV
programmes.
So far the magisterial leader writers have been quiet. But surely not for
long?

FT  04 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Justifiably dollar shy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bank intervention in currency markets is rarely effective when the
problems of the currency in question reflect anxiety about the broader
stance of monetary policy. Hence the general scepticism among traders and
economists after Wednesday's intervention by the US Federal Reserve to prop
up a dollar that was plumbing yet another post-war low against the yen.
The short-term perception is that the Fed's policy stance is not restrictive
enough to cope with inflationary pressures in the US and so pre-empt a
further dollar decline. Yet it is a moot point whether even a significant
increase in short-term dollar rates, perhaps after the next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting in mid-month, would provide the reassurance markets
seek.
Historically, the dollar has tended to strengthen late in the economic
cycle, as the Fed has applied the brakes to an overheating economy and the
rest of the world has moved into the recovery phase. Yet many of the
international flows in the present cycle may continue to work against the
gravitational pull of short-term interest rate differentials.
One trend that could go unhelpfully into reverse relates to the growth in
official dollar reserves. These have ballooned, most notably in Asia, in
response to large capital inflows, as central banks have sought to offset
the upward pressure on their currencies by purchasing dollars. Yet the cost
of unsterilised intervention aimed at maintaining currency competitiveness
is rapid money supply growth and accelerating inflation. With official
reserves at record levels and inflation soaring, currency appreciation will
come to seem the lesser evil. The dollar may thus have less support from
this source in future.
Progressive decline
Portfolio flows in the US and Japan, meantime, have long been running in the
opposite direction to what is needed to address the current account
imbalance between the two countries. A less frequently observed phenomenon
is the progressive decline of net direct investment out of Japan from
Dollars 48bn in 1990 to less than Dollars 14bn last year. Why is the
Japanese tradeable goods sector failing to respond to the appreciation of
the yen against the dollar by investing more heavily in the US?
One clue is provided by an article in the New York Fed's latest quarterly
review, which points out that foreign firms' experience in the US has been
dismal even when the dollar is stripped out of the equation. With assets of
Dollars 1,800bn and sales of Dollars 1,200bn they failed to turn any profit
on their investment in 1992.
Transfer pricing
Of course, any losses of Japanese companies within the aggregate figures may
be less than they might have incurred on the same operation at home, because
of the overvaluation of the yen. But since five out of six inward investment
dollars have been spent on acquisitions rather than new enterprises, this
looks academic. Nor do the New York Fed economists believe that transfer
pricing - shifting profits to less heavily taxed overseas jurisdictions -
accounts for more than a quarter, at most, of the difference between foreign
and domestic profits.
The more obvious explanation is that foreign companies went wild in the
takeover boom of the 1980s, since by 1990 around half of foreign holdings in
the US resulted from acquisitions in the previous five years. The Japanese
in particular were taking advantage of their lower cost of capital to buy
cheaply. Yet the advantage appears to have been nullified by poor selection
of acquisitions and heavy reliance on debt finance. Post-acquisition profits
have tended to collapse.
In the past, direct investment profits have improved with age. Even so,
recent experience will do little to reduce Japanese industrialists' dollar
shyness. And in a climate of poor corporate earnings and depressed
investment in Japan, the short-term enthusiasm for investment overseas is
anyway limited.
In due course the dollar may have its day. But as the American monetary
pundit James Grant has pithily observed in Grant's Interest Rate Observer,
the miracle of the dollar is that, after so many years of officially
sponsored depreciation, it is still the world's top monetary brand name.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Red tape in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which became law yesterday, is an
extraordinary hotchpotch of a measure. If properly applied, it could make a
modest improvement to Britain's competitiveness. But its most important
contribution to that goal may be to put an end to the misconceived notion
that deregulation tout court is a panacea for the ills of the British
economy.
The deregulation act does everything from establishing a new legislative
procedure for sweeping away outdated rules and procedures affecting business
to reducing the accounting and reporting requirements on small charities,
allowing betting on Sundays and permitting children into the bars of
suitable pubs.
The important provisions are the powers which will allow ministers to
abolish or reform regulations they consider outdated and burdensome where
this can be done without removing 'necessary' protection, and the five new
powers to improve the fairness, transparency and consistency of enforcement
procedures.
In both cases, the legislation is drawn in general terms, so it is hard to
tell in advance how much difference it will make. Throughout the
parliamentary debates on the legislation the Labour party condemned it as a
'constitutional outrage', because of the powers given to ministers to frame
proposals for the repeal or amendment of regulations. Concern was expressed
that health and safety might be compromised by excessive deregulation.
Right of appeal
On the other hand, some business leaders believe the provisions do not go
far enough, and are aggrieved at the failure to provide a simple and
statutory right of appeal against enforcement orders, particularly those
emanating from local councils. The trade and industry department has gone no
further than a 'model appeal mechanism' which has still to be drawn up and
will be incorporated in future legislation.
In practice, the constitutional outrage is unlikely to materialise. Nor is
the wholesale escape from local regulation which some companies seek. The
government claims that 40 per cent of the health and safety regulation which
affects the 'generality' of business should be removed. Yet it is equally
insistent that it is not going to remove necessary protection either for
employees or for local communities and claims the support of the Health and
Safety Commission for most of its recommendations.
That can only mean that most of the regulation to be swept away involves
petty bureaucracy, rules that are anyway in disuse, or regulations which
impact on only a small proportion of businesses. So it appears from the
deregulatory changes already decided upon, which include halving the waiting
period for claiming VAT for bad debt relief and scrapping 85,000 employment
survey forms a year.
Euro-regulation
More of the same is welcome. It is also important that a standing watch is
kept on the rise of Euro-regulation - either in its direct form of
unnecessary obligations imposed by Brussels or its indirect form of
overzealous application of EU directives by UK officials.
Yet there is no point pretending that such action is going to transform the
business climate and sharply improve Britain's competitiveness. To do that,
governments need, over the long term, to find a way of containing public
spending and taxation, while promoting better education and skill training -
and the local and national infrastructure that companies and individuals
need to flourish.
The priorities are familiar, but no less urgent for that. Britain's record
on vocational training remains abysmal - and recent reports on the progress
of the new General National Vocational Qualifications do not lead one to
suppose that a miracle cure has yet been found. The Training and Enterprise
Councils have still to prove themselves as employer-led vehicles for
training. More needs to be done to equip the unemployed with skills, and to
make it attractive for companies to employ them. Some form of 'modern
apprenticeship' for young employees with poor skill levels is essential.
The list could be continued. At the end of the day, the country would be
better off, even if too many forms were issued, so long as far more
employees could complete them in decent English.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bizarre result is against wishes of
residents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was very concerned to read your prediction ('Council reform faces
further setback', November 1) that the Local Government Commission will
recommend no change in most of the county areas in the second phase of their
review. Last week, the commission published its recommendations for nine
county areas. In six of these, including my own county of Cheshire, the
commission made a U-turn and recommended no change.
The big question that I and the electorate in Cheshire and other county
areas will now be asking is: 'Why has the commission spent more than two
years reviewing local government at a cost nationally of in excess of Pounds
8m a year, and is coming out with absolutely no positive results?'
All the arguments for scrapping the present system and creating new unitary
councils in Cheshire and other counties are as powerful today as when the
commission advanced them in its draft recommendations last June. Two-tier
local government costs residents more, it is inefficient, unaccountable,
confusing and unpopular. It is bizarre that the commission should now
recommend after all its own research and evidence to the contrary, the
retention of the status quo.
We in Chester consulted our residents about their wishes on several
occasions. On the last occasion, a Gallup Poll undertaken in October showed
that there was still a clear majority of Chester residents who preferred
unitary local authorities and that indeed 67 per cent of them wanted a
unitary council based on Chester.
In view of this substantial public support in Chester, and no doubt
elsewhere, it seems preposterous that the residents of cities like Chester
should not get the same benefits of unitary local government as will now be
enjoyed in the future by the cities of York and Bath and Chester's
neighbouring town of Wrexham in North Wales.
We in Chester, in common with other towns and cities, will be pressing the
government strongly to reject these totally unacceptable recommendations.

FT  04 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Hard-driving realist - Howard Davies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been some years since British business had it so good. When Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, was
recently with a group of West Midlands businessmen, only one was negative
about his prospects.
'We looked at him as if he were a bad smell,' says Davies. Could all the CBI
surveys capturing rising optimism among business leaders be wide of the
mark?
Davies took the man aside to seek out the problem. ' 'Oh, Howard, don't
worry,' ' Davies recounts in a passable Brummy accent from his airy office
high above London. ' 'We've just got some very bad products right now.' '
Davies returns to Birmingham on Sunday for the start of the CBI's annual
conference. While grass roots members will have their usual share of gripes,
the business outlook is unusually favourable.
Inflation is at a 27-year low. The exchange rate is stable. Growth, exports
and investment are accelerating. Even if interest rates have to rise further
to keep inflation in check, they will not return to the double-digit levels
of only a few years ago.
The outlook is also good for the CBI as a lobbyist for business. Its views
find a ready ear in Whitehall, especially with Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary. The relationship with the government is
sweetness and light compared with 1980 when Sir Terence Beckett, a previous
director-general, threatened a 'bare knuckle fight' over economic policy.
So where is the next challenge for the hard-driving director-general, who
seems to make as many media appearances as England's football manager.
In the short term, he will be watching the government closely to make sure
that it is not back-sliding on economic management. The temptation to switch
from investment to consumption in order to line voters' pockets at the
expense of business will strengthen as the next general election approaches.
'It is at the back of one's mind that they may well,' Davies says. An
investment-led recovery requiring the government to bear down on public
expenditure 'may not be popular' with the electorate, he concedes. Vigilant
for such unwelcome policy shifts, Davies and the CBI will try to use their
influence to keep the economy on a business-friendly track.
Looking further ahead politically, the CBI is keen to further its dialogues
with the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. It is also keen to lobby the
European Commission where, arguably, the real power will increasingly lie.
All three organisations will be on the platform at the Birmingham meeting.
Paddy Ashdown will be the first Liberal leader to address the CBI
convention, following Labour's debut last year by John Smith. Labour's
representative this year will be Robin Cook, until recently the party's
pugnacious and effective industry spokesman.
The CBI is less lucky in attracting Euroleaders to speak. Last year Jacques
Delors, then EC president, pulled out at the last minute because of illness.
This year, the CBI invited Jacques Santer, when he was a candidate to
succeed Delors, but the new president appears to have decided to save his
first UK public appearance for a bigger occasion.
But the Commission's representative at Monday's morning session, Padraig
Flynn, is hardly a make-weight. Responsible for the EU's social policy, he
will be expected to respond to the charge, voiced by many a British business
executive, that the commission's social charter on employment would be an
instrument of ruin.
'Flynn will get a mixed reception,' Davies says. 'But it's a good sign that
he more or less volunteered to come.'
The commissioner is likely to be grilled by CBI members on the extra
employment costs and inflexibilities laid down in the charter and Britain's
chances of retaining its opt-out from it. To marshal ammunition, the CBI has
conducted two extensive surveys on its members' Euro-thoughts that it will
publish on Sunday.
Broadly speaking, CBI members favour the EU and its enlargement, Davies
says. But they worry about the costs, chafe at needless complexities and are
disappointed by the degree reality falls short of rhetoric. The CBI's survey
will show the single market remains highly imperfect for many goods and
services.
Davies is a realist. A future Labour government would sign Britain up to the
charter regardless of vociferous business complaints, he concedes.
Therefore, the CBI, which has a Brussels lobbying office, is working with
UNICE, the European employer organisation, to make the charter less costly
for business.
Other themes in the conference schedule include long-term issues such as
raising investment levels, improving competitiveness, the cost of
environmental legislation and the difficulty of getting the unemployed back
to work.
For Davies, the pick-up in investment has been the most significant
development in the last six months. Until the spring, the economic recovery
had been led by consumption, with investment levels remaining stubbornly low
for this stage in the cycle.
This reflected the UK economy's slow response to stimuli such as lower
interest rates. 'You give the thing a kick and this surly beast turns round
and says 'what's going on?',' Davies says.
One reason business has been slow to invest has been the volatility of the
British economy compared with other countries. 'It takes people longer to
believe things are better,' he says.
But now that business has enjoyed an unusually long period of price,
exchange rate and interest rate stability, it has begun investing again.
'We're back on track.' As a percentage of gross domestic product, investment
is back to levels last seen in 1983-1984.
After years of underinvestment compared with other countries, the CBI's
bigger concern is to achieve a 'step change' in investment levels. Its
budget proposals, for example, are an attempt to improve the return for
investors. 'If we can recalibrate those things surrounding the investment
decision, then the natural animal spirit of the British entrepreneur will
have a free rein.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Theory squeezes economic ideas into a
mathematical straitjacket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many of those who read Professor Barro's Personal View (November 1)
would have been surprised to discover that the essence of 'endogenous growth
theory' is the proposition that commercial research and development leads to
the discovery and adoption of new technologies and new products, and that
this 'theoretical advance' had been made in California in the late 1980s.
They may have thought that this idea was a fairly commonplace one, which has
become familiar since its propagation by Schumpeter more than 50 years ago.
What the proponents of 'endogenous growth theory' have done is to try to
squeeze some of the ideas of earlier economists into the straitjacket of a
set of mathematical equations. Few people would believe that the evolution
of modern market economies can usefully be represented by a set of equations
which focus on linear relationships between quantifiable 'variables', to the
exclusion of the more subtle but more important connections between social,
political and subjective factors.
In this connection, Professor Barro's statement that 'Overall, the new
theory and empirical work on economic growth supports the general thrust of
. . . economic policies such as privatisation and deregulation . . .' is
misleading. While one would expect 'empirical work' to support the notion
that privatisation and deregulation are beneficial to economic growth in
advanced economies, this has nothing to do with endogenous growth theory,
which does not count such measures as privatisation or deregulation among
the 'variables' of its equations.
Britain's chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and others are right to be sceptical
of intellectual games which subtract from, rather than add to, our
understanding of the process of economic growth. Their only practical
function appears to be to provide catch-phrases for those politicians who do
not understand them.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hubs offer transport economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You would expect us in telecoms to welcome Giles Keating's Personal
View (October 31) about the use of information technology to address the
realities of the transport problem. I should like to develop his thinking in
my capacity as a prisoner of the M25 London orbital motorway.
As he says we have grown accustomed to the predictability and door-to-door
security of auto travel, such as they are. We may feel we ought to use
trains; but not only are they dirty and erratic, they never go to the right
place. If one has to get oneself or one's goods to and from the railhead
anyway it is easier to go the whole way by car or lorry.
Modern airports have become hubs in highly developed hire vehicle networks
almost without us noticing. It would need only a minimum of investment, of
organising skill and of imagination to turn stations into similar hubs for
highly organised short-distance networks of buses and hire cars to homes and
offices.
Similarly, railway goods depots would be natural hubs for goods container
services to and from factories and shops, on the analogy of container
shipping. Mr Keating's information networks would optimise the economics of
both operations from the outset.
Once this key obstacle was cracked rail traffic would build up so fast there
would be more than enough cash to put more trains on to run; to make them
run on time; and even to clean the coaches.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: View 'music to the ears'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr TONY PICKLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was most refreshing to read Christopher Haskins' article on
partnership and social justice (Personal View, October 24). To hear a senior
UK industrialist condemn the 'obsessive pursuit of a low skills, low
investment strategy' is truly welcome; to hear him express support for the
European Union's Social Chapter, relating this to the need for responsible
and progressive company personnel policies, is surely music to the ears of
all of us who have become so depressed by the negative stance adopted by
some leaders of industry and some (many?) leading politicians.
If Mr Haskins' views were to become an integral part of public policy, and
if companies took on board the same enlightened policies, the UK would stand
a decent chance of becoming the modern, efficient, progressive economy that
we all claim to want - certainly the economy that is needed for social
justice to become reality.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Not yet Major's last post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take no notice of all the headlines about the humiliation of Mr Michael
Heseltine. Yes, the trade secretary has lost a battle over Post Office
privatisation, but that is not the significant defeat. The authority of the
government, already questioned, lies in ruins.
It is now obvious that Mr John Major is not in charge. His administration
does not know where it is going. The prime minister lives by the mercy of
whatever may be ordained by any two or three taxi-fuls of rebel members of
his party. His government is steered by the winds, buffeted by fate, kicked
around by ad hoc gangs of second-raters who oppose it from within. It has
proved unable to put a simple Post Office privatisation bill in the speech
due to be delivered by the Queen when she reopens Parliament on November 16.
If Mr Major recovers his nerve, he might introduce such a measure anyway,
perhaps early next year. The odds are that he will not.
It is a sorry sight. Mr Major showed courage during the debate on the bill
to ratify the Maastricht treaty, when he faced down Conservative rebels and
challenged them to topple the government. He might have tried the same
tactic this time. The chances are that it would have worked. He has,
instead, shied at the fence. His government's apparent inability to sell the
postal service confirms the difficulty of promoting radical or unpopular
legislation when your parliamentary majority is low and falling. It is an
indication of weak leadership. Will we now refer to 'Mr Major's lame duck
administration'? Probably.
That said, a kinder construction may be put upon yesterday's events. The
prime minister may have reasoned that a halt to PO privatisation would be
popular with the voters, and therefore helpful to the Tories. As Mr Kenneth
Clarke acknowledges, high water charges in some areas have turned opinion
against sell-offs. The chancellor has also observed that the excessive
salaries some greedy water company directors have paid themselves have given
privatisation a bad name.
At the recent Conservative party conference Mr Major wisely avoided the
temptation to lean further to the right. True, restless free marketeers in
his party will not cease their twittering until the government has
minimalised itself out of existence, but the wider electorate thinks
differently. The prime minister appears to have chosen to fight the next
election as a centrist. Anything else would be politically stupid; as it
happens he could yet win another term, even as a lame duck.
I am not alone in thinking this. If you peer through the eyes of Mr Tony
Blair the present condition of British politics is simply stated. The leader
of the opposition is far from complacent about Labour's chances in 1996 or
1997. He is nature's worrier, aware that in spite of everything it would be
premature to wave goodbye to Mr Major.
The prime minister has been through a difficult fortnight, during which he
has not always seemed in control of events. His handling of the succession
of disclosures of alleged corruption among his ministers has not won him
high praise. That may have damaged the government, but it will not win an
election for the opposition. Mr Blair believes that most voters dislike the
Conservatives and want a change, but he also knows that they are not yet
convinced that the people's party would improve the quality of their lives.
The Conservatives harbour two schemes for winning votes. First, when
election day is near the prime minister will wave the Union Jack,
challenging the opposition parties on both Europe and constitutional change.
Second, the chancellor might cut income tax in November 1995, in time for an
April 1996 election. If not then, taxes will almost certainly be reduced in
November 1996, ready for a tax-auction campaign the following April. To make
assurance doubly sure, Mr Clarke might reduce taxes in both Novembers. This
will be a strong temptation if Mr Major is obliged by fear of defeat to hang
on until the last possible date in 1997.
A similar double whammy - the flag and tax cuts - worked in April 1992. It
is not axiomatic that it will fail next time. Mr Blair understands this. He
is trying to change voter perceptions as a form of immunisation against
future Tory tax reductions. His concern is with 'shifting the fundamentals'.
This means speaking out boldly to change Labour thinking at every turn, and
trying, through speeches and voter education programmes, to prepare the
electorate to resist eve-of-poll Budget bribes. He has moved Labour towards
the centrist, or Conservative, position on interest rate rises, Ulster and
education. He proposes to remove the socialist Clause 4 from labour's
constitution, and has put his chosen moderniser in as party general
secretary. The recent report of the social justice commission contains
useful arguments in favour of taxing child benefit and means-testing state
pensions.
You and I may mutter that that is all very well, but there are still very
few specific policy commitments. Mr Blair talks about laying foundations,
putting building blocks in place, preparing the ground, thinking matters
through seriously, pointing the compass in the right direction. He accepts
that we now expect Labour to deliver specific, costed, proposals. Yet we
will have to wait. Certain 'flagship' policies may emerge at next October's
party conference. As to tax, the Labour leader argues that you cannot get
close to the truth about the best economic policy until very near polling
day, since everything depends on the economic circumstances that prevail at
that time. So he intends to maintain maximum flexibility.
In the short few months he has been leader, Mr Blair has worked hard to
appear relaxed. Everything he says and does is aimed at victory. For
example, he does not expect to win parliamentary jousts with Mr Major at
question time; leaders of the opposition rarely beat prime ministers. He has
chosen, instead, to maintain the right tone, the reasonable demeanour,
suitable for take-outs on the evening TV news. He attempts this even when
the prime minister blusters and rages. So far he has been fortunate. He has
managed to come across as a leader in control - of himself, his colleagues
and his party. With the best will in the world, the same cannot be said of
Mr Major.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: David Copperfield - Magic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He Walked Through the Great Wall of China; He has Made the Orient Express, a
Jet Airplane, and the Statue of Liberty Disappear, reads the promotional
blurb. So what is David Copperfield doing turning up aces and producing
rings from his back pocket in the bleak open spaces of the Earls Court
Arena?
Padding out his act, I suppose. A man who returned magic to the days of
Houdini by stage-managing elaborate public stunts, and brought it up to date
by exploiting the sophistication of television, looks strangely deprived of
his powers working at Earls Court.
Without the big stunts you quickly realise that Copperfield's performance
revolves around cutting up women and making them disappear - the magician's
lot throughout the ages. During the two hour show he mislays more pretty
girls than the average man loses socks. Loud music and awesome chutzpah
married to saturnine good looks have made Copperfield the richest magician
in history. His skill is in presentation: what he shows off is just the
commonplace woof and warp of the conjurer's trade. This is not so much
sleight of hand as sleight of personality.
But Copperfield holds a crowd. The problem with most magicians is that the
audience gets irritated with its own stupidity: it knows it is being tricked
by something as facile as mirrors, or wires, or twins, but cannot quite see
the joins. Copperfield disarms this criticism by constantly promising
stupefaction and delivering surprise. I suppose I can guess how he managed
to translate himself in a second from fondling a girl on stage to caressing
the same girl (apparently) half way down the Arena, but the illusion shocks
with its speed.
And again it is probably no harder to saw your assistant in half vertically
than horizontally, but Copperfield builds it up into an epic making event,
if only by the size of his blade. Until familiarity takes hold, the scale of
the tricks is impressive: you buy the sizzle.
Unfortunately the great climax - Copperfield flying - is something of a let
down. To the thousands at the rear of the Arena the sight of a small figure
moving like a badly co-ordinated goldfish at the back of the stage against
dark curtains cannot have been the most exciting of visions. It was not much
more impressive near the stage. We wanted Copperfield to fly over us like
Superman, not indulge in shenanigans which would have embarrassed a
Victorian medium.
Still there is something mysteriously eternal about magic - the elect have
kept their secrets. It probably does the brotherhood no harm that
Copperfield - assisted by fiancee, supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who sits
centre front, gazes on in awe and is Copperfield's marketing gimmick - has
such a smooth show biz approach that the punters are dazzled. But you can
imagine old hands at the Magic Circle tut-tutting at this crass
commercialisation of ancient rites.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: More friends in foreign places - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business in the UK gave more money to the arts in 1993-94. ABSA (The
Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts) will announce a total of
Pounds 69.5m, a rise of 6.2 per cent on the Pounds 65.4m of the previous
year.
But there were interesting variations in the giving. Straightforward cash
sponsorship was down for the second year running, by just over 2 per cent at
Pounds 56.37m, as against Pounds 57.69m in 1992-93. Companies were, however,
more generous to arts building projects, which rose by 50 per cent to almost
Pounds 7m, and in the fast growing area of support in kind - cars,
computers, etc. - which was almost 100 per cent higher at Pounds 6.16m.
The rise in corporate donations will please the government, which hopes that
business, along with local councils, will make matching contributions to the
arts building projects financed by the lottery.
On Tuesday the British Museum will announce that an American company is
putting up in excess of Pounds 1m to create a new and permanent North
American gallery at the museum. In recent years the Museum's collection of
native American art has been shown intermittently at its off-shoot, the
Museum of Mankind. It is now coming back to Great Russell Street as part of
the BM's 250th anniversary celebrations. It will be the museum's largest
ever corporate gift.
It is amazing how generous Americans are in underpinning the cultural life
of London - especially if their name is Sackler. Last month the National
Gallery re-opened its British room, devoted to the masterpieces of Turner,
Constable, Gainsborough, etc. It looks magnificent, restored to its 1870s
splendour. And the cost, well in excess of Pounds 1m, was footed by Mortimer
and Theresa Sackler, who in the past have given Pounds 500,000 to the Tate.
Pop over to the British Museum and admire the new Ancient Near East and
Early Egypt galleries and thank Raymond and Beverley Sackler, while the
Royal Academy has been transformed by the generosity of the late Arthur and
Jill Sackler, who gave millions towards the galleries that bear their name.
The UK obviously still has good friends in the US, at least in the Sackler
family, whose fortune was founded in the pharmaceutical industry.
But by far the most generous recent benefaction to a British gallery is the
Pounds 12m to the Tate from a mysterious American. The money will be spent
on revamping the old building, making it a fitting, and much larger, home
for the British collection when the modern stuff has gone to the new Tate
Gallery of Modern Art on Bankside. The giver is shy of publicity and has
been anonymous until now. He is Edwin Manton, Essex born but living in the
US since 1933, where he made a fortune in insurance.
British arts institutions, from museums to theatres to orchestras, will need
all the friends, British and foreign, private and corporate, they can find
in the next few years. For, to attract money from the lottery, they must
show their ability to raise a matching sum. The Arts Council has made it
clear that it does not expect substantial commitments from small arts
organisations, but larger institutions will be required to make a better
show.
The TSB has revamped its arts sponsorship programme. In the future it will
concentrate on those three popular corporate causes, education, youth and
opportunity, with a budget of around Pounds 300,000 a year. The first fruits
of its new policy will be announced on November 17 at the National Gallery.
The bank is to pay the transportation costs to bring school children from
outside the London area for a first visit to the gallery. Their teachers
will receive back-up support materials.
Another scheme provides for children who cannot get to the NG to receive
information packs which will enhance a visit to their local art gallery.
Next year a similar exercise will be launched with the LSO, enabling
children to attend concerts at the Barbican on discount tickets. A third
scheme is to be be announced next year.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: Orton double bill - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only 26 years since Joe Orton's death. Had he lived, he would today be
only 61 years old. Almost nothing in his black comedies has dated. The
connections between greed, lust, and criminality remain heartstoppingly
funny; and some of his jokes about the Kafkaesque British police in Loot are
astonishingly 'now'.
So it is upsetting to discover how seldom his plays are revived in
appropriate style. Orton's supreme joke is in his ironic - Wildean - mastery
of language. Characters frequently speak with precise formality about
matters carnal and/or criminal. Fay to Mr McLeavy (in Loot): 'You've been a
widower for three days. Have you considered a second marriage yet?' The
lines need maximum clarity and minimum special interpretation. The more
suave their delivery, the more delicious their irony.
In recent years, however, each Orton revival I have seen has been less
stylish than the last. The Birmingham Rep is now presenting an Orton double
bill - directed by Gwenda Hughes, designed by Kate Owen, with four actors
performing in both plays - in which Loot is creakily entertaining and
Entertaining Mr Sloane staggeringly short of innuendo.
It does not help Orton's comedy if the hostess Kath, telling her new lodger
Sloane that she has nothing on under her dress, reveals a firm petticoat; or
if, where Orton specifies a 'transparent negligee', she wears a fluff-lined
dressing-gown. Apart from these mere external factors, Stephanie Fayerman's
interpretation - pigeon-toed, half-gauche and half-dainty, hysterical - is
woefully over-emphatic, making a heavy meal out of the character's non-U
nursery talk and utterly missing the classic English joke of her romantic
social pretensions.
Michael Cashman does better as her brother Ed, but he usually stresses the
creepy side of Ed's homoerotic desires while not knowing how to make them
disarmingly funny too. As Mr Sloane, who seduces them both, young Ian
Pepperell (though physically too slight) has the right inscrutability, but
not nearly enough skill in nuance. Sloane is a heartless thug who fools
people he is an innocent - an innocent in need of firm . . . guidance; and
his deadpan account of his sporting . . . activities should be irresistible.
When Orton is not well enough acted, his originality dissolves. Watching the
Birmingham Loot, however, you are aware of little but Orton's subversive
novelty. Each character is consistent, but there is just enough absurdity in
the air for us to be undermined by hilarity.
Most of the cast - especially Cashman as Inspector Truscott - have such fun
with Irish or Scouse accents that they stress words more for sound effect
than for sense. Still, Cashman relishes his role; as does John Rogan as the
bewildered widower Mr McLeavy. Pepperell's Hal and Ian Targett's energetic,
nervous Dennis give fluent accounts of the two unscrupulous young
coffin-despoiling bank-robbers. Fayerman, as the much-married killer nurse
Fay McMahon, still overdoes the busy gestures, but here she adopts the right
basic suavity. (Good Orton must hover on the brink of camp.)
Wittily, Kate Owen has located the two plays next door to each other, in two
halves of one semi-detached house on the same revolving stage. Two of the
problems in Sloane are that she obliges us to see action (in the kitchen, or
upstairs) that Orton meant to occur offstage, and that she shows us the
flock of cuddly-toys that Kath keeps in her bedroom. (Doesn't much of
Orton's essence always lie in what he does not show us?) In Loot, however,
we see little save what Orton meant us to see, and the comedy of what is
seen and unseen flourishes.
At the Birmingham Rep.

<TEXT>
Somebody once said that when people stop believing in god they don't start
believing in nothing, they start believing in anything. If you plot the
decline of religious belief in Britain against the rise in 'new age'
nonsense there appears to be a lot of truth in this. Even quite serious
newspapers and magazines now run features on 'your stars', and television is
increasingly keen on ooky-spooky programmes about the supernatural. The most
recent is Strange But True? a title which leaves room for doubt in its
printed form, with that question mark on the end, but which becomes an
assertion of fact when pronounced by presenter Michael Aspel (8.30 ITV).
Friday night is still movie night and the best of today's offerings is The
Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (12.15 BBC2). Unsurprisingly it is one of the
titles mentioned in the Favourite Films programme at 9.30. The guest is
Anjelica Huston whose father and grandfather both won Oscars for the
picture, John for screenplay and direction, Walter as best supporting actor.
The story is set in the Mexican gold rush.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: The Editing Process - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In The Editing Process, the new play by Meredith Oakes staged by Stephen
Daldry at the Royal Court, the word 'editing' scarcely occurs. And the
concrete practice of editing - of making a literary work suitable for
publication - also makes only fleeting appearances. No accident, this. On
one level, Oakes is showing us the terrible truth about modern publishing:
that all too little of it is actually concerned with the process of editing.
On another level, however, as she shows us the larger processes of a large
publishing house, she lets us feel the larger metaphorical sense of
'editing'. Editing has many ingredients: improving, changing, adding,
subtracting, deleting.
The Editing Process is a satire - bitter and tender, very uneven and always
interesting - about aspects of modern life. At first it is mainly about the
dismaying way in which a serious specialist journalistic endeavour is
incorporated into a brash philistine publishing firm; and for anyone with
some acquaintance with the ways of modern publishing this is a highly
affecting subject. Oakes's treatment, however, is tough and ironic. The
little old magazine, Footnotes in History - edited by William, with the
support of his long-term secretary, Peggy, who keeps on resigning - is in no
way run well. William is lofty, pompous, insensitive, in person and, one
presumes, as an editor. But the crass modern establishment in which
Footnotes in History finds itself is just as absurd. Its corridors bristle
with careerism; and Ted, the assistant editor, proves responsive to the new
climate.
Later, however, the play's subject becomes redundancy. Peggy must be made
redundant; William lacks the guts to tell her. He not only drives her hard
towards resignation, he does nothing to woo her back, this time, when she
does. In due course, redundancy comes to William too. But whereas Peggy
still believes in Footnotes in History, William suddenly feels that his
whole career has been a fraud. And, anyway, they are both footnotes in
history now. 'Life does go on, doesn't it,' Peggy says; then (my favourite
line) 'As soon as one's back is turned, life goes on.'
It is by no means a completely realistic play. There are sudden soliloquies
amid ensemble scenes; and there are set speeches like arias, set dialogue
like duets or stichomythia. The characterisations are complex but not always
convincing. Still, its blend of realism, stylisation, and artifice is what
Daldry's production emphasises. William, attacking his new boss Lionel, says
'People like you swim in the polluted waters of this company all oblivious,
opening and shutting your mouths with the idiot complacency of dying fish.'
Et voila] The dominant metaphor of Daldry's, and his designer's Ian
McNeil's, staging. We see fish-tanks small and large around the office of
Footnotes in History; and we see, I think, that the office - the firm - is
itself a goldfish bowl, enveloped in a high curving perspex wall.
A note of caution. Too many Daldry stagings seem to apply the same formula:
heavy scenic effects to stress a play's socialist intentions. You may feel
that Daldry and Co. are pressing more omens, metaphors, and melodrama from
the play than it needs.
On the other hand, the play is strongly cast, and most of its pacing
excellent. Fascinating to watch Prunella Scales, whose method is to fix the
social character of a role with a satiric edge, as Peggy, alongside Alan
Howard, whose style is to stylise a role's pure thought, as William. There
are moments when they hardly seem to be on the same planet, but their
dissimilarity underlines the whole point of Oakes's writing. The Editing
Process - Daldry's first production of a new play - is just the kind of
drama the Royal Court is all about.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: Spectacular reticence - The praise for Gothenburg's
new opera house should be sung from the roof-tops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a city which has just acquired a splendid new opera house, Gothenburg is
being very quiet about it. The Operan, to use its Swedish name, opened last
month with three song-and-dance evenings targeted at a local public. It has
just unveiled its first stage production, Karl-Birger Blomdahl's space opera
Aniara, sung by members of the local ensemble. The programme contains no
translations for foreigners, and unlike other recent opera house
inaugurations, no attempt has been made to attract international attention.
It is as if Gothenburg could not care less what an international public
thinks of its new opera house. And, you might ask, why should it? The
theatre was designed not for jet-setting canary-fanciers, but for the
working people of Sweden's second city, who have struggled against
considerable odds to get it built.
Nonetheless, the absence of fanfare is surprising. Gothenburg, with its
westward-looking port, has always thrived on its openness to the world. It
is even more surprising when you see the new theatre's spectacular
harbourside location, its practical design and user-friendliness: its
praises deserve to be sung from the roof-tops.
The reticence can be partly explained by management instability in the
run-up to the opening. The opera house has been a hot political potato since
it was first seriously mooted in the 1960s. There have been rowdy
demonstrations, arguments about where it should be sited and who should pay,
and repeated attempts by local politicians to dictate the style and content
of the programme. These machinations resulted last year in the sacking of
the Gothenburg Opera's artistic and administrative directors.
Their replacements arrived only three months ago - to find a building far
behind schedule: even now, the stage lighting is not properly installed. The
new artistic director is Juhani Raiskinen, an experienced conductor and
manager who ran the Finnish National Opera from 1973 to 1984. As a professor
at the opera school in Gothenburg, he knew the situation and quickly won the
backing of staff.
But the reticence also reflects the fact that Gothenburg has not provided
enough money to run the theatre properly. The city laid detailed plans in
the boom years of the 1980s, and by a stroke of good timing, signed the
builders' contracts before recession began to bite. The final bill - much of
it paid by business and private subscribers - was SKr558m (Pounds 48m), half
the cost of Helsinki's opera house. With 1250 seats and a stage of 475
square metres, the new theatre has more than double the capacity of the old
Stora Teatern (Grand Theatre), a beautiful but crumbling structure. Now that
Gothenburg has the chance to compete and co-produce at international level,
it cannot pay for theatre of international quality. There are only 39
members of the chorus, 78 in the orchestra and 50 in the ballet.
Raihinen says raising standards above the provincial will take time and
money. 'People here have seen Swan Lake on the old stage and cannot
understand why we don't revive it in the new theatre. With our present corps
de ballet, the dancers would be lost. And can you imagine the end of the
first act of Tosca with a chorus of 30 on a stage this size? You can bluff
your way now and then, but not for 220 performances a year.'
Never mind: the fabric of the building is in place, and what a magnificent
site it occupies, with cranes and ocean-going ferries looming across the
water, leisure craft moored literally on the theatre's cobbled doorstep, and
everywhere a real smell of the sea. The long curved lines of a ship's hull
have been incorporated in the exterior design, which has buoyant roof
projections, spiked fly-tower corners and a swirling glass facade offering
panoramic views up and down stream. Standing apart from other buildings just
a stone's throw from the city centre, it fits the harbour environment
perfectly.
Inside, the atmosphere is warm and intimate, thanks to cherry-wood floors
and a traditional horse-shoe design with three balconies. The acoustic is
probably a little too bright (it was hard to judge from my seat on a covered
side-balcony). Jan Izikowitz, a Swedish architect of Polish origin, deserves
credit for creating a theatre which has character but is never boastful.
Aniara is hardly an opera for the common man, but the Gothenburg
performances - which run till the end of November - sold out quickly because
of interest in the new theatre. Blomdahl (1916-1968) based his first and
most successful opera on a book by the Swedish author Harry Martinson. It
takes place entirely within a spaceship, which hurtles into eternity after
abandoning a poisoned Earth. The master is a near-human computer, the Mima,
which is fed lumps of pure earth and operated by a mysterious character
called Mimaroben. With the onset of despair and moral decline, the computer
expires and the passengers gradually die.
The opera was first produced in 1959 by the Royal Opera in Stockholm. It
created quite a stir - this was two years before man went into space - and
even today, 25 years after the first moonwalk, a space opera throws up all
kinds of stimulating ideas. What has dated is Blomdahl's music. An
easy-on-the-ear mixture of jazz, vocalise, choral chanting and lyrical
flourishes, it has episodic atmosphere but lacks a coherent personality. The
use of the original electronic tapes only underlined the point.
A good production would have overcome these limitations. That the Gothenburg
performance fell short was not the fault of the cast, which included a
Mimaroben of eerie presence in Mats Persson, a capable Blind Poetess in
Carolina Sandgren and a strong cameo from Ragnar Ulfung as the comedian
Sandon. The weakness lay in Leif Segerstam's unsubtle conducting and Marie
Feldtmann's staging, which used romantic choreography (Virpi Pahkinen),
quaint and colourful costumes (Annsofi Nyberg) and a set dominated by a tree
representing the Mima (Lars Ostbergh).
What Feldtmann saw in Aniara was a metaphor for people who lose their
illusions about life and discover that their dreams and aspirations no
longer matter. But what we saw was a traditional, earthbound opera.
The Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra plays Sibelius' music for The Tempest at
the Barbican in London on Saturday November 5.

FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Walpole, 'blowing its own trumpet'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeremy Franks, group chief executive of Daks Simpson group, has been
appointed the new chairman of the Walpole Committee, replacing Giles
Shepard, who has stepped aside now he is no longer chief executive of the
Savoy group, one of the committee's members.
The committee was set up in June 1992 in order to promote British industry's
reputation for quality and style in goods and services, along the lines of
France's Comite Colbert. Among its eight founder members was the Financial
Times. Its membership includes such well-known companies as British Airways,
Land Rover and Mappin &amp; Webb. Each company pays a fee, based on turnover,
but the amounts are not disclosed.
There have been suggestions that in the two years since its inception the
committee has little concrete to show for its work, an accusation Franks
rebutted yesterday. 'We have been trying to build up our membership in what
was a difficult time. To have reached 31 main and six associate members is
commendable. The question is now how we go forward and exploit that.'
Franks, 57, added that there has been 'tremendous interfacing' between the
members and denied that the committee is one grand public relations
exercise. 'The British tend to be laid back and modest. We are trying to
blow our own trumpets, but trying to get an overall game plan is very
difficult. One day in the near future I am sure that the Walpole Committee
will be the spokesman for British excellence.'
From the point of view of his own company, Franks said that one of the
achievements of belonging to the committee has been the 'interfacing it has
brought about with other companies, such as British Airways'. First item on
his agenda is to 'get together personally with each of the members and then
from that form a control basis of companies that relate to each other'.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology: Now you see it, now you don't - The implications
of a device that substitutes broadcast images
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years of effort to develop the technology for a powerful new
broadcasting system unveiled last month may seem like nothing compared with
the commercial and ethical wrangles to come.
Matra Hachette Multimedia chose the annual international sports and
television convention in Monte Carlo to launch a system that permits the
electronic substitution of the advertising hoardings transmitted in
televised sporting events.
At the heart of the product is Epsis, a software package developed by
Lagadere Group, owner of Matra Hachette Multimedia and the ultimate parent
of Matra, the defence, electronics and media group. It was based on work
conducted for Matra Cap Systems for the aerospace industry. It processes
broadcast images and inserts computer-generated equivalents in their place.
The idea behind the new application - which cost several tens of millions of
French francs to develop - was mainly to be able to help advertisers using
hoardings in sporting events broadcast in more than one country. They might
want to use different images, brand names or the local language in the
places where the event is shown.
There are also wider applications. Advertisers might want their ads to
appear at certain times, such as at the start or end of an event. They might
not want to reach an audience in all markets receiving broadcasts. Equally,
advertising restrictions of some products, such as alcohol or tobacco, vary
between countries requiring, variations in advertising treatments.
Epsis offers a solution, by permitting substitution of any two-dimensional
image broadcast during a sporting event. A hoarding or even a car
number-plate can be altered, with the replacement fitting exactly in the
space of the original. It can also create new 'virtual' billboards where
none exists at the site of the sporting event.
The technology uses the signals from a series of cameras located at the
broadcast event. First, the software identifies and captures the image of
the billboard identified by an operator. It tracks this image electronically
as it moves across the television screen. It also isolates barriers or other
images on the background to the billboard. These three elements then allow
it to substitute the 'real' image for another.
Arnaud Lagadere, head of Matra Hachette, said that one of the challenges has
been to maintain the image even when it is obstructed by, for example,
players moving in front of the billboards. Another was tracking images that
were moving. In these cases, some of the substitution can still only be done
using pre-recorded material.
However, he says, these problems should be resolved within the next year,
with the full system commercially available by 1996. During the first live
test of the system in front of several hundred conference delegates in Monte
Carlo, Matra was able to switch images comfortably - although there was some
slight difference in resolution indicating that the replacement image was
electronically imposed.
The potential ramifications for advertisers are vast. The system could allow
far greater volumes of advertising, with much greater differentiation in
timing, positioning and geographical focus of images.
The company estimates that the European market for sports advertising alone
is worth more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn). It is also growing fast, with the
airtime devoted to sport rising from 24,000 hours in 1989 to 55,000 last
year.
The markets have become so big, and the regulatory hurdles so complex, that
it may make it more difficult than ever for all but the largest companies to
be able to afford a global advertising campaign. Segmenting the market using
Epsis, says Lagadere, makes the medium available to smaller advertisers.
But the new system could also pose ethical problems In the words of Michel
Hidalgo, a French sporting personality: 'This is a very impressive
invention. But will athletes' rights be interfered with? Will they be able
to protect themselves from being associated with products they are not
familiar with or do not approve of? We have to avoid excesses.'
A representative of the International Olympic Committee, which has no plans
to permit advertising at its events, asked about the regulatory
implications. 'When you change the image, the person watching will no longer
know what is really happening.' He urged clear labelling to show that the
picture received on television sets was not the same as that seen by
spectators at the event.
'We are trying to deal with the technology. The rest is for someone else to
cope with,' is Lagadere's response. His company suggests that those using
the system will be given a copy of an 'Epsis charter' on ethical issues, and
the company will provide events organisers with contractual clauses to help
them negotiate terms with advertisers.
Nevertheless, as Neal Pilson, former president of CBS, the US broadcasting
organisation, puts it: 'This is wonderful and exciting, but the easy part
was developing the technology. The hard part will be reconciling it into a
very complex business context.'

Answering the doorbell can pose problems for the disabled, or those who are
concerned about the risk of letting a potential burglar into the house.
A Coventry-based company has launched a mobile answering intercom device,
which allows the user to talk to the caller without opening the door. The
Answermaid works within a range of 70 metres, allowing the door to be
answered from anywhere in the house or garden.
The system also has a panic button, which allows a user faced with an
unwelcome caller to activate an alarm. The system is also able to alert the
user to intruders breaking into outbuildings such as garages.
The system, which costs Pounds 179.95, consists of a control panel, a
handset, a door-push and a perimeter alert unit.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Tunnel grease stamps out fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blame for tunnel fires often rests with the inflammable greases used to
seal newly-cut tunnel edges, claim engineers at Oxford Brookes University.
Greases are used to help seal the gap between the tunnel lining and the
tunnel-boring machine. Problems arise when the seals are repaired or
replaced because tunnel workers often pump compressed air into the workings
to keep out water. The oxygen-rich atmosphere adds to the danger that the
grease may ignite when the seals are burned away with oxyacetylene torches.
The researchers have developed a non-flammable tunnel grease, consisting of
water and minerals suspended in wax, which they claim is safer, easier to
use and more economical than existing greases.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A long-established drug used in the treatment of diseases such as leukaemia
has emerged as a strong candidate for Aids therapy, according to a study
published today in Science, the US journal.
Researchers at the Laboratory of Tumour Cell Biology at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, conducted a laboratory
experiment which showed that hydroxyurea blocked the replication of the HIV
virus in blood taken from people with Aids.
The antiviral effect was achieved using doses of hydroxyurea that were
non-toxic and lower than those currently used for leukaemia treatment.
Hydroxyurea is unlike existing Aids drugs such as AZT, which directly target
viral proteins in that it does not attack the virus directly but works by
inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. The researchers
believe that the HIV virus is far less likely to develop resistance to
hydroxyurea than conventional antiviral drugs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong evidence linking childhood leukaemia with infection is published in
the British Medical Journal today, Clive Cookson writes.
Scientists at the Cancer Research Campaign's epidemiology unit in Oxford
found that the exodus of more than 1m children from London and other big
cities during the second world war resulted in a significant increase in
leukaemia in rural Britain.
Deaths from the disease in the four years after the war were 47 per cent
higher in rural areas that received the largest numbers of urban evacuees.
CRC researchers believe that 'population mixing' during the war exposed
rural children to city children carrying the unknown infection - probably a
virus.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology: Change in the formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese mothers who feed their babies with Snow Brand infant formula are
giving them more than the mixture of calories and minerals usually contained
in baby formulas. Essential fatty acids have been added to make it more like
mothers' milk.
The idea could spread to western countries. Several companies, including
Sandoz Nutrition of Switzerland, Nutricia of the Netherlands, which owns the
Cow and Gate brand, and American Home Products, have signed up with the
biotechnology companies that make the fatty acids.
There has long been evidence that mothers' milk is better for babies than
artificial alternatives. The difference is most marked in premature babies,
whose brains develop better on mothers' milk, according to researchers and
the UK Medical research Council's Nutrition Unit in Cambridge.
There may be several explanations, but one of the more likely is that
essential fatty acids present in mothers' milk are absent from formulas.
Scientists say that fatty acids are probably important in brain and eye
development. These fatty acids are difficult to make in industrial
quantities. One source is UK biotechnology company Scotia, which is
supplying Snow Brand. Another is Martek of the US, which has signed letters
of intent to supply Sandoz and Nutricia.
As foods rather than drugs, the new products do not have to undergo clinical
trials. The fatty acids appear to be harmless, but without trials it is hard
to demonstrate that the doses are right. Further, these formulas do not have
the antibodies found in mothers' milk that protect against infection.
Martek and Scotia do not make serious medical claims for the new infant
formulas. 'We're saying that they are more like mothers' milk,' says Martek.
'But no one will make therapeutic claims right now.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Peripatetic Perkins picks publisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The explosion of interest in new media is encouraging some interesting
excursions across traditional boundaries. Fred Perkins, former head of the
Financial Times electronic information services, has been appointed group
vice-president for the McGraw-Hill Book Company, based in Maidenhead, near
London.
His responsibilities will cover Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Perkins' experience of on-line information goes back more than two decades
but this is his first experience of management in the world of traditional
book publishing: 'I believe McGraw-Hill wanted somebody who is aware of the
publishing world but who comes from outside it,' Perkins says, adding that
the company is a combination of state of the art innovator and established
business.
McGraw Hill, founded in 1888 with sales last year of around Dollars 2bn, is
already experimenting with new media forms - it publishes its entire book
catalogue on CD-ROM.
Another trial involves allowing college teachers to pick and mix sections
from McGraw-Hill textbooks to create material tailored to each course, the
idea being to render illegal photocopying unnecessary.
Perkins, 46, studied electrical and electronic engineering at the
universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow and carried on to an MSc at Sussex
and research in medical electronics at Dundee.
He worked for Citibank, ICL and IP Sharp (now part of Reuters) before the
FT, where he led the successful campaign to convince the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission that FT Profile's licensing practices were not against
the public interest.
Although his old company and his new are aiming at the same markets, he does
not rule out the possibility of collaboration as the multimedia revolution
redraws the boundaries of competition.

FT  04 NOV 94 / People: Half a pair for Hi-Tec's Mackness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank van Wezel, founder of Hi-Tec Sports, is splitting his job as chairman
and chief executive and handing over the chief executive's baton to Terry
Mackness, 50, head of the group's important US operations.
Hi-Tec Sports, which specialises in making sporting shoes and leisure wear,
has had a chequered stockmarket history. Its performance has been hit by
fierce competition from bigger sports shoe manufacturers. Last month the
shares fell sharply after the group reported a first half pre-tax loss of
Pounds 7.1m which was inflated by exceptional charges for restructuring the
business.
In addition to worries about the group's performance, the City has also been
concerned that van Wezel, whose family controls over half the equity,
exercises too much control. In March 1993 two well-known non-executive
directors resigned from the Hi-Tec board only a few weeks after they had
been appointed, thus leading to speculation that they had not been able to
get along with van Wezel's management style.
Mackness will divide his time equally between the UK and the US, the group's
two main operating areas. Formerly with Cadbury Schweppes and Imperial
Tobacco, Mackness joined Hi-Tec as marketing director in 1981. In 1986 he
took charge of the group's UK operations before moving to California as
president of Hi-Tec USA in 1989. Since then Hi-Tec's North American turnover
has grown from Dollars 9m to Dollars 48m last year. Hi-Tec's shares, which
traded over Pounds 2 in 1992, were unchanged at 41p yesterday.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Management: Streets ahead - Europe's manufacturing quality
and productivity still lag far behind Japan's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Dan Jones and his colleagues at Cardiff Business School, Cambridge
University and Andersen Consulting were at it again yesterday. Two years
after telling an audience of UK motor component makers that their
productivity and quality was grossly inferior to that of Japanese
counterparts, they announced that many continental European groups are no
better - and some are worse.
Jones, also co-author of The Machine That Changed the World, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology study which highlighted the
significance of 'lean' manufacturing, was unveiling the results of a new
Worldwide Manufacturing Competitiveness Study*.
The results expand on the 1992 benchmarking project which showed Japanese
component makers outperforming the UK's by a 2:1 margin in productivity and
by no less than 100:1 in quality. The latest project investigates the
manufacturing performance and management practices of 71 motor components
plants in nine countries: 14 in the US and Canada, 12 in the UK, 11 in
France, nine in both Japan and Germany, eight in Italy and four in both
Spain and Mexico.
Among these, the study identifies 'world-class' plants which meet certain
criteria: substantially higher volumes of finished parts compared with
similar-sized non-world-class concerns; high-capacity utilisation; more
automated assembly processes, backed up with effective 'fool-proofing';
larger and more rapidly changing product portfolios; and integrated and
tightly controlled processes.
The study once again makes uneasy, and for many UK and Italian components
makers chilling, reading. It indicates that despite progress in Europe,
Japanese suppliers are improving at no less rapid a rate - and even widening
the competitiveness gap with the UK and Italy.
While the study identified no companies by name, it is unlikely to pass
unchallenged by many components suppliers. Nissan, Toyota and Honda publicly
maintain that suppliers to their UK 'transplants' are doing well, but
privately express reservations about their progress.
To make the findings relevant beyond the motor industry, the study covered
production of seats, exhausts and brakes - chosen because they require a
variety of process technologies.
The researchers consistently found a 2:1 difference in productivity
performance between world-class plants and the remainder. The quality gap
was found to be even higher - 9:1 in seats, 16:1 in brakes and 170:1 in
exhausts.
Performance was measured by two main criteria: productivity, in terms of
annual units of output divided by labour hours, and quality by the number of
supplied parts per million claimed by vehicle manufacturers to have been
defective. Financial measures were not used.
In one world-class seat plant there were 237 customer complaints per million
seats delivered, compared with 2,071 for a non-world-class facility; the
world-class exhaust plant received eight complaints per million exhausts and
the world-class brake plant nine per million on brakes.
The US was found to be closest to Japan in quality, with Japanese plants
retaining 'only' a 30 per cent advantage. This stretched out to a 4:1
advantage over France and Germany, rising to at least 8:1 in the case of the
UK and Italy.
Japan's overall productivity and quality performance, meanwhile, 'is
significantly better than it was two years ago, with improvements in the
range of 38 per cent. UK companies also show a big improvement (31 per
cent). This, however, has not been enough to qualify as world class and
shows that the gap with Japan is widening'.
Of the 71 surveyed companies, many were subsidiaries of big producers
already supplying globally. While these have had a unique opportunity to
combine knowledge and learning from different countries, they have also had
to find compromises between their own corporate cultures and conditions and
practices outside their domestic base. The report says that failure to
reconcile the two accounts for Japanese plants generally not doing as well
outside Japan as within. Only one of the world-class Japanese plants was
outside Japan.
One surprising feature of the study is that world-class companies are to be
found in Japan, the US, France and Spain - but not in Germany, the presumed
motor industry powerhouse of Europe. This 'suggests that one should be wary
of confusing the quality and prestige of the finished product with the
efficiency and sophistication of the process which produced it'.
Product simplification and co-ordination of the supply chain must receive
priority from German industry if it is to become more competitive, the study
concludes.
It also found US plants to be good on process control and delivered quality,
at least among first-tier suppliers. 'The challenge now lies in extending
this to the second tier' - the thousands of much smaller parts makers who
supply the big components companies.
What should non-world-class companies do about improving their positions?
The researchers found that the common denominators in the world-class plants
were process control and very tight management of the entire supply chain.
Many aspects of plant performance which have received considerable
publicity, such as the use of teams and suggestion schemes, did not appear
to be universal requirements for good performance.
Indeed, the study warns that simply aping the quality circles and
problem-solving groups which form part of world-class Japanese companies
cannot work.
'The real benefits of problem-solving structures appear to lie in the
long-term continuous improvement of a basically sound system . . . imitating
practices from other countries of indiscriminately devolving responsibility
to the shop floor and hoping that problems will disappear is clearly not
going to work.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Management: A mesh of the formal and the flexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boundaryless, virtual, horizontal, flat, shamrock- or starburst-shaped,
clustered, concentric, circular. Managers are constantly bombarded with
these images of the sort of organisation their companies must become if they
are to survive the change, complexity and chaos of the late 1990s and
beyond.
As if one set of such epithets was not enough, executives are assured by
gurus and academics that these structures will create the type of
customer-facing, rapid-response, high-performance, self-managed, team-based
enterprises needed to compete in the markets of the future. In an overworked
but powerful phrase, they are told that this is the 'new management
paradigm'.
Most managers are intrigued by at least some of these images. But they are
also confused or frustrated. Before taking action, some are searching for a
clearer, more detailed, picture of what the 'new organisation' should look
like, with its constituent sub-structures, systems and procedures.
Others are already having a crack at the new approach - or elements of it.
But they risk floundering because of the paucity of proven models to draw
from.
With the exception of several overworked examples from 'creative' industries
such as media and consulting, there are few concrete cases of the approach
operating comprehensively and successfully at the level of entire
organisations of any size. Most well-documented instances are either of
medium-sized companies with unusual backgrounds, such as Gore-Tex, or of
isolated business units within giants such as US General Electric.
A third group of managers, the sceptics, are steering clear of almost
anything that smacks of such radical, risky - and over-American -
innovation.
All three groups are in danger of losing their way. Like fans - radical or
conservative - of architecture, who see it as having a capital 'A', they
make the mistake of being transfixed by structure and outward appearance at
the expense of an organisation's intricate inner workings. They treat an
organisation as an all-important big 'O', rather than as a means of enabling
companies to act more effectively in the marketplace.
To make matters worse, the Big O brigade mistakenly sees the 'new
organisation' as mainly a matter of formal design, rather than as what Nitin
Nohria and James Berkley, two Harvard academics, call pragmatic or
'action-centred' entities, whose life-blood consists of informal attitudes,
relationships and ways of operating.
In the latest issue of California Management Review, Nohria and Berkley
argue that while the informal side of organisations has often been
acknowledged in the past, the energy of most managers and management
thinkers alike has been directed towards trying to develop better formal
models and designs.
To underline their view that the current spate of organisational change and
experimentation is not a prelude to some ultimate, fixed architecture, the
two academics reject the term 'new paradigm' as misleading, even dangerous.
They argue that the most helpful metaphor is of a shifting 'action
perspective'.
This sees organisations as complex systems - better still, as organisms -
where many different things are happening at once, and which are constantly
in flux, often in response to low-level action.
To illustrate the dangers of top-management attempts to impose new
organisational designs, Nohria and Berkley cite the 'sobering' example of a
group of three divisions within Allen-Bradley, itself an offshoot of
Rockwell International. In 1990 the group, which makes high-tech industrial
control devices, announced a flat, team-based, 'concentric' structure.
Within months the old hierarchy reasserted itself: 'business teams' were
formed to oversee the operational teams, and an executive council to oversee
the business teams. Within a year, the use of teams was reined in severely.
In 1992 much of the concentric organisation was disbanded, and a traditional
multi-divisional structure re-installed.
The upside of the story, the academics claim, is that the fundamental ideas
behind the 1990 reorganisation are still held to be central, in spite of the
reversion to a conventional formal design.
This is feasible because the group persevered with the introduction of two
steps essential to effective informality: IT systems that spanned its whole
organisation; and broader sets of performance measures.
In essence, Nohria and Berkley's message is eminently sensible: few European
companies would be as rash as Allen-Bradley or some of its American cousins
in converting so suddenly to such a novel structure. Any halfway sensible
organisational innovator knows that informal changes have to accompany
formal ones, and often precede them.
That is not to say that formal changes are unnecessary. Nohria and Berkley
say as much, but with far too little emphasis. As so often with management
academics, they almost throw the baby out with the bathwater.
If any senior manager thinks internal boundaries can be bridged without
dramatic change in organisational design, he or she should examine the
experience of the myriad of companies that have tried to introduce
cross-functional teamwork just by laying a lightweight project structure
across a collection of chimney-like vertical departments, and instigating a
series of accompanying informal changes. Ford, Digital and a string of other
companies are now having to rectify that mistake.
The truth is that the formal and informal aspects of an organisation are
equally important, and interdependent. Whether old-style or new, formal or
embodying an 'action perspective', they need to be in synch.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Hope for mail managers facing nightmare scenario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Post Office's senior management, yesterday's decision was the
nightmare scenario. Rarely in the past has the chief executive of a
nationalised industry campaigned as publicly for change as has Mr Bill
Cockburn, the Post Office's outspoken chief executive.
Mr Cockburn's argument was simple: without greater commercial freedom the
Post Office would not be able to develop its business to meet new national
and international competition.
Since Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, claimed that full
freedom could only come with some form of privatisation, it might appear
that the Post Office is now sentenced to gradual decline.
That, however, would be to take rhetoric at face value and to ignore stark
facts. In reality:
The Post Office remains highly profitable. Last year it made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 306m, and has been in profit for more than a decade. It is
commonly seen as one of Europe's most efficient postal services.
Only one other European postal service - the Dutch - has been privatised,
and unlike telecommunications there is no sign that privatisation is about
to sweep across the industry in the European Union. The Post Office need
not, therefore, be at a severe competitive disadvantage remaining in the
public sector.
The way is still open for the government to give the Post Office much of the
freedom it craves - without privatisation.
The new challenge for Mr Cockburn is to persuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that existing Treasury constraints can be dispensed with. He
could begin by quoting the government's green paper, which reveals that the
Treasury has contemplated removing some controls on the Post Office even if
it remains in the public sector.
The paper lists specific controls which could be lifted. These include the
existing limit on overall capital expenditure, and allowing some
joint-venture projects with private companies - two areas of acute concern
to Mr Cockburn.
Furthermore, the Post Office is under no serious threat of competition in
its core domestic business of letter collection and delivery - it has a
monopoly over the delivery of all mail stamped at less than Pounds 1.
The government was contemplating reducing the Pounds 1 limit - but that,
ironically, is likely to be another casualty of yesterday's retreat.
Mr Cockburn might do well to familiarise Mr Clarke with the postal services
of Sweden and New Zealand. Both are state-owned, but run on a similar basis
to private companies. And both are highly successful.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Down, but not out for the count: David Owen and Kevin Brown
assess Michael Heseltine's ability to recover from defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is he all washed up?
After two years of well-publicised setbacks the government's vacillation and
ultimate retreat over the privatisation of the Post Office appears to have
dealt another blow to Mr Michael Heseltine's political prospects.
Coming in the wake of the coal fiasco, the doubts about his health and being
upstaged at last month's Tory conference by Mr Michael Portillo, the right's
young pretender, the latest climbdown has fuelled speculation that the trade
and industry secretary's glittering career may be entering its final phase.
The fact that Mr Heseltine left nobody in any doubt that he favoured the
sale of a majority of the corporation's shares has made the outcome of
yesterday's marathon cabinet meeting look like a peculiarly personal setback
for him.
He has lost out to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who was every bit as
vigorous as Mr Heseltine in promoting privatisation but refused to
countenance the fall-back option of giving the Post Office greater
commercial freedom in the public sector.
Mr Clarke argued successfully that real commercial freedom would require a
relaxation of Treasury controls over Post Office borrowing, which would
fatally damage its ability to determine the size of the public sector
borrowing requirement.
One of the Tory rebels, whose opposition finally killed the sell-off, said
after a 45-minute meeting with Mr Heseltine on Wednesday: 'He was not his
normal ebullient self.' Another, more sympathetic, back-bencher said: 'He'd
probably like to hang some of these rebels up by their fingernails.' Others
sought to portray his last-ditch attempt to rescue the sale, with a
complicated plan for partial privatisation, as a tactical error which
backfired.
According to one back-bencher the compromise plan - to sell 40 per cent of
the Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, retain 40 per cent in
the public sector, and transfer another 20 per cent to an independent trust
 -convinced some MPs that Mr Heseltine was trying to privatise the
organisation by the back door.
Some of the rebels saw it as a signal of Mr Heseltine's weak position as a
proponent of privatisation in a cabinet that was not prepared to stand firm.
But beneath his suave exterior the trade and industry secretary is as tough
a political street-fighter as any of his cabinet colleagues. And as a
veteran of Baroness Thatcher's cabinet he has more experience than the vast
majority of today's ministers.
The past two years have brought victories as well as defeats - notably his
bravura performance in March at Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
He is also widely credited with instilling a more pro-active and
business-like culture in his department.
His heart attack in Venice in June 1993 does not appear to have diminished
his ambition for the highest office. Nor, it seems, has the second and fatal
heart attack suffered by John Smith, the former Labour leader.
It was at first widely assumed that one consequence of Mr Smith's death was
that Mr Heseltine would no longer be seen as a credible candidate to succeed
Mr John Major.
It is an assumption that Mr Heseltine has never accepted, and which he has
successfully pushed from the minds of many of his potential supporters on
the Tory backbenches.
If any minister has the sheer political savvy to turn the events of recent
weeks to his advantage it is the trade and industry secretary.
From his lengthy spell in the wilderness in the late 1980s to his defeat at
the hands of Mr John Major in the 1990 Tory leadership contest, Mr Heseltine
has been written off so many times that it would be rash to underestimate
his capacity to bounce back.
The sheer energy with which he tried to win over the Post Office rebels  -
even after it was clear that they were in no mood to fold their tents -
demonstrates that his taste for battle is as strong as ever.
Perhaps fortuitously, he will have an early opportunity to return to the
limelight in the next parliamentary session, which will centre on his bill
to deregulate the domestic gas market.
It is an opportunity he is unlikely to pass up.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Nolan may probe private funds for political parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nolan committee on standards of conduct in public life may investigate
the funding of political parties by private organisations - in spite of the
prime minister's insistence that this should be outside its remit.
Lord Nolan, a leading law lord, yesterday clearly indicated that the
committee, which had its first meeting yesterday, would conduct the widest
possible examination of rules for public servants. He said political
donations would come within his committee's remit. The committee could also
make recommendations on whether MPs should have paid interests outside their
parliamentary work.
He confirmed that the committee would not investigate any of the specific
allegations of 'sleaze' that have been made against members of Mr John
Major's government. But it appeared likely that former cabinet ministers who
accepted paid directorships at companies with which they had been officially
involved would be cross-examined in televised sessions.
Asked whether the funding of political parties would fall within the
committee's remit, Lord Nolan said: 'I would be very surprised if it did
not, in this sense: that if party political funding was associated with some
preference to the person providing the funds, some official preference, some
government preference, then it would plainly come within our terms of
reference.'
This was in contrast to a statement by the prime minister in the Commons
last week that the committee's investigation would have 'nothing to do with
the financing of political parties, which has been dealt with by the Home
Affairs Select Committee'.
On the subject of whether MPs can hold outside interests Lord Nolan said the
committee could not dictate to the Commons what rules it should have. But
the committee would examine submissions from political groups on whether MPs
should be allowed to have any paid outside interests.
The committee has been asked to submit a first report within six months. In
the early stages its work will be divided into four groups. These will
examine the question of gifts in cash or kind to ministers, payments to MPs
for parliamentary services, appointments to quangos, and paid appointments
of recently retired ministers.

FT  04 NOV 94 / 'Family-friendly' companies spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of British companies are adopting family-friendly,
flexible working policies although not many employees are taking advantage
of them, Lady Howe, chairwoman of the business-led initiative Opportunity
2000, said yesterday.
Lady Howe said on the campaign's third anniversary: 'The provision of
progressive policies such as maternity and paternity leave, job sharing and
part-time work have grown significantly over the past year.'
But Lady Howe said that the take-up of many of these policies was still very
low and the increasing prevalence of a 'working all hours' culture made it
difficult for people to curtail their work habits to take care of their
families.
A report on a survey of 187 Opportunity 2000 members found that job-share
arrangements were used by less than 10 per cent of eligible women in 88 per
cent of businesses. In nearly a quarter of the organisations responding,
maternity provision beyond the statutory requirement was taken up by less
than 10 per cent of eligible women.
However, Opportunity 2000's 275 members, which come from most sectors of the
market and employ more than 25 per cent of the UK workforce, are improving
management prospects for women.
An average of 25 per cent of managerial positions in these companies are
held by women. This compares with estimates from the Institute of
Management, which put the figure as low as 9.5 per cent for top companies as
a whole.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Investors see little growth in forests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first analysis of returns from direct investment in forests has
confirmed the old adage that money does not grow on trees.
In the past 16 years forests have delivered a return of only 4 per cent a
year, compared with 11.4 per cent from commercial property.
The study, commissioned by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain,
was by Investment Property Databank, which specialises in measuring the
performance of commercial property.
Once tax incentives are included the annualised return from forestry rises
to 7.1 per cent. Adjusting for inflation, however, the annualised pre-tax
return since 1977 is minus 2.8 per cent, compared with a real return of 4
per cent from commercial property and 11.4 per cent from equities.
IPD looked at the annual valuations of 126 privately owned forests in the
UK. It found forests in northern England and central Scotland tended to
perform best. Mature forests tended to outperform newly planted areas. As
plantations mature trees become the dominant element in the valuation.
The performance of older forests depends on timber prices, although there
appears to be a two-year lag between a change in timber prices and movement
in forestry values. This delayed response may reflect a market dominated by
private investors acting on scanty information.
On the positive side, the study found that forestry showed lower volatility
than any other institutional asset class, and its performance was largely
independent of bonds or equities. This suggests that forestry could be used
by investment institutions to reduce portfolio risk.

FT  04 NOV 94 / CBI appeals for reinforcements on the green front: A
catalogue of complaints from business leaders about the cost analysis of
environmental regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses are starting to chafe under the weight of environmental
regulation.
They feel the government is creating laws without sufficiently balancing the
costs and benefits. They also wish the government would make up its mind
about environmental issues. These concerns will be reflected in a document
which the Confederation of British Industry will publish at its annual
conference next week.
Many of the points in the report challenge the line taken by government on
environmental issues and are likely to provoke a response from Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who will be addressing the
conference.
The CBI says there is little evidence for the government's claim that
environmental legislation makes business more competitive by creating
pressure for greater efficiency. The CBI says this 'has not been justified
by a full analysis of the costs and benefits of legislation across affected
sectors'.
Nor, in the CBI's view, are new environmental initiatives providing 'massive
new opportunities for products and services' along the lines much-touted by
ministers. Where these initiatives go with the grain of the market, they do
help strengthen innovative businesses. But where they do not, they add
unnecessarily to the cost burden.
'At present, too many businesses are falling foul of the pitfalls rather
than seizing the opportunities,' the CBI says.
A further problem is the effect of regulation on international
competitiveness. A quarter of respondents to a CBI poll said they were
experiencing difficulties gaining access to foreign markets, mainly because
of eco-labelling schemes in other countries. Thirty per cent said that they
suffered specific British disadvantages because of standards imposed
domestically, and the stricter enforcement of EU legislation in the UK.
Although the CBI accepts that some businesses may not be responding to
opportunities, it lays much of the blame at the government's door. Among the
criticisms it makes are:
The government does not pay enough attention to the effect that
environmental regulation has on competitiveness. It cites the fact that the
white paper on competitiveness issued earlier this year has only one page on
the environment but 20 pages on education and training.
Government needs to provide a more supportive policy framework where the
benefits outweigh the costs of action by business. Environmental regulators
are not sufficiently sensitive to the costs they impose. The CBI thinks
regulators could take a leaf out of the book of the Health and Safety
Executive, which has a longer record of dealing with business.
The government should create more regulatory certainty by establishing
policy on key issues, particularly who pays for contaminated land.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said that industry was keen to get
into a 'win-win' situation where well-planned regulation brought benefits to
both business and the environment. 'This is not a report which says 'We
can't afford all this environmental regulation.' But it does reflect
frustration over a lot of wasted effort.'
He thought that there were promising signs in the government's proposal for
a new environmental agency which would draw together the functions of
pollution and water regulators. He welcomed the clause in the draft bill for
the agency which would instruct it to balance the costs and benefits of
regulation.
The CBI document is not entirely about what the government should do,
however. It also lays out an agenda for business. Among its recommendations
are that business should give greater stress to environmental issues in its
board and company policy, and that it should identify the opportunities
created by the environment ahead of regulatory developments.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Hualon plan faces Europe challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board has declined to confirm that
the controversial plan by Hualon of Taiwan to build a Pounds 157m Belfast
textiles plant will go ahead if the European Commission's approval of Pounds
61m of aid for the project is challenged in court.
The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which says the plant will
create unfair competition, said yesterday that it planned to appeal to the
European Court.
Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington and a member of the Commons public
accounts committee, is to urge the committee to ask the Northern Ireland
Audit Office to investigate the project.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Part-time workers win cash deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six airline stewardesses employed by British Midland Airlines who claimed to
have been made redundant because they worked part-time have won a
substantial settlement from the company, Robert Taylor writes.
This promises to be a landmark in the legal treatment of part-time workers
following the Lords judgment in March that they should enjoy the same access
to protection from unfair dismissal and redundancy as full-time employees.
The actual terms of the agreement have not been revealed because they are
subject to a High Court injunction issued against the Equal Opportunities
Commission, which represented the women.
The commission said it welcomed the financial settlement and looked forward
to working with British Midland on the implementation of a revised
equal-opportunities policy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief executive, yesterday accused a number
of ITV companies of trying to persuade the government to privatise the
channel.
He told a media conference in Brighton that a number of companies had
suggested to the Treasury that the privatisation of Channel 4 could raise
Pounds 1bn for the government while also providing additional money to
reduce the levy that all the ITV companies must pay to the Treasury.
He said if the government tried to privatise Channel 4 'I will resign'. He
insisted the government had made it clear that it had no intention of
privatising the channel.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Post Office unrepentant over sell-off campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office faces 'crippling uncertainty' after the cabinet's decision
to abandon its privatisation, Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, warned
last night.
He added it was 'in danger of going into decline' without the fast
introduction of the changes the Post Office needed to compete commercially.
Mr Heron - with the backing of the Post Office board - also said that the
nationwide network of post offices and delivery of letters to every address
at a uniform and affordable price would now be 'undoubtedly threatened'.
The board reaffirmed yesterday that it would be pressing 'for the commercial
freedom needed to secure the future of the business'.
The Post Office management is unrepentant about its aggressive public
campaign to secure privatisation. 'We cannot wish our problems away,' said
one senior manager. 'We will now be pressing the government to go as far as
possible to the furthest perimeters of what is permissible to get in private
investment through joint ventures and partnerships.'
Mr Heron said: 'The Post Office needs to escape from a government system of
cash-driven management to gain access to external finance and to develop its
business through whatever commercial means are most appropriate.'
He added that it was crucial that the Post Office must be free to meet 'the
growing competition in the UK and ensure technological change in the
communications world would be an opportunity and not a problem'.
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, said
the cabinet's climbdown was a vindication of the union's 26-month campaign
of opposition.
He said: 'This is a real victory for the British people. It is heartening
that the overwhelming views of the public have been heard. What we must now
do is work hard to deliver real commercial freedom in an integrated Post
Office while (it is) in the public sector.'
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the union's campaign had been
'modern trade-unionism at its best', showing 'the effectiveness of modern
campaigning methods for trade-union causes'.
The National Consumer Council said the decision was 'a victory for
commonsense'. It added: 'We were concerned none of the options considered by
the government would safeguard rural post offices.'
Mr Keith Bill, secretary of the Protecting Postal Services group - a
coalition of 3,090 charities and voluntary organisations - said that 'the
threat of privatisation was a monster that should never have been let
loose'. He added: 'We knew that offices in rural areas would have closed and
services we take for granted would have been eroded despite the assurances
of Mr Heseltine and Post Office management.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Public support unitary councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bournemouth, Brighton and Plymouth all seem certain to become unitary
councils following yesterday's publication of public-opinion research by the
Local Government Commission.
The commission is, however, set to abandon more radical plans for
restructuring Devon, Essex and East and West Sussex because the polls do not
show any great public support for the move.
The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, is expected to make final
recommendations to the government on these counties by the end of the month.
The government has signalled that it will honour the results of the polls.
In Devon the commission's preference is to make Plymouth a unitary authority
 -combining the powers of county and district councils. However, 52 per cent
of respondents favoured retaining the two-tier system for the rest of the
county.
There was 33 per cent support for the commission's second preference of
creating six unitary bodies.
Most support for this option came from Torbay (57 per cent) and Exeter (52
per cent) where the district councils have campaigned strenuously for
unitary status.
In Dorset a unitary solution seems likely, with 34 per cent favouring three
unitaries - the commission's preference - and 33 per cent preferring four.
In Essex the commission's preference for unitaries in Southend and Thurrock
while leaving the rest of the county untouched, was most popular, being
backed by 53 per cent of respondents.
But it is most likely that there will be no change at all since support for
the status quo was strongest in the two districts recommended for change -
35 per cent in Southend and 67 per cent in Thurrock.
Support for maintaining the status quo in East Sussex outside Brighton and
Hove was 34 per cent, with 23 per cent backing no change at all.
There was also 15 per cent support for creating four unitaries.
In West Sussex the status quo had strong support, with 49 per cent wanting
no change and 30 per cent backing the commission's proposal to create a
unitary combining Hove with Adur and Worthing. This option had minimal
support in these areas, however.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Nuclear Electric gets go-ahead for Sizewell B
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, has cleared the last
significant regulatory hurdle in the run-up to commissioning Sizewell B,
Britain's first pressurised water reactor power station.
The Pollution Inspectorate has granted an authorisation for the Suffolk
plant, built within its Pounds 2.03bn budget, to routinely discharge
radioactivity into the environment.
The decision follows a second round of public consultation made necessary
earlier this year by a High Court case involving the Sellafield reprocessing
works of British Nuclear Fuels.
It means that Nuclear Electric can proceed with its plans for the Sizewell
reactor to start up in the middle of next month.
Final commissioning procedures will have to meet standards set by the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the UK safety watchdog.
Sizewell B is expected to achieve full power by the end of February - in
line with a commitment given to the government at the public inquiry in 1983
which considered plans to build the plant.
As a result of the Sellafield case the Pollution Inspectorate was required
to be satisfied that there would be a net public benefit from the operation
of Sizewell B, taking into consideration routine discharges of
radioactivity. It received hundreds of representations from groups and
individuals calling for the authorisation to be refused.
The inspectorate has concluded that there is a balance of advantage in
favour of Sizewell B.
It has also concluded that the discharge limits set will protect human
health, the safety of the food chain and the environment generally.
Nuclear Electric last night welcomed the decision which, it said, vindicated
the company's case that nuclear power had a role to play in UK energy
policy.
Ms Bridget Woodman, national nuclear campaigner for the Greenpeace
environment group, said there was no justification for the decision because
the radioactive waste which would be produced by Sizewell B was not needed.
She said the risks of an accident were not acceptable.
Nuclear Electric said: 'We are delighted that this authorisation means we
can achieve the target we have always set ourselves.'
Nuclear Electric wants to build another plant at the site. The twin-reactor
Sizewell C would have a capacity of 2,500MW and would cost about Pounds
3.5bn to build.

GEC's bid to take over the submarine maker VSEL should be judged by UK

A similar decision has already been made in the case of BAe's bid for VSEL.
Both are being assessed in the UK because in some situations the government
can exclude big deals from EU jurisdiction if special national interests are
involved. The bids will now be examined by the Office of Fair Trading, which
normally expects to produce its recommendation within three weeks.

Sales agents and independent financial advisers saved the government almost
Pounds 29bn in 1992 through selling pensions, insurance and mortgages to

<TEXT>
Colonial, a Kent-based life insurance company, yesterday became the latest
organisation in the sector to announce a shift to a system of paying
salaries and bonuses rather than commission-only to its employed direct
sales force, Alison Smith writes.
From next year the 570 employed sales agents will move to salaries of up to
Pounds 18,000 - with bonuses typically taking total pay to about Pounds
25,000. The 80 self-employed sales agents for Colonial will continue to be
paid on a commission-only basis.
Mr Sandy Grant, deputy general manager, said he was sure that in dealing
with customers the two types of sales agent would both make sure investors
were clear about their remuneration structures.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Tube may drop tunnel method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground may decide to stop using the 'new Austrian' tunnelling
method for its Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension even before the Health
and Safety Executive has completed its inquiry into the construction
technique.
London Underground said last night it was considering a number of options.
An important consideration must be the length of time the safety executive
may need to complete its investigations.
The inquiry was launched after a tunnel under construction using the 'new
Austrian' method collapsed under Heathrow airport two weeks ago.
Jubilee Line contractors have halted work on two of 12 stations planned for
the extension. These are at Waterloo and London Bridge stations, the ones
planning to use the method.
Work on two new stations planned for Heathrow, part of a Pounds 300m rail
link between Heathrow and Paddington station in central London, has also
been halted.
A long delay in restarting work could cause serious financial problems if
the two projects were unable to open on time and start earning expected
revenue.
London Underground, therefore, might decide to change to traditional
tunnelling methods to get work moving again. The safety executive said it
would complete its investigations as quickly as possible but has not said
how long this might take.
A decision to abandon the 'new Austrian' method would increase the cost of
both projects, but by tens of millions of pounds rather than by hundreds.
The cost would be considerably higher if they were unable to start on time.
The two stations planned for Heathrow are part of a Pounds 60m contract
awarded to Balfour Beatty which includes about four miles of rail tunnel to
be excavated using conventional methods.
Both BAA, the airport operator, and London Underground have stressed that
work has halted on only a small part of their projects. This, however, still
leaves the issue of who pays for the cost of the Heathrow tunnel collapse if
the project's insurers do not pick up the bill.
Insurance premiums for contracts using the 'new Austrian' method may rise,
even if the technique is eventually given a clean bill of health.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Modest rise in new mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New net mortgage lending in September was only slightly higher than a year
ago, according to figures published yesterday which further underline the
slowness and fragility of the UK mortgage market recovery.
Bank of England statistics show new net lending totalled Pounds 2.11bn in
September compared with Pounds 2.05bn in the corresponding month last year.
A similar picture emerges from the statistics for loans approved, an
important forward-looking indicator since they translate into lending
undertaken in the following weeks. In September 83,000 loans were approved,
compared with 82,000 in the same month last year. New gross lending was,
however, higher this September than last, standing at Pounds 5.2bn, compared
with Pounds 4.59bn.
The figures also underline how market shares have changed in the total
amounts lent. In September building societies carried out more than 60 per
cent of the new net lending.
Last September, when fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks were particularly
popular, banks and societies both undertook about the same amounts of
lending.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, societies and
centralised lenders, said levels of mortgage activity were 'only modest' and
reiterated its warnings against 'nasty shocks' for the housing market in the
Budget.

FT  04 NOV 94 / 'Wise men' boost for chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, can take comfort. His panel of
independent economic forecasters expects growth to continue at a healthy
rate next year with a continuing expansion of gross domestic product and
subdued inflation in the medium term.
But as might be expected from six men with very different economic
philosophies, there are variations in some of the short-term as well as the
medium-term forecasts.
All six expect the economy to grow next year at or above the level that
economists regard as its long-term trend rate. The average expectation is
for GDP growth next year of 3 per cent after 3.6 per cent this year, with
forecasts for next year ranging from 2.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent.
But they differ on how next year will turn out compared with this year.
Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,
Professor David Currie of the London Business School and Professor Tim
Congdon of Lombard Street Research expect growth in the non-oil economy will
slow to 2.6 per cent or less from about 3 per cent.
Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University expects non-oil growth to be
little changed at 3.1 per cent while Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs and
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University see growth accelerating to
about 3.75 per cent.
This splits the group into optimists and pessimists. The group's forecasts
for consumption and investment generally divide in the same way as GDP,
although all agree that in the next year the balance of growth will shift
from consumption towards investment.
On inflation, there is a 'rough tendency' for growth pessimists to be
inflation pessimists and growth optimists to be optimistic about inflation.
The average expectation is for underlying inflation, excluding mortgage
interest payments, to rise to 2.9 per cent by the end of next year from 2.2
per cent in the current quarter. Forecasts for end-1995 range from the
monetarist Prof Minford's 1.9 per cent to the neo-Keynesian Prof Godley's
3.9 per cent.
There are some striking short-term variations in current account forecasts
and significant differences in expectations for unemployment. The average
expectation of next year's current account deficit, at Pounds 5bn, is little
changed from this year's average forecast of Pounds 4.8bn. But Prof Godley
forecasts a 1995 current account deficit of Pounds 12bn, reflecting his
doubts about the strength of the UK's non-oil trade.
Prof Congdon forecasts a current account surplus of Pounds 2.1bn next year.
In his submission to the panel, Prof Congdon says that 'at current exchange
rates, UK exports are competitive, perhaps even highly competitive'.
All panelists expect UK unemployment to be about 2.5m at the end of this
year and most expect a fall of about 250,000 through 1995. But Prof Currie
expects his forecast of slower growth will cause unemployment to rise
slightly to 2.6m by the end of next year before starting to fall again.
Prof Minford forecasts a sharp fall to below 2m, partly because he expects
stronger growth and partly because he believes unemployment will revert to a
lower trend rate than during the 1980s.
Looking to the very long term, the panel believes it should be possible for
the UK economy to return to a low level of unemployment of possibly between
3 per cent and 5 per cent compared with more than 9 per cent at present. But
this will depend on policies which encourage a period of moderate and
balanced growth of demand.

FT  04 NOV 94 / New lending tops Pounds 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New lending by the main British banks rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds
3.22bn in the third quarter of 1994, from Pounds 983m in the second quarter,
figures released yesterday by the British Bankers' Association show, Philip
Coggan writes.
The figures are compiled from monthly statistics, which the association has
already published. They show that the main reason for the apparent rise in
net lending was a fall in the level of repayments by the corporate sector
during the second quarter.
Lending to the personal sector rose by Pounds 1.78bn, or 1.3 per cent,
(after allowing for special factors) in the third quarters.
Credit card borrowing was one of the strongest elements, rising by Pounds
198m.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Ministers set to hack into jungle of red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are poised to use the powers in the Deregulation and Contracting
Out Act, which was given royal assent yesterday, to sweep away what they see
as outdated regulations imposing unnecessary burdens on business.
Mr John Major, prime minister, told last year's Conservative party
conference that the move would strengthen the formidable arm of Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in hacking through the jungle of
red tape.
Developing this theme yesterday, Mr Heseltine said the act's arrival on the
statute book was a step in the government's drive to remove excessive
burdens from business.
He also highlighted the opportunities the act provides for the private
sector to compete in new areas for the delivery of public services.
But more than ministerial rhetoric will be needed to convince some leading
opponents of bureaucracy that the act will make an impact in Britain's high
streets.
They fear that officials dealing with environmental health and trading
standards will still be able to impose requirements which result in
businesses closing down.
The government has tried to remove anxiety about the activities of
over-zealous environmental health officers with an amendment giving
businesses a right of appeal against an immediate closure order.
Any business would be able to continue trading until the outcome of the
appeal. Ministers have yet to decide which body will handle such appeals.
Tory backbenchers would prefer them to be dealt with by magistrates, but the
government fears that this would lead to renewed charges of inconsistency in
enforcing regulations.
Ministers point to variations in the decisions of magistrates in different
parts of the country when dealing with what appear to be similar cases.
A clause approved by MPs early on Wednesday authorised the government to
establish by order (rather than by primary legislation) a model standard
appeal mechanism.
The order-making power conferred on ministers by the act will enable them to
repeal more easily laws which they believe have outlived their purpose.
The government resisted an attempt, backed by Lord Simon of Glaisdale, the
former law lord, to make the act subject to renewal every three years.
Constitutional safeguards agreed by the government mean that although the
power in the act to make deregulation orders comes into immediate effect it
will be subject to special scrutiny by parliament.
The act also opens the way for a less bureaucratic system of restrictions on
heavy lorries in residential areas of London at night and weekends.
Deregulation provisions due in January 1995 simplify procedures under the
monopolies and mergers legislation, and help facilitate the operations of
building societies.
The government aims to introduce changes in the insolvency service to allow
official receivers to contract out their functions.

FT  04 NOV 94 / 'New Austrian' system is cheaper but more risky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'new Austrian' tunnelling method, which is at the centre of a safety
inquiry into the Heathrow tunnel collapse, is not new at all.
The concept championed by Dr Ladislaus von Rabcewicz, a Salzburg consulting
engineer, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, has been used with success
internationally for almost 40 years.
Hundreds of projects have used the method, including the Frankfurt and
Washington metros, the Orange-Fish tunnel which diverts water under Suurberg
Mountain to Eastern Cape Province in South Africa, and a water tunnel
diverting the Indus River for the Tarbela dam in Pakistan.
It was used to carve the world's biggest undersea cavern for a rail
cross-over for the Channel tunnel, 40 metres below the seabed and 5 miles
off the British coast.
The technique requires engineers to use the strength of the rock surrounding
the tunnel to minimise the extra strengthening required to prevent collapse
or catastrophic settlement - as occurred two weeks ago at Heathrow.
Its advantage is that it allows excavation by conventional diggers rather
than expensive tunnel-boring machines, permitting faster construction and
greater design flexibility.
Mr Colin Kirkland, development director of consulting engineers Sir William
Halcrow, and former technical director for Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
operator, said that it can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than conventional
tunnelling methods.
Much depends on geology and ground conditions. Underground caverns in the
Alps have supported themselves for centuries. It would be impossible to
construct a fabricated lining which could bear the weight of the kilometres
of rock below an Alpine peak.
Mr Kirkland said that in Italy engineers froze gravel, which normally would
be too unstable and have insufficient strength, to allow them to use the
'new Austrian' method.
The British Health and Safety Executive, which is investigating the Heathrow
collapse, is examining whether the method is suitable for use in London clay
 -even though a Pounds 1.5m test tunnel using the method has suffered no
problems since it was constructed in 1992 by BAA, the airport operator.
Alternatives to the method include the laborious installation of strong
prefabricated tunnel linings as excavation proceeds, or using a
cut-and-cover technique, excavating the ground from the surface, which is
stabilised by massive concrete structures while the tunnel is built.
Because of the unpredictability of ground conditions, which can change
radically in a matter of inches, costly over-engineering invariably occurs.
Dr Myles O'Reilly, former head of the ground engineering division of the
Department of Transport's research laboratory, said that the original
cast-iron linings of the London Underground were eight times stronger than
necessary.
The 'new Austrian' method, which encourages a minimum of additional
strengthening during excavation, is riskier but cheaper. Its success depends
on the precision of engineering predictions of likely ground responses to
excavation and on sophisticated measuring procedures, which should allow
engineers time to strengthen the tunnel if unexpected movement occurs.
In harder ground rock bolts up to 6 metres long might be inserted at points
of weakness. These are then cemented in and tightened to bind the rock
together. A steel mesh is used to cover tunnel walls, which are sprayed with
a quick-drying concrete.
Once a project is sufficiently advanced a final reinforced lining is
installed - as it would be with other methods. The undersea cavern for the
Channel tunnel includes a concrete lining up to a metre thick. Dr O'Reilly
said: 'The risk therefore is during the construction phase. The two new
stations being built under Heathrow by the 'new Austrian' method, for
example will have the same standard of strengthening and reinforcement as
any London Underground station, when completed.'
The risk of damage and loss of life, obviously, is much greater when
construction is taking place in highly populated areas. Three people died in
Munich in September when a bus fell into a hole caused by the collapse of a
tunnel being built using the 'new Austrian' method for the Munich metro.
There have been other failures involving the 'new Austrian' method,
including several significant collapses during the construction of 120km of
tunnels for the 330km long Hannover to Wurzburg high-speed railway line in
Germany. The most spectacular failure occured at Krieberg in 1986, when more
than 55m of a tunnel collapsed, causing massive settlement of the ground
above. The incident could have caused a major disaster if it had occurred
under a big office block.
Mr Kirkland said: 'The method is not inappropriate for London clay but it
does require a high standard of monitoring and construction control if a
project is not to be exposed to unacceptable risk.'

Sales agents and independent financial advisers saved the government almost
Pounds 29bn in 1992 through selling pensions, insurance and mortgages to
individuals who did not then look to the state to make provision, according
to a study published yesterday.
The Henley Centre report - commissioned by IFA Promotion, which promotes
independent financial advisers - says that by far the biggest element in
this saving, Pounds 26.3bn, relates to pension provision.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Sad farewell as Richmond leaves Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Torn between a celebration and a wake, workers at the Swan Hunter shipyard
watched yesterday as their final achievement slipped down the Tyne.
While the Swan Hunter brass band played 'Auld Lang Syne', the men stood on
the quayside, straining to keep sight of the Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond.
Even after 18 months of receivership, union leaders and receivers Price
Waterhouse insisted that they had not abandoned hope of saving the last
shipbuilder in north-east England, once the world's dominant shipbuilding
region.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said: 'We should recognise the
possibility this may look like the end - it may just as easily be the start
of the new beginning.'
But even hope has its limits. Of the 400 workers left on the payroll
yesterday - down from 2,400 at receivership - about 100 will be kept on
while the receivers mount a last worldwide campaign to try to sell the
Wallsend yard, the company's main shipbuilding facility.
Today 65 of the 400 workers will be made redundant, and a further 220
workers will go next Friday. Unemployment in Tyne and Wear was 13.4 per cent
earlier this year.
As Richmond prepared to leave Wallsend yesterday, the area faced another
jobs blow as employees across the river at switchgear maker Reyrolle, part
of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, were told 160 jobs were to go due to
lack of orders.
In spite of receivership and repeated job cuts, the workforce at Swans
maintained the highest standards to the last.
Captain Ken Morrison, the Navy's Type 23 frigate project manager, said
yesterday that Richmond was among the best quality vessels of its class.
'Their commitment has never wavered through all the time of receivership,'
he said. 'It's terribly, terribly poignant.'
Shipbuilding on the Tyne is known to date to 1294, when a galley was built
for Edward I. Richmond's departure marks the first time in hundreds of years
that no ships have been under construction on any river in the north east.
Swan Hunter alone in its 134-year history built 2,700 vessels including the
liner Mauretania. Less than 20 years ago the Swan Hunter Group claimed to be
Europe's largest shipbuilding and ship-repair consortium, employing 33,000
in the UK and overseas.
One of those watching Richmond sail down the Tyne yesterday was Mr David
Swan, the 54-year-old great-grandson of the company's founder and the last
Swan on the payroll. Made redundant in May, he is now unemployed.
Richmond will be handed over to the navy in Portsmouth on Tuesday. The Swans
workers sailing south on her will then return to Tyneside to be made
redundant.
A few, such as Mr Peter Cross, commissioning manager, have found jobs away
from the north east but most, he said, were heading for the dole. He said:
'The tragedy of it all is there are people on this ship, the vast majority,
who will never work again.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Spy chief rejects US-style agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of the security service MI5,
yesterday hit out at the creation of a US-style national counter-terrorist
agency, saying that recent experience had shown that a 'large number of
agencies and organisations can co-operate effectively'.
She said that the ceasefires in Northern Ireland had been brought about by
political progress achieved 'in the context of a wider counter-terrorist
strategy'.
Speaking to police chiefs, Whitehall officials and government lawyers
including Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, Mrs Rimington promoted
her agency as an efficient counter-terrorist organisation which had provided
useful advice to the government on political issues such as Northern
Ireland.
Her views are in contrast to some experts and police officers, who have been
critical of the fragmented state of Britain's law enforcement agencies and
have called for a single national organisation similar to the US Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
Her move comes as the future of her agency and others is uncertain because
of budgetary pressures and shifting political priorities. The secret
services are to have their spending, administration and policies scrutinised
by a parliamentary committee for the first time later this year.
Mrs Rimington said that while the Ulster ceasefires were welcome 'after so
many years of violence we must remain cautious'.
She referred to attacks by Middle East terrorists, and said: 'Compared with
the traditional certainties of the cold war era, with its frame of reference
apparently fixed for all time, the service's responsibilities, and the
environment in which we operate, are today all in a state of flux.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Tough measures to stamp out legal aid fraud announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, yesterday announced moves to counter
solicitor fraud thought to be costing the Legal Aid fund millions of pounds
each year.
The measures are designed to tighten rules governing the 'green form' scheme
to provide free legal advice and assistance to people on low incomes.
Solicitors receive an average fee of Pounds 60 from the Legal Aid fund for
two hours of legal advice, but they can receive up to Pounds 91.50 in London
and Pounds 86.50 outside. Once a client has signed a form, the solicitor
gives a brief description of the advice given and submits it to the Legal
Aid Board for payment.
In 1993-94 more than 1.6m people received help under the scheme.
Three firms are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for alleged
fraud. One firm under investigation has submitted Pounds 2.2m of claims in
the past 12 months.
Firms are suspected of offering inducements to low-income families to sign
forms and of making multiple applications for a single client.
Grosberg &amp; Co, a two-partner firm based in Leigh and Bolton, Lancashire, was
closed by the Solicitors Complaints Bureau on suspicion of 'green form'
fraud.
It was offering free food obtained from a European Union intervention board
to people on benefits if they signed up for a 'benefits check' under the
'green form' scheme. The firm cleared the idea with the Law Society before
putting it into operation.
The senior partner was arrested but has not been charged. He denies any
wrongdoing. One former employee estimates that the firm would have submitted
10,000 forms to the Legal Aid Board this year.
The tough new measures announced by Lord Mackay include moves to speed up
detection and action on suspect claims.
A new, more detailed form will be introduced for firms not franchised by the
Legal Aid Board. Solicitors will be required to seek authority from the
board before giving advice under more than one 'green form' per client in
any 12-month period. The board's powers to deal with cases of suspected
fraud are to be set out in new regulations.

FT  04 NOV 94 / FT Conferences: Flood cover for London 'set to end'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance bought by many companies against London flood damage may be
withdrawn as part of a trend by insurance companies toward limiting exposure
to some large hazards, a risk specialist said yesterday.
Mr Clive Pracy, head of risk management at London Transport, said that
because of the withdrawal of cover for some risks, the setting of limits on
policies and increasing premiums, buyers of insurance - not the providers -
were taking over the role of risk-taker.
London Transport is worried that a rising water table will increase the cost
of keeping water out of the Underground. 'I less than cheerfully predict -
particularly in my business - that flood risk in London will soon disappear
as an insurable item,' Mr Pracy told a Financial Times conference on
corporate risk management and the international insurance industry.
He said that companies had yet to market insurance policies to fill the gap
created by the ending of unlimited employers' liability cover in the UK from
January 1 next year. Unless companies make special arrangements, most
policies will be capped at Pounds 10m or less of cover.
Mr Herbert Harrell, chairman of Harrell Associates, a US consultancy, told
the conference that 'relationships between corporate buyers and sellers in
the insurance industry are very poor, to the detriment of both sides'.
But he said that part of the fault lay with companies buying insurance
policies. Insurers were not seen as strategic partners in the same way as
investment bankers. 'Risk is seen by senior general management simply as a
cost factor, not as a potential source of competitive advantage,' Mr Harrell
said.
He said that, as well as controlling costs, companies should be concerned to
obtain insurance cover that was denied to competitors, a fast response from
their insurance companies and expert advice in judging and lessening risks.
Mr Walter Kielholz, executive board member at Swiss Reinsurance, said that
the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products was not
cost-efficient.
He said he was 'amazed at the portion of premium that gets lost on its way
from the original risk to the ultimate risk carrier'. The obvious conclusion
was that the 'risk carrier has to get closer to the risk'.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Protectionist pressures worry Brittan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union must press more vigorously for liberalisation of world
trade, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, said yesterday, or face
mounting internal pressure from 'demagogues' who favoured protectionism.
In his first important speech since losing responsibility for eastern Europe
in last weekend's European Commission reshuffle, he promised that EU trade
policy would give higher priority both to the interests of consumers and to
combating other countries' unfair trade practices.
Sir Leon said it would be 'disastrous' for Europe to lapse into complacency
after completion of the Uruguay Round trade deal. It had to increase its
efforts to improve its economic competitiveness and to open international
markets.
The collapse of communism had robbed western Europe's leaders of an
important challenge, he told the Chartered Institute of Marketing in London,
creating uncertainty and diverting attention from important new issues.
'If it is persists, this malaise can spell drift and decline,' he said. 'Put
simply, the challenge for our continent-wide culture and economy is to
survive.'
Free trade was not a free-for-all, and world trade rules entitled the EU to
act against dumped and subsidised products and import surges which
threatened sensitive industries.
'These are simple truths, but they are hard to get across in a world where
demagogues can be elected to national parliaments and to the European
parliament, and receive substantial public subsidy for their pernicious
charge that open trade offers the European economy to foreigners on a
plate,' he said.
Setting a world trade agenda after the Uruguay Round would be difficult,
because it involved dealing with domestic policies and sensitive issues such
as the environment, competition policy and labour laws. But countries had to
talk about these questions.
'If we do not, we lay ourselves open to further demagogy, with Europeans
alleging that other countries seek to exploit child labour in order to
increase European unemployment. Such arguments are plainly nonsense.'
He indicated that persuading developing countries to relax controls on
inward investment would be an important EU priority in the new World Trade
Organisation.
Sir Leon said the 'illicit practices regulation' recently proposed by the
Commission would enable the EU to press other countries more effectively to
open their markets and trade fairly.
However, he said the regulation was different from the US section 301 trade
instrument, because it did not seek to make unilateral determinations
against foreign trade barriers and would focus only on other countries'
breaches of agreed international rules. He said the EU had to try harder to
complete dumping and subsidy investigations rapidly, and to ensure that its
trade policy reflected the views of importers, retailers and consumers, as
well as of producers.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: UK should direct 'more aid to poor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain should progressively reduce its use of aid in pursuit of political
and commercial interests and direct a greater proportion towards poverty
alleviation programmes, argues a report published today.
A study by the London-based World Development Movement says that there has
been a significant fall in British aid going directly to the world's poor in
the past five years. Over the same period, there has been an increase in aid
spent on British consultants and industry.
The report also criticises the level of UK aid. Between 1980 and 1992
Britain's aid to sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, fell by 2
per cent in real terms, when for all donors there was an average increase of
55 per cent.
The UK aid budget has fallen to two-thirds of the 1979 level as a proportion
of GNP, and by 12.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report.
It notes that Britain is the sixth largest aid donor after Japan, the US,
France, Germany and Italy, but in 1993 UK aid amounted to 0.31 per cent of
GNP. Using this yardstick, it was 13th out of the 21 Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development aid donors.
Technical co-operation - consultants, training and research and development
at UK institutions - provides the bulk of the project aid. The remainder is
used to win commercial contracts, such as the Pergau dam in Malaysia under
the aid and trade provision (ATP).
Although spending on agriculture has risen by 40 per cent in the past five
years, it still received less than 8 per cent of total project aid in
1992-3. In that year, says the report, 'three times as much was spent
supporting British companies working in agriculture through the ATP, than on
direct financial assistance to farmers'.
Almost half of Britain's bilateral aid from 1987-8 to 1992-3 was spent on
technical co-operation, says the report, including the ATP. Funding for
non-governmental organisations is included in this budget and took up little
over 10 per cent of the total in 1992-93.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Patents claims hit parallel importers in
Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's parallel importers, which import branded goods through third parties
rather than through licensed distributers, are being challenged under an
increasing number of patent infringement claims by manufacturers.
A row between Chiyoda Sports, the Japanese sports equipment retailer, and
Nordica, the Italian ski equipment manufacturer, has become the latest case
in which a manufacturer has tried to stop the distribution of cheaper
parallel imported products by alleging the importer had violated
intellectual property rights.
Tokyo customs officials have banned Chiyoda from importing Nordica ski boots
from European wholesalers. The Italian company claims that only a licensee
can distribute the product, which uses a patented buckle. Chiyoda, on the
other hand, argues that Nordica is misusing the licence to quash efforts to
offer consumers cheaper products.
'They're just doing it to stop competition. It's overstretching patent
rights and very unfair to the consumer,' said Mr Yoshikazu Miyakoshi,
president of Chiyoda.
Chiyoda, which has been selling parallel imports of US and European ski
equipment for more than 10 years, was planning to sell the ski boots at
Y33,000 (Dollars 330.00) The same product imported by Nordica Japan, the
manufacturer's Japanese subsidiary, costs around Y55,000 while it is sold at
Y27,800 in Italy.
The ministry of finance, which oversees the customs office, says the ban on
Chiyoda's imports of Nordica ski boots was implemented according to the
patent law. 'Patent guidelines are oriented towards protecting industries,'
it said.
Meanwhile the country's Fair Trade Commission said Nordica's claims did not
breach anti-trust guidelines.
Other companies which have won bans on parallel imports based on patent
licensing claims include Ajinomoto, the leading Japanese maker of monosodium
glutamate (MSG). It said that parallel imports of MSG from the company's
south-east Asian production lines did not contain a special patented acid
and could 'confuse' the Japanese consumers' palate. The customs office has
also banned parallel imports of agro-chemicals by Monsanto, a US chemicals
maker.
While the ministry of finance says it is not trying to stop parallel
imports, some importers are wary of a clampdown by large overseas
manufacturers. They claim that such manoeuvres by the ministry of finance go
against efforts by the ministry of international trade and industry, which
is promoting parallel importing as a means to reduce Japan's mounting trade
surplus.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US plans an early exit from Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US plans to withdraw from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
with effect from early next year, provided the US Congress ratifies the
global trade accords setting up the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's
successor. The WTO is due to come into effect on January 1.
Although the US maintains the move will have little practical impact, the
decision has caused considerable concern among trading partners who say it
will allow the US to escape Gatt obligations to countries which are not WTO
members from the start. In addition, outstanding trade disputes under Gatt -
including such controversial cases as the tuna-dolphin row and punitive US
duties on steel imports - will simply lapse.
The US Senate is to vote on the Uruguay Round trade pact on December 2,
three days after the House of Representatives. The Clinton administration
can then withdraw from Gatt after a 60-day notice period. The US had hoped
to time its pull-out from Gatt to coincide with the WTO's entry into force
but this proved impolitic after Congress delayed the ratification vote from
October to December.
Washington says it decided as long ago as 1991 that it would not remain a
member of both Gatt and the WTO, which would involve overlapping legal
obligations to different groups of countries. However, no other country has
indicated its intention to follow suit.
US officials denied yesterday that Washington was in some sense dodging its
fair trade responsibilities. Mr Andrew Stoler, deputy US ambassador to Gatt,
said the US had no intention of removing existing Gatt trade benefits from
countries which were not WTO members, though the legal underpinning provided
by Gatt would go.
The US would also stand by obligations arising from dispute panel reports
already adopted by Gatt. But unresolved disputes and those still under
investigation at the time of withdrawal would fall by the wayside.
Mr Stoler added that only Switzerland among important trading nations had
said it could not meet the January 1 WTO deadline. However, of Gatt's 124
members, only about 40 nations, in addition to the 30 that have already
ratified, have notified Gatt they are in a position to complete legal
formalities by the end of the year.
Switzerland apart, most of the others are small developing countries. These
nations, Mr Stoler argues, are not countries with which the US is likely to
be in dispute.
During the Uruguay Round negotiations, it was agreed that Gatt would
continue in parallel with the WTO for an undefined period, since several
countries would not be able to join the WTO straight away. However,
precisely how the two legal agreements will operate in tandem has not been
clarified.
To minimise the potential for inconsistency (and give laggards a strong
incentive to join the WTO), there is broad support for a two-year 'cut-off'
after which Gatt would cease to exist.

Telstra, Australia's government-owned telecommunications group, is one of
six international telephone and cable companies to test Microsoft software
for a high-speed information highway. The Microsoft 'broadband network
operating system' (BNOS) software aims to transmit large amounts of
interactive data and services from third-party sources and could be
applicable in industries ranging from financial services to retailing.
Telstra said that the trials would help to give Australia a head start in
the development of multimedia industries. The project will begin next year.
Other carriers evaluating BNOS are Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, NTT, Rogers

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of multinational chemicals companies operating in China is putting
pressure on Beijing to cut registration fees which could cost several
million dollars, according to the magazine Asian Chemical News. Recent
regulations require companies to register every chemical they import to
China. The fee ranges from Dollars 2,000 to Dollars 10,000, depending on the
toxicity of the chemical, and each company has to pay the fee even if an
identical chemical made by another company has been registered.
The companies, which include BASF of Germany and the UK's ICI, complain that
the fees are incompatible with the membership of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) which China is trying to rejoin. BASF said the fees
imposed 'clearly violate Gatt principles in that they exceed the cost of
service rendered and discriminate against foreign companies. The companies'
case has been taken up by US and European chief trade negotiators at Geneva.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Brussels attacked on banana imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday attacked the European Union's banana import regime claiming
it contravened a Gatt code of fair trade practice on import licensing and
did not conform with rules of the future World Trade Organisation.
The claim, made to Gatt's import licencing committee, was strongly denied by
Brussels. Ms Barbara Chattin, head of tariff affairs in the US trade
representative's office in Washington, said the EU's import licensing scheme
for bananas was 'blatantly discriminatory' and 'contrary to both the letter
and the spirit' of the import licensing code. A tougher version of the code
will be incorporated in WTO rules.
Two US-based banana multinationals have called for an investigation under
Section 301 of US trade law of the EU's recent 'framework agreement' on
banana quotas which they say favours the signatories - Costa Rica, Colombia,
Nicaragua and Venezuela - over other Latin American exporters.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: CD sales lead music market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The global music market is enjoying brisk growth with an increase in sales
of 8 per cent during the first half of this year against the same period of
1993, according to the latest figures from the International Federation of
the Phonographic Industry.
Compact discs continued to be the chief catalyst of the market's expansion.
Sales of CDs rose by 18 per cent in the first six months of this year after
a 19.4 per cent increase to a total of 1.4bn units during 1993.
The US was one of the most buoyant areas of growth for CDs, with a 25 per
cent rise in unit sales during the first half of 1994. This reflects the
continued trend for consumers to replace their collections of vinyl records
and cassettes with CDs, and the wider availability of budget CDs.
However, the pace of CD sales growth is starting to slow in more mature
markets, notably in Italy. The IFPI also detected a reduction in the rate of
CD sales growth in some Asian countries where piracy is a problem.
One of the fastest growing areas of the music market is CD singles, where
sales have continued to increase in spite of a slight decline in overall
single sales. The number of CD singles sold worldwide rose by 55 per cent in
1993 and grew again in the first half of this year.
The increase in CD sales has predictably depressed demand for cassettes. The
IFPI noted a decline in sales of cassettes for the first time last year to
1.35bn worldwide from 1.47bn in 1992. The drop continued - albeit at the
slower pace of 4.6 per cent - in the first six months of this year.
The traditional vinyl market appears to be in terminal decline. Sales of
vinyl LPs fell sharply to 80.4m in 1993 from 114.9m in 1992. The IFPI
reported another fall in the first half of 1994.
The Hollywood movie industry yesterday handed an olive branch to its
European rivals following the conflict at the recent Gatt negotiations. The
Motion Picture Association of the US unveiled a 'peace' package including an
initiative to help the Europeans dub their films and to improve distribution
in the US.

FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China may get later WTO entry - US and EU
push Beijing to adopt a more constructive negotiating stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and the EU are prepared to consider delaying the deadline for China's
planned entry as a founder member of the new World Trade Organisation,
provided Beijing agrees to negotiate more constructively.
The apparent change of mind has been prompted by the growing belief in
Washington and Brussels that China's negotiations to rejoin the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are progressing too slowly to be concluded by
the end of this year, as scheduled. China has long insisted that it wants to
be a founder member of the WTO, due to be established at the start of next
year.
Under internationally agreed rules, China would only qualify for that status
if it already belonged to Gatt when the WTO came into being.
US and European willingness to consider such a course reflects their
determination to underline the importance they attach to China's WTO entry,
despite their unhappiness at what they consider Beijing's inflexible
negotiating stance. The Clinton administration remains committed in public
to the January deadline. But it is understood that Ms Charlene Barshefksky,
deputy US trade representative, mentioned the possibility of an extension
last month in talks with Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister.
The question is likely to be raised again by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, in 10 days' time, when he is due to meet Ms Wu at a
conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Jakarta. Sir
Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, is also said to be ready to
offer the possibility of an extension when he visits Beijing next week.
But EU officials say he will do so only if it becomes clear that there are
solid practical reasons why China's talks with the Gatt cannot be completed
on time.
They say Sir Leon is prepared to consider deferring China's WTO entry until
as late as May or June.
The US and the EU are both pressing China to improve its membership
proposal, notably by agreeing to cut tariffs further, curb state monopolies
and open markets wider.
A US report, released by the Economic Strategy Institute, says China's
accession is the biggest international economic issue faced by the US and is
'a unique window of opportunity to influence China's economic and trade
policies'. Mr Greg Mastel, author of 'China and the WTO', warns: 'Once we
commit ourselves, even in principle, to give China WTO status, we lose what
leverage we have.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Delhi clue to Sri Lanka deaths: A common factor in recent
killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Connections with India appear to be a significant factor behind a string of
assassinations of Sri Lanka's senior political and military figures.
Mr Gamini Dissanayake, the opposition leader who was to have been
presidential candidate in Sri Lanka's elections next Wednesday, was
assassinated because of his role in the India-Sri Lanka 'peace accord' of
1987 which brought a huge Indian peace-keeping force to crush the
secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
Sri Lanka's new government has asked Indian investigators to help with
inquiries into Mr Dissanayake's murder, perhaps risking again inflaming
Tamil rage at a time when it has been trying to bring peace to the northern
Jaffna peninsula for which the LTTE is seeking autonomy.
At the time, of New Delhi's last intervention, the Indian elite were worried
about the possible impact of LTTE propaganda on Tamil Nadu, the large
southern Indian state which has a secessionist history of its own. The
narrow Palk Straits separates Sri Lanka's northern province, the
'traditional homeland' of the island's Tamils, from Tamil Nadu.
Mr Dissanayake was proud of the part he played in the 'peace accord' and of
his close friendship with Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian prime minister who,
like Mr Dissanayake, was assassinated by a Tamil suicide bomber.
The presence of an Indian army bigger than Sri Lanka's own led to the
resurgence of the Sinhalese radical youth movement (JVP), which in 1971
raised the romantic Che Guervara banner, but this time is ultra-Sinhala
nationalist and Pol Potist in sentiment.
In the late 1980s, the JVP mounted a bloody campaign in the south which
damaged the island's tourism industry and eventually overshadowed the Tamil
rebellion.
In 1988, pressed from north and south, the then President Ranasinghe
Premadasa asked India to pull out its troops. Mr Gandhi refused. The Indian
peace-keeping force lost 1,400 men. Mr Gandhi's successors then withdrew the
force.
The LTTE expected to be rewarded with at least regional autonomy. Mr
Premadasa disappointed them, soon establishing good relations with the new
Indian prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. On May Day last year, an LTTE
suicide bomber killed Mr Premadasa.
In February this year the LTTE accused 'Sinhalese chauvinist forces' of
gathering in the south and engaging in a new proselytising drive.
'This coming together is being secretly encouraged by India. Thus, there
cannot be any doubt Gamini is an Indian lackey,' it said.
Mr Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka's foreign minister, has now asked the
Indian government 'to provide the services of two Indian experts to help in
the investigation into the assassination' of Mr Dissanayake.
The cabinet had responded to a request by Mrs Srima Dissanayake, who has
replaced her late husband as the conservative United National Party's choice
to stand in the presidential elections against the Peoples' Alliance
candidate, prime minister Chandrika Kumaratunge.
When the newly-elected People's Alliance, which gambled successfully on a
growing peace constituency and looks forward to a 'peace dividend' to cut
defence spending sharply, sent a four-member 'peace mission' to Jaffna, it
was received by an LTTE commander and treated to an LTTE guard-of-honour.
The two sides sat on opposite sides of a table which had two flags, the Sri
Lankan and the LTTE. On the wall was a picture of Velupillai Prabhakaran,
the LTTE supremo. The meeting, given widespread television coverage, gave
the impression that the delegates represented two separate states.
Mr Prabhakaran is seen as the toughest guerrilla leader in the world, says
one western diplomat. The questions now are whether India sends its
investigators, and whether Mr Prabhakaran will see their arrival as the
formation of another Delhi/Colombo axis against him.

Turkish prime minister Tansu Ciller yesterday began the first official visit
to Israel by a Turkish leader, part of a five-day Middle East tour that will
include meetings with PLO chairman Yassir Arafat in Gaza and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. In her talks with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, Mrs Ciller is expected to discuss
issues ranging from the Middle East peace process, economic and business
ties between Turkey and Israel and co-operation on controlling terrorism.
Turkey is fighting a 10-year Kurdish insurgency that has cost more than
13,000 lives. Sharing the region's scarce water resources will also be on
the agenda. Turkey's Dollars 10bn hydro-electric and irrigation schemes on
the head waters of the Tigris and Euphrates will give it control over the
region's two most important rivers.

<TEXT>
The French state gas company Gaz de France has withdrawn nearly all 200 of
its expatriate staff from Algeria after Islamic fundamentalists murdered two
foreign drilling experts, the newspaper Le Monde reported yesterday. A Gaz
de France official declined to comment except to say: 'We are still present
in Algeria and gas deliveries continue.'
Le Monde said the decision to pull out Gaz de France expatriates was taken
after the killing of a French and Italian technician employed by a French
company in the Aures mountains of north-east Algeria on October 18. A senior
French military official said last week that Paris was concerned by the
attack, since it could signal an offensive by rebels against Algeria's gas
and oil industries, the country's main currency earners. Gaz de France has
been active in Algeria virtually since independence in 1962.

Rescue workers found 18 burned bodies in the village of Dronka yesterday,
pushing to at least 450 the death toll from southern Egypt's fire and flood
disaster. Floodwater and burning fuel swept through the village, 200 miles
south of the capital Cairo, soon after dawn on Wednesday. Flash floods from
Wednesday's six-hour thunderstorm claimed about 60 more victims in other
villages in the provinces of Assiut, Sohag and Qena, security officials
said. Thousands of Dronka villagers who spent Wednesday night in mosques in
the nearby city of Assiut are heading home to search for relatives but have
little hope of finding survivors from 200 houses engulfed by the river of
blazing fuel.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Business optimism declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World businessmen have become less optimistic about their sales and profits
in the fourth quarter, despite the strength of the world economy, according
to the latest survey of business expectations from Dun and Bradstreet. The
business information group's index of sales fell from 57 to 55 between the
third and fourth quarters, while the profits index fell from 45 to 42. In
the sales area, the countries which experienced the biggest declines in
optimism were Switzerland, New Zealand, the US and Mexico; the greatest
increases came in Brazil, France, Japan and the Netherlands. Despite the
quarter-on-quarter decline, levels of optimism were higher than they were in
the fourth quarter of 1993. 'The worldwide business climate continues to be
in very good shape as the survey shows optimism indices at pre-recession
levels,' said Mr Joseph Duncan, vice-president and chief economist at Dun &amp;
Bradstreet.
The employment index also fell between the third and fourth quarters, from
20 to 18. 'The employment index is at a respectable level, but is not as
high as it could be,' said Mr Duncan. 'We should see some hiring in the next
few quarters.' Employment optimism is at its lowest in Japan and Belgium,
and at its highest in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, US and Canada.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Manila raises investment limit

Philippine monetary authorities have doubled the ceiling for outward
investment by residents to Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.7m) a year in an attempt to
stem the rise in the local currency. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of Bangko
Sentral, the central monetary authority, said yesterday that the higher
limit 'is expected to increase foreign exchange demand and directly ease the
appreciation of the peso'. A sharp increase in foreign exchange inflows in
recent months, following improved investment conditions and high domestic
interest rates, has strengthened the peso against the US dollar. Yesterday
the currency traded at 24.693 pesos to the dollar, an increase of 12.3 per
cent against its level at the start of the year.
This has hurt Philippine exporters, who claim the lower peso proceeds for
their exports have led to losses. Some exporters' groups have also warned
that the rising peso has curtailed expansion plans. A policy allowing
Philippine residents more investments abroad is the latest of a series of
Bangko Sentral moves to curb the currency's rise.

   JAKARTA, DILI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia's President Suharto has struck a conciliatory note over troubled
East Timor, saying he was willing to meet exiled East Timorese for talks.
According to Mr Lopes da Cruz, the country's envoy for East Timor, the
president said during a meeting yesterday that reconciliation talks could be
continued and that more East Timorese needed to be involved. 'He also agreed
to meet East Timorese living in exile, but no date has been fixed yet.'
Mr da Cruz said that he himself would meet some East Timorese leaders living
in Australia, but did not say when. Opponents in Australia have been the
most vocal. The envoy quoted Mr Suharto as saying that East Timor could be
granted autonomy but added that it would be within the Indonesian context of
being a part of the archipelago.
In Dili, the capital of East Timor, the announcement was greeted with some
caution; a prominent local Timorese suggested it could be for show ahead of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bogor near Jakarta
on November 15. Mr Suharto will host the meeting, which will be attended by
President Bill Clinton.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Accidents cast pall over South Korea contractors: Corruption
and cost pressures in the construction industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge has exposed the problems
affecting domestic public infrastructure projects caused by corruption and
low bid prices in a huge construction industry that accounts for almost 12
per cent of South Korea's gross national product.
Contractors for public works projects are allegedly forced to take
short-cuts in construction if they want to achieve profits. There are few
apparent problems in the private construction sector, where higher prices
are paid.
The accident, in which 32 people were killed, has cast a pall over South
Korean contractors and foreign construction companies will, as a result,
'have a much better chance than before of winning public sector orders' once
barriers to the domestic market are removed in 1997, according to Mr Hwang
Bong-mok, construction analyst at W I Carr Securities in Seoul.
Investigators are still trying to determine whether substandard construction
by Dong-ah Construction, the Songsu bridge's builder, or poor maintenance by
city authorities was the main cause for the collapse of the 15-year-old
structure. But the incident follows accidents involving other infrastructure
projects, including the collapse of seven other bridges over the past
decade.
Contractors confront severe cost pressures in accepting government orders.
One reason for this is that contract prices are low, with government
estimates for labour and material costs often below market prices. Alleged
demands for kickbacks by government officials further reduce profit margins.
The chairmen of the Daewoo industrial group and Dong-ah, for example, were
charged in August with giving kickbacks to a former president of Korea
Electric Power, the state-owned electricity monopoly, in return for winning
nuclear power plant construction contracts.
'Corruption in the construction industry is widespread worldwide, but in
Korea it is more severe than elsewhere. Bribery is a common practice,' said
Mr Don Lee, construction analyst for BZW Securities in Seoul.
Nonetheless, construction companies are eager to gain public sector orders
as the cash flow is favourable; the government pays at least 20 per cent of
the project cost in advance and provides the balance throughout the
construction period.
Infrastructure projects are also becoming more important for the industry,
due to a slowdown in house building which dominated growth in the past five
years. Public sector orders will account for Won14,700bn (Pounds 11.2bn) of
the estimated Won40,000bn in domestic construction orders this year.
In an attempt to increase profit margins on public projects, construction
companies have frequently resorted to measures that appear to undermine the
quality of their work. Design specifications are frequently changed and
schedules accelerated. Contractors are accused of using inferior materials
to save costs. The subcontracting of work at low rates has also become
common.
The hazards of this became apparent last year when a subcontractor for
Samsung Engineering and Construction caused one of the nation's worst train
accidents when a railbed collapsed during excavation work.
Faulty construction is often undetected as inspection procedures are lax,
with contractors allegedly bribing government inspectors to grant project
approval.
The Songsu bridge collapse has renewed concern about the safety of the
country's infrastructure, particularly when the government is planning to
invest Dollars 100bn (Pounds 63.2bn) on projects over the next eight years.
The government has announced several measures to eliminate substandard
construction. Pre-screening procedures will be strengthened, with the lowest
bid system abolished in favour of selection on technical capability. The
government will also increase estimates for labour and wage costs in
construction proposals.
Subcontracting will be more tightly regulated, while the warranty period for
construction projects will be increased from five years to 10-20 years after
completion.
Inspection procedures will be improved, including allowing foreign
construction inspectors to operate in South Korea from next year. The
measures, however, 'will increase construction costs to meet the higher
standards,' said Mr Hwang.
The costly domestic regulation is likely to encourage South Korean
construction companies to seek more orders abroad.
Overseas orders will account for only 12 per cent of total orders for the
Korean construction industry this year - in sharp contrast to 15 years ago
when orders from the Middle East provided the bulk of business for Korean
contractors.
The decline in Middle East oil income that fuelled the building boom has
forced Korean companies to concentrate on winning domestic orders, while
shifting their overseas activity to southern Asia and China.
